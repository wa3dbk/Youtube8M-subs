00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
exact same phone when it comes to the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.049 
exact same phone when it comes to the
operating<00:00:13.440> system<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.549> doesn't<00:00:14.880> matter

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
operating system so it doesn't matter

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.939 
operating system so it doesn't matter
you<00:00:15.780> know<00:00:15.900> whether<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.320> got<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.500> different

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you know whether you got a different

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.560 
you know whether you got a different
network<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.970> that's<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> be<00:00:18.449> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
network because that's going to be a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.300 
network because that's going to be a
difference<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.199> terms<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.529> reception<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
difference in terms of reception and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.310 
difference in terms of reception and
data<00:00:20.520> speeds<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.510> when<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.720> comes<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
data speeds but when it comes to how the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.890 
data speeds but when it comes to how the
iPhone<00:00:22.949> itself<00:00:23.430> works<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.210> exactly<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
iPhone itself works it's exactly the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.269 
iPhone itself works it's exactly the
same<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.350> we're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.769> covering<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

hard<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> see<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.170> keyboards<00:00:46.710> normally<00:00:47.190> see

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
hard to see the keyboards normally see

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.100 
hard to see the keyboards normally see
the<00:00:47.520> difference<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.030> two<00:00:48.239> three<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the difference one two three that's the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.860 
the difference one two three that's the
