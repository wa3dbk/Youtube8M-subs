program should be able to control your

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
program should be able to control your
scanner<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.210> well<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.710> their

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
scanner as well but they all have their

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.139 
scanner as well but they all have their
built-in<00:00:41.040> software<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.969> one

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
built-in software just like this one

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.180 
built-in software just like this one
that<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.540> pops<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.680> once<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that actually pops up so once you're in

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.000 
that actually pops up so once you're in
it<00:00:44.360> you<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.390> options<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.379> scan<00:00:46.680> or

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it you have options to actually scan or

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
it you have options to actually scan or
you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> preview<00:00:47.489> already<00:00:48.020> except<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you can preview already except the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.479 
you can preview already except the
things<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.469> are<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.039> had<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> picture

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
things that are there I had a picture

something else I did already we have

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.819 
something else I did already we have
basic<00:00:54.570> stuff<00:00:54.750> where<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.140> rotate<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.710> we

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
basic stuff where we can rotate it we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.490 
basic stuff where we can rotate it we
can<00:00:55.980> zoom<00:00:56.190> into<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> picture<00:00:57.199> whatever<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
can zoom into the picture whatever it is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
can zoom into the picture whatever it is
light<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.980> dark<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.520> sharpen<00:01:00.180> anything<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
light and dark and sharpen anything you

want<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.289> color<00:01:01.859> adjustments<00:01:02.520> such<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
want to do color adjustments such and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.630 
want to do color adjustments such and
such<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> biggest<00:01:04.439> things<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.799> want

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

to give you a little key note on is your

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
to give you a little key note on is your
resolution<00:01:07.470> that's<00:01:08.280> probably<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> most

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
resolution that's probably the most

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.399 
resolution that's probably the most
important<00:01:09.210> thing<00:01:10.189> let's<00:01:11.189> click<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> if

you're<00:01:13.530> messing<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.799> resolution<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.640> my

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you're messing with resolution in my

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
you're messing with resolution in my
recommendation<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.020> scanning<00:01:16.590> for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
recommendation if you're scanning for

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
recommendation if you're scanning for
instance<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.070> photo<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.090> able

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
instance a photo and you want to be able

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
instance a photo and you want to be able
to<00:01:18.659> print<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.950> scan<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
to print it out I would scan it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
to print it out I would scan it
something<00:01:20.759> around<00:01:20.939> 300<00:01:21.540> dpi<00:01:21.979> right<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.159> it's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
something around 300 dpi right now it's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.179 
something around 300 dpi right now it's
set<00:01:23.520> default<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.180> 200<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.920> here

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
set default to 200 just like it is here

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.249 
set default to 200 just like it is here
I'll<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:26.909> ahead<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> click<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.630> 300

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I'll just go ahead and click over 300

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'll just go ahead and click over 300
pretty<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.310> anything<00:01:29.579> over<00:01:29.850> 300<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
pretty much anything over 300 is kind of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
pretty much anything over 300 is kind of
a<00:01:30.869> waste<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.470> basic<00:01:31.619> printing<00:01:32.159> but

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
a waste for just basic printing but

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
a waste for just basic printing but
around<00:01:33.000> 300<00:01:33.450> dpi<00:01:33.720> will<00:01:33.960> give<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> good

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
around 300 dpi will give you a good

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.490 
around 300 dpi will give you a good
crisp<00:01:34.950> scan<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.570> good<00:01:36.750> enough<00:01:36.990> print

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
crisp scan and a good enough print

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.990 
crisp scan and a good enough print
quality<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.369> you're<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:38.579> printing

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
quality when you're actually printing

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.550 
quality when you're actually printing
out<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.329> final<00:01:39.630> product<00:01:40.020> whatever<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.409> did

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
out the final product whatever you did

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260
