00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.370
 sometimes hard to say but what does it do 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.380

 7 0 yes yes this look I expected 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.240
 not beforehand but I think every 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.950

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.580

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.660
 of course yes non-performance but there 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.030

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.009
 well guys like was a good one 11 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.140
 Second wonder what is less but the comes 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.150
 because you are in front with 3 0 he shoots 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.050
 learn about that again today 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.009
 shortly after rest make 3 0 and continue 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.050
 gyptone times it counts so fantastic 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.970
 train and if the whistle went that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.350
 it then actually no longer ran 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.360
 well i only have ongoing promotions too 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.100

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.900
 also a good week and i look 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.120
 for the time being still that we phone 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.519
 country is already fantastic football for four 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.890
 something not only against that hospitality tent 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.390
 everything collapses like a house of cards 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.640
 but what can we say good every week 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.010
 and if you are already young again 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.739
 Ajax next to this is another city 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.840
 better and sjoerd ars there I think 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.640
 that it can only go better because 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.110
 when i say click with sjoerd ars in front of it 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.690
 what do you say then 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.750
 yes I did not think much about 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.660
 say the loop is going nice and cozy now 7 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.910
 0 against a very good candidate I think 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.090
 that young psv instead of white pants 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.900
 come back with brown pants 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.099
 yes she had them from start of it 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.819
 season should be all that everyone 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.580
 with 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.629
 came with angsty but I think so 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.040
 I already have that right now 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.200
 put that club does not like the fine 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.700
 found forward but last question 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.739
 what time are you at home tonight and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.540
 how much drink gets stirring 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.879
 play well and safely and possibly against it 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.440
 so go out so nicely 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.180
 I think it blind eye I 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.180
 it's a little too late we'll see
