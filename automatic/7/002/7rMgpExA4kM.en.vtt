00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.200
 Planes 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.660
 Are mainly compressed cylinders that run through the air 10 km above the ground 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.840
 She takes us to work and on vacation, take us to our family 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.520
 In general, we moved from point A to point B faster than any public transport available on the ground 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.740
 Here is how to make a modern commercial jet plane: 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.540
 Well, it's a beautiful autumn morning 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.020
 I prepare myself to go 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.140
 Boarding a plane 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.200
 To go to France to learn about aircraft 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.400
 I flew to Europe to visit the Airbus plant and research and design centers 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.880
 Because they wanted to give me as well as a scene behind the scenes about their latest A350 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.120
 Here it is! 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.240
 But before he made his first trip 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.380
 Even before the first rivet / nail / 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.580
 A team of thousands of engineers and designers have spent years developing and designing for both aircraft 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.660
 And how to manufacture them 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.400
 They had to take into account the desired passenger capacity 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.960
 Field and speed of aircraft 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.980
 Comfort of passengers 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.080
 Landing requirements and airport browsing 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.120
 Flight Control 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.900
 Fuel efficiency 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.920
 How and where they will get and produce materials and pieces 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.780
 And a million other scattered details 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240
 Over design time 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.160
 Engineers use computer simulations and wind tunnel models 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.520
 To test the flow of the aircraft in its take-off, flight and landing arrangements 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.740
 Even models of miniature pneumatic engines are used 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.000
 To understand the reactions of wing motors 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.380
 The fluid dynamics are frighteningly complex 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.320
 All systems must be tested independently 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.920
 Wing sheets and deployment of landing gear, engines and so on 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.720
 They even release a number of dead ducks inside the engine and at high speed 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.380
 To make sure it can continue to provide momentum if you encounter a flock of birds 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.200
 Once the plane is designed, the pieces - each 2.65 million of them - must be manufactured and installed 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.820
 Some of them from Airbus itself 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.180
 And many such as engines and landing gear by outsourced contractors 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 Regarding the status of the A350 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.660
 The top and bottom of the wing were made in an additive process using the injected Creon fibers in a resinous tape 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.700
 Which was then processed in a large furnace to become stronger and lighter than steel 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.900
 Let me say this again 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.400
 This will be an airplane wing 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.580
 Made of adhesive tape 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.160
 The wing boxes are fitted with electric, hydraulic and fuel systems 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.060
 It was painted, then the plates, plates, and wings of the buttocks - the thing used for steering - 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.160
 The giant tail cascade was constructed in a similar fashion 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.180
 Fuselage * Has difficulty spelling the word * 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.320
 The rear pressure barrier was built separately 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.000
 And again from carbon fiber materials 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.060
 The wiring was connected with equipment, hydraulic / fluid / 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.560
 The introduction of the aircraft has been added 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.540
 And then all the pieces were built off site 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.460
 Fly by a special carrier aircraft and very funny form 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.920
 For the final assembly line 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.200
 Where one giant giant paddle / hanger is attached to the fuselage pieces together 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.440
 The wings are connected 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.880
 Landing devices installed 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.600
 The auxiliary power unit is put into place 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600
 The vertical stabilizer and the tail of the horizontal plane are connected 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.720
 Seats, ventilation, cabin and inner cockpit are installed 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.600
 Etc ... 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.160
 Finally, finally, now is the time of the engines 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.120
 They are the most expensive pieces of the price, so they are put to the last thing 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.780
 The aircraft is subject to a test flight to ensure that all systems are operating as required 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.700
 When a new aircraft is developed, the first few planes will be built 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.520
 They are covered by sensors and are extensively tested for a range of limits in: 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.480
 the weather is cold 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880
 TE weather is hot 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880
 High altitude 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.160
 Water on the runway 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.260
 Friction tail when taking off slowly 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.500
 Power bend wing 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.260
 etc..... 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.300
 In addition to the extensive testing of this first model, each aircraft itself exits the assembly line 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.320
 They are taken on a test trip of their own 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.240
 Once pilots have been tested pilots and flight test are happy 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.920
 We are finished 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.920
 The plane goes to the runway to be delivered to airlines somewhere in the world 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.520
 When fully powered, Airbus will build 10 A350 aircraft each month 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.800
 This means one plane is completed every two working days 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.460
 This is actually an amazing feat of engineering, manufacturing, structural and technology 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.800
 And if there was one thing I learned about manufacturing the aircraft on my visit to Airbus 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.820
 He is that for every single part of the process he has his own expert 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.860
 There are air traffic control experts 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.660
 Seat experts 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.780
 Panel panels experts 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.760
 Experts models wind channel engine 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.300
 And even carbon fiber recycling experts 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.240
 All this, so you and I can go from New York to London in a few hours instead of a few days 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.140
 I'm here in the escape slot in the A350 aircraft 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.540
 Uh, in an emergency I have to jump out of this place 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.820
 But I would like to say thank you to Airbus for bringing me here 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.680
 It was an amazing trip, I learned a lot about airplanes 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.480
 It was really interesting to see the production centers 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.620
 See the plane test and things like that 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.100
 If yes, thanks to Airbus for allowing this to happen, hope you have enjoyed it 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.980
 I can not believe how big this plane is 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.980
 It's huge 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.260
 I do not want to jump out 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.340
 Oh, and one other thing 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.460
 If you would like to buy an Airbus A350 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.440
 Connect with Airbus and let them know that I sent you to them
