00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.760
 we're back to citizen duty 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.040
 to make young people aware of the importance 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.350
 to drive carefully to avoid 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.450
 the worst that's what the police did 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.119
 blainville by organizing a simulation 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.240
 accident at henri high school 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.520
 bloody victim mobilized 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.710
 many emergency services all 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.130
 was in place to fully understand the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.740
 message 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 and despite the shock campaigns of the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 automobile insurance company of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.489
 Quebec City she decided blainville 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 in 2006 to set up his own 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 road safety campaign 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 does this campaign give the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.060
 expected results 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.060
 that's what we went to check 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.290
 November 14, 2012 and the 13 hours in this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.600
 sunny afternoon 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.060
 Secondary V students at the school 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.550
 henri-dunant in blainville attended a 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.530
 police accident simulation and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 paramedics and firefighters are on the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.550
 places and no effort is spared to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 demonstrate to young people just how much 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.690
 accident mobilizes many 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.950
 stakeholders in our profession we have 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.660
 often answer precisely this kind 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.560
 of accident that kind of calls to the fact that 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.450
 it's something that I really want 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.070
 teach young people to slow down so 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.479
 the attention of one who drive each 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.100
 for me I think it's really a 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.920
 nice way to touch young people 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.960
 people yasmine bourdy is one of 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.240
 two victims during the simulation 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 is to raise awareness that a friend 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.229
 decided to play the game 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.590
 in fact I know someone who does 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.270
 but who drives takes all the time 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.130
 properly then I find that if I 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 do the simulation myself maybe 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.490
 that they will react who wants to think that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.110
 these apple trees preparatory meeting 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.649
 accident simulation back on 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.690
 event 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.280
 do the principal concerned 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.380
 actually understood the message 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.610
 that's what we tried to know 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.800
 I already had 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.619
 finally be careful the children attention 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.289
 it alone if I had local 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.700
 do that I need to see how a 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.929
 nobody who mobilized for that me 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.819
 I thought it was not so much 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.280
 world who also I did not think it 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.010
 was all that when we see it in front of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.450
 we these different cantons 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.250
 we just saw had made rise 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.659
 it's different it's really more that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.000
 would have more differences on the 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.620
 no one as I would expect 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.610
 while mingling when the seat not seen I 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
 find myself in this unfair situation 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.500
 and it was still a long and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.959
 it happened to me and I tend to 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.280
 to die I am severe month affecting the 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.099
 know what you do not want that every day 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.510
 favor what goes what a nice associate 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.760
 space fangs for him to pay the round 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.549
 it's really going to be forgotten what is 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.780
 it takes for young people according to you for 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.489
 that their behaviors change 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.560
 really a parental presence that's 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.769
 less and less there since a judgment 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.480
 severe but redone or the parent we have 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.609
 worked hard to support 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.379
 needs of the family so his polo and 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.790
 under the watch we see a tight link 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.889
 with made them was a space 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.139
 their children to larach is not well they 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.849
 are left human is good but the 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.310
 children and need a coaching 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.840
 and also need an example then 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.670
 they're going to take it we're depending on 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.959
 everywhere on the internet the media 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.269
 that error that makes sure that 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.879
 it's not all she's a good example 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.459
 so if the parents get involved andy 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.090
 little more maybe that we would bring the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.859
 campaigns that the saaq does is that the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.870
 police services do here because 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.150
 it's still huge what is happening 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.109
 as awareness work 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.400
 but maybe it's not that this 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.660
 would be better while not that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.949
 it's come to make sure 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.049
 would change the internship habit 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.970
 generation there to incite the 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.430
 blainvillois and those who circulate on 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.109
 the territory to carefully drive the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.329
 Blainville city in collaboration 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.650
 with the police department decided to 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.410
 take the big ways 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.819
 in 2006 she created her own campaign 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.879
 awareness 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.840
 we have a very young city one of the cities 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.819
 the youngest in Quebec 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 so yes it's important there are 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.180
 young children crossing streets 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.599
 said 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.939
 it makes it uncomfortable for parents to see that 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.140
 at the same time we have young teens who 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.260
 start driving 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.599
 so that's important for us and we 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.370
 made it a priority to blainville by 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.859
 the past the themes of different 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.269
 campaigns were very diverse there 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.970
 was about driving speed 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.530
 of schoolchildren's safety, and in particular 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.990
 styling on the road 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.699
 as regards the 2012 campaign 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.020
 which took place under the theme you have 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.539
 wanted to do to your head 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.729
 she reacted a lot according to the 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.349
 mayor of wheatville the social media they 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.870
 are definitely for something 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.280
 we were really targeting a clientele of 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.120
 social media ie a 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.800
 young clientele 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.160
 we saw him elsewhere on facebook had 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.110
 like 20000 key that has a moment and that 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.180
 spread everywhere in Quebec people 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.320
 from everywhere in Quebec told us about 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.289
 the blainville campaign 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.889
 even the ministry congratulated us for 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.639
 this campaign so yes sas his typing and 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.400
 as they say it to statistically 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.229
 fewer collisions fewer accidents 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.479
 with collision in Blainville less 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.460
 accidents with injuries also since 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.870
 we started the 12000 campaigns 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.020
 more people brought into the 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.349
 portions of 42 minutes to 50 4 55 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.870
 currently in 2005 in 2005 have reached 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.810
 42 wet so there are more cars 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.940
 but there are fewer accidents with 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.990
 collision so we are we are we think 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.150
 yes, we have an impact 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.980
 that's what ends this second 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.610
 show devoted to driving 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.920
 automotive 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.930
