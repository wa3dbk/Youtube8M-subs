00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
like MSM of prenatal vitamins it may

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.609 
like MSM of prenatal vitamins it may
work<00:02:07.189> for<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.640> better<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:08.929> just<00:02:09.380> my

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
experience and I'm not a professional

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.030 
experience and I'm not a professional
anything<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.489> take<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:14.060> for<00:02:14.299> what<00:02:14.599> it's<00:02:14.750> worth

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
anything so take it for what it's worth

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.680 
anything so take it for what it's worth
the<00:02:16.040> most<00:02:16.220> important<00:02:16.730> thing<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.269> make<00:02:17.660> sure

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the most important thing is to make sure

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.870 
the most important thing is to make sure
that<00:02:18.049> you<00:02:18.170> drink<00:02:18.410> plenty<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.799> water<00:02:18.890> because

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
that you drink plenty of water because

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880 
that you drink plenty of water because
you<00:02:20.000> don't<00:02:20.180> want<00:02:20.390> your<00:02:20.510> skin<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.900> clog<00:02:21.470> up<00:02:21.680> or

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
you don't want your skin to clog up or

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.520 
you don't want your skin to clog up or
your<00:02:22.010> pores<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.370> get<00:02:22.610> clogged<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.120> any<00:02:23.329> way<00:02:23.630> so

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
your pores to get clogged in any way so

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.949 
your pores to get clogged in any way so

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
I would hopefully do another follow-up

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.449 
I would hopefully do another follow-up
in<00:02:27.079> about<00:02:27.290> three<00:02:27.530> months<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.890> see<00:02:28.099> where<00:02:28.310> we
