00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 measurements of each muscle and how much you want to increase 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.090
 The ideal would be to have the advice of an expert nutritionist or coach 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.370
 physical activity to follow a diet and exercises appropriate to the need or 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.849
 personal desire 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.400
 some people have mistakenly believed that to increase the 

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:22.539
 muscles it is necessary to first fatten and then tone the fat but that 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.249
 it's a big mistake since it puts health at risk and then it's done 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.409
 very difficult to mold a body with excess fat 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.070
 the ideal is that at the same time you are making a diet rich in carbohydrates 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.010
 proteins and nutrients work on the muscles in which you want 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.740
 achieve greater density 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.830
 in fact there are extremely thin people that no matter how much they eat they do not get fat yet 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.190
 doing diets to gain weight 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.300
 but they set out to be a daily routine of loading exercises in which 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.690
 they work their muscles and they start to grow 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.950
 feeding is something that will contribute to weight gain 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.010
 street pando out the daily exercise routine is recommended to make certain 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.160
 guidelines to avoid losing calories since since there is a 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.200
 correct nutrition will suffice with muscular work to stay healthy 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.740
 the consumption of carbohydrates during the day turns out to be very beneficial in the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.340
 diet to gain muscle mass what I have done are source of energy and 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.240
 contribute to physical endurance during training 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.820
 the yogurt is recommended the good the honey the vegetables rich in starch the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.340
 lactose the legumes the cream of wheat and the integral cereal among others 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.060
 the proteins in turn are the most related to the formation of tissue 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.090
 muscular 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.630
 eat for example full egg white games that those beef 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.720
 of state chicken breast and turkey without skin among others 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.560
 However, this protein consumption must be balanced with the intake of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.510
 carbohydrates since it takes energy for there to be a correct 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.660
 metabolism and so that at the same time you can perform enough 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.969
 physical activity to increase muscle mass 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:13.699
