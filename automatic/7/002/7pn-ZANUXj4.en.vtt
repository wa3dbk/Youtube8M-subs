project<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.950> its<00:01:09.160> location<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:10.570> are<00:01:10.660> located

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
project is its location we are located

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.010 
project is its location we are located
right<00:01:11.470> on<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.400> corner<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.300> old<00:01:13.330> city<00:01:13.750> wall

on the second ring and this this

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.400 
on the second ring and this this
location<00:01:17.290> really<00:01:17.530> is<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:18.430> central<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.960> Beijing

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410

location really is so central to Beijing
that<00:01:20.590> from<00:01:21.250> about<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.850> fourth<00:01:22.120> floor<00:01:22.300> on<00:01:22.690> a

city and it's our idea that the cinema
becomes<00:04:04.609> a<00:04:04.730> place<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.239> gathering<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:06.290> it's

becomes a place of gathering but it's

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.379 
becomes a place of gathering but it's
also<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.010> way<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.160> microcosm<00:04:07.849> because<00:04:08.239> when

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
also in a way a microcosm because when

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.539 
also in a way a microcosm because when
you<00:04:08.480> look<00:04:08.660> at<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.959> way<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.380> looping<00:04:10.160> bridges

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
you look at the way the looping bridges

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.879 
you look at the way the looping bridges
connect<00:04:10.940> everything<00:04:11.389> in<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.599> project<00:04:12.079> in<00:04:12.500> a

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
connect everything in the project in a

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.920 
connect everything in the project in a
way<00:04:13.010> that's<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.370> cinematic<00:04:14.060> adventure<00:04:14.239> the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
way that's a cinematic adventure the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.770 
way that's a cinematic adventure the
sort<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.260> feeling<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.280> moving<00:04:16.669> through<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:17.510> loop

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
sort of feeling of moving through a loop

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.680 
sort of feeling of moving through a loop
in<00:04:17.959> space<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.620> moving<00:04:19.609> through<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.000> loop<00:04:20.299> in

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
in space and moving through a loop in

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.110 
in space and moving through a loop in
space<00:04:21.079> at<00:04:21.349> the<00:04:21.470> base<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.099> project<00:04:22.580> so<00:04:23.000> the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
space at the base of the project so the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.080 
space at the base of the project so the
cinema<00:04:23.479> becomes<00:04:23.870> in<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.470> way<00:04:24.590> an<00:04:24.800> emblem<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:25.580> at

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
cinema becomes in a way an emblem and at

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.250 
cinema becomes in a way an emblem and at
night

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
night

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.530 
night
the<00:04:27.580> projections<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.790> what's<00:04:29.120> going<00:04:29.360> on

the projections of what's going on
inside<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.050> cinema<00:04:30.380> occur<00:04:30.800> in<00:04:31.040> certain

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
inside the cinema occur in certain

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.670 
inside the cinema occur in certain
places<00:04:31.670> on<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.120> exterior<00:04:32.540> so<00:04:33.230> you<00:04:33.320> have<00:04:33.560> this

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
places on the exterior so you have this

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.560 
places on the exterior so you have this
color<00:04:34.570> reflection<00:04:35.570> effect<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:37.250> water<00:04:40.570> on

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
the intermediate level of course you you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.120 
the intermediate level of course you you
have<00:04:44.300> more<00:04:44.540> quiet<00:04:44.870> spaces<00:04:45.260> like<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.770> gardens

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
have more quiet spaces like the gardens

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.490 
have more quiet spaces like the gardens

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
top that one can see from all these

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.910 
top that one can see from all these
apartments<00:04:56.060> so<00:04:56.450> one<00:04:56.930> never<00:04:57.200> looks<00:04:57.470> down<00:04:57.710> on<00:04:57.890> a

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
apartments so one never looks down on a

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.040 
apartments so one never looks down on a
black<00:04:58.220> asphalt<00:04:58.850> roof<00:04:59.090> you're<00:04:59.540> always<00:04:59.660> looking

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
black asphalt roof you're always looking

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.780 
black asphalt roof you're always looking
down<00:05:00.080> on<00:05:00.500> green<00:05:01.310> gardens<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.330> green<00:05:02.840> aspects

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.550 

and<00:05:08.380> then<00:05:09.380> of<00:05:09.500> course<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.920> top<00:05:10.160> becomes<00:05:11.030> a

and then of course the top becomes a

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:35.779 
and then of course the top becomes a
wonderful<00:05:12.560> experience<00:05:12.980> in<00:05:13.340> perspective
