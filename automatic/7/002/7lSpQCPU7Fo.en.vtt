with<00:03:33.000> toothbrush<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.870> piece<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.080> cloth

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.360 

I<00:03:49.689> felt<00:03:50.689> like<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.230> was<00:03:51.470> not<00:03:51.650> finished<00:03:51.890> without

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
I felt like it was not finished without

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.360 
I felt like it was not finished without
top<00:03:52.909> piece<00:03:53.180> by<00:03:53.989> which<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.439> could<00:03:54.650> easily<00:03:54.799> lift

up<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.909> entire<00:03:56.269> holder<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:58.370> we<00:03:58.519> did<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.790> final

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
