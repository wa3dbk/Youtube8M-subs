00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello, I want to share everything 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.559
 impressions of such a kranchik 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.809
 who bought on ebae for our common 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 affairs 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.560
 buy a crane to adjust the flow 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:26.310
 water cooling because how to regulate 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.920
 her using a ball valve crane is not 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 very comfortable with the usual 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.550
 Kitchen faucet therefore bought such 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.730
 kranchik faucet very cheap something 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:43.070
 one and a half two dollars per thing up to 2 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 of the week I already had a tap not a stainless steel 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.649
 from brass to make a golden man 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.629
 covered in brilliant 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.879
 nickel chrome did not know here 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:01:05.519
 incoming incoming outgoing thread 1 8 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:10.310
 since it is arranged and the old man is all just 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.840
 like all all ashamed in general that 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.030
 call it needle tongue not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.810
 turns that is to regulate 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.350
 probably what sort of selection will be there 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 hard enough because like a needle 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.500
 so with a finger thick but 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 adjusting the water I roughly represents 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.829
 he works gruffly rude but 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 the other side to adjust the water 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.240
 cooling is quite that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.110
 Enough for now I'm in a little 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.170
 unified that is screwed 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.649
 screwed into the crane directly 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:59.159
 quick couplings for air 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.330
 festa in particular this one 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.909
 connector let's say this festa 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.070
 this one i'm not sure maybe 100 100 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.479
 but it does not matter that is the essence is the same 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.650
 such some for air supply 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.990
 used will be on automation 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.610
 everywhere 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.930
 You can also buy on ebay not much 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.350
 expensive but they cost a little but plus 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.040
 extremely convenient, that is , for example 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:36.930
 if there is a hose 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:39.489
 pvc 6 millimeters here for example hose 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.180
 you court just in art-1 this is not 6 he 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.269
 thinner hose is just inserted and already 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.840
 from there in no way jump out 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.640
 keeps fine pressure so that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.350
 From here you need to extract click on this blue 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:00.750
 shaybochka I pull out particulars I imagine 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.030
 put some ethics for such purposes 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.320
 Here I have a water connection to the faucet 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.940
 did through here such an adapter 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.100
 Initially it was like an aerator. 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.970
 such a thing you don't see it 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.959
 seller and penny down his served 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.510
 something junk 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.079
 so the lower part took off there in will come 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.010
 tube with a tube on 6 also this 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.590
 wound on the crane standard and here 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.019
 this tube on 6 fits very well here 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:42.970
 insert this quick connector 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:45.579
 all he holds there very well by 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.940
 about not poisoning to make out 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:53.890
 press the ordeals and ideally so 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.240
 state connects tube for 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.010
 water supply already to the apparatus so 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.920
 I also want to share one little 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.130
 so on ear ears know how 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.230
 There is no know experience this problems not with 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.700
 connecting friend pvc 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.970
 The problem I had was that they 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.340
 this tube is not very elastic if 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.170
 use for example clamps and something 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.600
 like that is this connection 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.430
 it turns out 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.410
 permanent that is constantly to me 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.410
 I want the device I need to make out something 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.970
 wash then collect back 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.030
 used to use wire but uncomfortable 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.520
 Well, somehow it looks certainly not very 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.400
 nice yes but exactly such a thought 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.420
 take a piece of silicone hose 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.610
 means a hose 66 and a half that is 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:55.850
 inner diameter 6 wall and a half this 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:05:00.080
 PVC hose is also 6 and a half and here and on 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.630
 we put on this silicone hose 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.120
 from above and he himself creates this one 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.400
 here are the burning efforts very well 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.560
 keeps it all sorted out going 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.960
 very quickly and accordingly if necessary 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.310
 just worn completely and everything in 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.460
 seconds can be collected and 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:25.370
 disassemble in general, that's all I'm talking about 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.670
 I would like to talk to you today before new ones 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.670
 meeting
