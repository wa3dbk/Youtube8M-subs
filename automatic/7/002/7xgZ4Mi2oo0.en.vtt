00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:08.000
 good morning, welcome to the course 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.090
 technical drawing elements my name 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.019
 is cristian valderrama I am the 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.019
 director of this course 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.810
 this course from basic training 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.020
 has some transversal competences is 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.660
 a theoretical course consisting of two 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.770
 credits and it will develop in a time 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 16 weeks 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 being a two-credit course only 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.600
 It consists of two units in the unit 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270
 number one we will see everything that has to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 see with the introduction to the drawing in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.450
 unit number 2 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.810
 we will see descriptive geometry and its 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.810
 application 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.040
 The following strategy will be used 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.690
 learning remember that this course will 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.490
 will develop through a 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.490
 project- based learning 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 the students 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.140
 within their collaborative part they should 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.850
 design geometric figures using 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.480
 the different tools of use 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.000
 technical as are draftsight and autocad 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.390
 which will be increasingly complex 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.729
 as the course progresses this 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.630
 course consists of six phases spread across 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.630
 16 weeks 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.300
 an environment of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.040
 practical learning so that the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.170
 student 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.200
 can polish and learn about 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 different tools and software 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.320
 technical drawing that will be used in 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.240
 the present course remember that this 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240
 environment does not have any qualification 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.400
 within the evaluation part is 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.190
 will develop the six phases and the phase 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.380
 number one that consists of diagnosis 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.140
 a video of the recognition will be made 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.710
 of the draw site and autocad programs 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.710
 has a value of 25 points 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.960
 in phase number 2 which is the second 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.910
 part of the diagnosis we will make a 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.570
 hand metric figuration design 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.570
 raised this has a value of 50 points 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.740
 in phase number 3 which is the first 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.020
 planning stage will be carried out 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.370
 design of geometric figures with views 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.080
 in digital format 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.080
 will have a value of 100 points 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.780
 in phase number 4 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.950
 in the second planning stage 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.860
 we will make the design of figures 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.630
 digital in three dimensions also 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.630
 will have a value of 100 points 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.319
 phase number 5 that will be called without 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.760
 control is the design of figures 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.010
 digital in three dimensions starting 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.220
 of the proposed views within the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.500
 work 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.500
 this will have a value of 100 points 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.060
 and in the last easy 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.610
 what is the execution of the project 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.459
 we will do the final exam that is 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.370
 a final project in a group and it will be 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.250
 open only within dates 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.230
 established by the university will have 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.230
 a value of 125 points 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.190
 thank you very much for your attention
