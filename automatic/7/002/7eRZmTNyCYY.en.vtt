00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello to all of us we are 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.309
 found Sunday on the racecourse of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.640
 banks of Seine to houses-laffitte for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.199
 the big eponymous handicap so big 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 handicap of houses-laffitte a race 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.140
 for 4 years and over disputed on the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.619
 distance of 2500 meters the course will have 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.149
 place right hand and we can rely on 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.120
 a good pitch to soft number five 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.890
 worlds of pink sounds partner 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.340
 olive tree driven by jeans 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.969
 Marie Béguigné has just caused a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.129
 big impression on June 30th at chantilly 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.700
 in the price of precy a race 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.500
 played on 2400 meters that day so 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.379
 the son asks for rau placed a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 acceleration of all beauty for 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.559
 to win with little but very surely 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.030
 with an obvious margin 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.460
 attention to him it seems inevitable 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.640
 this is the basis 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.420
 one euros seventeen thousand and one thousand 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.030
 driven by carlos and yann lerner 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.700
 irreproachable by three times dolphin of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.860
 quinted this thousand and a thousand gifts that he has he 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.270
 has preceded 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.720
 my sweet lord he just finished 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.610
 behind my desk rings on 2500 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.950
 meters his music reads as follows 1 3rd 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:36.260
 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd and on this course he has 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.960
 won he ranked second in two 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.440
 and so it's a thousand and a thousand too 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.280
 must number 14 so my 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.060
 sweet lord 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.490
 this is the logical consequence so this 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.300
 boarder of eduardo holgado guillaine 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.060
 has always always done well here he has 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.750
 an ability to prove at this course he 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.040
 makes sense to keep it number 16 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.680
 Miskin this is a fun bet 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.680
 perhaps the most fun bet of the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.179
 race in play single winner placed 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.790
 she is a resident of john hammond 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.520
 companion of casaque slab kazim 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.150
 he counts four wins have come out a 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.090
 he is not devoid of means he 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.640
 he will evolve so on a course that he 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.769
 know well he broke 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.860
 ranked by good 5th 4th and 3rd 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.640
 he comes from 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.430
 to win with a big semi margin 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.820
 skin so worth 35 enemies he can 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.760
 to hurt this weight is very fun 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.460
 the number 8 amiens son of galileo ex 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.360
 boarder andre fabre him who remains 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.210
 on a win so at this level here 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.410
 even before that on 3100 meters he had 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.100
 well kept his part 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.510
 care assured mine who can so if 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.810
 it's in the in the combination 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.850
 winning number 3 is this the wesley this 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.680
 I do not know how they say so 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.950
 pensioner of carlos laffon pariah this 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.140
 who remained on two victories at the level 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.110
 to claim a leap is good has proclaimed a 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.850
 before failing at the doors of the quinté he 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.700
 just ranked sixth of a 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.010
 super handicap event 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.430
 again it is a super handicap 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.480
 a price to endow 70,000 euros so this 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.790
 horse attention he is fit 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.280
 they can come they can come 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.840
 take a lot number 7 bazin 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.269
 well-known competitors of the turfists 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.209
 seasoned quintetists we retain the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.580
 number 15 in finland or blue second 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.340
 representing lerner father and son 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.739
 so it's a competitor who does not have any 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.959
 room for maneuver in the same no 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.879
 however, they can stay 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.299
 able to take a fifth place 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:57.900
 so here we summarize the selection 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.420
 number 5 worldwide are the 17 thousand and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.910

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.190
 total consisting of four horses in 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.510
 hoping to touch so the 5 on single or 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.010
 bonuses etc 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.440

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.680
 of all horses in total field 5 17 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.570
