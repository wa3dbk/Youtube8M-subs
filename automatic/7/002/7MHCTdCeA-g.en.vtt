 hello everyone I'm cat and welcome to me 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.119
 canal crafts strip in crafts 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.580
 straits we continue to transform and create 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.910
 today in street crafts we are going to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.489
 learn how to make these two keyrings in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 Heart shape can also be made 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.539
 in decoration as seen in the photo 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.489
 what are these keychains are very easy 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.370
 of doing very economical are done with 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.199
 newspaper or advertising paper or 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 magazine than they want to make 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.469
 and well I hope that the tutorial will

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.040
 to move on to materials and 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.199
 procedure I would like to ask you if

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.060
 and now we move on to the materials be 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.220
 process 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.930
 the materials that we are going to use to 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.640
 this craft is these thick wire 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.400
 a clamp 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:34.830
 and a brush a scissors sticks that are 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.630
 previously painted acrylic varnish 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.500
 these little hooks that sell it in the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.690
 bazaars the silicone gun and if the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.050
 hooks and sticks of de los pintan 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.100
 with water coloring can use 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.229
 also glue 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.409
 you do not have to use the gun 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.200
 silicone if they do so well 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.830
 now we go to the procedure and there is a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.899
 Once your stick and you have the form 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.299
 from your heart you want the following 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.850
 let's go let's do the following 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:13.570
 we're going to hit like that 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.780
 do not forget to tell them that this little stick 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.090
 It has to be painted with sticks 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.430
 to be with painted decorative sticks 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.950
 Diaz then it 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.890
 we have rolled here is worth if you want to 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.930
 can be putting silicone but for 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.150
 that's what I say in the materials that this 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.910
 it has to be a hard wire so that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.530
 if we are doing it with one more wire 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.990
 fine is losing the form according to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.560
 let's go putting then let's go 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.910
 I wrapped up we are going to give shape to this 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 depending on what we are 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.600
 we want to see we are going to go around 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.620
 so we're going to go around 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.530
 to our liking so a few laps as 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.720
 you want and it's just go 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.140
 circling 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.210
 we are going to put sticks until we have 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.060
 the volume that we want and I'm already going 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.790
 three sticks and it's for them to see how it is 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.880
 something so simple so simple so easy 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.550
 to do and it's simply we're giving 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.830
 turn more laps like that 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.950
 trying that our heart does not 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.620
 lose the form if you put a lot 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.910
 here you will lose the form because it is a 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.650
 very tiny heart 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.069
 What I want is that I have volume 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.260
 but more in the center 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.499
 that on the sides if you see that you 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.219
 it's going to be like that now 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:44.090
 it just messes up and that's it and they're 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:46.819
 to go like that trying to cover 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.310
 the lava heart is trying to 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.770
 cover the heart of the background as they come 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.670
 when you finish that little stick is 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.550
 just add with another one with a 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.290
 little bit of glue 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.290
 we introduce the other 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.230
 and is already as I will follow where 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.379
 volume if you want to leave it like this 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.389
 and all this is to taste how they want 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.389
 leave it as you want 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.660
 as you want your heart 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:29.800
 I left as I see I'm giving more 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.800
 more volume 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.080
 and so on until they have the volume that 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.639
 you want without a fair you know 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.520
 when we're messing up like that more 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.129
 our sticks well in the heart 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.220
 will ever come a moment in the 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.860
 that not in the one that does not fit in the one that does not 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.229
 they are left to slide or whatever 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.750
 the reason that is and what we are going to do 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.259
 is that we are going to put a droplet here 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.270
 hot silicone and let's go like this we're going 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.699
 to keep rolling like that for example me 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.039
 I want to cover this hole here and 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.580
 for it so that it does not slip like that 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.080
 Well, I guess another droplet like that in silicone 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.729
 we are going to continue giving them this way 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.550
 until we have the volume that we 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.250
 we want to fill in because in the end this 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.990
 stage that is already where you have the volume 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.740
 What I want is to simply raise a 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.740
 little bit like that 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.630
 and put a little bit of glue on it and 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.240
 it will be stuck like this and is ready to 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.710
 decorate well and having my heart 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.500
 so the next thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.450
 Give two layers of acrylic varnish to 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.360
 my whole heart I'm going to give you first one 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.310
 layer I'll wait for it to dry and when 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.470
 I know I'm going to give him the next layer 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.800
 well and it's already getting here 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.510
 this step and the only thing that remains is 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.910
 well put the hook we're going 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.780
 to introduce somewhere that we 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.910
 can see and if we are going to hang something 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.780
 we introduce this here 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.639
 and we have it ready to decorate for 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.469
 give for what they want 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.099
 well how come they see how they are 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:12.590
 our keychains once finished this 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:17.599
 who see here these two who see here the 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:22.879
 I did in the 21 orange and I gave him money 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:26.300
 and the other I painted it red wine red and 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:28.129
 I gave him a little gold and good and 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.289
 decoration that comes here also the 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:32.619
 I did the same only that gave him a mallow 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:36.819
 a mallow 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:39.860
 intense and I gave him dry brushes of white 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.619
 and these flowers that I have put them on 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.289
 are some flowers that are made with 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:49.490
 egg carton mass that I'm going to 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.500
 leave the link of how they are made and good 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.110
 nothing I hope that the tutorial has 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.970
 liked that they are encouraged to do it and 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.970
 it will be up to the next tutorial bye 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.400
