you know raining their bases going
through<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.800> gonna<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> little

than<00:00:48.480> him<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.200> game<00:00:49.410> does<00:00:49.829> recognize<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.399> i

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
than him the game does recognize that i

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
than him the game does recognize that i
will<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.850> beating<00:00:51.180> him<00:00:51.390> almost<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.680> one

hundred<00:00:52.980> percent<00:00:53.059> all<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.329> time<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.500> we're

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
hundred percent all the time so we're

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.869 
hundred percent all the time so we're
going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> take<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> real<00:00:56.160> quick<00:00:56.340> look<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.760> his

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
going to take a real quick look at his

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.569 
going to take a real quick look at his
base<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.289> very<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.620> good<00:00:59.039> design

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
base here it's a very very good design

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.950 
base here it's a very very good design
it<00:01:00.390> has<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> nice<00:01:00.960> pinch<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:02.960> nice

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
it has a nice pinch right there nice

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.250 
it has a nice pinch right there nice
choke<00:01:04.320> point<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.830> good<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.869> barrier

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
choke point a good use of the barrier

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
choke point a good use of the barrier
right<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.890> because<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.090> bring<00:01:09.240> up

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
right here because if you do bring up

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
right here because if you do bring up
cannons<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.830> probably<00:01:11.189> attack<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.610> which

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
cannons to probably attack this which

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.250 
cannons to probably attack this which
should<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> firebolt<00:01:12.540> cannon<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.049> here

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
should be a firebolt cannon over here

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.620 
should be a firebolt cannon over here
the<00:01:13.830> cannons<00:01:14.400> will<00:01:14.520> most<00:01:14.790> likely<00:01:14.970> trigger<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the cannons will most likely trigger and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
the cannons will most likely trigger and
tack<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> mortars<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
tack this and then with the mortars the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.039 
tack this and then with the mortars the
Moors<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.090> sit<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.540> corner<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.020> well

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
Moors will sit in this corner as well

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
Moors will sit in this corner as well
this<00:01:19.439> choke<00:01:19.710> point<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.130> also<00:01:20.880> divert<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
this choke point and also divert the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
this choke point and also divert the
cannon<00:01:21.750> detention<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
cannon detention and then so the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
cannon detention and then so the
firebolt<00:01:23.759> cannon<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> corner<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:24.930> here

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
firebolt cannon in the corner right here

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.320 
firebolt cannon in the corner right here
will<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.860> able<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> destroy<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> lot<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.970> cannons

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
will be able to destroy a lot of cannons

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.109 
will be able to destroy a lot of cannons
you<00:01:27.990> want<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> put<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.799> fireball<00:01:29.520> cannon<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you want to put a fireball cannon in a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
you want to put a fireball cannon in a
corner<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.659> because<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.040> very

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
corner like this because it's very very

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
corner like this because it's very very
hard<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.360> range<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.110> pushed<00:01:34.560> back

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
hard you know range it's pushed back

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
hard you know range it's pushed back
just<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> little<00:01:35.189> bit<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.119> only<00:01:36.270> units

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
just a little bit and the only units

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
just a little bit and the only units
that<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:36.990> attack<00:01:37.259> at<00:01:37.439> our<00:01:37.530> cannons

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that can really attack at our cannons

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
that can really attack at our cannons
and<00:01:38.189> Canada's<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:39.150> extremely<00:01:39.540> weak<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and Canada's actually extremely weak to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
and Canada's actually extremely weak to
those<00:01:40.409> firebolt<00:01:40.890> cannons<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
those firebolt cannons so are the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
those firebolt cannons so are the
fireball<00:01:42.869> towers<00:01:43.290> excuse<00:01:43.649> me<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
fireball towers excuse me so it's a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
fireball towers excuse me so it's a
great<00:01:45.270> great<00:01:45.540> thing<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> reason

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
great great thing to do and the reason

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.380 
great great thing to do and the reason
why<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> because<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> curve<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.329> here

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
why is because of the curve right here

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
why is because of the curve right here
u-turns<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.229> units<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:49.950> moving<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.369> way

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
u-turns all units are moving this way

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.789 
u-turns all units are moving this way
and<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.600> spot<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.759> probably<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.119> most

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
and this spot is probably the most

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.789 
and this spot is probably the most
efficient<00:01:55.799> our<00:01:55.979> spot<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.479> map<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.590> looking

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
efficient our spot in the map so looking

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.819 
efficient our spot in the map so looking
forward<00:01:59.070> he<00:01:59.280> does<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> mini<00:02:00.619> clover<00:02:01.619> thing

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
forward he does have a mini clover thing

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.969 
forward he does have a mini clover thing
over<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.110> good<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> diverts<00:02:04.740> all

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
over here this is good it diverts all

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.889 
over here this is good it diverts all
this<00:02:05.280> attention<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.119> time<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.750> your

some of his great base designs here uh

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.000 
some of his great base designs here uh
since<00:02:54.960> I<00:02:55.050> won't<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.770> worry

since I won't really have to worry

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.130 
since I won't really have to worry
probably<00:02:56.460> about<00:02:56.580> dying<00:02:56.940> too<00:02:57.180> much<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:58.080> I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
probably about dying too much like I

probably about dying too much like I
said<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.320> am<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.710> little<00:02:59.040> bit<00:02:59.310> overpowered<00:02:59.940> here

spot I total the fireball tower is right

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.970 
spot I total the fireball tower is right
up<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.390> great<00:03:31.110> positioning<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.770> that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
up there a great positioning of that

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.070 
up there a great positioning of that
tower

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.600 

into<00:03:41.080> his<00:03:41.230> trip<00:03:41.620> his<00:03:41.770> first<00:03:42.040> choke<00:03:42.250> point<00:03:42.490> is

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
into his trip his first choke point is

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.850 
into his trip his first choke point is
right<00:03:42.790> here<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.210> that's<00:03:43.930> why<00:03:44.110> I<00:03:44.140> on<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.440> mortar

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
right here and that's why I on a mortar

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.350 
right here and that's why I on a mortar
is<00:03:45.010> because<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.430> mortar<00:03:45.670> has<00:03:45.820> such<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.060> high

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
is because the mortar has such a high

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.990 
is because the mortar has such a high
help<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.440> also<00:03:47.620> has<00:03:47.800> very<00:03:48.190> very<00:03:48.280> resistant

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
help and it also has very very resistant

a<00:05:45.710> very<00:05:46.070> very<00:05:46.190> solid<00:05:46.640> base<00:05:49.180> will<00:05:50.180> take<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.360> real

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
a very very solid base will take a real

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
quick look at the key points again and

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.580 
quick look at the key points again and
some<00:05:53.720> of<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.900> things<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.170> he<00:05:54.260> could<00:05:54.410> do<00:05:54.560> to
