00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.389
 first french news of the week which 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.890
 will once again be a week to troon 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.660
 speak again at the end of the mission hi to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.980
 we are all on Monday, March 30, 2015 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.220
 and it's the freshman two days it's 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.220
 left 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.340
 a video that has been circulating since yesterday on 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.630
 internet shows a samsung galaxy sii 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.520
 those projected several times is very 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.570
 violently on the ground and when the person 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.670
 but recovers there seems to be 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.320
 no scratches on the screen so this 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.270
 video is she real or is this a fake 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.230
 hard to say but the galaxy sii 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.450
 this team and the slab of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.190
 goryl gas protection 4 which is deemed 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.550
 like unbreakable if this video is a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.079
 fake 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 it may cause a bad buzz 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.260
 for gorilla there and for samsung but 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.030
 if it is authentic it seems that one 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.920
 finally took a step towards the quest 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 ultimate shatterproof screen after 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 video-by-image analysis 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.899
 there does not seem to be any trickery even 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.100
 if the responsiveness of the screen seems a 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.110
 little wonder towards the end of the video 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.370
 after its fall but we are wary 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.690
 image hackers are often 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.950
 very strong to make us believe that 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.320
 we see things that do not exist 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.700
 we would like to have your opinion said 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.469
 us what you think about them in 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.790
 comments under the video a new 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.979
 smart one just launched a campaign 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.959
 participatory funding m video has 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.189
 for main peculiarity of power 

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.139
 measure your stress 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.060
 they also analyze your activity 

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:14.189
 physical your heart rate and well 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.359
 sure guessed what they give their mbio 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.159
 displays in real time the level of 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.569
 stress detect and then tells you 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.310
 the critical moments you cross 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.049
 stress levels important she 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.579
 sends you a vibration inviting you 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.740
 to look at the screen you see there then 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.689
 either an orange icon or red next 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 the stress level detect m viau you 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.749
 will then give advice to avoid 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.340
 these minutes and stress when the 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.319
 level of stress will be down to the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.389
 normal the watch will vibrate again and 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.799
 pitots will then be opened if the 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:39.149
 watch interests you and this despite his 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.810
 a little off-putting aspect that is not going well 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.700
 please everyone 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.799
 the kickstarter project and the watch 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.359
 is available for about 167 dollars 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.770
 here is an interesting info but it 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.450
 will be very difficult to prove to you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.700
 youtube images inaugurated this weekend 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 the arrival of videos 4k 60 images per 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.750
 second so if the 4k video exists 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.280
 since 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.810
 several months on the platform of 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.850
 videos she was limited to 30 images 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.570
 per second with a number of 60 images 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.400
 per second 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.840
 the video quality is exceptional and 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.100
 now a fluidity that breaks the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.510
 images all the more realistic 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.190
 in clear we can not find better 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.660
 today on the internet streaming and 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.830
 that's for theory in facts 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.780
 it is very complicated to be able to 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.370
 enjoy the videos this quality it 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.120
 must first has a screen 4 cases 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.470
 it does not run the streets 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.360
 it is especially necessary an internet connection 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.340
 very fast and the major disadvantage there 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.230
 need a very powerful computer capable 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.790
 to decode the stream and that's not won 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.110
 even with a pro and tina macbook 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.459
 last generation for a very image 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.350
 jerky if you're still 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.720
 sufficiently well equipped youtube released 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.489
 a very varied playlist of 4k 60 videos 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.270

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.400
 indicated in intro the rest of the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.630
 week is going to be a little sparse 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.580
 for whoever dares to end up in 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.840
 any case tomorrow if everything is fine and we do not 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.400
