 two terminals see these terminals 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.880

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.230
 call depending on the size of 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.050
 length of canvas work you want to produce 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.960

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.850
 waxed cotton inserted here is closed with 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.890
 doyle tweezers so that you create the 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.930
 terminal and then you can enter the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.390
 closure you want or more 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.700
 simply then it is simply doing 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.220
 a knot even if we say to creation 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.130
 a little less refined by cutting these 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.410
 final parts and you got 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.770

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.320
 of effect that you can insert from the neck 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.180
