00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.530
 good and now we go to one of the 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 devices that I like the most 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:14.520
 of this presentation that is the funk band 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.830
 out efe hd 6 is a device like that 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.160
 as the name implies of 6 inches 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.650
 the good the touch and feel is really 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.950
 fantastic to have one in your hand 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.770
 enjoy 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.360
 is a 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.360
 a device that counts 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.980
 with the stylus 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.540
 android 4.2 intel processor 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.510
 full phone capacity 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.940
 but as we said our our range 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 compact the characteristic that has 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 these smartphones is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 that actually the ability to be able 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.040
 making calls is secondary to the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.050
 type of user to whom it is addressed 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.210
 the main thing he wants the kind of 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.760
 The user searching for this device is the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.010
 mobility in access to content 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.080
 multimedia content online for both 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.970
 create them as to access them and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.220
 Enjoy discounts regarding dates 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.020
 it also has an intel processor 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.440
 atom in this case is 25 80 is also 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.440
 dual core 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.830
 It has two front speakers in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.830
 stereo technology sonicmaster 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.580
 proprietary applications such as can be 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.580
 the audio wizard 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.170
 has the function of optimizing 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.260
 sound characteristics for 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.430
 different profiles and that you can 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.210
 tell you what you want 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.380
 prices but I do not know let's see this 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.380
 approximately three four wheels 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.299
 the version in this case of 16 GB 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.930
 8 follow people movement 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.870
 well now we present the new format 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.040
 7 is an evolution of the version 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.659
 previous of the compass 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.370
 it is clearly seen that it is an evolution 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.970
 both at the design level 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.049
 since, for example , access to 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.120
 sim card or sd much more 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.390
 accessible than the previous version that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.150
 had a lid on top of the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.239
 device 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.470
 in this now in this version has 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.690
 access all the time 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.600
 another of the characteristics that have been 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.800
 improved is that in this version it counts 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.290
 with two front speakers in stereo 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.690
 then this allows us a better 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.330
 user-level experience 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.250
 multimedia we recognize that the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.390
 type of user par excellence of this 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.440
 type of device is the user that 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.060
 use the phone as a 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.310
 secondary characteristic of its 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.740
 smartphone and the main feature 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.190
 of use is internet access 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.830
 of social networks share 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:21.440
 contents both at the level of 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.540
 get them from the network how to create them for 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.780
 this is what has been designed between 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.780
 dispositives 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.490
 the processor in this case 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.900
 same cut of the new series of 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.420
 Internet 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.420
 let's do the 25 60 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.080
 it is a shot to extract 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:01.500
 and the weights of the devices 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.500
 300 minus 330 grams in 328 grams 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.110
 the availability in Spain date of 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.270
 availability in spain 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.060
 we do not have a date completely 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:21.430
 sure at this moment we have it to 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:25.210
 end of this year the price 199 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.210
 the version that we will have available is 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.169
 of 8 gigs of memory with the capacity 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.889
 of probably expanding it with the 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.740
 micro SD 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.100
 until 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.310
 32 gb if I do not remember 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.320
 64 in the least are comments 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.600
 and again the features this has 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.760
 improved is the panel that in this case 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.760
 we are talking about an hd panel 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.730
 then of course this is also a 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.010
 improvement in user experience 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.240
 what we were saying is that the kind of 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.760
 user par excellence of this 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.320
 device is the one that prefers a 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.980
 Larger device to enjoy 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.930
 both content by internet or 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.400
 multimedia content then you have to 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.400
 have a better user experience 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.379
 Android conversion that I have been left 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.379
 dependent 4.2 4 points
