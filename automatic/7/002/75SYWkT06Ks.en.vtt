00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.189
 for cocaine if you make a victory 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.980
 important yes very important for us 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:20.090
 against a very strong team 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:26.869
 palermo with who played very beautiful 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:32.870
 last week, however, ago today 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:38.180
 we played at home for the first time 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:44.149
 we gave a gift for them though 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:51.890
 then we played very well 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.890
 yes I saw it all at the newspaper on TV 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.250
 so much market for all for the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.090
 Italians for the team does on TV because 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:15.750
 only a small group who do 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:15.750
 this goal our goal 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.060
 go to europe 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.060
 but if it is possible 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.270
 third place we find a victory 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.450
 very important we were looking for the three points and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.760
 nothing this gives us morale to go 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.500
 Come on yet done bring yourself here 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.500
 invented immediately in the game was tough 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.930
 there is a physical game as well, nothing 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.250
 I am right away for the mentality that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.280
 he asked for the mister is nothing if I have 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.710
 tried to protect the ball and bring 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.300
 the team his coach did yesterday 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.250
 also compliments saying that you are 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.930
 working really very well that is 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 changed your role a little, not a year 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.900
 last of more protagonist is not bad 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.210
 no 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.090
 well as he says he expects to play by 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.920
 more how difficult it is to insert oneself 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.870
 being able to enter the game in a few 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.230
 minutes and gain space in this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.600
 the other one 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.430
 I think nothing this depends on 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.190
 everybody when the game starts too 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.720
 if he's on the bench, I'll start this 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.870
 concentrated on the game look at the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.410
 opponents for when it came to be everything 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 easier 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.470
 you are working on this leading role 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.870
 central 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.000
 yes yes i also like central tip 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.670
 nothing if they make me find there outside 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.190
 where I am I put all but what it is 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.690
 what has changed in you since last year a 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.100
 last year you were a player up 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.810
 which Lazio was aiming very hard at 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.570
 doing very well this year instead it has 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.739
 I struggled a little , freeski, and I heard nothing 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.570
 maybe they are the thoughts of the coaches and 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.570
 different choices 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.760
 nothing even talker last year 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.190
 he was looking for other things this is now 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.260
 look for others but nothing i always work 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.500
 for myself and I'll always be ready 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.000
 this lazio from champions according to us 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.180
 let's work every day 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.130
 with our feet on the ground we show you all 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.120
 in the field and we are champions 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.120
 we will come stumbling
