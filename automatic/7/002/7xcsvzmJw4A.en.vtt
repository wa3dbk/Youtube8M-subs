but<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.560> probably<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.159> job<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.369> nothing

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
but I probably do this job for nothing

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
but I probably do this job for nothing
because<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.810> interesting<00:01:40.350> job<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> do

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
because it's that interesting job to do

because it's that interesting job to do
this<00:01:41.130> place<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.820> ridiculous<00:01:41.970> that's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this place is kind of ridiculous that's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.330
