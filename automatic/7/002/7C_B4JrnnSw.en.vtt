00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.269
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.610
 master nickname and today will show you how 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.090
 open port 25565 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.169
 for minecraft server and so to us 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 need to start a torrent so 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:33.089
 install and run 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.790
 so in the bottom corner right here right here 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.530
 there is such a box 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.789
 you have to click on it and here you are 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.690
 enter the port you want 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.019
 open there does not know any port for to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.199
 I have already forgotten myself in short, we write 25565 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:59.519
 and push the constant value of the port here 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.519
 here is you have the opportunity to choose 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.610
 and gave great rc between the letter object 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.240
 help the rest of the court screwed 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.679
 click save close 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 so we turn off the torrent but not 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:19.950
 close though 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.110
 Well, I can restart you, but if 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.060
 you're not there I worked on the run and so 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.720
 then go to the site 2 reper 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.130
 In short, this link is such 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.640
 without this blade the link will be also in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.229
 description 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.229
 so waiting with that 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.790
 and with us we get to this page and 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.130
 where you can check under and here we enter 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.770
 the port you want to check is open 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.140
 on line 25565 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 click check like this 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.090
 and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.100
 we wait 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 So 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.720
 and here we see that we have written the port 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.330
 open here that is 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.210
 all is well 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:19.060
 you now if you close the torrent here 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:22.600
 all the same demonstrated and verified 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.510
 for the ax should be closed like me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.910
 came out the item came out let it close 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.850
 because no program and nothing 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.890
 it is not used on see here that is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.870
 the port we have closed no program of it 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.240
 does not use and therefore it is closed 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.750
 but if you will create a server for you 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.790
 for example, it is not necessary to open a torrent 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.820
 to recreate 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.690
 so you need not worry well in general 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.700
 I think today all thanks to all 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.610
