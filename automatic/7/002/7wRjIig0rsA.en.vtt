00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
allows you to just kind of read the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.810 
allows you to just kind of read the
paper<00:01:07.950> he'll<00:01:08.190> go<00:01:08.340> better

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.280 

definitely<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.910> ER<00:01:11.970> goes<00:01:12.300> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.660> bike<00:01:12.869> tend

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
definitely the ER goes on the bike tend

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
definitely the ER goes on the bike tend
to<00:01:13.440> be<00:01:13.590> more<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.190> race<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.790> race

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to be more of a race you know race

to be more of a race you know race
position<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.750> longer<00:01:16.710> hauls<00:01:16.920> might<00:01:17.190> be<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
position so longer hauls might be a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
position so longer hauls might be a
little<00:01:17.490> bit<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.300> an<00:01:18.479> issue<00:01:18.630> but

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
little bit a little bit of an issue but

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.650 
little bit a little bit of an issue but

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it was a little difficult for me to pick

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
it was a little difficult for me to pick
up<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> pace<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.160> I<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.610> exactly

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
up the pace on it I don't know exactly

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.830 
up the pace on it I don't know exactly
what<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.899> was<00:01:37.080> but<00:01:37.560> our<00:01:38.130> hard<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.910> me<00:01:39.030> left<00:01:39.780> to

the<00:01:53.510> torque<00:01:53.810> curve<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.830> is<00:01:55.010> funny<00:01:55.310> because

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
the torque curve and it is funny because

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.710 
the torque curve and it is funny because
you<00:01:55.670> don't<00:01:55.880> feel<00:01:56.090> like<00:01:56.180> you're<00:01:56.330> going<00:01:56.510> that
