want to import audio tracks i'll go
ahead<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> say<00:00:49.800> no<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:52.530> makes<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.980> little

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
ahead and say no and it makes a little

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.450 
ahead and say no and it makes a little
bend<00:00:53.460> right<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> same<00:00:54.780> name<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
bend right here with the same name and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.860 
bend right here with the same name and
so<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> open<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.539> imported

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
so when you open it up you have imported

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.049 
so when you open it up you have imported
footage<00:00:58.350> which<00:00:58.590> links<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.609> your

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
footage which links all to your your

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.969 
footage which links all to your your
original<00:01:00.570> footage<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.309> well<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:03.979> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
original footage as well as your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.039 
original footage as well as your
sequence<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.700> edit<00:01:06.119> skatepark<00:01:06.510> left<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
sequence for edit skatepark left and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.100 
sequence for edit skatepark left and
your<00:01:07.200> sequence<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.820> well<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.869> your

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
your sequence for right as well as your

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
your sequence for right as well as your
stereo<00:01:10.470> sequence<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.220> reason<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> does

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
stereo sequence and the reason it does

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.109 
stereo sequence and the reason it does
this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.549> these<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.580> sequences

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this is because the these two sequences

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.289 
this is because the these two sequences
are<00:01:15.509> nested<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.229> our<00:01:16.350> stereo<00:01:16.770> sequence

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
are nested in our stereo sequence

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.429 
are nested in our stereo sequence
basically<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> treat<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.049> like

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
basically we can treat these like

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
basically we can treat these like
footage<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.790> they're<00:01:21.119> perfectly

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
footage because they're perfectly

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.289 
footage because they're perfectly
aligned<00:01:21.900> there<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:22.950> minute<00:01:23.159> 27<00:01:23.640> frames<00:01:24.030> each

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
aligned there one minute 27 frames each

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.620 
aligned there one minute 27 frames each
and<00:01:25.189> we<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.430> treat<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:26.850> footage<00:01:27.360> just

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and we just treat them like footage just

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
and we just treat them like footage just
drop<00:01:27.990> them<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> right<00:01:29.030> drop<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
drop them on the right drop it on the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.920 
drop them on the right drop it on the
left<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.299> bring<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> our

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
left and so we can bring it up in our

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.100 
left and so we can bring it up in our
edit<00:01:34.259> 3d<00:01:34.680> comp<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:36.619> everything<00:01:37.619> should<00:01:37.860> be

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
edit 3d comp and everything should be

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
edit 3d comp and everything should be
synced<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.009> sure<00:01:41.159> looks<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
synced up and it sure looks like it is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.980 
synced up and it sure looks like it is
so<00:01:42.229> that's<00:01:43.229> great<00:01:44.540> but<00:01:45.540> here's<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.810> problem

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
so that's great but here's the problem

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.620 
so that's great but here's the problem
we<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.590> multiple<00:01:47.009> clips<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.420> want

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
we have multiple clips and we don't want

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.490 
we have multiple clips and we don't want
to<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.810> through<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:50.060> for<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.869> next<00:01:52.259> shot

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
to go through and look for the next shot

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
to go through and look for the next shot
especially<00:01:52.890> after<00:01:53.310> effects<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.880> would<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
especially after effects that would be a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240 
especially after effects that would be a
pain<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.259> i'm<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.590> another<00:01:55.860> script

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
called PT layer markers and PT layer

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.540 
called PT layer markers and PT layer
markers<00:02:09.319> does<00:02:10.319> some<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.739> cool<00:02:10.979> stuff<00:02:11.039> with

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
markers does some really cool stuff with

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.150 
markers does some really cool stuff with
with<00:02:12.030> markers<00:02:12.569> obvious

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
with markers obvious

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.940 
with markers obvious
in<00:02:13.490> after<00:02:14.390> effects<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.440> we're<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.800> use

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
in after effects so we're going to use

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.870 
in after effects so we're going to use
this<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.160> add<00:02:16.430> markers<00:02:16.970> at<00:02:17.390> every<00:02:17.900> cut<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
this to add markers at every cut in the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.430 
this to add markers at every cut in the
sequence<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:20.810> don't<00:02:20.900> have<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.140> go<00:02:21.260> through

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
sequence so we don't have to go through

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.860 
sequence so we don't have to go through
and<00:02:21.680> find<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.100> cuts<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.420> what<00:02:23.690> I'm<00:02:23.780> going

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and find the cuts and so what I'm going

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.630 
and find the cuts and so what I'm going
to<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:27.550> double<00:02:28.550> click<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.910> my<00:02:29.900> edit

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
to do is just double click on my edit

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.110 
to do is just double click on my edit

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
up all of my Clips here I'm going to go

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.870 
up all of my Clips here I'm going to go
to<00:02:37.910> file<00:02:38.300> scripts<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.380> I'm<00:02:39.920> going<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:40.400> PT

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880

to file scripts and I'm going to get PT
layer<00:02:41.090> markers<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:44.150> brings<00:02:44.330> up<00:02:44.510> this

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
layer markers and it brings up this

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.770 
layer markers and it brings up this
nifty<00:02:44.840> little<00:02:44.990> box<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:47.210> gives<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.570> few

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
nifty little box and it gives you a few

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.600 
nifty little box and it gives you a few
options<00:02:47.960> there's<00:02:48.440> add<00:02:48.620> markers<00:02:48.890> at<00:02:49.160> cuts<00:02:49.370> or

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
options there's add markers at cuts or

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.160 
options there's add markers at cuts or
split<00:02:49.940> layers<00:02:50.120> at<00:02:50.330> markers<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> we're<00:02:51.050> going

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
split layers at markers and we're going

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.980 
split layers at markers and we're going
to<00:02:51.230> add<00:02:51.380> Marcos<00:02:52.280> at<00:02:52.550> cuts<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:53.870> we're

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
to add Marcos at cuts so then we're

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.540 
to add Marcos at cuts so then we're
going<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.140> select<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.920> out<00:02:55.040> points

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
going to select in and out points

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.550 
going to select in and out points
because<00:02:55.910> we<00:02:56.030> want<00:02:56.270> a<00:02:56.450> marker<00:02:56.930> both<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
because we want a marker both at the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.470 
because we want a marker both at the
beginning<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.340> end<00:02:58.520> of<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.880> clip<00:02:59.210> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
beginning and the end of a clip and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.630 
beginning and the end of a clip and
we're<00:03:00.470> going<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.650> say<00:03:00.860> add<00:03:01.070> two<00:03:01.220> new<00:03:01.340> solid

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
we're going to say add two new solid

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.050 
we're going to say add two new solid
layer<00:03:01.940> that's<00:03:02.210> fine<00:03:02.510> hit<00:03:02.750> apply<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:04.820> makes

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
layer that's fine hit apply and it makes

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.880 
layer that's fine hit apply and it makes
this<00:03:05.270> nifty<00:03:05.540> solid<00:03:06.170> with<00:03:06.320> all<00:03:06.500> these<00:03:06.710> little

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
this nifty solid with all these little

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.310 
this nifty solid with all these little
markers<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.510> what's<00:03:08.720> cool<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.080> i<00:03:09.170> can

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
markers on it so what's cool is i can

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.200 
markers on it so what's cool is i can
grab<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.130> I'll<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:11.380> I'll<00:03:12.380> just<00:03:13.030> cut<00:03:14.030> it

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
grab this and I'll just I'll just cut it

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.120 
grab this and I'll just I'll just cut it
from<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.020> sequence<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.680> I'm<00:03:15.800> just<00:03:15.950> going<00:03:16.040> to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
from the sequence and I'm just going to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.570 
from the sequence and I'm just going to
put<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.490> in<00:03:16.520> my<00:03:16.940> edit<00:03:17.720> 3d<00:03:18.110> sequence<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.770> this

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
put it in my edit 3d sequence and this

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.000 
put it in my edit 3d sequence and this
is<00:03:19.730> great<00:03:19.850> because<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.240> don't<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:21.010> go

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
is great because I don't have to go

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.710 
is great because I don't have to go
through<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.490> find<00:03:22.580> all<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.240> little<00:03:23.480> cuts

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
through and find all the little cuts

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.510 
through and find all the little cuts
here<00:03:24.110> by<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.800> looking<00:03:25.070> for<00:03:25.220> different

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
here by just looking for different

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.640 
here by just looking for different
frames<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:26.090> already<00:03:26.390> found<00:03:26.540> them<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:26.990> me<00:03:27.110> what

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
frames it already found them for me what

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.070 
frames it already found them for me what
I<00:03:27.680> can<00:03:27.950> do<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.700> can<00:03:28.730> go<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.060> my<00:03:29.540> geometry

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
I can do is I can go to my geometry

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.360 
I can do is I can go to my geometry
control<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.490> can<00:03:31.760> start<00:03:32.660> editing<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.950> my

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
control and I can start editing for my

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.940 
control and I can start editing for my
convergence<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.300> my<00:03:35.540> disparities<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.440> so

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
convergence and my disparities and so

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.220 
convergence and my disparities and so
for<00:03:37.190> each<00:03:37.220> clip<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.910> can<00:03:37.940> adjust<00:03:38.930> my

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
for each clip I can adjust my

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.800 
for each clip I can adjust my
convergence<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.730> maybe<00:03:43.940> I'll<00:03:44.120> converge<00:03:44.510> on

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
convergence and maybe I'll converge on

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.339 
convergence and maybe I'll converge on
these<00:03:45.620> steps<00:03:45.950> here

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.339 

just<00:03:54.349> like<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:55.599> so<00:03:56.599> i<00:03:56.629> can<00:03:56.810> adjust<00:03:57.110> this<00:03:57.290> for

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
just like that so i can adjust this for

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.410 
just like that so i can adjust this for
convergence<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.340> i<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.750> go<00:03:59.900> through<00:04:00.230> and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
convergence and i can go through and

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.660 
convergence and i can go through and
preview<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:05.110> 3d<00:04:06.110> effect<00:04:06.140> using<00:04:07.099> my<00:04:07.430> Anna

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
preview the 3d effect using my Anna

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.530 
preview the 3d effect using my Anna
cliff<00:04:07.909> glasses<00:04:08.590> that's<00:04:09.590> not<00:04:09.769> too<00:04:09.980> bad<00:04:10.540> so

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
cliff glasses that's not too bad so

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.569 
cliff glasses that's not too bad so
after<00:04:11.689> I<00:04:11.870> get<00:04:12.079> my<00:04:12.260> alignment<00:04:12.620> how<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:12.950> want<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.370> I

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
after I get my alignment how I want it I

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.050 
after I get my alignment how I want it I
go<00:04:14.120> ahead<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.359> just<00:04:14.870> keyframe<00:04:15.729> where<00:04:16.729> it<00:04:16.880> is

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
go ahead and just keyframe where it is

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.330 
go ahead and just keyframe where it is
so<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:17.959> just<00:04:18.109> going<00:04:18.259> to<00:04:18.320> hit<00:04:18.470> k<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.769> go<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.160> the

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
so I'm just going to hit k to go to the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.290 
so I'm just going to hit k to go to the
end<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.699> clip<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.769> I'm<00:04:21.769> going<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:21.979> hit<00:04:22.300> you

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
end of the clip and I'm going to hit you

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.230 
end of the clip and I'm going to hit you
on<00:04:23.600> my<00:04:23.630> geometry<00:04:23.900> control<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.030> I'm<00:04:26.030> just

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
on my geometry control and I'm just

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.460 
on my geometry control and I'm just
going<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:26.419> set<00:04:27.229> my<00:04:27.260> key<00:04:27.530> frames<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.990> go<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.050> the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
going to set my key frames and go to the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.330 
going to set my key frames and go to the
next<00:04:31.060> frame<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.930> is<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.199> brand<00:04:33.560> new<00:04:33.680> clip<00:04:34.130> and

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
next frame this is a brand new clip and

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.879 
next frame this is a brand new clip and
so<00:04:37.340> we'll<00:04:37.490> set<00:04:37.699> it<00:04:37.729> to<00:04:37.910> however<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.360> want<00:04:38.889> and

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
so we'll set it to however I want and

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.080 
so we'll set it to however I want and
this<00:04:40.630> looks<00:04:41.630> like<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:41.930> will<00:04:41.990> probably<00:04:42.260> be<00:04:42.440> okay

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
this looks like it will probably be okay

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.250 
this looks like it will probably be okay
I'm<00:04:44.090> actually<00:04:44.240> going<00:04:44.479> to<00:04:44.570> bring<00:04:44.720> this<00:04:44.870> up<00:04:45.050> a

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
I'm actually going to bring this up a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.620 
I'm actually going to bring this up a
little<00:04:45.380> bit<00:04:45.650> here<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:49.039> I'm<00:04:50.000> going<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.180> hit<00:04:50.330> k

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
little bit here and I'm going to hit k

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.710 
little bit here and I'm going to hit k
to<00:04:50.690> go<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.139> next<00:04:51.349> marker<00:04:52.039> and<00:04:52.509> so<00:04:53.509> that's

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
to go to the next marker and so that's

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.860 
to go to the next marker and so that's
the<00:04:53.900> end<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.349> this<00:04:54.530> clip<00:04:55.270> hit<00:04:56.270> my<00:04:56.389> key<00:04:56.570> frames

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
the end of this clip hit my key frames

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.939 
the end of this clip hit my key frames
go<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.650> next<00:04:57.940> clip<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:02.800> do<00:05:03.800> my

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
go to the next clip and do my

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.830 
go to the next clip and do my
adjustments<00:05:04.639> that<00:05:04.849> but<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.180> looks<00:05:05.330> good<00:05:06.250> end

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
adjustments that but that looks good end

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.350 
adjustments that but that looks good end
of<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.900> clip<00:05:10.599> keyframe<00:05:11.599> next<00:05:12.380> clip<00:05:13.360> keyframe

end<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.039> clip<00:05:16.690> and<00:05:17.690> those<00:05:17.870> all<00:05:18.080> look<00:05:18.110> good

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
end of the clip and those all look good

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.140 
end of the clip and those all look good
because<00:05:18.710> they're<00:05:19.070> shot<00:05:19.340> with<00:05:19.639> just<00:05:19.880> about<00:05:20.000> the

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
because they're shot with just about the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.570 
because they're shot with just about the
same<00:05:20.300> setup<00:05:20.659> now<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.039> kind<00:05:22.430> of<00:05:22.520> a

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
same setup now this is a kind of a

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.620 
same setup now this is a kind of a
different<00:05:22.760> location<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.630> this<00:05:24.470> guy<00:05:24.710> is

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
different location and this guy is

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.520 
different location and this guy is
starting<00:05:26.630> here<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.080> then<00:05:27.199> he's<00:05:27.320> going<00:05:27.470> to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
starting here and then he's going to

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.439 
starting here and then he's going to
ride<00:05:27.740> his<00:05:27.919> bike<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.430> way<00:05:28.669> and<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.210> what<00:05:29.360> I'm

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
ride his bike that way and so what I'm

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.490 
ride his bike that way and so what I'm
going<00:05:29.539> to<00:05:29.599> do<00:05:29.750> is<00:05:29.870> actually<00:05:30.050> converge<00:05:30.470> a

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
going to do is actually converge a

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.129 
going to do is actually converge a
little<00:05:30.800> bit<00:05:30.919> closer<00:05:31.159> on<00:05:31.340> him<00:05:32.470> because<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:35.139> don't

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
little bit closer on him because I don't

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.110 
little bit closer on him because I don't
want<00:05:36.349> him<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.620> stick<00:05:36.860> out<00:05:37.039> of<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.550> screen<00:05:37.849> like

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
want him to stick out of the screen like

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.060 
want him to stick out of the screen like
an<00:05:38.270> insane<00:05:38.599> person<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:40.430> just<00:05:41.210> gonna<00:05:42.010> make<00:05:43.010> him

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
an insane person so just gonna make him

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.890 
an insane person so just gonna make him
look<00:05:43.639> a<00:05:43.760> little<00:05:43.880> better<00:05:44.090> I'm<00:05:44.360> gonna<00:05:44.510> double

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
look a little better I'm gonna double

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.550 
look a little better I'm gonna double
check<00:05:44.930> in<00:05:45.380> my<00:05:45.760> my<00:05:46.760> preview<00:05:47.240> here

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
check in my my preview here

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:59.129 
check in my my preview here
and<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.250> doesn't<00:05:49.460> look<00:05:49.610> too<00:05:49.820> bad<00:05:50.889> so

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:07.290 

we'll<00:05:59.710> go<00:05:59.889> to<00:05:59.949> the<00:06:00.159> end<00:06:01.020> of<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.199> clip<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:06.300> I'm

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
we'll go to the end of the clip and I'm

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.850 
we'll go to the end of the clip and I'm
going<00:06:07.449> to<00:06:07.509> adjust<00:06:07.749> my<00:06:07.960> convergence<00:06:08.560> there

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
going to adjust my convergence there

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.550 
going to adjust my convergence there
because<00:06:09.279> this<00:06:09.490> is<00:06:09.699> this<00:06:10.509> is<00:06:10.659> animating<00:06:11.409> and

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
because this is this is animating and

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.869 
because this is this is animating and
maybe<00:06:12.249> I'll<00:06:12.400> push<00:06:12.610> my<00:06:12.789> convergence<00:06:13.330> away<00:06:14.879> just

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
maybe I'll push my convergence away just

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.670 
maybe I'll push my convergence away just
so<00:06:16.060> we<00:06:16.270> can<00:06:16.419> focus<00:06:16.629> on<00:06:16.990> him<00:06:17.199> just<00:06:17.469> a<00:06:17.650> little

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
so we can focus on him just a little

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.499 
so we can focus on him just a little
better<00:06:19.289> and<00:06:20.289> so<00:06:20.680> now<00:06:20.909> that<00:06:21.909> should<00:06:22.120> animate

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
better and so now that should animate

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.029 
better and so now that should animate
through<00:06:22.900> that<00:06:23.080> clip<00:06:23.529> and<00:06:25.409> and<00:06:26.409> look<00:06:26.770> pretty

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
through that clip and and look pretty

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.339 
through that clip and and look pretty
good<00:06:27.129> and<00:06:27.550> I<00:06:27.999> can<00:06:28.180> also<00:06:28.300> add<00:06:28.629> keyframes<00:06:29.110> in<00:06:29.229> the

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
good and I can also add keyframes in the

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.820 
good and I can also add keyframes in the
middle<00:06:29.590> of<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:29.710> clip<00:06:30.419> but<00:06:31.419> this<00:06:31.569> is<00:06:31.840> to<00:06:32.139> make

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
middle of the clip but this is to make

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.320 
middle of the clip but this is to make
sure<00:06:32.889> you<00:06:33.159> have<00:06:33.340> a<00:06:33.370> different<00:06:33.759> set<00:06:33.939> up<00:06:34.060> reach

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
sure you have a different set up reach

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.080 
sure you have a different set up reach
shot<00:06:35.580> so<00:06:36.580> I<00:06:37.469> can<00:06:38.469> go<00:06:38.620> to<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.949> next<00:06:38.979> marker<00:06:39.580> next

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
shot so I can go to the next marker next

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.269 
shot so I can go to the next marker next
clip<00:06:40.360> and<00:06:41.729> so<00:06:42.729> on<00:06:42.939> and<00:06:43.379> at<00:06:44.379> the<00:06:44.500> end<00:06:44.650> you<00:06:45.039> will

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
clip and so on and at the end you will

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:49.080 
clip and so on and at the end you will
be<00:06:45.430> rendering<00:06:45.819> a<00:06:46.060> side<00:06:46.300> by<00:06:46.479> side<00:06:46.750> of<00:06:48.090> your

be rendering a side by side of your

be rendering a side by side of your
whole<00:06:49.389> sequence<00:06:49.860> which<00:06:50.860> will<00:06:51.039> be<00:06:51.189> updated

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
whole sequence which will be updated

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.399
