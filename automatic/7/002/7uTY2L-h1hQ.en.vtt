the<00:05:11.830> beginning<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.970> vocals<00:05:16.449> can<00:05:16.840> be<00:05:17.020> from<00:05:17.800> Ray

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
the beginning the vocals can be from Ray

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.460 
the beginning the vocals can be from Ray
Davies<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.970> think<00:05:19.180> Ray<00:05:19.569> Davies<00:05:19.930> is<00:05:20.259> the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
Davies I think Ray Davies is the

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.760 
Davies I think Ray Davies is the
vocalist<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.720> Dave<00:05:22.720> Davies<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.440> guitars

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
vocalist and Dave Davies is the guitars

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.700 
vocalist and Dave Davies is the guitars
so<00:05:24.520> ray<00:05:24.699> davies<00:05:25.180> kingham<00:05:25.900> his<00:05:26.199> voice<00:05:26.440> is

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
so ray davies kingham his voice is

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.409 
so ray davies kingham his voice is
usually<00:05:27.430> very<00:05:27.460> high<00:05:27.789> pitch<00:05:28.030> but<00:05:28.240> in<00:05:28.300> this

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
usually very high pitch but in this

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.180 
usually very high pitch but in this
album<00:05:28.599> he<00:05:28.840> takes<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.289> usually<00:05:29.740> an<00:05:29.830> octave

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
album he takes it usually an octave

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.490 
album he takes it usually an octave
lower<00:05:30.220> invasive<00:05:30.820> its<00:05:31.599> voice<00:05:31.810> is<00:05:32.020> very<00:05:32.080> deep

what<00:06:37.870> I<00:06:37.900> mean<00:06:38.110> is<00:06:38.289> it's<00:06:38.530> but<00:06:39.310> if<00:06:39.550> there<00:06:39.789> was<00:06:39.880> a

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
what I mean is it's but if there was a

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.370 
what I mean is it's but if there was a
track<00:06:40.240> that<00:06:40.270> I<00:06:40.509> would<00:06:40.750> take<00:06:40.780> away<00:06:41.110> from<00:06:41.229> the

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380

track that I would take away from the
album<00:06:41.530> it<00:06:41.770> would<00:06:41.889> be<00:06:42.009> that<00:06:43.830> and<00:06:44.830> so<00:06:45.550> yeah<00:06:45.759> it's

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
album it would be that and so yeah it's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.090 
album it would be that and so yeah it's
a<00:06:46.060> very<00:06:46.240> group<00:06:46.660> kind<00:06:47.410> of<00:06:47.470> once<00:06:47.620> I<00:06:47.740> group<00:06:47.979> you
