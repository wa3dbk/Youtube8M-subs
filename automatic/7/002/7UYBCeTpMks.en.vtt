deck so that's what we're going to be

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.800 
deck so that's what we're going to be
playing<00:00:18.810> now<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.800> thing<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.039> look<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.810> the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.319 
these cards that we don't want and my
style<00:01:02.309> might<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.910> different<00:01:03.090> than

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
style might be a little different than

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.420 
style might be a little different than
yours<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.809> okay<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.890> I'll<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.340> ahead

and keep those although they're not

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.510 
and keep those although they're not
worth<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> ton<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.140> points<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.430> can

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
worth a ton of points and I think we can

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.289 
worth a ton of points and I think we can
still<00:01:11.790> win<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:13.790> now<00:01:14.790> since<00:01:15.030> he<00:01:15.180> has<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
still win with that now since he has the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.570 
still win with that now since he has the
monster<00:01:15.810> deck<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.619> means<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.040> after<00:01:17.159> every

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
monster deck that means that after every

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.020 
monster deck that means that after every
round

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
round

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.179

he leaves a card on the table which is

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.670 
he leaves a card on the table which is
normally<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> front<00:01:20.909> line<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.530> make

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
normally the front line so if we do make

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
normally the front line so if we do make
it<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> round<00:01:23.100> 3<00:01:23.189> make<00:01:23.820> sure<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.090> you're<00:01:24.240> not

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
out of cards because he is going to keep

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.609 
out of cards because he is going to keep
a<00:01:27.509> card<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.869> there<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> table

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
don't need to we just need to use it

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.890 
don't need to we just need to use it
right<00:03:47.980> before<00:03:48.280> we<00:03:48.400> use<00:03:48.550> our<00:03:48.820> bitter<00:03:49.510> frost

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
right before we use our bitter frost

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.750 
right before we use our bitter frost
card<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:53.830> should<00:03:54.040> have<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.220> lot<00:03:54.430> more<00:03:54.610> of

last time

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.210 
last time
then<00:04:01.480> my<00:04:01.810> Rangers<00:04:02.650> wouldn't<00:04:02.860> have<00:04:02.950> been<00:04:03.040> worth

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
then my Rangers wouldn't have been worth

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:13.220 
then my Rangers wouldn't have been worth
any<00:04:03.400> points

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.649 

there<00:04:14.159> we<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:14.400> he<00:04:14.730> almost<00:04:14.879> always<00:04:15.090> has<00:04:15.450> this

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
there we go he almost always has this

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.039 
there we go he almost always has this
card<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:15.959> doubles<00:04:16.410> his<00:04:16.590> points<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:21.049> I'm

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
card that doubles his points and I'm

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.330 
card that doubles his points and I'm
even<00:04:22.320> far<00:04:22.530> enough<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.889> game<00:04:23.130> where<00:04:23.310> I

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
even far enough in the game where I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.610 
even far enough in the game where I
could<00:04:23.699> use<00:04:23.880> my<00:04:24.120> weather<00:04:24.630> cards<00:04:25.050> but<00:04:25.350> I'm<00:04:25.470> going

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
could use my weather cards but I'm going

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.980
