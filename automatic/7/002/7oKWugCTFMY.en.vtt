one alright the first exercise up here

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
one alright the first exercise up here
is<00:00:48.270> pretty<00:00:48.510> easy<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> great<00:00:49.470> way<00:00:49.650> for<00:00:49.680> us

is pretty easy it's a great way for us
to<00:00:50.310> get<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.239> additional<00:00:51.630> weight<00:00:51.810> it's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
to get a little additional weight it's

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
to get a little additional weight it's
just<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.320> standard<00:00:52.770> weighted<00:00:53.460> crunch<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
just a standard weighted crunch but the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.400 
just a standard weighted crunch but the
way<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> hold<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> dumbbell<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> way<00:00:55.380> I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
way I hold the dumbbell in the way I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.160 
way I hold the dumbbell in the way I
perform<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> exercise<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.239> key<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:58.020> what

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
perform the exercise is the key do what

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
perform the exercise is the key do what
we<00:00:58.260> call<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> levitation<00:00:59.220> crunch<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.180> try<00:01:00.360> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
we call a levitation crunch you try to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.910 
we call a levitation crunch you try to
levitate<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.140> push<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.530> shoulders

straight<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> ceiling<00:01:03.210> push<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
straight up into the ceiling push that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
straight up into the ceiling push that
dumbbell<00:01:04.470> straight<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.159> into<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> ceiling

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
dumbbell straight up into the ceiling

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
dumbbell straight up into the ceiling
you<00:01:06.659> don't<00:01:06.899> want<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.109> start<00:01:07.259> pushing<00:01:07.499> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you don't want to start pushing the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.499 
you don't want to start pushing the
dumbbell<00:01:08.069> forward<00:01:08.579> because<00:01:08.759> as<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.210> all

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
dumbbell forward because as you do all

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.849 
dumbbell forward because as you do all
you're<00:01:09.689> doing<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.079> making<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.499> exercise

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
you're doing is making the exercise

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.099 
you're doing is making the exercise
easier<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.850> way<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.149> dumbbell<00:01:12.719> is<00:01:12.840> actually

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
easier the way the dumbbell is actually

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.840 
easier the way the dumbbell is actually
creating<00:01:13.469> forward<00:01:13.859> momentum<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.729> up

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
creating forward momentum to get you up

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
creating forward momentum to get you up
off<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> ground<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.990> try<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.469> straight

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
off the ground if you try to go straight

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679

up<00:01:16.859> remember<00:01:17.609> guys<00:01:17.759> our<00:01:17.969> physics<00:01:18.389> you're

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
up remember guys our physics you're

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.999 
up remember guys our physics you're
pushing<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.079> dumbbell<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.740> against

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
pushing that dumbbell right up against

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
pushing that dumbbell right up against
gravity<00:01:20.429> that's<00:01:20.880> supposed<00:01:21.149> to<00:01:21.179> be<00:01:21.359> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
gravity that's supposed to be the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.940 
gravity that's supposed to be the
toughest<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.319> that's<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.590> gonna<00:01:22.679> be<00:01:22.770> most

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
toughest and that's just gonna be most

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
toughest and that's just gonna be most
productive<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.639> the<00:01:24.329> next<00:01:24.450> exercise

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
here we have is our leg raise starting

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.459 
here we have is our leg raise starting
from<00:01:27.240> below<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.990> you'll<00:01:28.170> see<00:01:28.350> the

from below but you'll see the

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.099 
from below but you'll see the
positioning<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.249> I<00:01:29.670> established<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.359> bit

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
positioning that I established is a bit

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.469 
positioning that I established is a bit
of<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> rotated<00:01:31.829> position<00:01:31.859> free<00:01:32.429> rotate<00:01:32.819> I<00:01:33.090> have

of a rotated position free rotate I have
my<00:01:33.630> dumbbell<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.770> create<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.159> bit

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
my dumbbell here to create a little bit

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.160 
my dumbbell here to create a little bit
of<00:01:35.520> added<00:01:35.700> resistance<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.389> pull<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
of added resistance to pull me in the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.809 
of added resistance to pull me in the
direction<00:01:37.590> opposite<00:01:38.069> that<00:01:38.219> my<00:01:38.310> legs<00:01:38.520> want<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
direction opposite that my legs want to

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.760 
direction opposite that my legs want to
take<00:01:38.969> me<00:01:39.149> this<00:01:39.779> right<00:01:40.109> away<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.709> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
take me this right away is going to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.230 
take me this right away is going to
increase<00:01:41.069> the<00:01:41.340> activation<00:01:41.639> of<00:01:41.939> our<00:01:42.029> ABS

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
increase the activation of our ABS

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
increase the activation of our ABS
because<00:01:42.569> we<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.079> they<00:01:43.259> control<00:01:43.649> rotation<00:01:44.069> at

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
because we know they control rotation at

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
because we know they control rotation at
the<00:01:44.429> same<00:01:44.969> time<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.599> to<00:01:45.659> involve<00:01:45.929> our

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the same time it's going to involve our

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
the same time it's going to involve our
obliques<00:01:46.499> so<00:01:46.709> we've<00:01:47.069> got<00:01:47.249> an<00:01:47.399> opportunity<00:01:47.700> as

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
obliques so we've got an opportunity as

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.989 
obliques so we've got an opportunity as
I<00:01:48.569> press<00:01:48.869> both<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.709> leg<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.520> dumbbell<00:01:50.819> up

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
I press both the leg and the dumbbell up

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.019 
I press both the leg and the dumbbell up
together<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.899> work<00:01:52.170> both<00:01:52.859> from<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.579> top<00:01:53.759> down

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:54.029 
together to work both from the top down

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:55.470 
together to work both from the top down
and<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.479> bottom<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.229> in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
and the bottom up but in

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.850 
and the bottom up but in
who<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.720> all-important<00:01:56.290> rotation<00:01:56.710> and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
who the all-important rotation and

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.370 
who the all-important rotation and
obliques<00:01:57.160> in<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.370> exercise<00:01:57.900> okay<00:01:58.900> next<00:01:59.140> we

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
obliques in the exercise okay next we

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.750 
obliques in the exercise okay next we
can<00:01:59.530> take<00:01:59.560> this<00:01:59.890> dumbbell<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.520> we<00:02:00.610> can

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
can take this dumbbell and we can

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.940 
can take this dumbbell and we can
actually<00:02:01.180> do<00:02:01.360> one<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.750> my<00:02:01.840> favorite<00:02:01.950> exercise

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
actually do one of my favorite exercise

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.100 
actually do one of my favorite exercise
and<00:02:03.280> that's<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.610> AB<00:02:03.760> wheel<00:02:04.090> roll<00:02:04.330> out<00:02:04.540> minus

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
and that's the AB wheel roll out minus

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.810 
and that's the AB wheel roll out minus
the<00:02:05.260> AB<00:02:05.380> wheel<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:06.070> see<00:02:06.220> if<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.370> take<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
the AB wheel you see if you take the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.850 
the AB wheel you see if you take the
dumbbell<00:02:07.240> B<00:02:07.630> position<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.290> like<00:02:08.320> an<00:02:08.530> AB<00:02:08.650> wheel

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
dumbbell B position it like an AB wheel

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.100 
dumbbell B position it like an AB wheel
all<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.700> matters<00:02:10.150> now<00:02:10.180> is<00:02:10.540> if<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.750> get<00:02:10.960> your

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
all that matters now is if you get your

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.930 
all that matters now is if you get your
grip<00:02:11.410> pressure<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.070> way<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.310> hold<00:02:12.730> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
grip pressure in the way you hold the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.670 
grip pressure in the way you hold the
dumbbell<00:02:13.300> correct<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.020> that's<00:02:14.410> going<00:02:14.590> to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
dumbbell correct and that's going to

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.620 
dumbbell correct and that's going to
allow<00:02:14.860> us<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.040> do<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.400> great<00:02:15.640> exercise<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.510> as

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
allow us to do this great exercise so as

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.750 
allow us to do this great exercise so as
you<00:02:16.720> see<00:02:16.930> me<00:02:17.080> demonstrate<00:02:17.770> here<00:02:18.100> all<00:02:18.430> I'm

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you see me demonstrate here all I'm

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.130 
you see me demonstrate here all I'm
doing<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:19.240> changing<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.900> pressure

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
doing is really changing the pressure

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.810 
doing is really changing the pressure
that<00:02:20.440> I'm<00:02:20.530> applying<00:02:20.740> through<00:02:21.400> my<00:02:21.520> four

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
that I'm applying through my four

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.300 
that I'm applying through my four
fingers<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.480> through<00:02:22.900> my<00:02:23.050> thumb<00:02:23.290> as<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.980> roll

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
fingers and through my thumb as I roll

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.490 
fingers and through my thumb as I roll
out<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.790> want<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> take<00:02:25.300> all<00:02:25.570> four<00:02:25.870> fingers<00:02:26.110> off

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
out I want to take all four fingers off

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.890 
out I want to take all four fingers off
and<00:02:26.950> literally<00:02:27.190> push<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.760> dumbbell<00:02:28.570> away

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and literally push the dumbbell away

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.070 
and literally push the dumbbell away
from<00:02:29.200> me<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.640> my<00:02:30.850> thumb<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.720> allows

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
from me with just my thumb that allows

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.140 
from me with just my thumb that allows
the<00:02:32.290> dumbbell<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.650> spin<00:02:33.160> inside<00:02:33.520> my<00:02:33.700> hand<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the dumbbell to spin inside my hand and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.820 
the dumbbell to spin inside my hand and
not<00:02:34.240> get<00:02:34.450> slowed<00:02:34.720> down<00:02:34.750> or<00:02:35.170> dragged<00:02:35.620> down<00:02:35.800> by

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
not get slowed down or dragged down by

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.220 
not get slowed down or dragged down by
friction<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:36.880> as<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.150> come<00:02:37.420> back<00:02:37.690> what<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.020> want

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
friction but as I come back what I want

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.990 
friction but as I come back what I want
to<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:38.800> grasp<00:02:39.430> with<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> four

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
to do is then grasp with the four

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.910 
to do is then grasp with the four
fingers<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:40.960> release<00:02:41.290> my<00:02:41.470> thumb<00:02:41.740> from

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
fingers and then release my thumb from

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.890 
fingers and then release my thumb from
the<00:02:41.980> backside<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.030> now<00:02:43.240> I'm<00:02:43.600> able<00:02:43.750> to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
the backside so that now I'm able to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.810 
the backside so that now I'm able to
actually<00:02:44.350> roll<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> dumbbell<00:02:44.980> back<00:02:45.130> if<00:02:45.400> you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
actually roll the dumbbell back if you

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.310 
actually roll the dumbbell back if you
grip<00:02:46.030> too<00:02:46.210> hard<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.600> both<00:02:46.720> directions<00:02:47.050> you're

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
grip too hard in both directions you're

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.750 
grip too hard in both directions you're
going<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.500> wind<00:02:47.710> up<00:02:47.890> not<00:02:48.310> allowing<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
going to wind up not allowing the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.040 
going to wind up not allowing the
dumbbell<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.090> spin<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.630> it's<00:02:49.720> going<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> feel

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
dumbbell to spin or it's going to feel

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.930 
dumbbell to spin or it's going to feel
like<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:50.380> rough<00:02:50.650> in<00:02:50.770> your<00:02:50.890> hands<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.640> do<00:02:51.820> this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
like it's rough in your hands to do this

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.340

we<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.480> still<00:03:01.630> take<00:03:01.990> advantage<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.770> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
we can still take advantage of the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.490 
we can still take advantage of the
rolling<00:03:03.730> situation<00:03:04.360> here<00:03:04.630> by<00:03:05.080> turning<00:03:05.440> our

body around and now positioning the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.970 
body around and now positioning the
dumbbell<00:03:07.270> under<00:03:07.660> our<00:03:07.690> feet<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.560> here<00:03:08.830> I'm

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
dumbbell under our feet so here I'm

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.430 
dumbbell under our feet so here I'm
doing<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.430> sprinter<00:03:10.180> tuck<00:03:10.480> variation<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.320> I

doing a sprinter tuck variation of it I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.260 
doing a sprinter tuck variation of it I
look<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.860> sprinter<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.520> leg<00:03:12.700> back<00:03:12.970> one

look like a sprinter one leg back one
leg<00:03:13.480> up<00:03:13.720> right<00:03:14.530> we're<00:03:14.739> mimicking<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
leg up right we're mimicking the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.190 
leg up right we're mimicking the
athletic<00:03:16.209> movement<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.660> sprint<00:03:16.959> what<00:03:17.080> we're

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
athletic movement of a sprint what we're

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.420 
athletic movement of a sprint what we're
doing<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.590> here<00:03:17.709> with<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.890> dumbbell<00:03:18.070> we're

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
doing in here with a dumbbell we're

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.340 
doing in here with a dumbbell we're
driving<00:03:18.970> forward<00:03:19.330> with<00:03:19.480> one<00:03:19.690> knee<00:03:19.900> we're

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
driving forward with one knee we're

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.990 
driving forward with one knee we're
driving<00:03:20.739> backwards<00:03:21.190> with<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.400> opposite<00:03:21.820> one

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
driving backwards with the opposite one

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.610 
driving backwards with the opposite one
now<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.540> great<00:03:22.840> thing<00:03:23.050> about<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.440> exercise

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
now the great thing about this exercise

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.100 
now the great thing about this exercise
is<00:03:23.950> again<00:03:24.489> it's<00:03:24.670> another<00:03:24.880> lower<00:03:25.180> ab<00:03:25.450> targeted

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
is again it's another lower ab targeted

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.900 
is again it's another lower ab targeted
movement<00:03:26.410> because<00:03:26.680> we're<00:03:26.860> working<00:03:27.250> on<00:03:27.370> bottom

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
movement because we're working on bottom

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.820 
movement because we're working on bottom
and<00:03:28.270> we<00:03:28.720> can<00:03:28.870> even<00:03:29.020> get<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.320> little<00:03:29.620> bit<00:03:29.739> of

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
and we can even get a little bit of

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.470 
and we can even get a little bit of
bottom-up<00:03:30.250> stability<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.270> have<00:03:31.390> to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
bottom-up stability because you have to

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.940 
bottom-up stability because you have to
balance<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.080> positioning<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:32.739> dumbbell

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
balance the positioning of this dumbbell

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.250 
balance the positioning of this dumbbell
under<00:03:33.250> my<00:03:33.370> foot<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:34.270> might<00:03:34.450> find<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:34.959> rolls

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
under my foot you might find that rolls

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.800 
under my foot you might find that rolls
away<00:03:35.440> from<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.890> again<00:03:36.420> manage<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.540> pressure

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
away from you again manage the pressure

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.360 
away from you again manage the pressure
in<00:03:38.050> your<00:03:38.170> foot<00:03:38.440> become<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> little<00:03:39.130> bit<00:03:39.310> more

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
in your foot become a little bit more

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.190 
in your foot become a little bit more
coordinated<00:03:40.300> athletic<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:40.989> another

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
coordinated athletic it's another

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.940 
coordinated athletic it's another
