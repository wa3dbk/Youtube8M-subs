00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.920
 hello everyone today i would like to do 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.070
 small review and test for mic 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.220
 390 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.350
 I want to immediately say from my company 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.199
 I make this entry exactly from this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.240
 microphone in which mode I will tell 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.890
 a little bit later when we do 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.080
 tests a little bit briefly about the microphone is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.110
 budget microphone its price varies 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 within 50 hryvnia Ukraine and 200 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.850
 rubles in Russia is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 this microphone as you can see on 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.880
 a photo 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 a small stand on her leg height 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.850
 its about 25 centimeters mnozhko 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.040
 height adjustable on stand 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 there is an on / off button 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.670
 microphone and also soft cord found 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.480
 for greater reliability and flexibility 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.500
 go directly to 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.950
 characteristics 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.800
 so microphone specifications 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 sensitivity 58 dB plus or minus 2 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.330
 decibel a frequency range of 30 hertz 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.690
 up to 16 thousand hertz microphone s directed 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 and the length of the wire within two seconds 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.490
 half meters off the microphone with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.820
 using a three and a half plug 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 millimeter to your sound card 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 or motherboard who has sound 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.290
 The card has built-in characteristics like 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.000
 all go directly to the tests 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.050
 so let's do some tests like now 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.990
 we see it means we have a microphone level 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.520
 is at the maximum microphone gain 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 plus 10 decibels 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.159
 and improving cost echo cancellation means 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.460
 This is the mode in which I recorded 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.220
 video 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.190
 more precisely audio up to this point to the moment 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.530
 conducting tests let's do 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.950
 the following we will remove the echo suppression for 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.710
 start and see how the microphone is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.490
 sounding it will give out a few 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.490
 either effects 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.690
 Immediately on the graph we see enough 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:46.959
 high noise level is so fat 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:52.870
 stripe but voice without any 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:57.310
 effects more correctly more real 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:03.700
 let's say that something is transmitting the voice itself 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.819
 microphone more real your not someone's 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.099
 how is it that 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.499
 says one then a person cannot 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.800
 understand some kind of accident because you have 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:15.370
 so distorted that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.370
 you wo n't understand 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.079
 voice more real 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.299
 microphone gain I will not change 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:29.939
 especially from this big visa will not 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:33.810
 well, just try some improvements 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:38.099
 that is, in the first test we see that 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.290
 noise ratio is very high this is fat 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.030
 the floor. 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.360
 first put the permissible suppression 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.360
 noise 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:56.319
 the effect of noise reduction is immediately visible 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:02.739
 all the noise got a thin strip 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:09.030
 went here is clearly visible on the chart clean 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:12.129
 voice is recorded voice is two three 4 5 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.539
 clearly recorded voice noises we 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:20.289
 hardly observable but suppression 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.570
 noise and still want to say that my personal 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:27.509
 I think this effect is not very 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.070
 Liked it so much as the sound of your voice 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:34.120
 recorded with distortion with great 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.550
 distortion is transmitted not to hear clearly 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.270
 some kind of metal whether 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:45.960
 some floating shade my opinion 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:50.250
 it seemed somehow so let's take 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.250
 another echo cancellation effect 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.200
 again also see clearly rebuilt 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.530
 virtually no noise thin 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.860
 polosochka that is, we can increase 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:09.810
 here as if, in principle, well, no noise 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:15.510
 strangers are almost inaudible even 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:17.550
 at high volume, voice is recorded 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.000
 slightly better than noise reduction 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:25.980
 the effect of suppressing echo more remains 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.420
 correct let's say a human voice 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:35.040
 and the microphone transmits them in this while 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.750
 effect your voice is a little better with 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.430
 less sport distortion than 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:45.020
 noise reduction is my opinion on 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:48.120
 This I think with tests you can finish and 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.390
 at the end of my review I would like to say 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.580
 a few words about your impressions given 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.400
 microphone 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.580
 impression in principle is expected and beyond 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:04.460
 such a price we get ordinary 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.470
 simple microphone for chatting in skype and 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.170
 some 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:14.730
 unpretentious videoconferencing rounds 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:18.660
 podcast sprays if this microphone 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:23.360
 maybe connect good 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:26.430
 audio card given this test 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.700
 produced on an integrated audio card 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:34.720
 my motherboard therefore 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:38.610
 if maybe someone connected this 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.320
 microphone then made a good audio card 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.950
 I ask you to write in the comments 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.980
 it will be interesting and you read it here 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.050
 I think this review can be 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.150
 end 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.490
 I will be glad to see you on my channel 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:58.530
 there will be much more interesting 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:04.290
 personal video reviews subscribe 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.290
 Come all good bye bye
