00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the first one I'm going to start with is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.999 
the first one I'm going to start with is
Mary<00:01:53.549> Barton<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.649> much

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
Mary Barton I really don't know much

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.170 
Mary Barton I really don't know much
about<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
about it it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.210 
about it it
for<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.660> short<00:01:57.810> synopsis<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.920> sounds

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
for a very short synopsis and it sounds

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.440 
for a very short synopsis and it sounds
like<00:01:59.280> something<00:01:59.370> I<00:01:59.760> would<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.150> really

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
like something I would really really

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
like something I would really really
enjoy<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.290> since<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.770> don't<00:02:01.830> really<00:02:02.280> feel<00:02:02.610> like

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
enjoy and since I don't really feel like

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.060 
enjoy and since I don't really feel like
reading<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.200> ones<00:02:04.410> I've<00:02:04.650> already

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070

reading one of the ones I've already
watched<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.150> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.390> gonna<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.720> great

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
watched I think this is gonna be a great

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.170 
watched I think this is gonna be a great
one<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> start<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.650> number<00:02:08.040> five<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.729> Ernest

one to start with number five is Ernest

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.170 
one to start with number five is Ernest
Hemingway<00:02:10.050> now<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.259> know<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:11.070> he<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
Hemingway now I know that he is one of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.900 
Hemingway now I know that he is one of
the<00:02:12.450> most<00:02:12.660> famous<00:02:13.080> American<00:02:13.800> classic<00:02:14.730> authors

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
the most famous American classic authors

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.810 
the most famous American classic authors
and<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.600> probably<00:02:16.080> reason<00:02:16.560> enough<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
and that probably reason enough but the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.530 
and that probably reason enough but the
true<00:02:18.210> reason<00:02:18.870> why<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> want<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.520> read<00:02:20.760> Ernest

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.980 
true reason why I want to read Ernest
Hemingway<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.040> fell<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:24.060> love<00:02:24.090> with

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
Hemingway is because I fell in love with

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.680 
Hemingway is because I fell in love with
his<00:02:25.320> character<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.400> Woody<00:02:26.910> Allen's<00:02:27.330> film

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
read bad reviews about it so maybe it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.449 
read bad reviews about it so maybe it
was<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.050> bad<00:03:19.230> film<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:19.980> seventh
