00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.970
 today I want you to participate in a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.029
 example work process here you see a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.009
 framework I also did during one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:36.329
 demonstration and let's say this is here 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.430
 the first step is often the first step 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.840
 when he does then I do the demonstration 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.629
 arrives at this point and then unfortunately 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.280
 I can never finish 4 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.350
 so here in my studio several 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 paintings where only this politi base is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.859
 rho out as I define and today for 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 finish it which we see a basis for 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.560
 cyclamen and what I left the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.020
 functional vacuum of the vessel that of 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.580
 some leaves with a nice fusion on 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.939
 missing some full functional ones 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.100
 already the nearest flower in bloom e 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.000
 the most distant ones, therefore, even i 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.540
 Functional blanks this here of course 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 pull it out so I would look at it now 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 I said you have to finish it because it's not that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.930
 I can leave it and I was missing in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.520
 my palette this color that to blue 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.350
 of delft I finished it finished aragon e 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.799
 so before you start working 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.590
 because obviously I have to take it back with 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.360
 the same colors 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.860
 I opened a new wooden one because 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.350
 someone also asked me about mine 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.979
 favorite colors 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.290
 as it has a new color there 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:12.260
 I show you can read blue by 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:17.270
 delft covering very resistant to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.260
 light that are the 4 stars and penis between 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.790
 a little the card that is this triangle 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.640
 color and see it so from goode and it seems 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.690
 almost black no 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.330
 so now I'll show you to you from a 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.330
 idol a little if I spread it 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.890
 this has color 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:53.390
 It is a beautiful blue dark deep dark 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:59.500
 look wow and covering it obviously 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:02.750
 you can also dilute it becomes softer 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:09.070
 therefore beautifully nuanced 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:16.850
 or we can also do so 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:20.209
 a force is diluted intense and almost like 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.700
 the indigo just a little brighter here 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.230
 but as intensity I meant not how 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.209
 hue ok so I did them now 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.250
 first see the photo of this merger 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.890
 guided 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.709
 now I finish it I hope it comes well and 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:41.560
 then I add the photo of his father 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.560
 finished thanks for seeing you soon
