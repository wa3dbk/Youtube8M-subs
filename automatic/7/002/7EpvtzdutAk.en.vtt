active over the past week or so mainly

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.160 
active over the past week or so mainly
because<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> two<00:00:09.990> regions<00:00:10.440> region<00:00:10.889> 2268<00:00:11.759> and

low-level m-class flares they get active

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.250 
low-level m-class flares they get active
for<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.330> while<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.840> then<00:00:18.960> they<00:00:19.050> die

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
for a little while and then they die

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.320 
for a little while and then they die
back<00:00:19.500> down<00:00:19.710> then<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.369> get<00:00:20.520> active<00:00:20.910> again<00:00:21.000> for

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
back down then they get active again for

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
back down then they get active again for
another<00:00:21.420> couple<00:00:21.689> days<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.140> they<00:00:22.230> die<00:00:22.410> back

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
another couple days and they die back

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.890 
another couple days and they die back
down<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.369> refuse<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.850> go<00:00:24.119> away<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.480> we're

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
down but they refuse to go away so we're

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
down but they refuse to go away so we're
continuing<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> watch<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.460> also<00:00:26.670> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
continuing to watch them what also is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.759 
continuing to watch them what also is
interesting<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> east<00:00:27.810> limb<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> Sun

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
interesting is the east limb of the Sun

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
interesting is the east limb of the Sun
is<00:00:28.949> showing<00:00:29.279> some<00:00:29.460> serious<00:00:30.119> activity<00:00:30.720> some

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
is showing some serious activity some

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.380 
is showing some serious activity some
solar<00:00:32.040> storms<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.579> been<00:00:32.700> flying<00:00:32.969> off<00:00:33.210> we

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
solar storms have been flying off we

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.310 
solar storms have been flying off we
also<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.719> some<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.079> interesting

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
also have some very interesting

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
also have some very interesting
interesting<00:00:34.820> filaments<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.940> might<00:00:36.420> be

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
interesting filaments that might be

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
interesting filaments that might be
erupting<00:00:36.750> soon<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.620> also<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.190> southern

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
erupting soon we also have this southern

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.240 
erupting soon we also have this southern

did pick up on the 21st and 22nd only to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
did pick up on the 21st and 22nd only to
die<00:00:50.610> back<00:00:50.850> down<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> picked<00:00:52.050> up

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
die back down and then it picked up

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.889 
die back down and then it picked up
again<00:00:52.469> around<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> 26th<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> stayed<00:00:54.570> busy

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
again around the 26th and stayed busy

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.319 
again around the 26th and stayed busy
only<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> die<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.219> again<00:00:56.730> right<00:00:57.000> before<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
only to die down again right before the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
only to die down again right before the
beginning<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.750> februari<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> looks

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
beginning of februari and now it looks

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.709 
beginning of februari and now it looks
like<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.699> actually<00:00:59.730> might<00:01:00.149> begin<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> pick

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
like it actually might begin to pick

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.130 
like it actually might begin to pick
back<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:00.960> again<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.010> stay<00:01:02.219> tuned<00:01:03.110> switching<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
back up again so stay tuned switching to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
back up again so stay tuned switching to
our<00:01:04.320> storm<00:01:04.650> levels<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.430> haven't<00:01:05.700> seen

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
our storm levels we really haven't seen

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.670 
our storm levels we really haven't seen
much<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.390> way<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.510> solar<00:01:06.840> storms<00:01:07.260> other

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
much in the way of solar storms other

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
much in the way of solar storms other
than<00:01:07.950> fast<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:08.850> come<00:01:09.060> from<00:01:09.090> coronal

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
than fast one that's come from coronal

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.270 
than fast one that's come from coronal
holes<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.530> managed<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> keep<00:01:11.130> us

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
holes and that's managed to keep us

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
holes and that's managed to keep us
about<00:01:11.549> unlit<00:01:12.030> unsettled<00:01:12.479> conditions<00:01:12.570> to

active conditions over the course of the
past<00:01:15.390> two<00:01:15.689> weeks<00:01:15.960> although<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.740> did<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> other

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
past two weeks although we did the other

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.370 
past two weeks although we did the other
day<00:01:17.369> hit<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> very<00:01:18.180> fast<00:01:18.479> solar<00:01:18.900> wind<00:01:19.080> stream

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
day hit a very fast solar wind stream

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.810 
day hit a very fast solar wind stream
that<00:01:19.500> popped<00:01:19.770> us<00:01:19.950> over<00:01:20.189> storm<00:01:20.520> level

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that popped us over storm level

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
that popped us over storm level
conditions<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> rattled<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
conditions and that kind of rattled the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
conditions and that kind of rattled the
shield<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.799> little<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.670> we've<00:01:24.330> actually

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
shield a little bit so we've actually

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.749 
shield a little bit so we've actually
had<00:01:24.780> maybe<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.229> bad<00:01:25.439> ham<00:01:25.950> radio<00:01:26.280> propagation

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
had maybe some bad ham radio propagation

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.380 
had maybe some bad ham radio propagation
over<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> black<00:01:27.689> past<00:01:27.960> few<00:01:28.200> days<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.390> these

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
over the black past few days and these

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
over the black past few days and these
storm<00:01:30.750> conditions<00:01:30.990> brought<00:01:31.560> us<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> roar<00:01:32.040> from

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
storm conditions brought us a roar from

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
storm conditions brought us a roar from
all<00:01:32.490> around<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.880> world<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.840> Russia<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
all around the world like in Russia and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.539 
all around the world like in Russia and
New<00:01:35.520> Zealand<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.930> also<00:01:37.079> had<00:01:37.320> Aurora<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.920> Norway

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
New Zealand we also had Aurora in Norway

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.010 
New Zealand we also had Aurora in Norway
and<00:01:38.900> in<00:01:39.900> Scotland<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> gorgeous<00:01:42.450> Aurora<00:01:42.810> in

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
front side and that's actually been

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.940 
front side and that's actually been
shown<00:02:51.390> have<00:02:51.930> some<00:02:52.170> activity<00:02:52.650> because<00:02:52.800> it's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
shown have some activity because it's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.220 
shown have some activity because it's
right<00:02:53.190> next<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.730> dark<00:02:54.360> patch<00:02:54.750> that's<00:02:55.050> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
right next to that dark patch that's a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.080 
right next to that dark patch that's a
coronal<00:02:55.650> hole<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.430> there's<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.670> really

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
coronal hole so there's a really

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.699 
coronal hole so there's a really
interesting<00:02:57.390> looking<00:02:57.870> east<00:02:58.140> limb<00:02:58.350> right<00:02:58.530> now

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
interesting looking east limb right now

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.270

you<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.820> see<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.209> thing<00:03:03.420> rotating<00:03:03.930> around

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
you can see that thing rotating around

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.750 
you can see that thing rotating around
and<00:03:04.380> there's<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> new<00:03:04.800> region<00:03:05.160> just<00:03:05.310> above<00:03:05.610> it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
and there's a new region just above it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.820 
and there's a new region just above it
and<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.420> region<00:03:06.840> also<00:03:06.990> is<00:03:07.230> showing<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.590> lot<00:03:07.709> of

and that region also is showing a lot of
activity<00:03:08.310> those<00:03:08.790> should<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.150> returning

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
activity those should be returning

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.230

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
finally moving off to the west limb so

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.220

that drops RM flare risk just a little

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.310 
that drops RM flare risk just a little

and if they grow rapidly enough we might

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.120 
and if they grow rapidly enough we might

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
next few days and that would affect you

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
time to time also on the eastland we

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.940 
time to time also on the eastland we
have<00:05:18.600> some<00:05:18.780> very<00:05:18.900> interesting<00:05:19.260> structures

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
have some very interesting structures

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.980 
have some very interesting structures
including<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.490> very<00:05:20.700> long<00:05:20.970> snaky<00:05:21.510> kind<00:05:21.870> of

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
including a very long snaky kind of

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.080 
including a very long snaky kind of
filament<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.650> looks<00:05:22.830> pretty<00:05:23.040> unstable<00:05:23.490> and

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
filament that looks pretty unstable and

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.610 
filament that looks pretty unstable and
if<00:05:24.180> that<00:05:24.360> thing<00:05:24.570> rotates<00:05:24.750> into<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.500> earth

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
if that thing rotates into the earth

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.560 
if that thing rotates into the earth
strike<00:05:25.980> zone<00:05:26.280> we<00:05:26.670> could<00:05:26.850> launch<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.330> solar

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
strike zone we could launch a solar

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.540 
strike zone we could launch a solar
storm<00:05:27.930> that's<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.350> earth<00:05:28.470> directed<00:05:29.070> so<00:05:29.400> we're

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
storm that's to earth directed so we're

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.300 
storm that's to earth directed so we're
watching<00:05:29.910> that<00:05:29.940> quite<00:05:30.210> closely<00:05:31.040> also<00:05:32.040> right

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
watching that quite closely also right

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.430 
watching that quite closely also right
now<00:05:32.550> we're<00:05:32.880> kind<00:05:33.360> of<00:05:33.390> at<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.630> trailing<00:05:33.930> end<00:05:34.260> of

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
now we're kind of at the trailing end of

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.740 
now we're kind of at the trailing end of
a<00:05:34.500> high<00:05:34.650> speed<00:05:34.980> stream<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:35.580> we're<00:05:36.120> expecting

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
a high speed stream and we're expecting

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.320 
a high speed stream and we're expecting
to<00:05:36.870> have<00:05:37.140> continued<00:05:37.830> storm<00:05:38.460> conditions<00:05:38.730> over

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
to have continued storm conditions over

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.030 
to have continued storm conditions over
the<00:05:39.360> next<00:05:39.660> few<00:05:39.840> days<00:05:40.050> so<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.650> Aurora

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
the next few days so you Aurora

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.950 
the next few days so you Aurora
photographers<00:05:41.730> especially<00:05:42.540> those<00:05:42.690> at<00:05:42.840> high

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
photographers especially those at high

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.900 
photographers especially those at high
latitudes<00:05:43.140> might<00:05:43.980> get<00:05:44.160> a<00:05:44.190> chance<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.640> for<00:05:44.880> a

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
latitudes might get a chance to for a

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.990 
latitudes might get a chance to for a
few<00:05:45.210> more<00:05:45.360> pictures<00:05:45.630> before<00:05:46.020> it's<00:05:46.320> through

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
few more pictures before it's through

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.720 
few more pictures before it's through
