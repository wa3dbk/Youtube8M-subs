apartment we've lived together like

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.700 
apartment we've lived together like
other<00:04:58.789> times<00:04:59.090> it's<00:04:59.330> not<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.659> we<00:05:00.139> stop<00:05:00.379> living

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
together it's just more like we were

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.580 
together it's just more like we were
testing<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.509> out<00:05:02.629> for<00:05:02.900> like<00:05:03.020> three<00:05:03.199> months<00:05:03.409> we

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
testing it out for like three months we

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.029 
testing it out for like three months we
would<00:05:03.740> live<00:05:03.860> together<00:05:05.860> why<00:05:06.860> are<00:05:06.919> you

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
would live together why are you

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.070 
would live together why are you
explaining<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.849> we<00:05:08.120> did<00:05:08.300> complicated<00:05:08.870> things

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
explaining it we did complicated things

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.510 
explaining it we did complicated things
because<00:05:09.319> then<00:05:09.740> it's<00:05:09.889> going<00:05:10.009> to<00:05:10.069> seem<00:05:10.250> like<00:05:10.340> we

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
because then it's going to seem like we

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.860 
because then it's going to seem like we
live<00:05:10.729> together<00:05:10.909> and<00:05:11.240> then<00:05:11.360> we<00:05:11.479> broke<00:05:11.659> over

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
live together and then we broke over

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.779 
live together and then we broke over
