00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.049
 today is a wonderful september day 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.599
 the sun is shining and we have 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.250
 waning moon that means it's awesome 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.010
 and to go out today and not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.390
 to pick herbs above ground but 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.939
 underground the roots 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.519
 right now in autumn here for example 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.930
 I have found dandelion now and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.150
 From dandelion you can get any amount 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.119
 make lions , among other things 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.880
 Tooth root coffee I look at it now 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.010
 if I can spending a little bit 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.720
 I have a metal shovel many 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.840
 say yes they prefer to take no metal 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.450
 Rolf Dieter Stoll digs his roots 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.220
 always with a deer out of me 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:01:01.590
 Try to sting it roughly 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:01:02.120
 and look what I find quite a lot 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
 job 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.880
 dandelion roots can be correct 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.230
 get thick and deep as you see now 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.770
 Unfortunately she broke me but that 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.740
 does not do anything 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:20.010
 at least see such a piece of lobster 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.720
 what I still find the nice at 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.010
 Dandelion is one does not have to be like that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.290
 many thoughts make that one the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.650
 plant eradicates dandelion grows 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.330
 namely strong as everywhere again 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.200
 the name says dandelion we know it 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.300
 yes, everywhere 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.820
 In addition, the rootstocks grow the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.130
 are still left in the earth 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.170
 like to continue this is not 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.390
 for example, they influence the roots 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.710
 the angelika once you get that out 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.040
 taken then is the plant 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.560
 I do not have a way out of here anyway 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.740
 Everything can iron so next 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.630
 spring again a lot of new china grow 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.420
 next to the dandelion we also see the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.159
 chicory but as can be seen now in 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.610
 september it's good that they are so blue 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.870
 a lot of flowers are growing and she has 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.870
 Interestingly, leaves the lion 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.240
 are quite similar and are waiting for you 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.910
 also the theory was earlier after the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.670
 world war already a well-known 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.920
 plant for replacement coffee so also whole 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.000
 dig up like the dandelion 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.870
 take roots and cook coffee and such 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.580
 continues to pull the root of the path away and 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.260
 When you're done , always think 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.130
 Thank you to Mother Nature 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.180
 at the earth and at the plants for 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.920
 the gifts they give us 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.590
 now we go to cook coffee so have 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.790
 I dandelion our roots a lot 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.709
 and a little bit away from it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.840
 Next, I will do it thoroughly 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:06.870
 clean and under fluent 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:11.060
 Water has grown the best 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.060
 water on it and then 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.790
 you can get the upper parts of the roots 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.790
 also the same 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.780
 you have to remove the scales 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.340
 even with the same amount of earth we do 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.340
 no longer absolutely necessary 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.660
 Now our roots are nice and clean 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.460
 Now, of course, you have to shut down 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.610
 I have these strict pieces for you 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.560
 simply remove a single sentence from this way 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.770
 the narrative this wise they become 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:17.080
 beautiful white are the last earth 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:19.930
 still hanging in the corners so said 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.090
 I recently had pieces 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.080
 decide 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.440
 so in between half and one 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.440
 centimeter 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.300
 the pieces and I hope for one 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.210
 baking tray with baking paper we have here 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.470
 also won easily 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:55.210
 taken rust they distribute the should 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:06.940
 namely equal need to be even 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:15.160
 quickly the whole thing comes in now 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:18.970
 oven and the door is not the best 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.520
 but slightly open with it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.620
 moisture also escape from the oven 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.250
 can 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:32.250
 to air that now to 220 degrees 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.250
 dried 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:40.419
 and you're done with our dandelion 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:43.300
 roots chips the good thing is you 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.550
 may also be the chances you are in 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:53.199
 very crispy but watch out too 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:54.460
 pretty bitter four bishops and has 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.669
 quite a lot of bitter substances and quite 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.090
 especially in roots too much 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.280
 healthy and good for the teachers 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.590
 and also for the bile as cleaning 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.599
 Here you have a coffee of the good 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.909
 is totally for the internal organs 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.259
 Contrary to some coffee beans that 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.419
 whole comes here now in ours 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.699
 wandmixer who has can, of course 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.469
 like to take a coffee grinder with you 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:26.159
 go hand cranking well or even that 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:29.080
 Electric markets are now right 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:33.969
 dry and they could be so easy 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.770
 keep a can and then each for 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.370
 want to drink the café de la garde 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.370
 be fresh 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.760
 if you've done it all long enough 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.090
 did you get such a fine 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.070
 light brown desk and you can do that now 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.200
 simply to simmer coffee in the 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.880
 Do it right in the button and with 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.590
 water brewed that is the simplest 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.790
 variant 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.700
 I've been told it's also 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:07.220
 through the filter try it out and then 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:11.660
 look how it gets you healthier 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:14.870
 café lecca maybe not for everyone 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.430
 but in any case healthy and by the way 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.320
 when we dandelions this last time 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.470
 we were all drinking coffee 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.170
 very lively and talkative no 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.540
 caffeine but a lot of hello awake 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.110
 So stuff in it and try out 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.310
 you taste 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.310
 until next time bye
