00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.370 
think differently and and even though we
lost<00:03:57.850> being<00:03:58.090> five<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.420> came<00:03:58.810> out<00:03:58.960> in<00:03:59.080> one<00:03:59.230> game

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
lost being five and came out in one game

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.220 
lost being five and came out in one game
six<00:03:59.740> and<00:04:00.210> we<00:04:01.210> thought<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:01.720> our<00:04:01.810> time<00:04:02.050> we

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
six and we thought this is our time we

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.600 
six and we thought this is our time we
finally<00:04:02.410> got<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.650> monkey<00:04:02.890> off<00:04:02.920> her<00:04:03.130> back<00:04:03.400> and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
finally got the monkey off her back and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.210 
finally got the monkey off her back and
repeat<00:04:04.390> Ottawa<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:04.990> great<00:04:05.680> series<00:04:05.980> against

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
repeat Ottawa and great series against

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.040 
repeat Ottawa and great series against
Buffalo<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.880> obviously<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.300> Joey<00:04:07.480> Juno<00:04:07.810> ball

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
Buffalo and obviously the Joey Juno ball

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.740 
Buffalo and obviously the Joey Juno ball
Bobby<00:04:08.770> my<00:04:08.950> most<00:04:09.130> memorable<00:04:09.540> goal<00:04:10.540> was<00:04:10.690> a

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
Bobby my most memorable goal was a

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.090 
Bobby my most memorable goal was a
capital<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.550> it's<00:04:12.550> unfortunate<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.210> we

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
capital and it's unfortunate that we

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.260 
capital and it's unfortunate that we
lost<00:04:15.100> four<00:04:15.340> straight<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.700> Detroit<00:04:16.030> because<00:04:16.180> I

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
lost four straight to Detroit because I

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.370 
lost four straight to Detroit because I
thought<00:04:16.450> we<00:04:16.570> were<00:04:16.690> better<00:04:16.870> team<00:04:17.080> than<00:04:17.110> that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
thought we were better team than that

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.990 
thought we were better team than that
but<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.590> think<00:04:17.709> deep<00:04:17.920> down<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.400> maybe<00:04:18.700> as<00:04:18.970> a

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
but I think deep down and maybe as a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.580 
but I think deep down and maybe as a
team<00:04:19.270> didn't<00:04:19.630> believe<00:04:19.959> we<00:04:20.110> could<00:04:20.140> beat<00:04:20.440> him

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
team didn't believe we could beat him

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.080 
team didn't believe we could beat him
