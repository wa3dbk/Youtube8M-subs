00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.208
Hello and welcome to the island of Menorca

00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:17.467
with camera in hand, and with the help of aerial images, we are going to visit a 
 fantastic house located in one of the most emblematic areas in the port of Mahon

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:25.965
a detached house that occupies a large plot of land in an area which 
 has been traditionally one of the most desirable in the city of Mahon

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:32.520
this property occupies a plot of more than 1700 square metres

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.265
with 600 square metres constructed areas

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:42.077
the house is built over four floors

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:51.813
you see the gardens, they are mature gardens with 
 large trees and here we have a summerhouse

00:00:51.813 --> 00:00:57.661
the great value of this property, without a doubt, is its location

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:04.959
it is just a stone's throw from the best part of Mahon harbour

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:15.755
and from here we can see the views you can enjoy from 
 just the terrace, from inside the house they are even better

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:20.468
if front of us there is a large yacht

00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:23.928
here we have the swimming pool

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:31.819
as you can see, we have the advantage of having these magnificent views

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.674
the pool is a good size, as you can see

00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:45.670
let's take a look at the inside of the house, we have another 
 video taken room by room to see the layout of this house

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:53.290
as you see, here we have a large double sitting room, 
 the house has 4 levels as I mentioned earlier

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:03.580
below this floor there is another floor which is the barbecue 
 area with various rooms to enjoy the summer months

00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:09.870
the materials used are of a very high 
 quality, the wooden flooring, all the woodwork

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:19.350
it also has automated features, the shutters are electric

00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:26.810
it's a house that has been very well constructed, 
 a house originally constructed in the time 

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:32.710
just look at the staircase, what great carpentry work, it's marvellous

00:02:32.714 --> 00:02:41.980
it's a house that was originally constructed in the 1960s 
 and was reformed and renovated in the 1990s

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:50.300
on this floor we have three bedrooms, we will take 
 a look just at the master bedroom

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:56.330
here we have lovely views of the port of Mahon

00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:04.110
this is the dressing room, which as you see is very 
 spacious with lots of recessed lighting in the ceiling

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:12.590
the air conditioning is by a series of ducts and 
 which can be hot or cold

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:18.260
here as you can see we have a luxurious bathroom

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:33.860
with jacuzzi, twin wash basins with this large mirror, and as you would expect 
 in a property such as this one, it has its own sauna

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:39.590
and also a hydro-massage shower

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:44.500
as you see, the quality of all the materials is magnificent

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:53.040
there is marble, the walls are stucco, and the woodwork as 
 I said to you is of the highest quality

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:08.740
upstairs we have a tower which is on the 
 fourth storey of the house with incredible views

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:14.510
we find a circular room, which is this one

00:04:14.508 --> 00:04:25.360
and from here we have amazing views of the port of Mahon

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:31.850
as we have seen in the video report, 
 we have visited a truly unique property

00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:37.180
which is on a prime plot of privileged land just 
 a few metres from the port of Mahon

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.170
