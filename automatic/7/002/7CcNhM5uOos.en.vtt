00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
basic I actually end up liking it it's a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.610 
basic I actually end up liking it it's a
small<00:02:32.000> screen<00:02:32.239> but<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.510> doesn't<00:02:32.750> matter<00:02:32.840> but

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
small screen but it doesn't matter but

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 
like that I didn't actually ask for it

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.869 
like that I didn't actually ask for it
but<00:03:15.620> because<00:03:15.799> it<00:03:16.009> was<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.430> only<00:03:16.579> one<00:03:16.729> that

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
but because it was the only one that

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.189 
but because it was the only one that
could<00:03:16.939> find<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.299> granite<00:03:17.659> they<00:03:17.810> had<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.049> give

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199 
could find in granite they had to give

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.240 
could find in granite they had to give
it<00:03:18.259> to<00:03:18.349> me<00:03:18.439> they<00:03:18.590> could<00:03:18.650> have<00:03:18.859> asked<00:03:19.099> me<00:03:19.129> to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
it to me they could have asked me to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.550 
it to me they could have asked me to
come<00:03:19.400> back<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.609> refine<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.870> paperwork<00:03:21.319> and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
come back and refine the paperwork and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.860 
come back and refine the paperwork and
and<00:03:21.859> whatever<00:03:22.159> to<00:03:22.729> pay<00:03:22.909> for<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.209> but<00:03:23.389> I<00:03:23.599> could

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
and whatever to pay for it but I could

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.179 
and whatever to pay for it but I could
have<00:03:23.959> then<00:03:24.079> backed<00:03:24.319> out<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.889> put<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:25.159> a

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
have then backed out and I put it a

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.319 
have then backed out and I put it a
positive<00:03:25.609> so<00:03:25.759> they'd<00:03:25.849> have<00:03:25.939> to<00:03:26.090> give<00:03:26.209> that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
positive so they'd have to give that

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.710 
positive so they'd have to give that
back<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.530> they<00:03:27.650> included<00:03:27.979> that<00:03:28.129> in<00:03:28.540> does<00:03:29.540> have

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
back so they included that in does have

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.300 
back so they included that in does have
cruise<00:03:29.930> control<00:03:29.959> other<00:03:30.530> than<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.919> I<00:03:30.949> mean<00:03:31.069> it

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
cruise control other than that I mean it

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.860

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
about thirty to one and then they had to

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.249 
about thirty to one and then they had to
throw<00:03:47.239> in<00:03:47.419> the<00:03:47.509> hitch<00:03:47.659> which<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:47.959> about<00:03:48.079> under

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:48.259 
throw in the hitch which is about under

throw in the hitch which is about under
four<00:03:48.470> hundred<00:03:48.709> dollars<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:50.269> about<00:03:50.449> thirty<00:03:50.720> to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
four hundred dollars so about thirty to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.909 
four hundred dollars so about thirty to
five<00:03:51.169> plus<00:03:51.469> tax

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
five plus tax

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.179 
five plus tax
my<00:03:52.430> total<00:03:52.819> price<00:03:53.090> was<00:03:53.599> about<00:03:53.900> twenty<00:03:54.290> one<00:03:54.739> plus

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
my total price was about twenty one plus

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:56.890 
my total price was about twenty one plus
tax<00:03:55.699> and<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.060> reason<00:03:56.329> is<00:03:56.479> they<00:03:56.659> had<00:03:56.810> an

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
tax and the reason is they had an

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.449 
tax and the reason is they had an
instant<00:03:57.259> rebate<00:03:57.379> because<00:03:57.859> it's<00:03:58.009> n<00:03:58.159> a<00:03:58.189> month

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
instant rebate because it's n a month

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.819 
instant rebate because it's n a month
and<00:03:58.699> if<00:03:58.930> end<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.079> year<00:04:00.319> they're<00:04:00.469> trying<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.680> get

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
and if end of year they're trying to get

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.179 
and if end of year they're trying to get
rid<00:04:00.979> of<00:04:01.099> them<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.180> lucked<00:04:02.509> out<00:04:02.599> there<00:04:03.189> also

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
rid of them so I lucked out there also

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.920 
rid of them so I lucked out there also
because<00:04:04.609> they<00:04:05.359> kind<00:04:05.569> of<00:04:05.599> mucked<00:04:05.810> up<00:04:05.870> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
because they kind of mucked up the
