00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.519
 Hello everyone and today we will analyze you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.509
 song aria calm and asked me 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 parse this song one of the subscribers 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.279
 but rather not this song but in general 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.510
 something simple from aria 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:28.500
 Well, as you probably already noticed in aria 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 simple is not so much but the song 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.590
 calm 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.739
 Well, more or less even fit to her 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.270
 were able to play 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.250
 novice guitarists but how it sounds 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.320
 I can't sing like boiling so 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:57.620
 watch and listen sing as best I can but 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.620
 see what chords are couplets 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.850
 dome 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.120
 what 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.590
 even 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.590
 for we 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.060
 one 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.030
 announcement 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.650
 bag on top 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.210
 cobra nest you 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:49.600
 so like all couplets and now 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:55.819
 chorus ari plays it there a little slyly 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:01.520
 but we will simplify it well simplify to more 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:06.939
 nowhere shorter and swarm 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.939
 chorus with us like that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.910
 Yes 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.910
 by somebody 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.690
 same 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.380
 but not yours 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.380
 this 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.790
 once again what 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.220
 a bunch 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.220
 it's a pity 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.110
 beta 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.950
 that 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.950
 oligarchs 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.530
 Yes 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.540
 but no but i 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:14.220
 well, it was easier to play it 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:22.230
 sounds certainly not like the original but quite 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:26.280
 playable that's basically the whole song 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.280
 good luck to you all
