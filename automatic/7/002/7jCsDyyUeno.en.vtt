00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.270
 I think about Mike Anderson I fuck you 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.700
 I will not be 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.310
 is not 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.020
 I do not know Michael Phelps 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 personally that is, I have not been with him 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.160
 talking like I'm talking right now 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.720
 with you we have been in the same 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.489
 sports facility I have seen swimming 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.860
 live but we have not had the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.730
 opportunity to even say hello and a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.960
 of the things that I find most 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.550
 fun and it's that clear with this from 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.430
 social networks he will have been 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.500
 seeing in a lot of occasions that you 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.510
 have mentioned the intentional to me but 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.210
 that the image of 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.229
 thinking about him and imagining 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.740
 melo looking teresa perales and is who 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.440
 will be and why she named me 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.729
 comparison is logical too but now 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.040
 is that it is one thing a coincidence that 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.300
 it's very good for me because that allows me 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.110
 in each interview keep talking about 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.270
 Paralympic sport 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.729
 I believe that London has been a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.410
 definitive break of barriers is to say 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.810
 we have taken a giant step towards 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.520
 cndh no longer normalization without the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.800
 naturalization that this word now I 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.380
 like still more the naturalization of 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.750
 disability in sports 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.939
 my medals for the first time in the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.979
 history have been equipped in the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.470
 media to a few medals 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.100
 Olympic Games, it is time for them to 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.439
 institutional level we also go 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.780
 reaching that balance a sixth 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.030
 Olympic position equals a gold 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 paralympic, it takes an athlete 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.170
 Paralympic win six medals one of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.569
 gold three silver and two bronze already you 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.170
 you can imagine that it is worth 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:06.299
 balance it to an Olympic bronze all 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.039
 my medals have made a bronze 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.039
 Olympic I think it's very unfair 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.130
 Look at the swimming teresa born from a 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.830
 moment that was not easy was a process 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.380
 neurological and lasted approximately three 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.820
 three months or so on standing 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.650
 challenge the laws of gravity with 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.600
 crutches and sit in the wheelchair 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.700
 forever for good, I sat on the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.740
 chair and one day it occurred to me to get into 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.270
 the pool was on vacation and I 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.870
 I got into the question with a vest 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.750
 lifeguard with a whistle in his pocket 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.220
 converted and with my brother without having 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.030
 idea of ​​nothing I was of the style 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.290
 dog you know ya keep throwing him a hug 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.120
 and the other but they did not coordinate and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.520
 breathing neither legs nor arms nor anything 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.440
 clear now removed an element of the 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.540
 equation that are the legs 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.310
 it needs coordination I find it more 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.330
 easy good the fact is that I got myself and I 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.160
 he liked being up to the task not to be so 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.810
 I spend the day looking up and 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.820
 you know the problem of looking up 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.440
 here are moments when 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.060
 inevitably you fall into a complex of 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.430
 inferiority 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.890
 for height issue people get 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.510
 to speak up this a lot of people do not know 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.030
 account and rarely tell it but 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.130
 but it's something important, people get 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.170
 to speak at this point and it costs me 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.230
 make heard and there comes a time when 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.060
 I have to disconnect I do not hear you know and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.160
 disconnect and kaisen a small complex 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.290
 of inferiority to time stop 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.970
 look at my fingers to see if to see if the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.890
 moved and I think it's very important 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.019
 is the moment done I think it's the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.150
 most important moment of all because 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.090
 is when we have arrived so far 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.680
 it pitied me it was 19 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.140
 who had lived was a very childhood 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.630
 happy truncated in adolescence by the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.700
 death of my father with much pain 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.650
 after having been a girl and I say 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.890
 many times in addition, even in some 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.630
 I was a very selfish girl 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.769
 He left with 15 years old I did not care 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.989
 it's not that I will not care 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.280
 mind that my mother was suffering imagine 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.900
 my mother had stayed with a child of 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.599
 8 and with a 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.599
 of 15 the truth that I already have almost 37 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.419
 years she was widowed with 39 now is 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.519
 the more I realize the more grief 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.910
 I have to have been so so not so 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.910
 selfish 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.270
 It is what it is 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.100
 and the first days when after 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.500
 a disability you get to train the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.210
 evolution is very fast you know and clear 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.650
 so I went pim pam pim pam pim pam every 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.570
 day a little more a little more a little more 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.020
 I was lucky because I had good control 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.310
 from my body I immediately got used to 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.280
 handle it more or less than evolution 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.960
 it's amazing you see me now and I do not have 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.720
 nothing to see at the beginning at the beginning 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.669
 it fell a lot was very clumsy nothing you know 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.350
 Now I am completely different already 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.660
 has already accustomed let's say that my 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.370
 space I control it I control it super 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.440
 well this is not done from night to 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.690
 tomorrow 22 medals are not achieved in a 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.090
 day can start training a work 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.970
 three days a week to finish 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.220
 training seven days a week six 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.949
 hours a day and going out then in many 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.880
 occasions vomiting from training while 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.520
 exhausted 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.259
 if it is achieved with a lot of effort but 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.300
 I also think that when things get to you 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.000
 they cost effort you value them very much 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.009
 more and that's it and the truth is that the 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.620
 own history logically has its 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.440
 dramatic points 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.630
 but I have seen evolution with me as 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.229
 principle was a lot that is what I 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.870
 I had passed 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.389
 added to my sporting history now 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.770
 nobody tells what happened to me only 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.409
 that I am the Spanish athlete with more 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.669
 history medals 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.669
 that's what they tell me 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.860
 I have done a lot of mental visualization 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.930
 in sports , sport is very 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.030
 important to work the mind to work 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.670
 the brain when you've been training 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.710
 four years a lot a lot a lot a lot and you 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.020
 you play it in 35 seconds 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.000
 we have hundred can can do you 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.470
 To fail I look in London without going anymore 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.750
 Far away he lives a very emotional moment 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.990
 hard 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.170
 the last day the last approved 100 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.350
 meter free the result gold start of the 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.350
 day 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.130
 my broken arms burned me 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.410
 It hurt so bad I go back to the room 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.840
 I put my music and suddenly it starts 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.860
 to live to see without wanting how I'm going to 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.080
 win 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.820
 I recreate in my head each of the 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.220
 moments that I thought would come by the 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.990
 late is the first time in my life that 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.160
 something has happened to me has been up to such 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.770
 point I was wearing the heart rate monitor 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.650
 that I set at 170 beats per minute 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.460
 being lying at rest of course 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.560
 in my head and when it was time to see me 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.560
 for for energy pool 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.550
 pool and without saying anything to anyone by 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.550
 I thought this afternoon won 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.349
 and it's an award that has made me a lot 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.210
 illusion the great cross because it is the maximum 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.249
 institutional award that is delivered in 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.770
 Spain and the winner to me this year 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:10.750
 I also say that I have been missing 22 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.710
 medals 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:17.340
 It has been interesting if if the 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.340
 game day very fun
