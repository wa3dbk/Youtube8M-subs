the Vega

the Vega
is<00:04:46.949> that<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.430> shells<00:04:47.669> are<00:04:47.819> made<00:04:47.940> of

is that the shells are made of

is that the shells are made of
fiberglass<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:49.169> is<00:04:49.289> one<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.560> best

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
fiberglass this is one of the best

because<00:04:51.900> it's<00:04:52.050> super<00:04:52.349> lightweight<00:04:52.560> and

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
because it's super lightweight and

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.439 
because it's super lightweight and
