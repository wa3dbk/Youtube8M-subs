00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 you 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.490
 by the window with the character is the application of the policy of a mine of 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.690
 iron aluminum the subject at the bottom of the balance hull 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.040
 or because of the palmar the score 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.700
 I just regret that the company through field 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.850
 with the purpose of protecting the animal from being cured by the animal 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.610
 many liberal professionals perform this task of ferrara animales 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.180
 but they do not always know the correct technique 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.830
 also do not know the anatomy of the locomotion and sustentation system 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.340
 of the circuit 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.890
 this lack of technical knowledge can cause serious problems to the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.040
 animals leading lenders catering for large losses 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.710
 mystifies the course we will show the practice of 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.340
 Anatolian basic knowledge 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.150
 we will also show the correction of the autonomous 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.190
 through the traditional hot-air 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.360
 modern poly process 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 to coordinate this work was invited the veterinary doctor of the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.320
 tunnel when marcelo vendramini 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.440
 of the department of zootechnics of the Federal University of ViÃ§osa in Minas Gerais 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.790
 general 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.590
 giving sequence the girl heads the course on horses 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.680
 today we are going to show 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.980
 the procedures used in castro casting 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.500
 collection of supports 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 abdication of horseshoes here we have ahead 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 several are the instruments used in the meat industry 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.779
 knives groves to coolness 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.099
 but what really matters is that conserving is an action 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.139
 in the scapula in the investigation of the case 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.989
 in a second step 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.989
 the farrier before replacing a horseshoe 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.279
 he must observe with the supports 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.309
 no animal 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.869
 in motion and station 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.479
 he should observe 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.579
 the consistency of the wall 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.179
 integrity 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.019
 and observe also 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.019
 the expense of the previous horseshoe 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.839
 these indicators are very important 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.379
 to choose 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.699
 it application justice of the new horseshoe 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:53.119
 it is good to also remember that the stops are poorly made and incorrect application 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.170
 the horseshoes may cause damage to the ropes 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.829
 the foot of the horse is divided into two parts 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.939
 an internal bone that comprises the articular ligaments the tendons o 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.059
 damping apparatus the ugly arteries nerves and membranes 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.899
 and to the outside who is represented by the case 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.949
 the third precious phalanx that is housed within the term 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.709
 it has several holes through which passed nervous filaments evasion 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.709
