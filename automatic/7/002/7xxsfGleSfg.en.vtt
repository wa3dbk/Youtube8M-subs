00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.730
 first easter the sad eyes of a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.070
 woman watched a horrible scene 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 between the noise of the people in that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.779
 Your son was dying. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.060
 her mother was Maria and she was 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.880
 cross where Jesus had been preached as 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.430
 all this happened as life 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 wonder of Jesus could end 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.309
 As horrible as God could 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.360
 allow his own child to be 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.640
 nailed to a cross and die if there will be 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.660
 that Jesus had been wrong about who 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.700
 he was 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.719
 would god have failed not god would not 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.399
 failed 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.920
 jesus made no mistake jesus always knew 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.440
 who would be killed by evil men 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.680
 when jesus was still a baby a man 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.530
 called Simeon told Maria that this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.170
 sadness would happen 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.180
 a few days before Jesus died a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
 woman came near him from hubble an 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.840
 expensive perfume over your feet to 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.250
 disciples said that waste 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.930
 Jesus replied she made me a 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 very good thing what she did was 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.799
 perfume my body to my 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.049
 burial what strange words 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.170
 then Judas, one of the twelve disciples of 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.750
 Jesus agreed to deliver Jesus 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 chiefs of priests for 30 pieces of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.420
 silver at the Passover feast of the Jews 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.240
 Jesus ate his last meal together 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 with the disciples Jesus spoke the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.320
 disciples wonderful things to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 respect for God and His promises 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 for those who love him 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.010
 Jesus took the bread and gave the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.960
 disciples saying 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.479
 take and how this is my body 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.870
 then he took a goblet of wine and passed 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.320
 the disciples saying that all of you are gone 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.900
 because this is my blood that is 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.450
 spilled in favor of many to the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.180
 forgiveness of sins 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.470
 Then Jesus told the disciples that he 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.020
 would be betrayed and that they would flee 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.590
 I will never abandon the master of you 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.220
 Pedro but Jesus answered before the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.840
 Cock you sing take three times not 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.260
 meet me later that night 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.060
 Jesus went to pray in the garden of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.170
 disciples who were with him and 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.870
 they slept jesus prayed so my father would 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.360
 it is possible for me to keep this cup of 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.370
 suffering 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.720
 but what I want is not done 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.000
 but what you suddenly want 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.670
 several soldiers arrived in the garden on 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.640
 company of judas to jesus did nothing 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.130
 but Pedro cut a man's ear 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.750
 calmly touched the ear of the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.600
 man and the crown 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.760
 Jesus knew that all this was part of the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.220
 God's Will 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.540
 the soldiers took Jesus to the house of the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.940
 great priest 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.280
 there the Jewish leaders said that Jesus 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.260
 should be killed near there 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.350
 Pedro sat down with some 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.510
 employees around a campfire three 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.030
 Sometimes people pointed to Pedro. 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.510
 said this man was also with 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.260
 Jesus and three times Pedro denied that 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.360
 I knew Jesus exactly like Jesus. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.700
 had said 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.380
 Pedro even swore that God could 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.460
 punish them if this were true 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.280
 At that moment a cock crowed seemed to 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.500
 God's voice to Pedro remembering the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.490
 words of jesus pedro cried 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.290
 bitterly, Judas was sad he knew 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.640
 that Jesus was not guilty of any 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.310
 sin the crime 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.350
 Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.470
 but the chief priests did not 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.550
 They accepted back help threw out the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.130
 money and hanged himself 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.400
 the priests took Jesus to Pilate 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.010
 the governor of rome reported 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.730
 I find no reason to condemn 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.360
 this man but the crowd was shouting 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.670
 crucify crucify Pilate 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.700
 decided to condemn Jesus to death 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.910
 the soldiers boy tear jesus spit 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.700
 in it and took their clothes made 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.070
 a crown of branches full of thorns and 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.620
 put on the head of jesus 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.430
 finally he was nailed to a cross of 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.220
 wood 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.910
 Jesus always under his death would be 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.010
 form 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.530
 Jesus also knew that his death 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.850
 would bring forgiveness of sins to all 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.580
 who trust him 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.120
 two criminals were crucified at the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.170
 side of jesus one believe in jesus and was 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.220
 to paradise 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.900
 the other not after hours of 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.900
 suffering jesus said 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:26.640
 everything is complete you and your jesus died 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.620
 work was complete 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.560
 some friends put their body in a 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.530
 new tomb then roman soldiers 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.550
 closed the tomb and watched over 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:41.040
 no one could enter or leave if that 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.910
 was the end of the story would be very 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.730
 sad but god did something wonderful 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.460
 Jesus was not dead early in the morning 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.460
 on the first day of the week some 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.960
 disciples found the open tomb 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.930
 when they looked inside 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.090
 they saw that Jesus was not there a woman 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.960
 was crying near the tomb of jesus 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.600
 appeared to her she ran merrily to 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.900
 tell the other disciples, Jesus is 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:13.440
 alive he rose from the dead 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.810
 soon after Jesus appeared the disciples 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.890
 and showed the nail marks in his 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.680
 hands 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:25.020
 it was true jesus was alive again 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.060
 he forgave Peter for his sin and 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.150
 his disciples to speak to all 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.520
 about him then jesus went back to heaven 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.520
 Where had she come from the first Christmas?
