00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.910
 building up live weight before winter 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.300
 increasing the body weight of the animal 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:19.220
 due to the decrease in daylight 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.970
 increase in the number of hours 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.310
 everything managed again dark time in 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.949
 time of day and this time goes 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.169
 enhanced growth has probably 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.090
 temperature influences temperature another year 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.160
 this amount is the fact she is again for which the whole 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.989
 what is that belly feel 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.180
 the approach of winter is no longer calendars on 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.400
 no feel his visiting light 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.420
 days and the rise of the dark 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.460
 in time means it means they have 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.800
 get an appetite during and winter naga 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.909
 cast ie they must be deprived 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.100
 energy reserve 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.879
 so that winter survived the winter to kill 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.860
 now there is in the process of reproduction 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.900
 years of reproduction you have 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.250
 adopted the concept of enhanced fattening 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.970
 in winter there is a high probability 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.530
 that by winter they will heat up slightly 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.390
 they know what they are and don't know what they are 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.580
 do we go good every year and 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.880
 good food it makes no sense to build up 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.680
 in winter live weight that is this moment 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.650
 can be used in economic 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.930
 activities so this way so 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.230
 way that winter animal if 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.480
 lose anything okay this is not 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.480
 Australian scientists have calculated that 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.000
 oats on average with free access to 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.270
 feed resources can consume in 3 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.680
 times more hay and grain 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.260
 what is not needed for normal 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.210
 productivity still eat and meat 3 times 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.710
 more 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.630
 transfer of abdominal excrement 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.909
 there is a large amount of nutrient 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.860
 substances that is not recycled not 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.320
 reworked clear, that is, there is no point 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.570
 in winter to feed the animal so that it was 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.400
 higher than the average degree of fatness we 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.070
 you and the fact that she will lose weight a little 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.159
 evenings from the economic point of view too 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.640
 as it is useful for you it will be a lamb 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.640
 fine
