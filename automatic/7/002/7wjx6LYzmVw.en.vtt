00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.368
 "Baby constipation and cow's milk" 

00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:13.590
 In the 1950s, there was a first suspicion that some cases of constipation in children 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.536
 may be caused by the consumption of cow's milk. 

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:21.139
 This assumption was tested 40 years later. 

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:24.730
 Until recently, we thought most of the chronic constipation in infants and young children 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.072
 it is of psychological origin, that children keep the need. The rest of the cases were debited 

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:33.370
 bowel disorders. Nonetheless, these researchers examined 27 infants gradually, 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.951
 which parents brought to the gastroenterological clinic with chronic idiopathic constipation. 

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.472
 The title refers to the fact that it is not known what constipation causes. 

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:45.890
 So doctors tried to remove the cow's milk protein from the diet. 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.536
 Within three days, 21 out of 27 children were cured. 

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:57.303
 The symptoms completely disappeared after the introduction of a diet without cow's milk protein. 

00:00:57.303 --> 00:01:02.802
 During two subsequent attempts to reintroduce this protein 

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.906
 the clinical signs returned to the diet. After re-administration of cow's 

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:09.571
 of milk, constipation reappeared within 24 to 48 hours. 

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.743
 They tried twice with the same result. 

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:17.037
 When the children stayed with the milk-free diet and appeared in the clinic a month later, 

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:20.035
 they were still symptomatic, eczema and wheezing subsided. 

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:24.369
 Researchers concluded that many cases of chronic constipation in young children, 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.161
 probably more than three quarters, may be due to undetected milk allergy 

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:37.738
 protein. Chronic constipation is a common health problem in children. 

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:40.600
 Laxatives and fiber are prescribed for constipation. 

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:44.900
 If this is not enough, several higher doses of laxatives can be used. 

00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:47.600
 But that may not be enough. 

00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:51.900
 Five years later, a large number of children still suffered from constipation. 

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.900
 Constipation can even haunt them to adulthood. 

00:01:54.904 --> 00:02:01.640
 The cure of the problem within a few days with the exclusion of cow's milk was 

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:07.210
 truly breakthrough. It was an open study, so it was neither blind nor controlled 

00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:11.730
 placebo. However, such a study was later published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.860
 Double-blind, cross-over study: cow's milk vs. soy milk. 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.850
 Sixty-five children with chronic constipation. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.350
 All were previously treated with laxatives, but without success. 

00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:26.080
 49 of them had cracks in the anus, and it was inflamed and itchy. 

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:31.420
 Tiny rips from tearing on the anus are very painful. 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.020
 Children received cow or soy milk for two weeks, then the groups changed. 

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:38.650
 So what happened? 

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:43.780
 In two-thirds of the children on soy milk, the constipation disappeared. 

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:46.580
 Cracks on the anus have healed, and the pain subsided. 

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:50.820
 None of the children in the cow's milk group had a favorable response. 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.680
 In 44 children, hypersensitivity to cow's milk protein was confirmed 

00:02:55.684 --> 00:02:59.980
 double-blind studies with cow's milk. 

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:04.450
 All lesions, including the most severe cracks in the anus, disappeared on the diet 

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.280
 without cow's milk. But when she was cow 

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:14.650
 the milk was re-included in the diet, the problems returned. 

00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.380
 This may explain why children who drink more than a cup of milk a day may have it 

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:24.380
 eight times more likely to crack at the anus. 

00:03:24.384 --> 00:03:29.450
 The elimination of cow's milk can help heal the crevices in the anus and adults. 

00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:33.140
 When you give people milk again, 

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:39.030
 on a scale of 1 to 10, the reported pain in excretion is assessed to be 8 to 9 instead of 0. 

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:42.300
 As I said, it's very painful. 

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:47.800
 Cow's milk can also make a significant contribution to repeating diaper rashes. 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.320
 But why? 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.480
 In all studies investigating tissue samples in patients with chronic constipation 

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:59.150
 hypersensitivity to cow's milk protein revealed signs of rectal inflammation. 

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:05.100
 The lesson is that for all constipated children who do not respond to treatment, 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.070
 should be considered to exclude cow's milk from the diet test. 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.960
 Studies from around the world have confirmed these findings. 

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:20.400
 Up to 80% of children have been deprived of constipation after switching from cow's milk to soy or rice. 

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:22.530
 However, a common problem with studies is 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.430
 that even though children started to drink vegetable milk instead of cow's milk, 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.790
 they could continue to receive milk in other dairy products. 

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:32.860
 The rest of the diet was not controlled. That is, until the study. 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.830
 The 2013 study deployed children a completely milk-free diet and all children 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.330
 have healed. Another study published in the New England Journal study had 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.600
 only 68%. However, the rest of the diet was not limited in this study. 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.800
 In that study twenty years ago 

00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:55.170
 the cow's milk was even replaced with donkey milk. 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:03.920
 Even that was better than cow, but to exclude milk from all animals is probably the best choice.
