00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.850
 greetings simers and I hope that it 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.200
 find very very well and in this 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.600
 occasion I bring this video to 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.420
 explain a pretty simple trick 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.539
 but very very useful that is available in 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.670
 the 5 points version - 14.0 of the sims 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.460
 also known as the version of the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.400
 camping this trick will serve us for 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.780
 two things the first function of this 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.720
 Trick will surely love them 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.330
 because it will help us to have 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.510
 very many timoleÃ³n is completely 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.710
 fast free also style points 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.590
 of life and social points and the second 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.079
 function is that it will allow us 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.870
 unlock prematurely area 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.090
 picnic from the campsite especially the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.590
 that we are a little impatient, good 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.350
 if we are not going to have to wait for these 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.780
 seven days this trick besides being 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.219
 simple and fast works both in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.460
 devices that have a system 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.600
 operational as well as in 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.670
 devices that the system has 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.620
 operative android good if you 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.289
 they have some other operating system 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.820
 You can try it and also comment if 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.800
 has worked or not 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.920
 I will explain first how 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.080
 do it from ios devices but more 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.910
 forward also in this same video my 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.150
 mate kevin is going to be showing you 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.390
 how it's done from android and it's super 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.190
 simple in ios we're just going to go 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.230
 to the settings of our device 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.900
 from here we go to the configurations 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.170
 general where we mark the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.510
 date and time setting I have 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 of 6 at this time but if you 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.170
 they have 78 it's the same thing or it works 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 just nothing else look for these adjustments and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.110
 good they are going to deactivate the adjustment 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.330
 automatic of the date and time and the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.360
 let's manually adjust here what 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.880
 let's do is advance minimum a 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.789
 year 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.370
 I'm going to advance it one year to the date for 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.770
 show them 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.770
 and now I 'm going to go back to the game 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.390
 and when I went into the game I'm going to 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.430
 leaving this message means that the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.430
 trick has gone well and the little message 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.500
 tells us hello again the sims have been 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.740
 cast a lot less are a little 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.700
 sad here you have 150,000 if marion is 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.250
 21 pb and 7 ps to encourage them what happens 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.710
 is that if we stop playing with 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.140
 the application at least during a 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.150
 week we will get this little sign without 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.070
 need to do any trick but 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.200
 we can advance the date for 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.290
 that this little sign appears to us every 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.020
 we have the need to have 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.480
 maximum leonine pp and ps and in this way 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.930
 can we recover resources from 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.030
 very simple way very practical and good 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.550
 already here back at the campsite as 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.500
 you can see it does not come out that we have 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.420
 have to wait seven days to build the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.150
 picnic area so we can 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.950
 get from now on now if you want 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.050
 to repeat the trick what we are going to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.480
 to do is go back to the settings of 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.920
 our devices are going to activate 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.920
 again the automatic adjustment 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.760
 once it has been updated 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.019
 date and time automatically we go back to 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.370
 deactivate and now we're going to overtake 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.129
 again the date one year two years three 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.079
 years or what it is that you like 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.670
 I tell them there's no need to really 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.970
 exaggerate ones own if you want 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.890
 let's try to overtake it in about 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.750
 four years 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.750
 now let's go back to the game 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.510
 and good as you can see it has come out 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.459
 again the message where it tells me 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.890
 that they are giving me the sima lion 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.220
 and ps so I can repeat it several 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.159
 times to get the symbol nes pb and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.140
 ps that I need good now that 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.450
 Well, it's going to show you how this is done 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.530
 but on android 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.530
 we go here 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.349
 we put the date and time automatically 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.749
 and we take it off if they already have it there in 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.900
 good automatic date they take it off to 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:20.889
 who says define date they give it there and 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.490
 increase 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.850
 about three years they put four years 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.740
 they leave it there 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.920
 and then we go to the 5 place 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.760
 and we hope 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.760
 houston 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:45.659
 you have to leave this hello again 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:47.549
 you without being cast in a lot less 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:52.079
 they are a little sad from here you have 

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:54.380
 well that finally that and can now 

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:57.230
 unblock it 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.190
 without any problem 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.420
 from this 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.370
 that's why I hope you liked it 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.770
 good guys I hope this glitch 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.870
 failure of the game can serve them for 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.790
 take their children out of poverty 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.740
 I recommend that you try to take advantage of this 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.570
 trick all the crises that need 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.220
 before new ones come out 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.590
 updates since we do not know if 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.780
 will continue to work when they leave 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.850
 later updates I would 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.890
 dismissal do not forget to lay your life if 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.010
 They liked sharing it with others and mersch 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.130
 and I see them until the next video 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.130
 bye
