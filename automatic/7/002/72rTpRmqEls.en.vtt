alright so here are the three key areas

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
alright so here are the three key areas
to<00:01:06.659> gaining<00:01:07.140> lean<00:01:07.350> muscle<00:01:07.799> mass<00:01:08.330> number<00:01:09.330> one

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
to gaining lean muscle mass number one

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
to gaining lean muscle mass number one
is<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> eat<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:10.409> calories<00:01:10.830> than<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.460> body

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
calories and in order to build lean

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
calories and in order to build lean
muscle<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> need<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.380> give<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:16.710> body<00:01:16.770> the

need in order to building muscle well a
good<00:01:25.560> formula<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> use<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.850> 20<00:01:27.330> times

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
good formula I like to use is 20 times

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
good formula I like to use is 20 times
your<00:01:27.869> body<00:01:28.049> weight<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.280> equals<00:01:29.700> the

total number of daily calories that you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.170 
total number of daily calories that you
should<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.189> getting<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.610> order<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> start

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
should be getting in order to start

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.359 
should be getting in order to start
making<00:01:33.360> muscle<00:01:33.810> gains<00:01:34.049> now<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
making muscle gains now this is more of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
making muscle gains now this is more of
a<00:01:35.430> trial<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.909> error<00:01:36.060> process<00:01:36.360> than<00:01:36.780> anything

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a trial and error process than anything

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
a trial and error process than anything
else<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.560> try<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:38.790> least<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.090> week

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
else so try this out for at least a week

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.660 
else so try this out for at least a week
then<00:01:39.780> weigh<00:01:40.079> yourself<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> didn't

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
then weigh yourself and if you didn't

then weigh yourself and if you didn't
gain<00:01:41.850> weight<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.600> add<00:01:42.810> another<00:01:43.079> 200<00:01:43.439> daily

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.889 
gain weight then add another 200 daily
calories<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.729> check<00:01:44.970> again<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> week<00:01:45.659> if

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
calories and check again in a week if

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.990 
calories and check again in a week if
you<00:01:46.200> keep<00:01:46.590> doing<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.130> eventually<00:01:47.640> you'll

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you keep doing this eventually you'll

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
you keep doing this eventually you'll
hit<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.360> magic<00:01:48.869> number<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> daily<00:01:49.530> calories

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
hit that magic number of daily calories

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
hit that magic number of daily calories
that<00:01:50.280> makes<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.790> gain<00:01:51.030> weight<00:01:51.240> maybe<00:01:51.750> you'll

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that makes you gain weight maybe you'll

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.179 
that makes you gain weight maybe you'll
hit<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> first<00:01:52.619> try<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
calculation that I gave you or maybe

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899

you'll<00:01:55.590> hit<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> third<00:01:56.280> try<00:01:56.490> who<00:01:56.729> knows

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you'll hit it on the third try who knows

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.149 
you'll hit it on the third try who knows
the<00:01:57.360> important<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.710> find

the important thing is that you find
that<00:01:59.310> number<00:01:59.640> by<00:02:00.149> consistently<00:02:01.140> hitting<00:02:01.439> your

progress each week now if you take this

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.670 
progress each week now if you take this
a<00:02:06.030> step<00:02:06.149> further<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.020> next<00:02:07.259> thing<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> want

a step further the next thing you want

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.740 
a step further the next thing you want
to<00:02:07.829> do<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.160> start<00:02:08.459> eating<00:02:08.849> six<00:02:09.239> meals<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.720> day

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to do is start eating six meals a day

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.290 
to do is start eating six meals a day
instead<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.470> their<00:02:10.619> usual<00:02:10.649> three<00:02:11.459> meals<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
instead of their usual three meals the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
instead of their usual three meals the
reason<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
reason is

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.530 
reason is
your<00:02:13.620> body<00:02:13.890> needs<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.460> constant<00:02:15.120> supply<00:02:15.300> of

your body needs a constant supply of
nutrients<00:02:16.140> throughout<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> day<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.770> keep

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
nutrients throughout the day to keep

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.730 
nutrients throughout the day to keep
yourself<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.760> an<00:02:17.910> anabolic<00:02:18.720> muscle<00:02:18.870> building

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
yourself in an anabolic muscle building

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.590 
yourself in an anabolic muscle building
state<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.280> allows<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.970> build<00:02:21.270> lean

state that allows you to build lean

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.780 
state that allows you to build lean
muscle<00:02:22.080> mass<00:02:22.110> when<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.010> eat<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> meal<00:02:23.340> your

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.400 
muscle mass when you eat a meal your
stomach<00:02:24.210> will<00:02:24.390> actually<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.780> empty<00:02:25.170> within

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
stomach will actually be empty within

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.200 
stomach will actually be empty within
about<00:02:25.530> two<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> half<00:02:26.280> hours<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:27.060> your

will keep you growing bigger and
stronger<00:03:04.290> now<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:04.920> can<00:03:05.160> break<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.550> down<00:03:05.850> and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
stronger now we can break this down and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.780 
stronger now we can break this down and
say<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.140> 2<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.530> 4<00:03:07.800> rep<00:03:08.040> range<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.580> for

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
say that the 2 to 4 rep range is for

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.090 
say that the 2 to 4 rep range is for
gaining<00:03:09.060> strength<00:03:09.540> because<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.530> order<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.830> get

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
gaining strength because in order to get

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100 
gaining strength because in order to get
bigger<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.300> stronger<00:03:12.690> along

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
bigger you have to get stronger along

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.220 
bigger you have to get stronger along
the<00:03:13.260> way<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:14.640> 6<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.090> 10<00:03:15.330> rep<00:03:15.570> range<00:03:15.900> is

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the way and the 6 to 10 rep range is

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.960 
the way and the 6 to 10 rep range is
what's<00:03:16.470> going<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.740> build<00:03:16.980> lean<00:03:17.280> muscle<00:03:17.310> mass

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
what's going to build lean muscle mass

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.060 
what's going to build lean muscle mass
now<00:03:18.450> it's<00:03:18.630> best<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.990> hit<00:03:19.170> both<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.500> these<00:03:19.800> rep
