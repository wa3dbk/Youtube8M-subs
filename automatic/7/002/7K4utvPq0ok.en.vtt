00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
legit but that's it how do you rate the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.890 
legit but that's it how do you rate the
graphics<00:03:29.430> well<00:03:29.700> there<00:03:29.970> are<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> ton<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.540> still

nice<00:03:36.450> little<00:03:36.840> animations<00:03:37.500> popping<00:03:38.010> up<00:03:38.160> here

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
nice little animations popping up here

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.810 
nice little animations popping up here
and<00:03:38.550> there<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:39.560> would<00:03:40.560> say<00:03:40.680> visually<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.610> game

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
and there I would say visually the game

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.090 
and there I would say visually the game
looks<00:03:42.120> fine<00:03:42.720> for<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.140> museum<00:03:43.590> kiosk<00:03:44.160> piece<00:03:46.100> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
looks fine for a museum kiosk piece the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.000 
looks fine for a museum kiosk piece the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
sound isn't bad there is so much speech

it's<00:04:12.750> average<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.810> control<00:04:16.760> well<00:04:17.760> it's

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
it's average the control well it's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.479 
it's average the control well it's
mostly<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.690> bunch<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.080> menus<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.070> select

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
mostly a bunch of menus so you select

but honestly if you are interested in
dinosaurs<00:05:19.490> in<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.270> least<00:05:20.599> I<00:05:20.930> think<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.469> does

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
dinosaurs in the least I think it does

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.589 
dinosaurs in the least I think it does
the<00:05:21.680> job<00:05:22.009> well<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.400> has<00:05:22.819> a<00:05:22.849> lot<00:05:23.330> inside<00:05:25.270> so<00:05:26.270> I'm

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
the job well and has a lot inside so I'm

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.499 
the job well and has a lot inside so I'm
rounding<00:05:27.110> up<00:05:27.349> to<00:05:27.590> an<00:05:27.710> average<00:05:27.949> 3<00:05:28.520> out<00:05:28.729> of<00:05:28.759> 5<00:05:29.120> I

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
rounding up to an average 3 out of 5 I

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.469 
rounding up to an average 3 out of 5 I
can't<00:05:30.229> recommend<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.889> necessarily<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.240> will

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
can't recommend it necessarily so I will

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.480 
can't recommend it necessarily so I will
leave<00:05:32.599> it<00:05:32.719> up<00:05:32.810> to<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:33.169> to<00:05:33.409> decide<00:05:33.740> whether<00:05:34.099> you

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
leave it up to you to decide whether you

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.689 
leave it up to you to decide whether you
find<00:05:34.849> this<00:05:35.090> game<00:05:35.389> disappointing<00:05:36.199> or<00:05:36.699> somewhat

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
find this game disappointing or somewhat

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.330 
find this game disappointing or somewhat
magical
