here<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.189> are<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.519> washout<00:00:08.940> sync<00:00:09.210> where<00:00:09.389> we'll

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
here we are the washout sync where we'll

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.089 
here we are the washout sync where we'll
do<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.960> first<00:00:10.170> part<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> preparation

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
do the first part of the preparation

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.520 
do the first part of the preparation
process<00:00:11.250> that's<00:00:11.969> decreasing<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.719> screen<00:00:13.019> now

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
process that's decreasing the screen now

process that's decreasing the screen now
as<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:13.830> explained<00:00:14.280> earlier<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:15.089> very

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
as we explained earlier it's very

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.400 
as we explained earlier it's very
important<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> get<00:00:15.750> all<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.960> contaminants

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
important to get all the contaminants

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.800 
important to get all the contaminants
off<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> screen<00:00:17.010> mesh<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.090> frame<00:00:18.330> itself

off the screen mesh and the frame itself

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
off the screen mesh and the frame itself
before<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.619> coat<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.070> emulsion<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.060> do

before we coat it with emulsion to do
this<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.420> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.660> using<00:00:21.930> neutralized

we're<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> in

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
we're just going to use it in

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.580 
we're just going to use it in
concentrated<00:00:33.390> form<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:34.050> means<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
concentrated form which means we have to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.620 
concentrated form which means we have to
use<00:00:34.770> less<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:36.090> makes<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.510> easy

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
use less of it and it makes it very easy

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.619 
use less of it and it makes it very easy
because<00:00:36.960> all<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.710> plug<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.250> a

the<00:00:58.770> other<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> keep<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.520> mind<00:00:59.579> is<00:01:00.030> if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the other thing to keep in mind is if

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
the other thing to keep in mind is if
you<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> very<00:01:01.079> dirty<00:01:01.500> washed<00:01:01.829> out<00:01:02.070> sink

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you have a very dirty washed out sink

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.090 
you have a very dirty washed out sink
water<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.359> splash<00:01:03.750> off<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.260> dirty<00:01:04.530> signs<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
water can splash off the dirty signs of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.190 
water can splash off the dirty signs of
the<00:01:05.189> sink<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.640> back<00:01:05.880> onto<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.270> frame<00:01:06.659> so

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the sink and back onto your frame so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.750 
the sink and back onto your frame so
it's<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.619> important<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> keep<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.280> washout

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it's very important to keep your washout

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's very important to keep your washout
sink<00:01:09.060> clean<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.659> great<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> keep<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.680> clean

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
sink clean a great way to keep it clean

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.520 
sink clean a great way to keep it clean
is<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.610> actually<00:01:11.760> use<00:01:12.030> liquid<00:01:12.630> renu-it<00:01:13.049> which

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
is to actually use liquid renu-it which

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
is to actually use liquid renu-it which
cleans<00:01:13.830> off<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> edges<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.610> washed<00:01:14.880> out

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
cleans off the edges of your washed out

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
cleans off the edges of your washed out
sink<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.020> keep<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.259> washout<00:01:16.740> screen

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
sink but if you keep your washout screen

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
sink but if you keep your washout screen
sprayed<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.700> after<00:01:18.030> every<00:01:18.060> use<00:01:18.509> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
sprayed down after every use you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
sprayed down after every use you
shouldn't<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.200> much<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.560> problem<00:01:19.950> keeping

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
shouldn't have much of a problem keeping

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.490 
shouldn't have much of a problem keeping
it<00:01:20.340> clean<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> first<00:01:21.869> thing<00:01:22.049> we're<00:01:22.170> gonna<00:01:22.229> do

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it clean the first thing we're gonna do

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.929 
it clean the first thing we're gonna do
to<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> frame<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to the frame is we're going to get it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.300 
to the frame is we're going to get it
away

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.590 

now<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.760> get<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.940> what<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.150> both<00:01:30.330> sides

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
now you can get it what on both sides

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.090 
now you can get it what on both sides
but<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.049> only<00:01:31.260> need<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.950> one

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
but really only need to get it on one

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.039 
but really only need to get it on one
side

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
side

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
side
quickly<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> wet<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.670> then<00:01:35.670> we'll

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
quickly get it wet like that then we'll

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
quickly get it wet like that then we'll
take<00:01:36.030> our<00:01:36.210> degreaser<00:01:37.020> brush<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.619> spray<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
take our degreaser brush and spray a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
take our degreaser brush and spray a
small<00:01:38.729> amount<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.150> degreaser<00:01:39.659> onto<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
small amount of degreaser onto the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.240 
small amount of degreaser onto the
screen<00:01:40.710> mesh

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
screen mesh

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.420 
screen mesh
we'll<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> primed<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> small

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
we'll get this primed up here so a small

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.570 
we'll get this primed up here so a small
amount<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.300> couple<00:01:48.479> squirts<00:01:49.580> then

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
amount is just a couple squirts then

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.850 
amount is just a couple squirts then
we'll<00:01:50.729> agitate<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.330> degreaser<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.590> work<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
we'll agitate the degreaser to work it

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.389 
we'll agitate the degreaser to work it
into<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> mesh<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:54.649> should<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.890> Matt<00:01:56.100> foam

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
into the mesh you should see Matt foam

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.940 
into the mesh you should see Matt foam
slightly<00:02:03.050> next<00:02:04.050> we'll<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.350> back<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
slightly next we'll do the back of the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.310 
slightly next we'll do the back of the
screen<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:06.149> run<00:02:06.360> our<00:02:06.509> brush<00:02:06.750> across<00:02:07.050> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
screen and just run our brush across the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.750 
screen and just run our brush across the
frame<00:02:12.530> that'll<00:02:13.530> take<00:02:13.769> all<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> group<00:02:14.340> degrees

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
frame that'll take all the group degrees

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.330 
frame that'll take all the group degrees
off<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.420> screen<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.200> frame<00:02:16.230> now<00:02:17.130> when

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
off the screen and the frame now when

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.440 
off the screen and the frame now when
you're<00:02:17.459> done<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.880> grease<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> brush

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
you're done with you to grease a brush

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.000 
you're done with you to grease a brush
you<00:02:18.660> want<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> store<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.440> separate<00:02:19.830> area

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
you want to store it in a separate area

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.830 
you want to store it in a separate area
so<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.519> don't<00:02:20.700> put<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.239> dirty<00:02:21.480> part<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
so you don't put it in the dirty part of

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.660 
so you don't put it in the dirty part of
the<00:02:21.900> washout<00:02:22.260> sake<00:02:22.530> either<00:02:23.130> have<00:02:23.310> somewhere

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the washout sake either have somewhere

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.759 
the washout sake either have somewhere
above<00:02:24.030> or<00:02:24.330> somewhere<00:02:24.750> below<00:02:24.900> your<00:02:25.200> sink<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
above or somewhere below your sink or to

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.050 
above or somewhere below your sink or to
the<00:02:25.860> side<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.220> sink<00:02:26.340> where<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.730> store

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the side of the sink where you can store

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.120 
the side of the sink where you can store
it<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.630> clean<00:02:27.840> area<00:02:28.050> we'll<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:28.860> put<00:02:29.040> it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
it in a clean area we'll just put it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.250 
it in a clean area we'll just put it
right<00:02:29.250> up<00:02:29.400> there<00:02:29.519> for<00:02:29.760> now<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.540> important<00:02:31.110> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
right up there for now it's important to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.990 
right up there for now it's important to
get<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> frame<00:02:31.890> too<00:02:32.220> because<00:02:32.489> if<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.730> don't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
get the frame too because if you don't

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.060 
get the frame too because if you don't
get<00:02:33.360> grease<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.750> frame<00:02:34.019> dirty<00:02:34.650> grease

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
get grease to the frame dirty grease

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.560 
get grease to the frame dirty grease
from<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> frame<00:02:35.549> can<00:02:35.760> wash<00:02:35.910> down<00:02:36.150> into<00:02:36.450> your

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
from the frame can wash down into your

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.660 
from the frame can wash down into your
mesh<00:02:36.720> area<00:02:37.079> it's<00:02:37.769> also<00:02:37.920> important<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.459> keep

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
mesh area it's also important to keep

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.280 
mesh area it's also important to keep
your<00:02:38.820> screen<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.329> out<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> water<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
your screen up out of the water on the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.050 
your screen up out of the water on the
bottom<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.799> dirty<00:02:41.040> water<00:02:41.310> doesn't<00:02:41.610> splash

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
bottom so dirty water doesn't splash

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.780 
bottom so dirty water doesn't splash
back<00:02:42.360> up<00:02:42.570> into<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:42.900> screen<00:02:43.290> mesh<00:02:43.519> well<00:02:44.519> start

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
back up into your screen mesh well start

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.699 
back up into your screen mesh well start
rinsing<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.299> frame<00:02:45.540> now<00:02:45.750> start<00:02:46.320> at<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> top

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
rinsing the frame now start at the top

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.930 
rinsing the frame now start at the top
and<00:02:48.950> then<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:49.980> rinse<00:02:50.370> down<00:02:52.430> making<00:02:53.430> sure<00:02:53.700> all

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
and then just rinse down making sure all

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.789 
and then just rinse down making sure all
the<00:02:54.120> degreaser<00:02:54.480> rinses<00:02:55.230> off<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.590> frame

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
the degreaser rinses off of the frame

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.800 
the degreaser rinses off of the frame
it's<00:02:56.489> important<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.970> ensure<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it's important to ensure that all the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.539 
it's important to ensure that all the
degreaser<00:02:58.079> gets<00:02:58.320> out<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.769> mesh<00:02:58.980> because

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
degreaser gets out of the mesh because

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.670 
degreaser gets out of the mesh because
degreaser<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.450> also<00:03:00.690> act<00:03:01.049> as<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.320> barrier

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
degreaser can also act as a barrier

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.900 
degreaser can also act as a barrier
between<00:03:01.829> your<00:03:02.070> emulsion<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.760> don't

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
between your emulsion if you don't

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:16.230 
between your emulsion if you don't
properly<00:03:03.150> clean<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.750> all<00:03:03.900> out<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.200> frame

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.760 

so<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.110> inside<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.780> then<00:03:20.500> we'll<00:03:20.560> do<00:03:20.680> the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
so do the inside and then we'll do the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.720 
so do the inside and then we'll do the
outside<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.550> top

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.210 

and<00:03:28.150> that's<00:03:28.959> really<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.440> that's<00:03:29.770> all<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:29.980> have

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
and that's really it that's all you have

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.680 
and that's really it that's all you have
to<00:03:30.340> do<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.640> greasing<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.060> really<00:03:31.360> quick<00:03:31.540> and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
to do the greasing is really quick and

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.199 
to do the greasing is really quick and
easy<00:03:31.810> but<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> very<00:03:33.069> important<00:03:33.489> part<00:03:33.730> now

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
easy but it is a very important part now

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.790 
easy but it is a very important part now
the<00:03:34.300> other<00:03:34.510> thing<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.840> don't<00:03:34.930> want<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.379> do<00:03:35.560> is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
the other thing you don't want to do is

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.290 
the other thing you don't want to do is
when<00:03:35.980> you're<00:03:36.099> handling<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.519> frame<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:37.150> want

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
when you're handling the frame you want

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.550 
when you're handling the frame you want
to<00:03:37.360> make<00:03:37.450> sure<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.870> your<00:03:37.989> hands<00:03:38.230> are<00:03:38.410> clean

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
to make sure that your hands are clean

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.740 
to make sure that your hands are clean
so<00:03:38.950> quickly<00:03:39.670> rinse<00:03:39.819> off<00:03:40.030> your<00:03:40.209> hands<00:03:40.569> and

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
so quickly rinse off your hands and

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.900 
so quickly rinse off your hands and
ensures<00:03:41.230> there's<00:03:41.470> no<00:03:41.620> soap<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.489> can<00:03:42.700> drip

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
ensures there's no soap that can drip

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.880 
ensures there's no soap that can drip
down<00:03:43.060> into<00:03:43.120> your<00:03:43.510> mesh<00:03:43.720> once<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.620> screens

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
down into your mesh once the screens

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.839 
down into your mesh once the screens
been<00:03:45.099> decreased

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
been decreased

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.640 
been decreased
now<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.420> screens<00:03:46.720> degrees<00:03:47.050> we<00:03:47.410> need<00:03:47.560> to

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
now that the screens degrees we need to

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.589 
now that the screens degrees we need to
let<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:47.920> dry<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.730> obviously<00:03:49.060> can't<00:03:49.330> coat<00:03:49.569> a

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
let it dry you obviously can't coat a

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.059 
let it dry you obviously can't coat a
wet<00:03:49.840> screen<00:03:50.140> with<00:03:50.260> emulsion<00:03:50.560> because<00:03:50.950> they

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
wet screen with emulsion because they

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.890 
wet screen with emulsion because they
have<00:03:51.220> water<00:03:51.430> drips<00:03:51.700> all<00:03:51.880> over<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.390> couple

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
have water drips all over it a couple

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.110 
have water drips all over it a couple
ways<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.140> can<00:03:53.319> do<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:53.620> one<00:03:54.489> way<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:54.849> air

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
ways you can do this one way is air

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.820 
ways you can do this one way is air
pressure<00:03:55.330> this<00:03:55.930> would<00:03:56.140> be<00:03:56.319> if<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:56.799> a

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
pressure this would be if you have a

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.619 
pressure this would be if you have a
really<00:03:57.129> really<00:03:57.280> nice<00:03:57.610> dedicated<00:03:58.209> darkroom

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
really really nice dedicated darkroom

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.820 
really really nice dedicated darkroom
you<00:03:59.049> can<00:03:59.200> blow<00:03:59.349> it<00:03:59.470> out<00:04:01.290> with<00:04:02.290> some<00:04:02.500> air<00:04:02.680> like

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
you can blow it out with some air like

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.740 
you can blow it out with some air like
that<00:04:03.069> now<00:04:03.670> if<00:04:03.819> you're<00:04:03.940> using<00:04:03.970> air<00:04:04.450> pressure

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
that now if you're using air pressure

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.180 
that now if you're using air pressure
you<00:04:04.900> do<00:04:05.260> want<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.560> make<00:04:05.709> sure<00:04:05.739> that<00:04:06.010> you're

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
you do want to make sure that you're

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.949 
you do want to make sure that you're
using<00:04:06.220> an<00:04:06.640> airline<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.239> has<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.390> chiller<00:04:07.750> on

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
using an airline that has a chiller on

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.780 
using an airline that has a chiller on
it<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.590> couple<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.980> water<00:04:09.160> traps<00:04:09.489> in<00:04:09.700> it

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
it and a couple of water traps in it

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.190 
it and a couple of water traps in it
because<00:04:09.940> if<00:04:10.030> you're<00:04:10.209> using<00:04:10.450> dirty<00:04:10.780> water<00:04:11.049> and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
because if you're using dirty water and

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.660 
because if you're using dirty water and
your<00:04:11.349> air<00:04:11.500> compressor<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.010> spraying<00:04:12.430> into

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
your air compressor and spraying into

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.550 
your air compressor and spraying into
the<00:04:12.790> mesh<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.480> doesn't<00:04:13.900> help<00:04:13.989> at<00:04:14.170> all

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
the mesh that doesn't help at all

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.949 
the mesh that doesn't help at all
this<00:04:15.099> would<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.400> for<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.640> really<00:04:15.970> high-end

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
this would be for a really high-end

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.990 
this would be for a really high-end
dedicated<00:04:17.530> darkroom<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.459> would<00:04:18.639> be<00:04:18.790> air

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
dedicated darkroom it would be air

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.340 
dedicated darkroom it would be air
because<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.359> would<00:04:19.479> blow<00:04:19.780> out<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.049> screen

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
because that would blow out the screen

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.980 
because that would blow out the screen
and<00:04:20.590> make<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.100> really<00:04:21.250> fast<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.880> dry<00:04:22.120> what

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
and make it really fast to dry what

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.629 
and make it really fast to dry what
we're<00:04:23.169> gonna<00:04:23.260> do<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:23.860> we're<00:04:24.100> gonna<00:04:24.250> store

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
we're gonna do is this we're gonna store

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.969 
we're gonna do is this we're gonna store
