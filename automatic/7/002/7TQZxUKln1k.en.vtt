insert AC power cord into charger done
then<00:00:41.070> insert<00:00:41.790> AC<00:00:41.969> power<00:00:42.239> cord<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:42.570> wall

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
then insert AC power cord into wall

then insert AC power cord into wall
socket<00:00:43.940> okay<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.379> AC<00:00:46.379> power<00:00:46.680> cord<00:00:47.480> well<00:00:48.500> suck

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
socket okay so AC power cord well suck

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.479 
socket okay so AC power cord well suck
it<00:00:50.180> done<00:00:52.969> then<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.210> says<00:00:54.530> Cilla<00:00:55.530> oh<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.340> got

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.459 
it done then it says Cilla oh we got
some<00:00:56.730> flashing<00:00:57.360> some<00:00:57.660> flashing<00:00:58.140> green

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
some flashing some flashing green

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.580 
some flashing some flashing green
flashing<00:00:59.570> okay<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.840> says<00:01:01.050> select<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
flashing okay so it says select the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.260 
flashing okay so it says select the
battery<00:01:01.949> type<00:01:02.570> lipo<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.780> life<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:05.029> mine<00:01:06.029> is<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
battery type lipo or life and mine is a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.139 
battery type lipo or life and mine is a
liposuction<00:01:07.049> battery<00:01:08.039> so<00:01:10.759> select<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.850> proper

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
liposuction battery so select the proper

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.569 
liposuction battery so select the proper
charging<00:01:12.539> current<00:01:12.810> -<00:01:13.529> has<00:01:13.649> a<00:01:13.679> 50<00:01:14.009> 100<00:01:14.159> milli

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
charging current - has a 50 100 milli

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.389 
charging current - has a 50 100 milli
amp<00:01:14.789> power<00:01:14.969> so<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:16.469> assuming<00:01:16.829> that<00:01:17.039> means

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
amp power so I'm assuming that means

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.260 
amp power so I'm assuming that means
that<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.819> 5<00:01:18.119> amps<00:01:18.749> so<00:01:19.159> I<00:01:20.159> did<00:01:20.849> charge<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that I'm 5 amps so I did charge it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
that I'm 5 amps so I did charge it
originally<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.319> amp<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.889> I<00:01:22.920> guess<00:01:23.099> we<00:01:23.249> go

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
originally on one amp but I guess we go

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.649 
originally on one amp but I guess we go
to<00:01:23.429> three<00:01:23.990> okay<00:01:25.999> then<00:01:26.999> it<00:01:27.119> says<00:01:27.299> connect<00:01:27.569> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to three okay then it says connect the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.499 
to three okay then it says connect the
battery<00:01:27.959> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> main<00:01:28.669> charge<00:01:29.669> leads<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.300 

yeah<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.779> then<00:01:34.079> put<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.499> battery

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
yeah and then put in the battery

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.419 
yeah and then put in the battery
balancer<00:01:36.029> so<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.359> want<00:01:36.599> to<00:01:36.689> connect<00:01:37.429> these

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
balancer so you want to connect these

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.730 
balancer so you want to connect these
two<00:01:38.729> leads<00:01:38.999> pause<00:01:39.389> a<00:01:39.419> negative<00:01:39.959> read<00:01:40.169> positive

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
two leads pause a negative read positive

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.239 
two leads pause a negative read positive
negative<00:01:41.639> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.990> connect<00:01:43.319> this<00:01:43.499> and<00:01:43.859> then<00:01:44.189> we

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
negative and I connect this and then we

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.269 
negative and I connect this and then we
want<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.429> connect<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.739> over<00:01:46.739> here

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:47.279 
want to connect this over here

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.789 
want to connect this over here
okay<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.270> let's<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.779> that<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.169> do<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.590> them

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
okay so let's do that so I do have them

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
okay so let's do that so I do have them
connected<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.669> let's<00:01:51.149> go<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.419> to<00:01:51.599> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
connected now let's go back to the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.800 
connected now let's go back to the
instruction<00:01:52.679> manual<00:01:53.189> charge<00:01:53.639> the<00:01:54.450> charger

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
instruction manual charge the charger

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.429 
instruction manual charge the charger
starts<00:01:55.079> charging<00:01:55.289> charge<00:01:55.819> status<00:01:56.819> LED<00:01:57.439> will

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
starts charging charge status LED will

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
starts charging charge status LED will
glow<00:01:58.520> constant<00:01:59.520> red<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.029> better<00:02:00.270> pack<00:02:00.509> two

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
glow constant red is better pack two

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.120 
glow constant red is better pack two
cells<00:02:00.959> blah<00:02:01.169> blah<00:02:01.799> okay<00:02:02.279> so<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.669> one<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
cells blah blah okay so this one is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.270 
cells blah blah okay so this one is
three<00:02:05.130> cell<00:02:05.429> obviously<00:02:06.209> because<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:08.009> one's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
three cell obviously because that one's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.059 
three cell obviously because that one's
not<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.269> those<00:02:09.539> three<00:02:09.959> are<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.409> we're

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
not on and those three are and we're

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.500 
not on and those three are and we're
charging<00:02:11.549> which<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.000> interesting<00:02:12.239> because

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
charging which is interesting because
