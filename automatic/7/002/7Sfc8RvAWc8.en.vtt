00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
or white and the other reason being a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.219 
or white and the other reason being a
bit<00:01:47.520> crazy<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.149> humans<00:01:48.509> remember<00:01:48.869> colors

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
bit crazy but humans remember colors

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.810 
bit crazy but humans remember colors
more<00:01:49.500> than<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.799> black<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.310> white<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.700> I'm

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
more than they do black or white so I'm

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.609 
more than they do black or white so I'm
like<00:01:51.030> oh<00:01:51.149> my<00:01:51.329> gosh<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.409> there
