i'm not completely sure on those on
obviously<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.200> added<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.649> with

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
obviously what they added here with

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.200 
obviously what they added here with
smash<00:00:47.039> run<00:00:47.250> codes<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.670> says<00:00:47.789> please<00:00:47.910> make<00:00:48.180> sure

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
smash run codes it says please make sure

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
smash run codes it says please make sure
to<00:00:48.360> create<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> backup<00:00:48.930> data<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> return<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
to create a backup data to return to the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.130 
to create a backup data to return to the
original<00:00:50.070> state<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.329> says<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.750> powers

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
original state and that says all powers

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.240 
original state and that says all powers
which<00:00:52.350> will<00:00:52.500> essentially<00:00:52.800> give<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> all

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
which will essentially give you all

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.700 
which will essentially give you all
powers<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:54.059> eat<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:55.110> different<00:00:55.500> codes

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
powers now eat you has different codes

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189 
powers now eat you has different codes
right<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.190> which<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.910> can't<00:00:57.510> show<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.719> right

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.709 
right now which I can't show you right
this<00:00:58.379> second<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.239> they<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.449> codes

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this second but they have codes

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
this second but they have codes
essentially<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.379> badges<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.100> will<00:01:02.430> replace

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
essentially for badges that will replace

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.100 
essentially for badges that will replace
your<00:01:02.940> other<00:01:02.969> badges<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.510> will<00:01:03.750> make<00:01:03.899> like

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
your other badges that will make like

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.980 
your other badges that will make like
more<00:01:04.379> powerful<00:01:05.479> what<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> called<00:01:06.780> where

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
more powerful what is it called where

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
more powerful what is it called where
where<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:08.220> powerful<00:01:08.700> something

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
where is it more powerful something

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.440 
where is it more powerful something
special<00:01:09.840> something<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.100> uh<00:01:11.450> I'm

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
for those in you and EU you can have a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.969 
for those in you and EU you can have a
few<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.470> codes<00:01:19.740> than<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> power

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
few more codes than we do this is power

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.859 
few more codes than we do this is power
play<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.520> power<00:01:23.700> saves<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> same<00:01:24.540> exact

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
play not power saves it's the same exact

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
play not power saves it's the same exact
program<00:01:25.080> sold<00:01:26.070> under<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> different<00:01:26.790> name<00:01:26.970> with

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
program sold under a different name with

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
program sold under a different name with
a<00:01:27.330> different<00:01:27.500> device<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> same

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
a different device it's really the same

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
a different device it's really the same
thing<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.820> i<00:01:29.850> downloaded<00:01:30.060> both<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> sometimes

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
thing so i downloaded both and sometimes

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.210 
thing so i downloaded both and sometimes
i<00:01:31.079> switch<00:01:31.290> between<00:01:31.500> them<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> big

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
i switch between them it's not a big

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
i switch between them it's not a big
deal<00:01:32.250> still<00:01:32.670> power<00:01:32.850> saves<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:34.110> was

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
deal still power saves really it was

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.600 
deal still power saves really it was
just<00:01:34.259> meant<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.710> pokemon<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.340> stupid

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
just meant for pokemon but it's stupid

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.240 
just meant for pokemon but it's stupid
so<00:01:36.090> anyway<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:40.100> i'm<00:01:41.100> gonna

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so anyway that's that and i'm gonna

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.109 
so anyway that's that and i'm gonna
apply<00:01:41.369> these<00:01:41.610> codes<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:45.000> what

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
apply these codes and then you know what

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.469 
apply these codes and then you know what
we'll<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:46.700> not<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.880> because<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.450> have

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
we'll do not that because we don't have

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
um yeah that was it so let's do this

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.830 
um yeah that was it so let's do this
this<00:02:08.979> actually<00:02:09.220> use<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.670> same<00:02:10.030> card<00:02:10.450> for<00:02:10.750> my

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
this actually use the same card for my

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.840 
this actually use the same card for my
3ds<00:02:11.350> as<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.830> do<00:02:11.890> with<00:02:14.280> our<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> same<00:02:15.610> cable

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
3ds as I do with our the same cable

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.670
