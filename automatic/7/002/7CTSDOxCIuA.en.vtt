00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
parallel to Byrd Street okay so we had

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.000 
parallel to Byrd Street okay so we had

on<00:00:23.100> birch<00:00:23.369> tree<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.850> did<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.090> fact<00:00:24.300> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
on birch tree so you did in fact you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.000 
on birch tree so you did in fact you
feel<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.410> safety

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
feel that it that's safety

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
feel that it that's safety
I<00:00:26.039> think<00:00:26.670> we're<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.029> we're<00:00:27.330> clearly<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
I think we're and we're clearly in the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.570 
I think we're and we're clearly in the
same<00:00:28.349> neighborhood<00:00:28.800> okay

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
same neighborhood okay

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.840 
same neighborhood okay
and<00:00:29.699> how<00:00:30.150> big<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.869> mean<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.850> you

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and how big was it I mean you know you

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
and how big was it I mean you know you
know<00:00:32.910> he<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.149> moving<00:00:33.329> quickly<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.320> quickly

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
know he was moving quickly very quickly

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
know he was moving quickly very quickly
gracefully<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.520> quickly<00:00:35.940> I'd<00:00:36.750> say<00:00:37.050> it's

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
gracefully and quickly I'd say it's

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.190 
gracefully and quickly I'd say it's
probably<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:38.010> easily<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.300> torso<00:00:40.020> was

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
probably it's easily the torso was

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.280 
probably it's easily the torso was
probably<00:00:40.920> close<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> four<00:00:41.820> feet<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.149> length<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
probably close to four feet in length a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.060 
probably close to four feet in length a
couple<00:00:44.070> feet<00:00:44.250> high<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.030> height<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
couple feet high about the height of a

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.819 
couple feet high about the height of a
German<00:00:47.070> Shepherd<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:47.809> golden<00:00:48.809> retriever<00:00:49.320> Wow

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
German Shepherd or golden retriever Wow

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.600 
German Shepherd or golden retriever Wow
okay<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.809> but<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.110> ran<00:00:52.649> right<00:00:52.829> by<00:00:53.010> ran<00:00:53.460> by

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
okay and but it just ran right by ran by

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.430 
okay and but it just ran right by ran by
went<00:00:54.270> over<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> wall<00:00:54.750> went<00:00:54.989> through<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.410> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
went over a wall went through what I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
went over a wall went through what I
think<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> went<00:00:56.430> through<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> wasn't

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
think it went through because it wasn't

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080 
think it went through because it wasn't
right<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> gate<00:00:59.820> there

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
right up to it and what was a gate there

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
right up to it and what was a gate there
wouldn't<00:01:00.960> gate<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> could<00:01:01.770> could<00:01:02.609> have

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
wouldn't gate that it could could have

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.950 
wouldn't gate that it could could have
gotten<00:01:02.910> through<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> gate<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.660> there

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
gotten through the gate because there

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.520 
gotten through the gate because there
are<00:01:04.019> gaps<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> gate<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.570> or<00:01:06.570> certainly

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
are gaps in the gate and or certainly

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.460 
are gaps in the gate and or certainly
capable<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.100> jumping<00:01:08.490> over<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
capable of jumping over it right and I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.870 
capable of jumping over it right and I
