00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
pave low like I always do in my opinion

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.470 
pave low like I always do in my opinion
the<00:03:33.540> most<00:03:33.570> exciting<00:03:34.519> assault<00:03:35.519> package<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.180> use

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
the most exciting assault package to use

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.220 
the most exciting assault package to use
I<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.930> know<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.200> could<00:03:37.440> have<00:03:37.530> used<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:38.040> Reaper

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
I you know I could have used like Reaper

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.900 
I you know I could have used like Reaper
ac-130<00:03:40.230> osprey<00:03:41.010> gun<00:03:41.190> or<00:03:41.370> something<00:03:41.459> like<00:03:41.850> that

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
ac-130 osprey gun or something like that

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.569 
ac-130 osprey gun or something like that
but<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.570> my<00:03:42.840> opinion<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> little

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
but in my opinion that this is a little

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.240 
but in my opinion that this is a little
bit<00:03:44.730> more<00:03:44.880> exciting<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.620> enemy<00:03:46.980> spawn

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
bit more exciting in the enemy spawn

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.550 
bit more exciting in the enemy spawn
more<00:03:47.519> more<00:03:48.390> gunfights<00:03:48.840> more<00:03:49.140> kills<00:03:49.350> with<00:03:49.470> my

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
more more gunfights more kills with my

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.580 
more more gunfights more kills with my
gun<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.209> it's<00:03:51.209> yeah<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.049> pretty<00:03:52.230> exciting

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
gun and it's yeah it's pretty exciting

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.390 
gun and it's yeah it's pretty exciting
in<00:03:53.130> my<00:03:53.310> opinion<00:03:53.640> but<00:03:53.760> um<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.530> also<00:03:56.010> going

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
in my opinion but um this is also going

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.509 
in my opinion but um this is also going
to<00:03:56.489> be<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.799> wasn't<00:03:59.010> going<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.340> do<00:03:59.489> this

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
to be and I wasn't going to do this

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.940 
to be and I wasn't going to do this
until<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.329> got<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.750> gameplay<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.470> got<00:04:01.769> it

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
until I got this gameplay so I got it

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
they went like 26 and 40 or something

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.060
