00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.460 
fin I'm good to do green on the top and
bottom<00:02:28.520> but<00:02:29.420> I'm<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.690> switch<00:02:30.020> things<00:02:30.260> up

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
bottom but I'm going to switch things up

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
which is totally different from the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.970 
which is totally different from the
movie<00:02:35.240> but<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.510> think<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.810> looks<00:02:35.990> super<00:02:36.380> pretty

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
movie but I think it looks super pretty

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.440 
movie but I think it looks super pretty
that<00:02:37.280> way<00:02:37.960> love<00:02:38.960> it<00:02:39.400> now<00:02:40.400> let's<00:02:40.670> move<00:02:40.850> on<00:02:41.120> to

that way love it now let's move on to
the<00:02:41.600> top<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.290> her<00:02:42.770> mermaid<00:02:43.489> fin<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
the top of her mermaid fin and in the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.380 
the top of her mermaid fin and in the
movie<00:02:45.320> this<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.920> green<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:46.880> don't<00:02:47.180> want<00:02:47.300> it

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
movie this is green but I don't want it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.180 
movie this is green but I don't want it
to<00:02:47.570> like<00:02:47.690> blend<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.230> in<00:02:48.350> too<00:02:48.590> much<00:02:48.770> so<00:02:49.100> I'm

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
to like blend it in too much so I'm

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.030 
to like blend it in too much so I'm
going<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.459> do<00:02:49.670> dark<00:02:50.120> purple<00:02:50.810> here<00:02:51.260> looks

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040
