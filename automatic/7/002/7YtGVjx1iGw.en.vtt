00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello welcome to the board 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.940
 in this class I will talk about the system 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 blood nm and mail 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 I'll tell you how this one 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.189
 The system was discovered in 927 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 call nor stein injected blood from 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 several people in rabbits and after 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.540
 collect the serum 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.050
 these animals he realized that they 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.370
 had produced two types of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.520
 antibodies 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:48.630
 the anti anti mo in knowingly it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.560
 concluded that people produce in their 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.740
 RBCs two types of proteins that are 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.190
 the agglutinated geniuses or genius type 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.010
 m and the antigen type it oacute 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.589
 today it is known that a gene with two alleles 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.710
 responsible for the production of these 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:15.539
 they are the allele of gm produces the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.869
 hallucinogen m and the gene allele that 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.630
 It produces the last genius in between these 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.619
 two alleles there is a condominium relationship 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.219
 people who are the GM and the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.659
 genes produce the two proteins 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.289
 protein s 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 As for the protein m given, let's 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:44.869
 relate a genotype to each group 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:51.060
 blood 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:55.249
 the genii a gemini produce only the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.659
 belong to the group in 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:03.810
 people 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:09.929
 the genii act only produce the protein 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:15.900
 m belonging to the group in and people 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.150
 the gemini a gn produce the two proteins 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.560
 and belong to the group 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.170
 it now that we already know the relationship between 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.110
 hypnotic genotype 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.480
 Let's see what the possible rennÃ³ 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.980
 types of the children of a mn couple or 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:43.430
 a man 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.430
 We are gene with a woman. 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.010
 the genius people 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.650
 according to Mendel's first law 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.709
 these two alleles are separated 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.769
 during the formation of gametes then the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.769
 man produces two types of gametes the age 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:19.549
 as the genotype of the woman is similar 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:24.419
 the gametes will be the same male 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:27.480
 this picture has been brought to 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:32.519
 organize genotypes of children 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:36.540
 now you have the 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:41.909
 people to people 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:48.449
 the goal in current account of the goal then 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:53.930
 gn and cursing meets with this 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.930
 planet then we have g 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.500
 who then can see that at the intersection 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.780
 between two people with group m &amp; m all 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.370
 other blood groups may 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.380
 appear in children 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.489
 the group m in one of the four 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:31.580
 the group n 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:33.889
 also in 14 and the group in me in 2007 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.199
 the result then reflected in co 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.819
 dominance in which these two alleles of the 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.830
 mm system 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.900
 I hope you have understood 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.900
 good studies and even more
