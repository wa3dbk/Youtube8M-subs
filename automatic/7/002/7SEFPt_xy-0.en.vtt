00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.300 
and this is actually three instead of
four<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.910> one<00:02:42.150> two<00:02:42.530> three<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.280> you

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
four so it's one two three and then you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.930 
four so it's one two three and then you
lift<00:02:44.670> your<00:02:45.420> first<00:02:45.630> finger<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.890> put<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
lift your first finger and put it on the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.280 
lift your first finger and put it on the
E<00:02:47.970> string<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.690> then<00:02:49.530> that's<00:02:50.209> 44<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.540> then

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
E string and then that's 44 and then

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:02.080 
E string and then that's 44 and then
back<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.770> start<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:55.340> 1234<00:02:57.050> 1234<00:02:59.630> 1234

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
back to the start so it's 1234 1234 1234

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:16.930 
back to the start so it's 1234 1234 1234
1234<00:03:04.610> 1234<00:03:06.440> switch<00:03:09.350> 1234<00:03:10.700> 1234<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:14.780> ok<00:03:15.780> and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
1234 1234 switch 1234 1234 that ok and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.280 
1234 1234 switch 1234 1234 that ok and
you<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.269> be<00:03:18.360> hard<00:03:18.600> for<00:03:19.050> me<00:03:19.140> it

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
you know it's going to be hard for me it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.660 
you know it's going to be hard for me it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
was hard to get the transition if you're

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.280 
was hard to get the transition if you're
beginner<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.269> hard<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.600> get<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.780> transition

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
beginner it's hard to get the transition

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.100
