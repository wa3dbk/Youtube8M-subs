00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.190 
here by just clicking bonemeal on the
floor<00:03:43.950> but<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.700> can<00:03:44.880> also<00:03:45.060> make<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:46.170> a

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
floor but you can also make like a

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.490 
floor but you can also make like a
shifting<00:03:46.890> floor<00:03:47.220> design<00:03:47.640> with<00:03:48.210> pistons<00:03:49.110> there

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
shifting floor design with pistons there

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.280 
shifting floor design with pistons there
and<00:03:49.740> pistons<00:03:50.580> there<00:03:51.000> these<00:03:51.720> ones<00:03:52.050> are

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
and pistons there these ones are

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.380 
and pistons there these ones are
extended<00:03:52.890> then<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.550> have<00:03:53.670> grass<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.270> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
extended then you have grass in the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.680 
extended then you have grass in the
middle<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:54.980> then<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.250> basically<00:03:56.490> pushes<00:03:57.270> back

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
middle and then it basically pushes back

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.290 
middle and then it basically pushes back
and<00:03:57.960> forth<00:03:58.200> back<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.560> forth<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.280> if<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.060> then

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
and forth back and forth and if you then

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.840 
and forth back and forth and if you then
place<00:04:00.570> bonemeal<00:04:01.110> on<00:04:01.260> top<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.250> will

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
place bonemeal on top of that it will

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.000 
place bonemeal on top of that it will
grow<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.300> if<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.810> gets<00:04:04.020> pushed<00:04:04.320> everything

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
grow and if it gets pushed everything

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.640 
grow and if it gets pushed everything
will<00:04:05.430> fall<00:04:05.730> off<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.570> can<00:04:06.780> collect<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.290> click

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
will fall off you can collect it click

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.430 
will fall off you can collect it click
on<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:07.950> again<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.610> again<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.450> again<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.140> get
