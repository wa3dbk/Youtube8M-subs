00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.360
 hello very good today in this video 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.670
 we will make another drawing about the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.279
 Christmas theme that will consist in drawing 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.470
 a Christmas sock with some 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.280
 Gifts inside 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.040
 we will start doing 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.250
 this line so draw in the form of 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.250
 sock 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:39.280
 so this other curve around here and we'll go up 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.290
 we will make this curve in this area this 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.410
 another around here we will draw these lines 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.120
 both in this curve and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.300
 is and now they began to draw the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.790
 gifts we will make a bear more or less 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.650
 this day distance 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.670
 well and so we would do the first of the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.939
 arms up more or less around here 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.520
 and the second until more or less the same 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.359
 we would do now 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.359
 here 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.480
 so we would do the first of the ears of 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.430
 this one over here and the shape of the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.430
 head we will draw the snout 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 A) Yes 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.330
 over here these two things inside 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.350
 of the ears 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:46.480
 well and so and eyes areas 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.650
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.690
 and this work and so we will finish 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.850
 draw the top of tim 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.600
 we would be like this 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.900
 and this side equal 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.820
 well for example on this side cane 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.069
 candy 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.690
 around here we will return 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.230
 and divide based cutting area 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.230
 A) Yes 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.109
 here 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:26.700
 and so now we will make a gift 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.700
 in this part 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:35.330
 well we will do here 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.940
 tie like that and a stripe we'll make another 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.090
 gift will be this way as well 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.090
 behind 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.750
 we would do the same 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.600
 That way he 's out there 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.270
 these lines around here and the fringe like 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.280
 if you went down and we would have this from this 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.580
 so easy and simple way this sock 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.530
 Christmas I hope you liked it 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.870
 it has been simple to realize you 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.260
 this drawing and see you in my next 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.260
