this<00:00:15.719> map<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> walls<00:00:17.160> pal<00:00:17.640> condition

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
this map this is the walls pal condition

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.820 
this map this is the walls pal condition
there<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.690> couple<00:00:18.810> other<00:00:20.180> versions<00:00:21.830> but

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
there are a couple other versions but

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.660 
there are a couple other versions but
yeah<00:00:23.869> anyway<00:00:24.980> this<00:00:25.980> map<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.369> made<00:00:26.430> by

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
yeah anyway this map was made by

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.300 
yeah anyway this map was made by
skeletons<00:00:27.210> gaming<00:00:27.689> he<00:00:28.109> makes<00:00:28.289> some<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.949> nice

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
skeletons gaming he makes some very nice

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.330 
skeletons gaming he makes some very nice
maps<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.210> yeah<00:00:32.000> just<00:00:33.000> uh<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.899> rules<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
maps so yeah just uh some rules then you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
maps so yeah just uh some rules then you
touch<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.329> make<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.719> down<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
touch the or to make it go down so I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:48.709 
touch the or to make it go down so I
think<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:39.920> whoops<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> anyway<00:00:46.039> these<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.719> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
think that whoops so anyway these are it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.209 
think that whoops so anyway these are it
so<00:00:49.680> I'm<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:49.950> sure<00:00:50.160> when<00:00:50.430> timer<00:00:50.730> starts

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
so I'm not really sure when timer starts

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.299 
so I'm not really sure when timer starts
so<00:00:53.219> yeah<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:55.789> don't<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.969> there's<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.360> literal

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
so yeah I don't think there's a literal

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
so yeah I don't think there's a literal
timer<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:00:59.969> pretty<00:01:00.210> sure

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
timer that you can see I'm pretty sure

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:10.789 
timer that you can see I'm pretty sure
it<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.510> time<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> though<00:01:03.379> let's<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:09.799> think

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it is time to though let's see I think

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.149 
it is time to though let's see I think
there's<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.820> actual<00:01:12.060> timer<00:01:12.950> anyway<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
there's an actual timer anyway so you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.760 
there's an actual timer anyway so you
have<00:01:14.280> 15<00:01:14.700> minutes<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.320> i'm<00:01:16.320> pretty<00:01:16.530> sure

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
have 15 minutes and i'm pretty sure

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.100 
have 15 minutes and i'm pretty sure
there's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:18.290> hey<00:01:20.780> yeah<00:01:21.780> there's<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.049> redstone

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
there's a hey yeah there's a redstone

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.700 
there's a hey yeah there's a redstone
thing<00:01:25.110> over<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.430> Wow<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> big<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.470> anyway

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
thing over here Wow is a big so anyway

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
thing over here Wow is a big so anyway
yeah<00:01:31.950> I'm<00:01:32.670> pretty<00:01:32.970> sure<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.390> part<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
yeah I'm pretty sure this is part of the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.160 
yeah I'm pretty sure this is part of the
alternate<00:01:34.530> redstone<00:01:36.470> yeah<00:01:38.329> yup<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.720> once<00:01:42.990> all

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
alternate redstone yeah yup and once all

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.499 
alternate redstone yeah yup and once all
that<00:01:43.350> goes<00:01:43.560> through<00:01:43.860> it'll<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.579> 15<00:01:44.790> minutes<00:01:45.329> so

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that goes through it'll be 15 minutes so

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:54.670 
that goes through it'll be 15 minutes so
you<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.560> much<00:01:46.740> time<00:01:48.140> until<00:01:50.750> whoo

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680
