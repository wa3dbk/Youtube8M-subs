00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
away from where the sphere lands and our

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.100 
away from where the sphere lands and our
feral<00:03:10.290> tank<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:10.800> tries<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.850> get<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.870> dog

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
feral tank here tries to get the dog

feral tank here tries to get the dog
into<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.970> crystal<00:03:14.970> trap<00:03:15.269> around<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.720> time

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
into a crystal trap around that time

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350 
into a crystal trap around that time
because<00:03:16.620> what<00:03:17.310> rippln<00:03:17.670> will<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.000> he'll

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
because what rippln will do is he'll

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.880 
because what rippln will do is he'll
retrieve<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.640> spear<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.930> this

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
retrieve the the spear and so this

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.430 
retrieve the the spear and so this
allows<00:03:23.010> both<00:03:23.340> tanks<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:24.120> reset<00:03:24.959> their<00:03:25.110> stacks

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
allows both tanks to reset their stacks

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.060 
allows both tanks to reset their stacks
and<00:03:27.019> not<00:03:28.019> have<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.320> worry<00:03:28.380> about<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.830> whole

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070
