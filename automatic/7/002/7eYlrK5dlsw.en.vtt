practice<00:00:42.960> sharing<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.219> important<00:00:45.210> in

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
practice sharing it is important in

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.650 
practice sharing it is important in
order<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> speak<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.289> those<00:00:47.000> actors<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.420> the

order to speak to those actors in the
supply<00:00:48.899> chain<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.500> also<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.180> politicians<00:00:51.180> for

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
supply chain but also to politicians for

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.270 
supply chain but also to politicians for
example<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> commissure<00:00:52.199> frittata<00:00:52.710> test<00:00:53.129> in

example the commissure frittata test in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.950 
example the commissure frittata test in
here<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.270> important<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here so it's important to get the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.229 
here so it's important to get the
messages<00:00:55.559> across<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.550> learn<00:00:56.850> from

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
messages across and to really learn from

each other and spread out the messages

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.840 
each other and spread out the messages
to<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> world<00:00:59.910> packaging<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
to the world packaging is really

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.509 
to the world packaging is really
important<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.750> part<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.860> sub<00:01:05.100> suite<00:01:05.369> of

tools to help produce food waste I mean
it's<00:01:08.610> obvious<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.240> need<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> packaging

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it's obvious that you need a packaging

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.490 
it's obvious that you need a packaging
of<00:01:10.460> some<00:01:11.460> kind<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.909> most<00:01:12.060> products<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.780> keep

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
of some kind for most products to keep

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.010 
of some kind for most products to keep
it<00:01:13.650> safe<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.070> keep<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.400> high<00:01:14.549> genic<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.330> protect

the product and what we've seen in the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
the product and what we've seen in the
UK<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.619> good<00:01:19.860> innovation<00:01:20.400> by<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
UK is some really good innovation by the

functionality<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.220> reclosable<00:01:30.079> packaging

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
functionality like reclosable packaging

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
functionality like reclosable packaging
that<00:01:31.259> means<00:01:31.409> consumers<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:32.009> keep<00:01:32.220> products

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that means consumers can keep products

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.999 
that means consumers can keep products
fresher<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.060> longer<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> new

create the food into the edible food and
that's<00:02:41.550> why<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.820> was<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.810> conversations<00:02:43.380> that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
that's why it was the conversations that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.020 
that's why it was the conversations that
I've<00:02:43.590> had<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> evidence<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.459> I've<00:02:44.730> seen

I've had in the evidence that I've seen

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.990 
I've had in the evidence that I've seen
definitely<00:02:45.360> suggests<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.260> well-designed

definitely suggests that well-designed
packaging<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:49.650> an<00:02:49.769> increase<00:02:50.070> in

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
packaging you know an increase in

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.620 
packaging you know an increase in
packaging<00:02:50.640> or<00:02:50.760> perhaps<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:51.060> couple<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.420> grams

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
packaging or perhaps a couple of grams

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.860 
packaging or perhaps a couple of grams
can<00:02:52.080> prevent<00:02:52.950> food<00:02:53.310> waste<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:54.120> has<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> much

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
can prevent food waste that has a much

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.140 
can prevent food waste that has a much
bigger<00:02:55.080> environmental<00:02:55.800> impact<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:57.090> know

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
bigger environmental impact and I know

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.809 
bigger environmental impact and I know
the<00:02:57.450> figure<00:02:57.900> that's<00:02:58.080> quoted<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.650> food<00:02:59.610> waste

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
the figure that's quoted is food waste

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.400 
the figure that's quoted is food waste
has<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> 10<00:03:00.300> fold<00:03:00.540> greater<00:03:00.989> environmental

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
has a 10 fold greater environmental

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.170 
has a 10 fold greater environmental
impact<00:03:02.040> than<00:03:02.280> than<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> packaging<00:03:03.150> that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
impact than than the packaging that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.990 
impact than than the packaging that
surrounds<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> lot<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:05.370> expert<00:03:05.820> I've

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
surrounds it so a lot of not expert I've

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.090 
surrounds it so a lot of not expert I've
certainly<00:03:06.360> agree<00:03:06.630> with<00:03:06.780> what<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:06.989> heard<00:03:07.230> my<00:03:07.890> key

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
certainly agree with what I heard my key

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.170
