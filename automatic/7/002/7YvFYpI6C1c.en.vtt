00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 I'm going to talk about the two 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.279
 I'm sure that the same 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.170
 Mexican women are very different from moms 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.730
 from the rest of the world to start mom 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.380
 Mexican has that funny part 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 that is to blackmail by everyone always and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.299
 dried like one of these days already new 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 find and have to do and the worst is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.570
 that works because you feel bad 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 because he 's at a party, it 's like nothing 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 mom is not going to leave now do not leave 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.369
 but one of these days you're not going to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.080
 find and see if I go there 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.420
 let's thanks you allow you have to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.020
 leave another typical phrase of mom is clear 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.579
 and here you have your maid mom 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.030
 I just asked you if I was ready 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.040
 dinner treating me as a servant and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 just right with the wax does not happen to you 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 say that you do not want to eat what you 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.290
 they served because they do not start it how many 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.660
 children are not dying 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.150
 and you wasting food but not 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.760
 were your cracklings cited because this 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.950
 If you really eat them their chicha rites 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.890
 because that is another always assured me 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.490
 embroidered as chicha rites or how it continues 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 the faith and he will give me the patatÃºs to me 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.360
 or things as they are sticking wins 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.400
 I feel that many women get pregnant 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.260
 because they know that being a mom excuses 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.760
 a lot of things because they know that a 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.470
 mom is going to forgive everything then 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.770
 they can make mistakes as many times as they want 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.320
 how to see that I'm pregnant I can 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.760
 take bad photos if I want 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.830
 because that 's always you want to fight 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.870
 with your mom ask her to take a photo 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.320
 we all have a well-being in which 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.320
 we are like this 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.360
 you ask them to take a picture of you and 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.360
 you say it's usually a and this is a 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.180
 apart from that magic of solving everything with 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.850
 a single phrase up a sandwich 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.390
 my mom I'm hungry until a sandwich 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.710
 in the hand of the head well a sandwich 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.950
 a sandwich mom lost a leg 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.690
 action blood the fat since you go to the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.850
 kitchen to make a sandwich pulls out another 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.080
 phrase that is of championship and picks up the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.080
 kitchen that I just cleaned
