 [Music] 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.930
 I do not want to keep playing that I thought 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.570
 that it was unfair that rossi found him 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.879
 I did not say where you were hiding alone 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.590
 I have come to look for my jacket to life 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.370
 who was hiding under the table 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 the kitchen 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.699
 Rossi knows that it is time for a nap 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.229
 where are you going mom I go from the supermarket you 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.479

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.739

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.729

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.590

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.780

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.780
 Mom says we need money 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.840
 here you are ready to go, look, mom, you 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.950
 money will be better than what you put in the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.950
 you will lose it 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.860
 that I thought I was older to go 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.880
 in the supermarket cart I preferred 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.460
 push your own cart and fill it 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.530
 for darling more slowly I have a list 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.869

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.270

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.720
