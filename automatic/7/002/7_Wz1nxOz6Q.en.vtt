is<00:00:14.750> one<00:00:14.869> of<00:00:14.959> the<00:00:15.020> biggest<00:00:15.199> features<00:00:15.709> of<00:00:15.949> the

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
is one of the biggest features of the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.680 
is one of the biggest features of the
new<00:00:16.400> software<00:00:16.880> update<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:17.360> i<00:00:17.390> thought<00:00:17.539> i'd

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
new software update and i thought i'd

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.060 
new software update and i thought i'd
just<00:00:17.720> give<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.080> a<00:00:18.109> little<00:00:18.230> preview<00:00:18.500> of<00:00:18.800> what

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
just give you a little preview of what

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.560 
just give you a little preview of what
you<00:00:19.160> can<00:00:19.280> expect<00:00:19.340> when<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:19.940> software<00:00:20.300> update

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
you can expect when the software update

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.530 
you can expect when the software update
goes<00:00:20.720> live<00:00:20.930> for<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.230> public<00:00:21.620> this<00:00:21.950> summer<00:00:22.540> so

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
goes live for the public this summer so

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.600 
goes live for the public this summer so
let's<00:00:24.260> say<00:00:24.320> i<00:00:24.440> wanted<00:00:24.620> to<00:00:24.740> watch<00:00:24.890> pandora<00:00:27.610> now

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
let's say i wanted to watch pandora now

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.580 
let's say i wanted to watch pandora now
previously<00:00:29.090> what<00:00:29.450> would<00:00:29.570> happen<00:00:29.930> is<00:00:30.110> you'd

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
previously what would happen is you'd

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.459 
previously what would happen is you'd
play<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.980> app<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:31.689> then<00:00:32.689> when<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:32.960> exit<00:00:33.320> it

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
play the app and then when you exit it

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.590 
play the app and then when you exit it
out<00:00:33.649> it<00:00:34.280> would<00:00:34.430> no<00:00:34.550> longer<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:35.300> could<00:00:35.480> no

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
out it would no longer you could no

have all the apps that are currently

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.900 
have all the apps that are currently
open<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.430> I<00:00:49.460> could<00:00:49.790> switch<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:51.579> mail<00:00:52.579> if<00:00:52.790> I

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
open so I could switch to mail if I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.420 
open so I could switch to mail if I
wanted<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.290> now<00:00:54.290> what<00:00:54.860> I'm<00:00:54.980> going<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.160> switch

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
wanted to now what I'm going to switch

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.530 
wanted to now what I'm going to switch
you're<00:00:55.579> going<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.790> hear<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:55.969> music<00:00:56.120> stopped

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
you're going to hear the music stopped

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.459 
you're going to hear the music stopped
and<00:00:56.570> I'll<00:00:56.809> explain<00:00:57.050> why<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.530> second<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:02.469> the

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
and I'll explain why in a second so the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.109 
and I'll explain why in a second so the
music<00:01:03.800> stopped<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.399> basically<00:01:04.729> what

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
music stopped and basically what

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.840 
music stopped and basically what
happened<00:01:05.570> was<00:01:05.600> even<00:01:06.590> though<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:07.429> can<00:01:07.639> see

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
happened was even though you can see

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.889 
happened was even though you can see
here<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:09.049> still<00:01:09.229> down<00:01:09.439> here

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
here that it's still down here

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.969 
here that it's still down here
multitasking<00:01:11.899> needs<00:01:12.079> to<00:01:12.200> be<00:01:12.319> coated<00:01:12.649> in<00:01:12.709> by

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
multitasking needs to be coated in by

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.959 
multitasking needs to be coated in by
the<00:01:13.039> developer<00:01:13.639> it's<00:01:13.819> an<00:01:13.939> API<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.139> even<00:01:15.380> though

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
the developer it's an API so even though

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.739 
the developer it's an API so even though
Apple<00:01:16.969> now<00:01:17.270> supports<00:01:17.719> multitasking

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
Apple now supports multitasking

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:20.230 
Apple now supports multitasking
developers<00:01:18.740> will<00:01:18.889> have<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.130> add<00:01:19.279> multitasking

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
developers will have to add multitasking

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.749 
developers will have to add multitasking
into<00:01:20.749> all<00:01:21.049> of<00:01:21.079> their<00:01:21.350> applications<00:01:22.100> now<00:01:22.639> this

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
into all of their applications now this

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.739 
into all of their applications now this
is<00:01:22.819> kind<00:01:23.029> of<00:01:23.149> frustrating<00:01:23.389> because<00:01:24.249> why<00:01:25.249> on

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
is kind of frustrating because why on

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.559 
is kind of frustrating because why on
jailbroken<00:01:26.749> devices<00:01:27.139> they<00:01:27.380> had<00:01:27.590> a

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
jailbroken devices they had a

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.760 
jailbroken devices they had a
multitasking<00:01:29.569> solution<00:01:30.259> that<00:01:30.499> didn't

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
multitasking solution that didn't

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.019 
multitasking solution that didn't
require<00:01:30.889> this<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.549> could<00:01:31.700> use<00:01:31.789> it<00:01:31.909> with<00:01:31.999> any

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.029 
require this you could use it with any

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.230 
require this you could use it with any
app<00:01:32.389> so<00:01:33.079> now<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.319> have<00:01:33.679> to<00:01:33.920> have<00:01:34.880> all<00:01:35.119> your

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
app so now you have to have all your

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.239 
app so now you have to have all your
applications<00:01:35.539> freshly<00:01:36.349> coded<00:01:36.709> for<00:01:36.859> so<00:01:37.069> right

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
applications freshly coded for so right

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:38.859 
applications freshly coded for so right
now<00:01:37.279> it's<00:01:37.849> not<00:01:38.149> really<00:01:38.359> going<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.539> work<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:38.840> i

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
now it's not really going to work so i

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.719 
now it's not really going to work so i
can't<00:01:39.109> really<00:01:39.139> demo<00:01:39.529> it<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:40.069> but<00:01:40.219> that's

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
can't really demo it for you but that's

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:41.949 
can't really demo it for you but that's
basically<00:01:40.849> how<00:01:41.149> it's<00:01:41.420> going<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.569> work<00:01:41.659> you

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
basically how it's going to work you

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.989 
basically how it's going to work you
double<00:01:42.229> click<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:43.099> have<00:01:43.249> all<00:01:43.429> your<00:01:43.549> open<00:01:43.700> apps

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
double click you have all your open apps

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.469 
double click you have all your open apps
here<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.369> again<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.490> idea<00:01:46.579> would<00:01:46.880> be<00:01:46.939> pandora

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
here and again the idea would be pandora

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.169 
here and again the idea would be pandora
can<00:01:47.749> still<00:01:47.990> play<00:01:48.289> when<00:01:48.590> i'm<00:01:48.709> reading<00:01:49.340> in

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
can still play when i'm reading in

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.149 
can still play when i'm reading in
safari<00:01:50.719> or<00:01:50.869> when<00:01:51.109> i'm<00:01:51.229> answering<00:01:51.560> email<00:01:52.009> or

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
safari or when i'm answering email or

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.730 
safari or when i'm answering email or
whatever<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.549> case<00:01:52.579> may<00:01:52.969> be<00:01:52.999> so<00:01:53.929> this<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.619> just

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
whatever the case may be so this is just

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.469 
whatever the case may be so this is just
a<00:01:54.859> quick<00:01:55.009> demo<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.429> multitasking<00:01:55.909> for<00:01:56.389> the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
a quick demo of multitasking for the

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.330 
a quick demo of multitasking for the
iphone<00:01:56.899> operating<00:01:57.439> system<00:01:57.770> four-point-oh

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
iphone operating system four-point-oh

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.279 
iphone operating system four-point-oh
again<00:01:59.029> it'll<00:01:59.179> actually<00:01:59.450> work<00:01:59.689> when<00:02:00.200> this
