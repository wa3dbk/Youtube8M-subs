00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.519
 I look you decided to do corn I 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.620
 I will help you in this matter I warn you 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.309
 immediately be ready to fork you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.519
 have to 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.880
 nehilo and so what we need for 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.830
 this business technique first of all to us 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.990
 need a tractor by itself with 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.960
 counterweight without counterweight we are not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 we work the next item will be itself 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.679
 a cultivator distributor 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.600
 fertilizer and seeder notice that a seeder is needed 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.500
 special that you can sit down 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 it is corn besides us 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 need a normal cart as well 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.309
 conventional combine but with an unusual header 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.730
 reaper need special for corn 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 well about how to fertilize cultivate and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.890
 I will not teach you to sow the field 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.920
 and you yourself know how well if you canâ€™t 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.379
 click on the link after our 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.120
 corn has grown we start to clean it 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 there is nothing new for you here 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.549
 the essence is still the same you collect on 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.350
 combine itself or with the help of workers 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.600
 you drive up on a tractor with a cart 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.180
 you climb that namolit go 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 sleep back and so on until 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.450
 you will not collect the whole field as you see here everything 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.670
 easy and simple 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.020
 it was simple corn which 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.759
 subsequently buy from you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.650
 once packed in jars and shipped by 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.320
 shopping 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.150
 much more interesting is silo 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.100
 for silage we need equipment 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.750
 somewhat different straight tractor with 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.120
 counterbalance cultivator 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.310
 fertilizer distributor planters and 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.800
 carts you have to fork out yet 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.320
 and on a special combine harvester is not easy but 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.510
 feed as it will have to get hold of 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.340
 a set of special reapers still you 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.590
 need a wheel loader 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.470
 the bigger bucket this loader will have 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.940
 the better cleaning options for you 2 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.640
 option 1 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.530
 if your assistant zabuhal or just 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.450
 went to the district center for business you can 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.850
 attach the cart directly on 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.250
 different combine to sit behind the wheel spread out 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.869
 buy combine and forward option 2 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.240
 if your assistant is fine 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.460
 planting was right on the forage harvester while he 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.010
 you go with the summer with a cart when the cart 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.440
 filled let's say letting wait and himself 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.750
 go fast to the factory 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.250
 biogas production and in one of 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.290
 concrete corridors you wallow all 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.170
 the contents of your cart this step is necessary 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.300
 repeat until the entire field is removed 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.850
 after you brought all your syoss 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.920
 it needs to be thoroughly pressed top 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.660
 you have an indicator in the left corner 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.820
 pressing you need to catch up to 100 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.100
 percent is better to press any 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.150
 heavy weighty technique such as 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.150
 same wheel loader 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.670
 cn painted well done now the whole thing 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.690
 need to cover and wait a few 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.569
 hours after the fermentation process 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.849
 will be finished we get ready 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.370
 silo now you just need to drive up 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.650
 loader pick it up in a bucket and take it 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.750
 in installation after pour out 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.650
 bucket content to your balance right there 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.650
 money will come 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.400
 case of unloading silo somewhat fashionable 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.600
 but profitable so it would be better to be patient 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.620
 it's worth it also share one 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.660
 a little secret you can gather strength 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.180
 not only with corn and and also possible 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.730
 collect on questions from the grass or just 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.290
 pack it enough to rearrange another 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.330
 special reaper which fits 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.060
 just for grass to attach the cart 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.800
 different harvester and forward here is your 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.780
 the worker will not help you here 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.830
 do everything yourself and the process will be 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.020
 somewhat longer 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.670
 for example while you are waiting for fermentation or 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.790
 you just get bored, you can zamorochitsya 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.310
 ipad mow the grass along the road on this 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.810
