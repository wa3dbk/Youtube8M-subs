00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.410

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.840
 we have there, then, iron, then 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.790
 I arrive here at the top pick and play 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.610
 nothing is the squeeze is that it will improve 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.290
 also 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.160
 now that three irons have appeared 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.959
 tightening r 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.200
 I got it because for you to do anything 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.239
 thing of 10 in the case of iron is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.560
 There are ten defendants so here in this place is 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.569
 fun with the whole game not so much 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.129
 How much I wanted to be playing alone. 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.719
 in fact none of my enemies in 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.150
 friends bought elder scrolls 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.639
 Unfortunately, I really wanted to have it. 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.879
 bought but will not buy then so 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:47.090
 even open to suggestions followed and such 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.750
 only I'm in the one in that alliance 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.849
 red flag I think it's up to it 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.230
 good and dragon is such a thing the band 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.200
 heart 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.510
 I think its good hardware I do not have the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.950
 absolute certainty not least because not 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 I focused not so much 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.200
 and still continues to have these small 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.379
 Problems folks fps autographing one 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.650
 fps that is enough and then castan is like this 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:17.629
 just is not as good unfortunately is 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.829
 the famous vandals book and now walks 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:31.639
 mature there 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:35.139
 cold water bathing suit now I 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.139
 I think you'll notice something like that. 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:43.639
 the top finish and has a lot of 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.930
 shining that a person are 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:49.239
 suspecting that they are people who 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.239
 you know , the body stays like this. 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:04.360
 Yes, the government is okay. 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.430
 stealing old man is stealing a guy 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:12.330
 old is what everyone was in the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:14.680
 German car also like jingle slip 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.330
 so that's all having enough fun 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.590
 of the staff with the game is this reinforced 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.960
 What I said is what I think it's worth 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:30.460
 the penalty is very subjective 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:42.820
 Wow, that's what I slept for, will you stay? 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:45.300
 here 's a problem that really gets 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.300
 stay 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.190
 the guy 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.020
 clothes were everything was was all this 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.140

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.910
 bravo bravo caramba I'm loose 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.740
 because this is where you play in the old group 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.490
 dude this time I've tried 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.610
 invite I played with him for beta 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.920
 type was was epic but unfortunately he 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.910
 do not have the game yet for what kind of 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.720
 skin 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.130
 Can you see together? 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.260
 see let's see if we can find 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.750
 People want to play together, not like that. 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.180
 rode the widow I get to level 10 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.370
 people to be able to and foresees forgiveness 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.550
 I got there because I remember the game. 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.250
 it is really like so reminiscent know is 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.220
 one thing you do not stay too long 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.390
 and I know michael is usually that but 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.150
 I'm not with this 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.060
 availability and I do not want 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.010
 get stuck in a game and that's not it but it's 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.230
 a game that is playing all astana 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.790
 I will still play pretty beauty has its 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.560
 Quick video to show you guys 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.880
 then this fishery issue 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.820
 I did not see anyone with chances still in the 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.350
 youtube and you are is something that the 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.600
 game is so important but I think the 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.340
 experience is that player is a 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.020
 legal discourse because I think the 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:23.820
 experience of ending groups 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:25.800
 that player brought the woman is this 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.880
 cross is the interesting is that you 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.790
 really sees the world is not from the elder 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.800
 scrolls, do not you like to do all the 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.320
 things that he is to blame who has day care 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.870
 There are angels in the fight that have all of this. 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.280
 so I think it would be interesting would it be 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.940
 cool even if we can get a 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.310
 House 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.960
 this guy as sky has understood that it is a 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.090
 bit complicated this is better but not 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.770
 so much that he uses but then you do not 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.110
 knows very well that they have houses to 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.150
 including type is medieval so pmdb 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.190
 go fantasies are good now also in 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.170
 canal of churras that he has his house 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.670
 where then, so it was cool that 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.850
 could be the person my home my 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:05.880
 You know that to keep things alone 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.080
 It could be very cool, but it 's not 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.550
 this is happening at the moment 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.120
 it may be that in updates since the 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.580
 game 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.710
 is paid and the reasons it is paid is 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.320
 this is what very good updates and 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.000
 much is so important in the game in the 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.440
 from the life of his life. 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.630
 so who knows does not come out there is a 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.300
 of these we can have the house beauty 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.330
 has guard the image of elder scrolls 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.510
 on the channel what type is the type of game that 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.430
 I like né and medieval rpg 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.440
 besides being better and that I am 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.979
 playing then you have then asking not to 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.479
 enjoying 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:39.210
 We're going to bring more beauty so 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:42.500
 hug a fighter and not run away from the 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.500
 rule I went
