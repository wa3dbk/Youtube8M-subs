00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.410
 comes from japan is from masaru emoto el 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.180
 mister on a motorbike began to be interested 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.360
 very much for the molecular structure 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.370
 of water and what affects water 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.040
 is the most receptive of the four 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.410
 elements the motor lord thought that 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.660
 maybe he would react to non-physical events 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.700
 so he started a series of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
 investigations applied stimuli 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.159
 mentally and photographed the water with a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.500
 dark field microscope 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.770
 do not 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.170
 for a water sample let's use 0.5 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.440
 cubic centimeters of water in 50 plates 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440
 of petri 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.800
 then we took those 50 petri dishes 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.790
 and freeze them at 25 degrees below zero 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.790
 for three hours 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.380
 we took those frozen samples the 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.509
 We put in a refrigerator a 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.100
 temperature of 5 degrees below zero in the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.590
 that there was a microscope with a camera 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.890
 and we photographed each of the 50 drops 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.890
 of water 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.689
 first we took pictures of the water in 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.399
 which we had not introduced any 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.079
 information 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.490
 then we take the water with information and 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.520
 we perform the process that I just 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.530
 describe we chose the first and the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.070
 second photographs and we compared the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.070
 differences 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.509
 when we had projected the sensation 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.450
 of love and thanks in the water the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.920
 crystals were precious at times like this 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 I believe that water is at peace 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.780
 the first one is a water photograph of 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.780
 the fujiwara dam 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.689
 this photograph is of the same water 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:32.200
 after a Buddhist monk zen the 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.200
 blessed 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.600
 in the next series of photographs the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.090
 motorcycle lord printed words I stick them 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.420
 with adhesive tape in water bottles 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.790
 distilled and I leave you like this one night this 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.090
 first picture is an image of water 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.430
 pure distilled is only the essence 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.170
 following photographs as you can see 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.209
 they are different 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.310
 this is the chile the vital force of 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:06.880
 love and here we have thanks here come 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.630
 where he stuck it to the bottle if they know 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.360
 Japanese have already given account ja 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.330
 the remote lord considers that the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.120
 thought or intention are the soul 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.790
 of all this is unknown 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.890
 science of how thinking affects in 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.590
 actually to the molecules only the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.990
 they know the molecules of clear water and 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.840
 it's fascinating if you consider 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.840
 that 90% of our body is water 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.960
 sobering truth 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.940
 if the thought of access to water 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.450
 that will give us the thoughts to 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.450
 we
