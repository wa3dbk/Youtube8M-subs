one cell well think of the human body
for<00:00:45.059> example<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.590> possible<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:48.210> single

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
for example is it possible for a single

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.680 
for example is it possible for a single
cell<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.649> every<00:00:50.280> function<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.270> going

on inside a human body for example can a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.680 
on inside a human body for example can a
single<00:00:54.480> cell<00:00:54.719> become<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.559> heart<00:00:56.160> cell<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:57.149> nerve

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
single cell become a heart cell a nerve

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.560 
single cell become a heart cell a nerve
cell<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.230> skin<00:00:58.800> cell<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.370> stomach<00:01:00.059> cell<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.390> once

cell a skin cell a stomach cell at once

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
cell a skin cell a stomach cell at once
no<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.100> possible<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> therefore<00:01:04.920> we

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
no that is not possible so therefore we

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.719 
no that is not possible so therefore we
have<00:01:05.519> cells<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.330> become<00:01:07.260> specialized<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
have cells that become specialized and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.899 
have cells that become specialized and
as<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:10.430> specialized<00:01:11.430> cells

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
as you can see here specialized cells

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.679 
as you can see here specialized cells
perform<00:01:12.689> specific<00:01:13.049> functions<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:15.420> only

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
perform specific functions and they only

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.429 
perform specific functions and they only
do<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.280> because<00:01:17.280> they<00:01:17.700> only<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> portion

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
do this because they only use a portion

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
do this because they only use a portion
of<00:01:19.560> their<00:01:19.710> DNA<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.880> deals<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.270> their

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
of their DNA that deals with their

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.039 
of their DNA that deals with their
function<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.560> example<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.159> skin<00:01:23.790> cell<00:01:24.119> will

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
function for example a skin cell will

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.649 
function for example a skin cell will
only<00:01:25.320> use<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> portion<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> entire<00:01:27.119> human

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
only use the portion of the entire human

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.620 
only use the portion of the entire human
genome<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:29.009> deals<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.880> skin<00:01:30.329> cell

similar<00:02:14.040> cells<00:02:14.520> working<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> common

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
similar cells working on a common

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.910 
similar cells working on a common
function<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:18.330> next<00:02:18.720> step<00:02:18.930> would<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.230> an<00:02:19.410> organ

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
function the next step would be an organ

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.310 
function the next step would be an organ
this<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> collection<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.390> similar<00:02:21.690> tissues

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
this is a collection of similar tissues

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.170 
this is a collection of similar tissues
that<00:02:22.770> are<00:02:22.800> working<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.340> common<00:02:23.760> function

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that are working on a common function

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.870 
that are working on a common function
and<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:25.680> finally<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.460> organ

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and then finally you have the organ

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.990 
and then finally you have the organ
system<00:02:27.620> where<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:29.010> similar<00:02:29.550> organs

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
system where you have similar organs

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.840 
system where you have similar organs
working<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> common<00:02:31.410> function<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.670> for

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
working on a common function so for

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.540 
working on a common function so for
example<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:34.530> would<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.830> an<00:02:34.950> individual

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
example you would have an individual

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.000 
example you would have an individual
cell<00:02:36.330> that's<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> digestive<00:02:37.350> system<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
cell that's in the digestive system the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.330 
cell that's in the digestive system the
digestive<00:02:38.760> system<00:02:39.320> basically<00:02:40.320> has<00:02:40.590> three

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
digestive system basically has three

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.620 
digestive system basically has three
different<00:02:41.580> tissue<00:02:42.030> layers<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.450> put

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
different tissue layers and then you put

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.000 
different tissue layers and then you put
all<00:02:45.780> three<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.020> these<00:02:46.110> tissues<00:02:46.350> together<00:02:46.800> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
all three of these tissues together you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.280 
all three of these tissues together you
have<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> single<00:02:47.610> organ<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.780> put<00:02:48.990> all<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
have a single organ and you put all the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.050 
have a single organ and you put all the
organs<00:02:49.740> such<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:49.980> large<00:02:50.340> intestine<00:02:50.910> small

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
organs such as large intestine small

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.760 
organs such as large intestine small
intestine<00:02:51.210> stomach<00:02:52.170> together

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
intestine stomach together

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.490 
intestine stomach together
that's<00:02:53.340> your<00:02:53.640> organ<00:02:53.970> system<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.600> then<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
that's your organ system and then the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's your organ system and then the
fifth<00:02:55.770> one<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.610> put<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> bunch<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.120> organ

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
fifth one you put a bunch of organ

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.510 
fifth one you put a bunch of organ
systems<00:02:57.450> together<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.800> have<00:02:58.950> an<00:02:59.040> organism

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
systems together you have an organism

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.080 
systems together you have an organism
for<00:03:00.210> example<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.610> individual

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
for example you so you have individual

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.300 
for example you so you have individual
cells<00:03:03.300> in<00:03:03.420> your<00:03:03.540> body<00:03:03.920> many<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.040> them<00:03:05.130> come

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
cells in your body many of them come

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.580 
cells in your body many of them come
together<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.730> form<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.030> certain<00:03:06.330> tissue

alright<00:04:14.970> we<00:04:15.060> put<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.270> bunch<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.600> these<00:04:15.750> tissues

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
alright we put a bunch of these tissues

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.620 
alright we put a bunch of these tissues
together<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.770> then<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.489> have<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.940> organ<00:04:18.450> in

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
together and then we have your organ in

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.770 
together and then we have your organ in
this<00:04:19.080> case<00:04:19.320> would<00:04:19.830> be<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.070> heart<00:04:20.630> left<00:04:21.630> for

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
this case would be the heart left for

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.990 
this case would be the heart left for
integral<00:04:22.140> right<00:04:22.440> ventricle<00:04:22.979> I'm<00:04:23.310> sorry

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
integral right ventricle I'm sorry

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.830 
integral right ventricle I'm sorry
left<00:04:24.360> atrium<00:04:24.960> right<00:04:25.290> atrium<00:04:26.690> left<00:04:27.690> ventricle

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
left atrium right atrium left ventricle

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.720 
left atrium right atrium left ventricle
right<00:04:28.470> ventricle<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:30.260> then<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:32.010> add<00:04:32.190> in

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
right ventricle and then you add in

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.620 
right ventricle and then you add in
these<00:04:33.480> blue<00:04:33.870> veins<00:04:34.490> these<00:04:35.490> red<00:04:35.790> arteries<00:04:36.330> and

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
these blue veins these red arteries and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.260 
these blue veins these red arteries and
then<00:04:37.200> you'll<00:04:37.410> have<00:04:37.590> your<00:04:38.270> cardiovascular

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
then you'll have your cardiovascular

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.820 
then you'll have your cardiovascular
system<00:04:41.120> cardio<00:04:42.120> referring<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.960> heart<00:04:43.200> and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
system cardio referring to the heart and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.730 
system cardio referring to the heart and
then<00:04:43.950> all<00:04:44.130> these<00:04:44.340> tubes<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:44.940> make<00:04:45.120> up

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
then all these tubes that make up

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.950 
then all these tubes that make up
arteries<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.010> veins<00:04:47.870> that<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.560> vascular

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
arteries and veins that is the vascular

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.600 
arteries and veins that is the vascular
mask<00:04:51.960> on<00:04:52.200> just<00:04:52.230> refers<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.710> tubes

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.020 

okay<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:58.370> arteries<00:04:59.370> would<00:04:59.550> be<00:04:59.669> a<00:04:59.700> separate

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
okay so arteries would be a separate

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.180 
okay so arteries would be a separate
organ<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.810> veins<00:05:01.470> would<00:05:01.680> be<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.830> separate

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
organ and veins would be a separate

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.950 
organ and veins would be a separate
organ<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.610> put<00:05:02.760> those<00:05:02.880> three<00:05:03.090> together<00:05:03.210> there

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
organ you put those three together there

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.020 
organ you put those three together there
you<00:05:03.990> have<00:05:04.320> your<00:05:04.350> cardiovascular<00:05:05.220> system<00:05:05.400> so

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
you have your cardiovascular system so

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.590 
you have your cardiovascular system so
here<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.300> go

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
here you go

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.300 
here you go
cells<00:05:07.580> tissues<00:05:08.750> organ<00:05:09.750> organ<00:05:10.680> system<00:05:11.070> and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
cells tissues organ organ system and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.430 
cells tissues organ organ system and
then<00:05:11.700> of<00:05:11.850> course<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:14.390> single<00:05:15.440> organism

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
then of course the single organism

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.200 
then of course the single organism
because<00:05:16.770> she's<00:05:16.950> gonna<00:05:17.070> have<00:05:17.250> him<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.550> nervous

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
because she's gonna have him a nervous

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.060 
because she's gonna have him a nervous
system<00:05:19.130> she's<00:05:20.130> got<00:05:20.310> skin<00:05:21.680> digestive<00:05:22.680> system

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
system she's got skin digestive system

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.140 
system she's got skin digestive system
etc<00:05:23.520> etc<00:05:26.330> all<00:05:27.330> right<00:05:27.500> once<00:05:28.500> again

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
etc etc all right once again

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.840 
etc etc all right once again
multicellular<00:05:30.150> creatures<00:05:30.300> have<00:05:31.850> specialized

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
multicellular creatures have specialized

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.020 
multicellular creatures have specialized
cells<00:05:33.450> how<00:05:34.290> did<00:05:34.410> they<00:05:34.500> become<00:05:34.620> special<00:05:35.190> just

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
cells how did they become special just

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.580 
cells how did they become special just
the<00:05:36.180> way<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.540> I<00:05:36.750> said<00:05:37.169> earlier<00:05:39.440> let's<00:05:40.440> see

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
the way that I said earlier let's see

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.080 
the way that I said earlier let's see
what<00:05:40.740> strange<00:05:41.010> this<00:05:41.190> one<00:05:43.280> they<00:05:44.280> express<00:05:44.880> only

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
what strange this one they express only

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.670 
what strange this one they express only
the<00:05:45.840> genes<00:05:46.460> required<00:05:47.460> to<00:05:47.760> do<00:05:47.910> their<00:05:48.090> function

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
the genes required to do their function

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.310 
the genes required to do their function
alright<00:05:49.680> so<00:05:50.100> for<00:05:50.250> example<00:05:50.840> we've<00:05:51.840> got<00:05:52.050> two

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
alright so for example we've got two

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.810 
alright so for example we've got two
different<00:05:52.410> kinds<00:05:52.650> of<00:05:52.800> cells<00:05:52.950> here<00:05:53.190> here's<00:05:53.669> the

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
different kinds of cells here here's the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.080 
different kinds of cells here here's the
skin<00:05:54.060> cell<00:05:54.330> type<00:05:55.080> of<00:05:55.260> epithelium<00:05:55.910> over<00:05:56.910> here

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
skin cell type of epithelium over here

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.900 
skin cell type of epithelium over here
we<00:05:57.300> have<00:05:57.630> cardiac<00:05:58.560> muscle<00:05:58.979> remember<00:05:59.760> those

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
we have cardiac muscle remember those

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.840 
we have cardiac muscle remember those
intercalated<00:06:00.750> discs<00:06:01.400> right<00:06:02.400> here<00:06:02.640> you<00:06:02.729> see

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
intercalated discs right here you see

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.700 
intercalated discs right here you see
those<00:06:03.000> lines<00:06:03.540> that<00:06:03.660> come<00:06:03.810> between<00:06:03.930> them<00:06:04.140> as

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
those lines that come between them as

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.740 
those lines that come between them as
you<00:06:04.830> can<00:06:04.950> see<00:06:05.130> here<00:06:05.400> it's<00:06:05.940> kind<00:06:06.180> of<00:06:06.270> branching

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
you can see here it's kind of branching

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.159 
you can see here it's kind of branching
alright<00:06:07.380> these<00:06:08.160> two<00:06:08.550> cells<00:06:08.910> even<00:06:09.750> though<00:06:09.870> each

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
alright these two cells even though each

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.270 
alright these two cells even though each
nucleus<00:06:11.000> contains<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.210> same<00:06:12.479> amount<00:06:12.540> of<00:06:13.020> DNA

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
nucleus contains the same amount of DNA

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.240 
nucleus contains the same amount of DNA
this<00:06:14.280> skin<00:06:14.669> cell<00:06:15.000> reads<00:06:15.900> different<00:06:16.680> portions

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
this skin cell reads different portions

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.710 
this skin cell reads different portions
of<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.520> DNA<00:06:17.669> in<00:06:18.090> other<00:06:18.240> words<00:06:18.419> it<00:06:18.570> will

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
of the DNA in other words it will

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.469 
of the DNA in other words it will
transcribe<00:06:19.620> and<00:06:20.160> translate<00:06:20.220> different<00:06:21.210> genes

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
transcribe and translate different genes

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.620 
transcribe and translate different genes
it<00:06:21.979> expresses<00:06:22.979> different<00:06:23.430> genes<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:24.419> that

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
it expresses different genes and that

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.630 
it expresses different genes and that
gives<00:06:24.840> it<00:06:24.930> this<00:06:25.140> special<00:06:25.560> shape<00:06:25.919> and<00:06:26.220> that

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
gives it this special shape and that

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.180 
gives it this special shape and that
allows<00:06:26.850> us<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.030> do<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.180> special<00:06:27.479> function<00:06:28.190> skin

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
allows us to do a special function skin

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.680 
allows us to do a special function skin
cells<00:06:29.430> are<00:06:29.550> kind<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.820> like<00:06:29.880> the<00:06:30.090> shingles<00:06:30.540> on

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
cells are kind of like the shingles on

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.760 
cells are kind of like the shingles on
the<00:06:30.720> roof<00:06:30.960> of<00:06:31.110> your<00:06:31.169> house<00:06:31.410> they<00:06:31.650> have<00:06:31.740> a

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
the roof of your house they have a

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.969 
the roof of your house they have a
tendency<00:06:32.099> to<00:06:32.130> be<00:06:32.310> flat<00:06:33.050> and<00:06:34.050> they<00:06:34.440> join<00:06:34.740> up

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
tendency to be flat and they join up

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.460 
tendency to be flat and they join up
real<00:06:35.310> close<00:06:35.640> together<00:06:35.849> so<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.900> water<00:06:37.169> and

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
real close together so that water and

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.910 
real close together so that water and
other<00:06:37.590> stuff

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
other stuff

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.560 
other stuff
doesn't<00:06:38.340> you<00:06:38.670> know<00:06:38.760> in<00:06:38.880> other<00:06:38.970> words<00:06:39.180> your

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
skin that doesn't leak now muscle cells

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.690 
skin that doesn't leak now muscle cells
are<00:06:42.750> totally<00:06:43.500> different<00:06:43.650> they<00:06:44.340> need<00:06:44.520> to<00:06:44.580> be

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
are totally different they need to be

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.280 
are totally different they need to be
able<00:06:44.790> to<00:06:44.910> contract<00:06:45.420> and<00:06:45.690> they<00:06:45.780> need<00:06:45.930> to<00:06:46.050> do<00:06:46.170> it

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
able to contract and they need to do it

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.860 
able to contract and they need to do it
rhythmically<00:06:47.210> every<00:06:48.210> second<00:06:48.630> of<00:06:48.720> your<00:06:48.810> life

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.020 
rhythmically every second of your life
and<00:06:49.290> you<00:06:49.380> imagine<00:06:49.770> since<00:06:50.430> you<00:06:50.550> guys<00:06:50.700> were<00:06:50.850> born

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
and you imagine since you guys were born

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.550 
and you imagine since you guys were born
in<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.270> 21st<00:06:51.690> century<00:06:51.780> you'll<00:06:52.170> probably<00:06:52.350> live

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
in the 21st century you'll probably live

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.340 
in the 21st century you'll probably live
to<00:06:52.590> be<00:06:52.800> a<00:06:52.830> hundred<00:06:53.270> for<00:06:54.270> a<00:06:54.300> hundred<00:06:54.750> days<00:06:54.960> it's

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
to be a hundred for a hundred days it's

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.650 
to be a hundred for a hundred days it's
got<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.530> beat<00:06:55.830> in<00:06:56.100> the<00:06:56.700> moment<00:06:57.000> it<00:06:57.090> stops<00:06:57.330> you're

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
got a beat in the moment it stops you're

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.420 
got a beat in the moment it stops you're
in<00:06:57.750> trouble<00:06:57.930> alright<00:06:58.920> so<00:06:59.070> as<00:06:59.130> you<00:06:59.220> can<00:06:59.340> see

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
in trouble alright so as you can see

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.370 
in trouble alright so as you can see
here<00:06:59.820> it<00:07:00.240> has<00:07:00.270> read<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.720> genes<00:07:00.990> that<00:07:01.200> have

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
here it has read the genes that have

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.640 
here it has read the genes that have
made<00:07:01.590> it<00:07:02.030> branch<00:07:03.030> it's<00:07:03.930> a<00:07:03.990> bunch<00:07:04.230> of<00:07:04.350> long

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
made it branch it's a bunch of long

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.550 
made it branch it's a bunch of long

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.830 
fibers it's created these intercalated
discs<00:07:07.890> that<00:07:08.070> will<00:07:08.400> allow<00:07:08.610> it<00:07:08.880> to<00:07:08.910> communicate
