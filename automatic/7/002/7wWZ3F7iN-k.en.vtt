00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
usability as far as the design is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.880 
usability as far as the design is
concerned<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.790> mat<00:02:56.970> pack<00:02:57.769> gives<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:59.330> some

concerned the mat pack gives it some
resistance<00:03:01.890> from<00:03:02.330> smudges<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.660> fingerprints

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
resistance from smudges and fingerprints

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.520

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
certainly be a fingerprint magnet watch

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.860 
certainly be a fingerprint magnet watch
