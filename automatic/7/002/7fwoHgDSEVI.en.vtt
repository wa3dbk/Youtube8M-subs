00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.770
 for extreme hardware readers this 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.860
 the presentation video of the fall 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.020
 myskyhd 62 phobia controller of fans 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 pant vdf controller apart from this name 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.270
 which is really features of many 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.490
 of the solutions copies this fan 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.519
 controller has six potentiometers 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.529
 for fan control but also 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.550
 of the interesting features between 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.010
 which first a capacity up to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 36 watts per channel this and that is the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.629
 plate data in addition to this though 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 then presents a front lcd with itself 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.059
 potentiometers a front panel an aluminum 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.640
 really really nice brushed a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.559
 therefore rpm control temperature 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 six channels with sensors attached 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 temperature present in the part 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.010
 later we will observe later 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 up to 36 from certificates that channel between 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.750
 brackets I'm just reading 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.399
 what is the list of gods 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.439
 technical features present on the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.270
 site on the written review that 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.729
 you will find at the bottom small parenthesis e 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 I therefore close a lighting of the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.650
 lcd and green with decidedly characters 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 luminous indeed you can see very well at 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.280
 dark a difference of other models 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 competition that can see if 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 don't see a very neat aesthetic 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.960
 frame entirely in steel and oh well 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.060
 this instead is the norm that it is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.880
 follow another technical detail for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.430
 regarding the packaging 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.610
 house working procedures 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.240
 mother and dimensions can be found precisely 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.850
 in the table of technical parameters for 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:47.000
 what about let's say what we can 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.390
 present in the video yes first 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.840
 the fact that as you see here is now 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.840
 we see it in greater detail 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:11.930
 very good input for memory cards 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.120
 with standard cf sd mmc ms m 2 tf usb3 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.650
 so basically we have a fan 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.010
 controller that really aesthetically 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.599
 very nice but has one 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.750
 double thickness compared to those that 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.950
 are the current standards for what 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:38.630
 regards this type of resolution 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:41.750
 afterwards we observed the need for the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.829
 presence therefore of six channels for the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.900
 fans and if temperature sensors the 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.940
 whose insertion, however, whose insertion 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.750
 and slightly difficult because yes 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:00.139
 they find here where they are under six 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.030
 then individual channel capacitors 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.400
 the insertion of the difficult newscast 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.019
 however, a further peculiarity is 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.290
 inserting the connector of 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.200
 power that is found directly 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.799
 on the unit pcb what we see here 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.810
 first of all the fact that we have 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:26.540
 connected directly in series 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.459
 one two three ay connector a 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.040
 y 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.859
 regarding a 140 fan 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.940
 mm carolina you who is not a TV to him 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.799
 vegas 120 mm with 7.2 watts if I was not 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.430
 there consumption always in series therefore 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.070
 we find everything in series connected to 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.169
 the one that brings fan six even if into 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:53.479
 actually the wrong label because 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:59.769
 would be the 4 passive power supply fan yes 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:59.769
 soni that 460 bat 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.330
 and direct power supply 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:17.030
 feeder so now what 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:22.790
 we'll see how it gets along with about 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.790
 35 watts and single channel load 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.350
 obviously it is already on 4 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.660
 here it is 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:52.970
 35 watts overall per single 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:57.370
 channel specifications respected by 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.260
 sand is therefore essentially a model 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.570
 fantastic the purchase price yes 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.730
 stands at around 61 euros 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.420
 obviously we do not recommend a use 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.270
 so immoderate of the dl fan controller 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.260
 because in short 36 times per channel 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.870
 truly an enormity 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.090
 it is advisable not to go beyond 25 watts 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.640
 and about with these models also because 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.800
 as regards the circuitry of 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.450
 back power we are not up 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.690
 models the tron app that feature a 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:30.140
 mosfet mosfet they have 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.800
 features very different from the simple 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.320
 design of this model is therefore in 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.350
 substance 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:43.240
 the text has passed here we see one 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:47.020
 problematic light nomination and three 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.910
 among the most extreme fans on the market 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.210
 because they are scheidts among gays from 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.620
 3000 rpm well this video ends here 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.390
 we thank you for watching vi 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.390
 we invite you to comment on May in the north
