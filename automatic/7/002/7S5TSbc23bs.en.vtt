00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.630 

so<00:00:04.940> I<00:00:05.510> did<00:00:05.990> some<00:00:06.170> research<00:00:06.500> online<00:00:06.770> and<00:00:07.220> came

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
so I did some research online and came

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.090 
so I did some research online and came
up<00:00:07.790> with<00:00:07.819> a<00:00:08.210> recirculating<00:00:09.110> system<00:00:09.590> that<00:00:09.889> lets

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
up with a recirculating system that lets

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.190 
up with a recirculating system that lets
you<00:00:10.309> keep<00:00:10.790> your<00:00:10.850> work<00:00:11.240> outside<00:00:11.960> of<00:00:12.139> the

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
you keep your work outside of the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.970 
you keep your work outside of the
refrigerator<00:00:12.849> all<00:00:13.849> right<00:00:14.000> now<00:00:14.150> I<00:00:14.530> need<00:00:15.530> my

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
refrigerator all right now I need my

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.280 
refrigerator all right now I need my
particular<00:00:16.509> container<00:00:17.509> going<00:00:17.990> for<00:00:18.170> perhaps

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
particular container going for perhaps

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.330 
particular container going for perhaps
six<00:00:18.650> months<00:00:19.009> or<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:19.310> now<00:00:20.380> outside<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:21.560> garage

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
six months or so now outside the garage

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.390 
six months or so now outside the garage
somewhere<00:00:23.210> between<00:00:23.390> 75<00:00:23.990> 85<00:00:24.260> degrees<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.189> so

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
somewhere between 75 85 degrees and so

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.660 
somewhere between 75 85 degrees and so
far<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:26.240> worms<00:00:26.480> have<00:00:27.220> can't<00:00:28.220> stay<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:28.460> is

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
far the worms have can't stay this is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.189 
far the worms have can't stay this is
whether<00:00:28.880> they<00:00:29.090> thrive<00:00:29.449> because<00:00:29.660> like<00:00:29.930> I<00:00:30.140> do

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
whether they thrive because like I do

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.320 
whether they thrive because like I do
see<00:00:30.619> some<00:00:30.920> fragmentation<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.059> I<00:00:32.090> know<00:00:32.180> that

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
see some fragmentation so I know that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.860 
see some fragmentation so I know that
they<00:00:32.599> are<00:00:32.629> reproducing<00:00:33.559> in<00:00:33.680> some<00:00:33.920> way<00:00:34.129> but<00:00:35.059> I'm

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
they are reproducing in some way but I'm

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.920 
they are reproducing in some way but I'm
not<00:00:36.110> getting<00:00:36.350> any<00:00:36.790> worms<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:38.030> dying<00:00:38.270> off<00:00:38.540> on<00:00:38.780> me

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
not getting any worms of dying off on me

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.490 
not getting any worms of dying off on me
to<00:00:39.050> wait

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.840 

without<00:00:42.430> any<00:00:42.670> sort<00:00:42.940> of<00:00:43.200> iteration<00:00:44.200> or

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 

so<00:00:48.060> it<00:00:48.600> seemed<00:00:48.810> to<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.020> working<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so it seemed to be working a lot of it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
so it seemed to be working a lot of it
seems<00:00:50.400> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.000> even<00:00:51.330> a<00:00:51.540> lot<00:00:51.720> of<00:00:51.840> oxygen<00:00:52.020> in

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
seems to be just even a lot of oxygen in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010 
seems to be just even a lot of oxygen in
water<00:00:52.910> letting<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> fish<00:00:54.210> Club<00:00:54.540> letting<00:00:54.900> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
won't be able to rubbery abusing st.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.290 
won't be able to rubbery abusing st.
water<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.950> couple<00:00:59.400> of<00:00:59.489> weeks<00:00:59.550> it's

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
water now for a couple of weeks it's

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.660 
water now for a couple of weeks it's
awesome

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
awesome

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
awesome
change<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.390> water<00:01:04.629> every<00:01:04.780> day

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.430 

but<00:01:07.830> those<00:01:07.979> Thurston<00:01:08.369> myself<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.440> pretty

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
but those Thurston myself it's pretty

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.710 
but those Thurston myself it's pretty
simple<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.190> can<00:01:11.729> pick<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> parts<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.479> think

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
simple you can pick the parts I think

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.320 
simple you can pick the parts I think
aware<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.320> picked<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.220> mine<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.820> most<00:01:15.030> part

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
aware I picked that mine the most part

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.800 
aware I picked that mine the most part
over<00:01:15.600> it'll<00:01:15.840> sell<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.290> Walmart<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.009> Target

over it'll sell and Walmart or Target
with<00:01:18.810> dollars<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.680> pick<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:19.979> pieces<00:01:20.220> there

in it when a method of getting the water
back<00:01:39.690> up<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> bottom<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.429> top<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
back up from the bottom of the top and I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.969 
back up from the bottom of the top and I
just<00:01:42.720> lived<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.080> some<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> small

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
just lived for some of the small

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.919 
just lived for some of the small
tabletop<00:01:45.560> type<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.679> pumps<00:01:47.659> smaller<00:01:48.659> the

tabletop type of pumps smaller the

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.690 
tabletop type of pumps smaller the
better<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.409> finding<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.659> has<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.700> lever

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
better and finding this one has a lever

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
better and finding this one has a lever
on<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.179> least<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.780> change<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
on it at least where you can change the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.760 
on it at least where you can change the
volume<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.130> established

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
volume so it's established

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.100 
volume so it's established
I've<00:01:58.770> got<00:01:59.010> some<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.370> eBay<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.730> are<00:02:00.360> orders

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I've got some on eBay that are orders

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.240 
I've got some on eBay that are orders
all<00:02:01.260> that<00:02:01.440> something<00:02:01.860> anybody's<00:02:02.640> interested

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
all that something anybody's interested

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.680 
all that something anybody's interested
and<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.640> some<00:02:05.820> method<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.270> returning

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
and then just some method of returning

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.040 
and then just some method of returning
the<00:02:06.870> water<00:02:07.590> back<00:02:07.830> up<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.250> upper<00:02:08.520> area<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.869> my

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the water back up the upper area on my

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.500 
the water back up the upper area on my
first<00:02:10.320> one<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.679> use<00:02:11.039> occur

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
first one I use occur

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.530 
first one I use occur
I<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> little<00:02:13.019> cleaner<00:02:13.650> myself<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
I get a little cleaner myself so it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720 
I get a little cleaner myself so it
saves<00:02:15.719> a<00:02:15.930> little<00:02:16.049> bit<00:02:16.170> more<00:02:16.439> space<00:02:16.799> by<00:02:17.400> doing

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
saves a little bit more space by doing

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.959 
saves a little bit more space by doing
that<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:18.560> other<00:02:19.560> than<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.120> pretty<00:02:21.120> simple

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
that and other than that pretty simple

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.970 
that and other than that pretty simple
obviously<00:02:23.969> is<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:24.299> what<00:02:25.290> did<00:02:25.409> you<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.680> is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
obviously is there what did you do is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.099

of the websites that did research that

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.630 
of the websites that did research that
the<00:03:31.720> news<00:03:32.020> pumps<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.710> can<00:03:32.890> see<00:03:33.070> why<00:03:33.280> they<00:03:33.490> were

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
the news pumps I can see why they were

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.700 
the news pumps I can see why they were
saying<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.180> there<00:03:34.450> they<00:03:35.140> do<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.320> different

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
saying that there they do a different

saying that there they do a different
system<00:03:35.890> with<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> juicer<00:03:36.640> bucket<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.420> air

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
stone to aerate the water I just didn't

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.580 
stone to aerate the water I just didn't
care<00:03:40.630> for<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.870> because<00:03:41.050> I<00:03:41.230> thought<00:03:41.440> the

care for that because I thought the

care for that because I thought the
longer<00:03:41.950> be<00:03:42.040> too<00:03:42.280> neat<00:03:42.490> and<00:03:42.760> it'd<00:03:43.390> be<00:03:43.420> harder<00:03:43.750> to

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
longer be too neat and it'd be harder to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.450 
harvest them at the bottom of the bucket
or<00:03:45.910> something<00:03:46.210> like<00:03:46.330> this<00:03:46.600> really<00:03:47.460> some

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
go right in where I work anyway so for

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.580 
go right in where I work anyway so for
the<00:03:55.210> upper<00:03:55.480> container<00:03:55.840> where<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:56.140> find<00:03:56.440> this

the upper container where I find this

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.660 
the upper container where I find this
time<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.310> leaves<00:03:57.820> only<00:03:57.970> about<00:03:58.530> 3/16<00:03:59.670> to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
time is that leaves only about 3/16 to

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.570

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
spilling over

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.890 
spilling over
just<00:04:20.489> put<00:04:21.489> inside<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.970> container<00:04:22.330> there<00:04:22.630> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
just put inside the container there it

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.890 
just put inside the container there it
wedges<00:04:23.380> in<00:04:23.560> place<00:04:23.890> you<00:04:24.670> have<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.940> make<00:04:25.120> sure<00:04:25.150> to

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
wedges in place you have to make sure to

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.110 
wedges in place you have to make sure to
test<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.500> beforehand<00:04:27.130> because<00:04:27.280> as<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:27.910> found

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
test it beforehand because as I found

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.520 
test it beforehand because as I found
out<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.450> thought<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.140> was<00:04:29.320> going<00:04:29.470> to

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
out I thought that this was going to

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.140 
out I thought that this was going to
work<00:04:29.650> out<00:04:29.860> fine<00:04:30.160> but<00:04:30.430> as<00:04:30.490> soon<00:04:30.640> as<00:04:30.730> I<00:04:30.820> filled<00:04:31.060> it

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
work out fine but as soon as I filled it

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.340 
work out fine but as soon as I filled it
up<00:04:31.240> with<00:04:31.300> water<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:32.650> fell<00:04:32.920> inside<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:35.170> other

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
up with water it fell inside the other

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.450 
up with water it fell inside the other
one<00:04:35.560> which<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:35.770> nicely<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.610> one<00:04:36.910> have<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:38.020> use

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
one which is nicely this one have to use

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.690 
one which is nicely this one have to use
some<00:04:39.480> clothes<00:04:40.480> pins<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:41.080> keep<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:42.070> in<00:04:42.190> place<00:04:42.400> so

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
some clothes pins to keep it in place so

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.640 
some clothes pins to keep it in place so
that<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.180> doesn't<00:04:43.240> put<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.990> inside<00:04:44.170> of<00:04:44.380> it

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
that it doesn't put that inside of it

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.770 
that it doesn't put that inside of it
and<00:04:45.280> that's<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.670> to<00:04:45.790> allow<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.090> water<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.540> be

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
and that's just to allow the water to be

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.750 
and that's just to allow the water to be
able<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.990> trickle<00:04:47.230> out<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.460> can<00:04:51.640> do

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
able to trickle out and you can do

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.550 
able to trickle out and you can do
anything<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.150> could<00:04:52.390> literally<00:04:53.080> almost<00:04:53.290> do

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
anything you could literally almost do

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.640 
anything you could literally almost do
anything<00:04:54.040> with<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:56.050> first<00:04:56.290> one<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.530> I

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
anything with it the first one that I

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.250 
anything with it the first one that I
made<00:04:56.940> using<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.180> regular<00:04:58.390> type<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.840> dish<00:04:58.990> pan

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
made using the regular type of dish pan

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.400 
made using the regular type of dish pan
buckets<00:04:59.710> and<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.160> plastic<00:05:01.090> plastic<00:05:01.840> shoebox

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
buckets and a plastic plastic shoebox

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.320 
buckets and a plastic plastic shoebox
but<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.370> thought<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.700> try<00:05:03.820> some<00:05:04.090> other<00:05:04.240> things

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
but I thought to try some other things

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.110 
but I thought to try some other things
from<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.750> front<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.440> these<00:05:06.250> work<00:05:06.520> this

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
from the front of it and these work this

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.280 
from the front of it and these work this
one<00:05:07.330> doesn't<00:05:07.480> work<00:05:07.660> quite<00:05:07.870> as<00:05:07.960> well<00:05:08.050> but

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
one doesn't work quite as well but

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.200 
one doesn't work quite as well but
you've<00:05:08.650> got<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.830> little<00:05:09.160> confined<00:05:09.490> space<00:05:09.910> and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
you've got a little confined space and

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.240 
you've got a little confined space and
it's<00:05:11.169> to<00:05:11.290> pay<00:05:11.500> as<00:05:11.800> small<00:05:12.480> phrases<00:05:13.480> for<00:05:14.250> pencils

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
it's to pay as small phrases for pencils

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.459 
it's to pay as small phrases for pencils
or

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
or

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.829 
or
and<00:05:17.309> it<00:05:17.399> just<00:05:17.489> hangs<00:05:17.759> on<00:05:17.969> the<00:05:18.119> side<00:05:18.330> there<00:05:18.629> and

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:18.839 
and it just hangs on the side there and

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.809 
and it just hangs on the side there and
you<00:05:18.929> can<00:05:19.080> use<00:05:19.229> a<00:05:19.259> recycling<00:05:20.069> circulating<00:05:20.639> that

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
you can use a recycling circulating that

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.050 
you can use a recycling circulating that
were<00:05:21.029> there

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.180 

but<00:05:24.300> if<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.510> also<00:05:24.660> product<00:05:25.110> right<00:05:25.290> it's<00:05:26.010> sort

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
but if it also product right it's sort

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.650 
but if it also product right it's sort
of<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.310> system<00:05:26.490> this<00:05:26.760> one<00:05:26.940> works<00:05:27.150> too

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
of a system this one works too

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.780 
of a system this one works too
disposable<00:05:28.650> will<00:05:28.800> be<00:05:28.950> betrayed<00:05:29.400> container

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
disposable will be betrayed container

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.580 
disposable will be betrayed container
we're<00:05:30.180> going<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.540> build<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.840> bunch<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.170> holes<00:05:31.350> at

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
we're going to build a bunch of holes at

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.450 
we're going to build a bunch of holes at
one<00:05:31.800> end<00:05:31.980> there

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
one end there

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.060 
one end there
so<00:05:33.000> I'm<00:05:33.120> hoping<00:05:33.390> when<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:33.870> works<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.950> the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
so I'm hoping when this works that the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.620 
so I'm hoping when this works that the
worms<00:05:35.280> will<00:05:35.430> stay<00:05:35.640> in<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.820> deeper<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:36.390> more

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
worms will stay in the deeper and more

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.060 
worms will stay in the deeper and more
and

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
and

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.280 
and
again<00:05:38.970> these<00:05:39.300> are<00:05:39.480> the<00:05:39.510> harvest<00:05:39.900> from<00:05:40.080> that

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
again these are the harvest from that

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.350 
again these are the harvest from that
end<00:05:40.530> there

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
end there

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.540 
end there
I've<00:05:41.720> got<00:05:41.900> just<00:05:42.199> enough<00:05:42.379> space<00:05:42.800> like<00:05:43.159> mistake

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
I've got just enough space like mistake

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.409 
I've got just enough space like mistake
to<00:05:43.669> comprehend<00:05:45.610> but<00:05:46.610> you're<00:05:46.819> not<00:05:46.940> limited<00:05:47.389> to

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
to comprehend but you're not limited to

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.450 
to comprehend but you're not limited to

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
just one type of things in getting that

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.279 
just one type of things in getting that
great<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.849> think<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.629> can<00:05:50.780> try<00:05:50.960> any

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
great you think you can try any

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.860 
great you think you can try any
combination<00:05:52.099> of<00:05:52.159> items<00:05:52.550> in<00:05:52.879> our<00:05:53.150> space<00:05:53.629> that

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
combination of items in our space that

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.530 
combination of items in our space that
you<00:05:54.050> have

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
you have

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.960 
you have
and<00:05:56.050> this<00:05:56.230> isn't<00:05:56.470> them<00:05:56.650> pretty<00:05:57.070> much<00:05:57.340> these

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
and this isn't them pretty much these

and this isn't them pretty much these
the<00:05:58.180> way<00:05:58.300> I've<00:05:58.570> set<00:05:58.780> up<00:05:58.840> for<00:05:59.230> is<00:06:00.210> store<00:06:01.210> the
