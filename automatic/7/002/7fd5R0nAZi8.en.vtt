through<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.480> game<00:00:49.719> create<00:00:50.230> save<00:00:50.559> points

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
through the game create save points

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.189 
through the game create save points
everywhere<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.600> way<00:00:52.719> you<00:00:52.780> can<00:00:52.930> go<00:00:53.019> back

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
order to take these guys out because i

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.359 
order to take these guys out because i
just<00:01:27.579> found<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.329> it<00:01:28.600> was<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.979> was<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.189> little

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
just found that it was it was a little

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.230 
just found that it was it was a little
more<00:01:30.490> difficult<00:01:30.759> not<00:01:31.390> not<00:01:31.840> doing<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.259> well

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
more difficult not not doing that well

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.840 
more difficult not not doing that well
was<00:01:34.240> yeah<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.770> hadn't<00:01:35.770> done<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:35.979> I<00:01:36.220> tried<00:01:36.729> it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
was yeah I hadn't done it I tried it

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.240 
was yeah I hadn't done it I tried it
probably<00:01:37.180> about<00:01:37.329> six<00:01:37.659> or<00:01:37.750> seven<00:01:38.049> times<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.680> I

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
probably about six or seven times and I

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.700 
probably about six or seven times and I
couldn't<00:01:39.460> get<00:01:39.670> them<00:01:39.820> all<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.380> should<00:01:41.560> went

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
couldn't get them all so I should went

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.859 
couldn't get them all so I should went
back<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.399> low<00:01:42.579> later<00:01:42.820> on<00:01:43.060> as<00:01:43.270> our

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
back so this is a low later on as our

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.630 
back so this is a low later on as our
checkpoint<00:01:44.469> for<00:01:44.890> going<00:01:45.100> into<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.430> elevator

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
checkpoint for going into the elevator

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.060 
checkpoint for going into the elevator
so<00:01:46.299> we're<00:01:46.420> going<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.600> try<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.810> again<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.649> see

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
so we're going to try this again and see

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.800 
so we're going to try this again and see
if<00:01:48.100> we<00:01:48.219> can<00:01:48.340> do<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.909> is<00:01:49.210> actually<00:01:49.630> my

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
if we can do it and this is actually my

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.980 
if we can do it and this is actually my
successful<00:01:50.590> attempt<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.509> know<00:01:52.630> really

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
successful attempt so you know really

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.630 
successful attempt so you know really
the<00:01:53.200> key<00:01:53.380> point<00:01:53.649> here<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.189> got<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.399> be

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
the key point here is you got to be

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.149 
the key point here is you got to be
super<00:01:55.119> fast<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.719> gotta<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.590> know<00:01:56.619> I'm

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
super fast you gotta you know I'm

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.760 
super fast you gotta you know I'm
constantly<00:01:57.880> scanning<00:01:58.390> around<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.350> elevator

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
constantly scanning around the elevator

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.499 
constantly scanning around the elevator
because<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.219> pretty<00:02:00.369> much<00:02:00.490> have<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.390> know

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
because you pretty much have a you know

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.889 
because you pretty much have a you know
a<00:02:01.539> 360<00:02:02.320> degree<00:02:02.979> line<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.700> sight<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.630> have<00:02:04.750> all
