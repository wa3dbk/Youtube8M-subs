00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.670
 good day dear but simple today 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.980
 Just go on tour in which you 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.150
 Do you see the meadow? I'll just go now 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.250
 a little just managed to look 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.320
 what you find here but first 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.759
 Drink nice hot tea and we will 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.390
 I find it tense then I say 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.250
 first cheers so first good signal 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.579
 first find a very small one 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.410
 button, I believe a bit 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.809
 I had to be very weak on that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:50.520
 clean it and then we'll have a look 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:53.200
 closer to and deep about five centimeters 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.750
 next and a ring of copper or 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.590
 bronze 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.720
 maybe finger ring i think 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:06.009
 but now less and the fund was 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:10.090
 hidden at a depth of about 20 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.360
 centimeters so I have the job 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.360
 changed 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 on a different meadow and yes yesterday 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.360
 first signal is that good signal and 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.060
 already shows a coin which is regional 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.130
 I think you have to clean it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.409
 I still like it about 18 ticks 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 mode because here high voltage lines 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.080
 are and that is always a bit 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.260
 a good start 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.190
 there to the next reason first of it 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.080
 again on the surface 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.760
 some kind of button but we are 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.229
 placed that was not found so much 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.670
 small 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.280
 nor has clean and then we see the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.680
 was first invented nice button there 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 is also on it sign coat of arms or 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 so and all this spectacular 12 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.800
 he has a hardworking surface 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.840
 Wonderful looks good too 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.400
 but I suppose with a nice looking 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.980
 I still have one today and a customer 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.980
 made him unpack now together 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:36.130
 a beautiful thick old fast decorated 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.130
 how it looks 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.580
 but also for us 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.720
 who sees the summer the vliet 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.159
 hello people i'm on my way again and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.110
 Although fantastic here fantastic 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.819
 weather sun shines behind me i have 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.110
 discovered the old way I hope now 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.700
 to see that a little intro chamber 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.019
 and I'm really looking forward to what I'm here 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.030
 I really think I have a good feeling 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.830
 today big coil unpacked and it works 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.500
 go ahead then you're right with the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.819
 first find so people here first 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.819
 signal very close to the surface 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.430
 I will not go under again 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.970
 problem 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:52.709
 later monster suits me super 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.420
 at first and likes to do 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.420
 probably from the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.859
 water bottle so some of these people 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.930
 but you can split here 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.730
 family pack unearthed no idea 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.650
 Why 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.690
 On the head we had no idea 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.569
 is well preserved that I take with 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.660
 the x server and you can still do that 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.570
 as round box not bad shortly further 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.950
 and alike so far unfortunately 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.690
 not as successful as I hoped 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.450
 actually looked pretty good out of the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.450
 away but down to this scrap big 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.510
 for krempel was very little wants in the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.280
 Hardly any wood now you can still see 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.500
 piece down maybe there is still one 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.060
 little interesting I 'll do it 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.450
 a little and with us the same 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.880
 again so super runs full hit 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.680
 We were now two hours in the forest and 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.220
 is not really found what 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.410
 It goes two steps in the meadow and 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.690
 second signal a roman coin i 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.830
 Can not believe it friends 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.880
 Look at the deepness of madness 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.160
 twelve centimeters 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.050
 I have already seen something green and 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.090
 thought this is something old and 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.960
 indeed 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.870
 I can not measure it clearly the super 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.310
 folks and then I go a few more 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.550
 meter in the meadow look at whether one 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.560
 few beautiful things are the same 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.780
 to laminate nice signal had with 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.360
 1 80 leitwerk somehow ornament me 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:26.490
 I do not have it too clean 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:29.040
 made of nature or something 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.060
 the blow or key got through this 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.960
 is pretty and ok so start somehow 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:41.460
 north or so but still interesting 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.400
 but ok are now often to the car 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.210
 maybe there will be something else 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:52.500
 otherwise it will be enough until next time 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:55.410
 again part of one for a long time 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.350
 bell so that you spitzname the 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.660
 Glockner finally wear again 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.050
 comes nice wish 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.820
 I would like to find something completely 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.680
 pity that always broken times look 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.729
 maybe I'll find another one 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.650
 part of it good until next and 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.800
 what now all in the forest but find 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.800
 can 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:07:11.140
 That's how one shot fell. I have one 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.140
 very simple short question to you 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.720
 prefers your metal detectors without 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.100
 Display or with ad would me 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.290
 if that's in the comments 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.740
 would write and then until the 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.740
 next time
