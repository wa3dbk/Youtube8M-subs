00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.240
 installation and mishandling of co2 of 252 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.960
 when this game I was looking for 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.390
 over for a long time I was looking at 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.810

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.390

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.170

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.940
 compressed as they are 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.460
 we are not going to have to decompress it 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.970
 to download it only give in 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.340
