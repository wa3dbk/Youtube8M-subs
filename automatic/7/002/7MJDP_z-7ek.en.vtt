 good hello all kids this is fish 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.270
 to youtube and in this video I wanted 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.660
 talk a little bit about the news 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.879
 what apple could you implement in 7.2 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.920
 where the truth is that apple still does not 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.890
 has even officially launched 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.960
 there is a 7.1 but in the network then good 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.070
 as always she is speculating 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.929
 what apple could take out on May 7.2 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.820
 seen a concept on the internet that has 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.950
 seemed pretty good and I wanted 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.290
 share it with you 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.200
 well guys one of the things that I most 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.150
 has liked this concept of 7.2 is the 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.520
 possibility to encrypt our 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.980
 applications with a security code 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.820
 what I find very interesting and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.739
 pretty useful the iphone5 s worth how 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.720
 you are going to see now on screen we could 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.580
 unlock coded folders 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.579
 security or with the fingerprint sensor 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.039
 fingerprints 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.960
 another thing that is very good is the button 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.020
 to remove all apps in second 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 flat in multitasking 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 and good guys one of the most novelties 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.310
 interesting from the concept of it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.180
 7.2 is the ability to answer 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.670
 directly as you are seeing in 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.140
 screen from notifications 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.720
 I think this should implement it 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.670
 appel the year 7.2 without any doubt 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.940
 good guys how have you seen the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.400
 improvements of this concept of 17.2 are very 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.170
 little but very useful I would like 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.930
 you put me down in the comments 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.330
 what would you do to him 7 for 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.860
 improve it this has been all for today and 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.870
 good as usual if you liked 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.700
