lost<00:02:18.790> me<00:02:18.970> again<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.450> fast<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.050> crazy<00:02:20.319> to

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
lost me again so fast it's crazy to

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.740 
lost me again so fast it's crazy to
think<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.740> you'll<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:22.090> will<00:02:22.120> lose<00:02:22.450> points

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
think that you'll you will lose points

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.050 
think that you'll you will lose points
like<00:02:23.080> nobody's<00:02:23.500> business<00:02:23.760> maybe<00:02:24.760> if<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.910> can

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
like nobody's business maybe if I can

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.949 
like nobody's business maybe if I can
turn<00:02:25.150> around<00:02:25.270> here<00:02:25.480> might<00:02:25.600> be<00:02:25.630> able<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:25.930> a

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
turn around here might be able to get a

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.230 
turn around here might be able to get a
couple<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.319> kills<00:02:26.530> yes<00:02:27.190> 200<00:02:27.730> for<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.910> capture

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
couple of kills yes 200 for a capture

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.090 
couple of kills yes 200 for a capture
kill<00:02:28.420> then<00:02:29.020> for<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.260> vsat<00:02:29.620> assistant<00:02:30.040> look

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
kill then for that vsat assistant look

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.140 
kill then for that vsat assistant look
at<00:02:30.220> all<00:02:30.340> these<00:02:30.459> points<00:02:30.880> oh<00:02:31.000> my<00:02:31.270> god<00:02:31.510> plus<00:02:33.120> 525<00:02:34.120> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
at all these points oh my god plus 525 I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.580 
at all these points oh my god plus 525 I
think<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.540> captured<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.050> point<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.380> killed

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
think I captured the point and killed

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.500 
think I captured the point and killed
two<00:02:35.800> guys<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.880> was<00:02:37.000> an<00:02:37.090> orbital<00:02:37.390> vsat

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
two guys and that was an orbital vsat

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.210 
two guys and that was an orbital vsat
just<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.290> little<00:02:38.500> sequence<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:39.130> events

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
just that little sequence of events

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.270 
just that little sequence of events
orbital<00:02:39.880> vsat<00:02:40.030> check<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.660> shit<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:41.280> that's

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
orbital vsat check that shit out that's

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.470 
orbital vsat check that shit out that's
awesome<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.940> think<00:02:43.150> that's<00:02:43.270> absolutely

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
awesome I think that's absolutely

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.870 
awesome I think that's absolutely
amazing<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.350> think<00:02:44.590> if<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.220> comes<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.610> future

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
amazing I think if it comes to future

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.580 
amazing I think if it comes to future

rewarded<00:02:58.120> more<00:02:58.390> because<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.110> be<00:02:59.200> honest<00:02:59.440> it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
rewarded more because to be honest it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.050 
rewarded more because to be honest it
makes<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.830> lot<00:02:59.920> more<00:02:59.980> fun<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.580> watch<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.970> it

makes it a lot more fun to play using

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.370 
makes it a lot more fun to play using
the<00:03:03.580> little<00:03:04.480> bit<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.870> hitch<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.290> my

predictable god they're not entirely
controllable<00:03:17.380> because<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.799> such<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> small

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
controllable because it is such a small

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.560 
controllable because it is such a small
map<00:03:18.579> but<00:03:18.820> what<00:03:18.940> I'm<00:03:19.030> going<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.180> try<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.390> do

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
map but what I'm going to try to do

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.509 
map but what I'm going to try to do
before<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.019> round<00:03:20.290> ends<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:21.130> only<00:03:21.280> got<00:03:21.400> about

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
before this round ends we only got about

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.390 
before this round ends we only got about
30<00:03:21.820> seconds<00:03:22.209> left<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.190> another

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
30 seconds left is to get to another

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.979 
30 seconds left is to get to another
orbital<00:03:24.820> vsat<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.329> we<00:03:25.390> can<00:03:25.540> start<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.870> next

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
orbital vsat so we can start the next

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.280 
orbital vsat so we can start the next
round<00:03:26.200> fresh<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.920> know<00:03:27.459> right<00:03:27.820> now<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.780> I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
round fresh I know right now that if I

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.479 
round fresh I know right now that if I
run<00:03:29.500> out<00:03:29.530> there<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.040> be<00:03:30.190> I'm<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.430> to

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
run out there and to be I'm going to

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.280 
run out there and to be I'm going to
lose<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:30.730> orbital<00:03:31.299> vsat<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.870> we<00:03:31.959> got<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.200> be

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
lose that orbital vsat so we got to be

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.780 
lose that orbital vsat so we got to be
really<00:03:32.769> careful<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.370> run<00:03:33.489> around<00:03:33.579> their

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
really careful and run around their

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.340 
really careful and run around their

process and the problem is with looping
your<00:04:10.390> score<00:04:10.600> streaks<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:10.959> just<00:04:11.140> use<00:04:11.350> them<00:04:11.500> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
your score streaks I just use them to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.259 
your score streaks I just use them to
openal<00:04:11.920> vsat<00:04:12.280> on<00:04:12.400> top<00:04:12.579> of<00:04:12.730> an<00:04:12.850> orbital<00:04:13.150> vsat

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
openal vsat on top of an orbital vsat

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.690 
openal vsat on top of an orbital vsat
and<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.380> has<00:04:14.530> happened<00:04:14.859> sometimes<00:04:15.250> in

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
looping that process all over again it's

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.969 
looping that process all over again it's
a<00:06:01.150> it's<00:06:01.960> a<00:06:02.080> lot<00:06:02.229> of<00:06:02.320> fun<00:06:02.470> for<00:06:02.500> you<00:06:02.770> guys<00:06:02.800> that

a it's a lot of fun for you guys that
are<00:06:03.280> having<00:06:03.430> issues<00:06:03.669> with<00:06:03.910> hijack<00:06:04.479> and<00:06:04.599> you

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
are having issues with hijack and you

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.940 
are having issues with hijack and you
might<00:06:04.810> not<00:06:04.840> be<00:06:05.050> doing<00:06:05.229> the<00:06:05.320> best<00:06:05.500> on<00:06:05.650> this<00:06:05.740> map

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
might not be doing the best on this map

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.200 
might not be doing the best on this map
one<00:06:06.460> thing<00:06:06.610> I<00:06:06.669> could<00:06:06.789> recommend<00:06:06.940> is

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
one thing I could recommend is

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.760 
one thing I could recommend is
definitely<00:06:07.599> going<00:06:07.750> to<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.110> bottom<00:06:08.530> side<00:06:08.740> of

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
definitely going to the bottom side of

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.400 
definitely going to the bottom side of
the<00:06:08.919> map<00:06:09.099> and<00:06:09.310> then<00:06:09.490> flanking<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.030> little<00:06:10.270> bit

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
the map and then flanking a little bit

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.659 
the map and then flanking a little bit
what<00:06:11.410> I<00:06:11.440> usually<00:06:11.620> end<00:06:11.830> up<00:06:11.979> doing<00:06:12.250> in<00:06:12.340> this<00:06:12.460> game

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
what I usually end up doing in this game

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.670 
what I usually end up doing in this game
is<00:06:12.880> I'm<00:06:13.060> aware<00:06:13.539> of<00:06:13.599> that<00:06:13.750> so<00:06:14.050> I<00:06:14.139> will<00:06:14.289> run<00:06:14.470> over

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
is I'm aware of that so I will run over

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.060 
is I'm aware of that so I will run over
back<00:06:15.250> into<00:06:15.789> our<00:06:16.060> our<00:06:16.510> cabin<00:06:16.960> where<00:06:17.530> our<00:06:17.740> spawn

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
back into our our cabin where our spawn

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.460 
back into our our cabin where our spawn
is<00:06:18.310> and<00:06:18.550> try<00:06:18.970> to<00:06:19.030> take<00:06:19.660> advantage<00:06:19.780> that<00:06:20.260> and

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
is and try to take advantage that and

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.650 
is and try to take advantage that and
shoot<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:20.680> couple<00:06:20.800> of<00:06:21.010> guys<00:06:21.160> down<00:06:21.389> but<00:06:22.389> it<00:06:22.479> ends

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
shoot a couple of guys down but it ends

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.110 
shoot a couple of guys down but it ends
up<00:06:22.750> being<00:06:22.780> a<00:06:23.139> pretty<00:06:23.580> controlling<00:06:24.580> game<00:06:24.910> in

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
up being a pretty controlling game in

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.300 
up being a pretty controlling game in
the<00:06:25.240> very<00:06:25.270> end<00:06:25.690> if<00:06:26.320> you<00:06:26.380> if<00:06:26.770> you're<00:06:26.919> a<00:06:26.950> little

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
the very end if you if you're a little

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.279 
the very end if you if you're a little
clever<00:06:27.700> about<00:06:27.970> where<00:06:28.300> the<00:06:28.450> enemy<00:06:28.720> is<00:06:28.750> used<00:06:29.050> to

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
clever about where the enemy is used to

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.740 
clever about where the enemy is used to
I'd<00:06:29.680> be<00:06:29.950> the<00:06:30.250> opposition<00:06:30.789> being<00:06:31.000> oh<00:06:31.180> my<00:06:31.570> god

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
I'd be the opposition being oh my god

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.390 
I'd be the opposition being oh my god
dudes<00:06:32.080> just<00:06:32.289> shoved<00:06:32.830> in<00:06:32.979> there<00:06:33.130> like<00:06:33.250> they're

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
dudes just shoved in there like they're

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.399 
dudes just shoved in there like they're
a<00:06:33.430> freaking<00:06:33.820> clamp<00:06:34.120> if<00:06:34.659> you<00:06:34.840> take<00:06:34.990> advantage

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
a freaking clamp if you take advantage

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.230 
a freaking clamp if you take advantage
of<00:06:35.469> those<00:06:35.590> moments<00:06:35.740> were<00:06:36.099> the<00:06:36.700> opposition

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
of those moments were the opposition

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.600 
of those moments were the opposition
knows

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
knows

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.070 
knows
a lot<00:06:37.819> of<00:06:37.849> enemies<00:06:38.240> show<00:06:38.389> up<00:06:38.479> from<00:06:38.599> this<00:06:38.750> area

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
a lot of enemies show up from this area

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.600 
a lot of enemies show up from this area
I'm<00:06:39.289> not<00:06:39.469> going<00:06:39.650> to<00:06:39.740> show<00:06:39.889> up<00:06:39.919> from<00:06:40.250> that<00:06:40.400> area

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
I'm not going to show up from that area

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.770 
I'm not going to show up from that area
I'm<00:06:40.909> going<00:06:40.969> to<00:06:41.120> show<00:06:41.210> up<00:06:41.330> from<00:06:41.449> a<00:06:41.539> spot<00:06:41.750> that

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
I'm going to show up from a spot that

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.439 
I'm going to show up from a spot that
people<00:06:42.770> don't<00:06:42.949> always<00:06:43.219> die<00:06:43.759> from<00:06:44.150> you<00:06:44.330> know

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
people don't always die from you know

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:45.760 
people don't always die from you know
what<00:06:44.539> I<00:06:44.599> mean<00:06:44.629> and<00:06:44.900> it's<00:06:44.990> hard<00:06:45.199> to<00:06:45.319> think<00:06:45.349> about

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
what I mean and it's hard to think about

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.559 
what I mean and it's hard to think about
that<00:06:45.919> a<00:06:45.979> lot<00:06:46.219> of<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.400> times<00:06:46.699> but<00:06:47.060> once<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.449> get

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569 
that a lot of the times but once you get

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.839 
that a lot of the times but once you get
used<00:06:47.960> to<00:06:48.080> it<00:06:48.169> it<00:06:48.800> becomes<00:06:49.039> much<00:06:49.340> easier<00:06:49.370> to

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
used to it it becomes much easier to

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:51.999 
used to it it becomes much easier to
understand<00:06:50.270> exactly<00:06:51.020> where<00:06:51.650> you<00:06:51.800> should<00:06:51.830> be

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.009 
understand exactly where you should be

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:53.980 
understand exactly where you should be
putting<00:06:52.219> yourself<00:06:52.699> to<00:06:52.849> prevent<00:06:53.240> death<00:06:53.689> and

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
putting yourself to prevent death and

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.969 
putting yourself to prevent death and
here's<00:06:54.139> one<00:06:54.289> of<00:06:54.349> those<00:06:54.469> guys<00:06:54.650> trying<00:06:54.830> to<00:06:54.860> make

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
here's one of those guys trying to make

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.189 
here's one of those guys trying to make
it<00:06:55.099> through<00:06:55.310> to<00:06:56.300> the<00:06:56.330> bottom<00:06:56.719> side<00:06:56.870> to<00:06:57.080> get

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
it through to the bottom side to get

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.600 
it through to the bottom side to get
into<00:06:57.379> our<00:06:57.530> spawn<00:06:57.770> and<00:06:58.069> not<00:06:58.280> going<00:06:58.400> to<00:06:58.490> have

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
into our spawn and not going to have

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.040 
into our spawn and not going to have
none<00:06:58.759> of<00:06:58.789> that<00:06:58.879> especially<00:06:59.599> with<00:06:59.689> an<00:06:59.780> orbital

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
none of that especially with an orbital

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.950 
none of that especially with an orbital
vsat<00:07:00.169> so<00:07:00.979> a<00:07:01.280> fairly<00:07:01.909> successful<00:07:02.509> game<00:07:02.689> and

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
vsat so a fairly successful game and

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.990 
vsat so a fairly successful game and
kind<00:07:03.169> of<00:07:03.199> a<00:07:03.289> crazy<00:07:03.590> score<00:07:04.159> in<00:07:04.310> the<00:07:04.430> very<00:07:04.610> end<00:07:04.819> as

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
kind of a crazy score in the very end as

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.790 
kind of a crazy score in the very end as
well<00:07:05.150> I<00:07:05.210> think<00:07:05.479> we<00:07:05.780> finalized<00:07:06.319> this<00:07:06.560> game

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
well I think we finalized this game

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.080 
well I think we finalized this game
going<00:07:07.129> about<00:07:07.900> 104<00:07:08.900> to<00:07:09.169> 7<00:07:09.620> with<00:07:10.129> seven<00:07:10.430> captures

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
going about 104 to 7 with seven captures

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.290 
going about 104 to 7 with seven captures
and<00:07:11.360> 38<00:07:12.259> freaking<00:07:13.069> defends<00:07:13.490> I<00:07:13.729> think<00:07:13.939> that's<00:07:14.120> a

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
and 38 freaking defends I think that's a
