just dictated it from the points

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.020 
just dictated it from the points
basically<00:02:14.420> take<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.870> or<00:02:14.959> leave<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.880> once<00:02:16.880> they

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
basically take it or leave it once they

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.309 
basically take it or leave it once they
pretty<00:02:17.270> much<00:02:17.360> did<00:02:17.720> anywhere<00:02:18.080> because<00:02:18.170> they

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
pretty much did anywhere because they

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.910 
pretty much did anywhere because they
run<00:02:18.560> golden<00:02:18.920> boy<00:02:19.100> at<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.180> time<00:02:20.260> now<00:02:21.260> they

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
run golden boy at the time now they

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.250

don't want no parts of at this moment

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.680 
don't want no parts of at this moment

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
especially if you may weather so you

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.900 
especially if you may weather so you
know<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.650> future<00:03:37.100> we'll<00:03:37.340> see<00:03:37.579> what<00:03:37.760> happens

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910

but<00:03:38.269> that's<00:03:38.570> right<00:03:38.870> now<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.590> know<00:03:39.850> three<00:03:40.850> big

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
but that's right now you know three big

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.300 
but that's right now you know three big
fights<00:03:41.360> they<00:03:41.870> can<00:03:42.079> probably<00:03:42.709> get<00:03:42.829> someone<00:03:43.190> to

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
fights they can probably get someone to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.140 
fights they can probably get someone to
distribute<00:03:43.910> easy<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:45.400> get<00:03:46.400> their<00:03:46.640> money<00:03:46.880> I

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
distribute easy and get their money I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.720 
distribute easy and get their money I
mean<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.840> really<00:03:48.590> don't<00:03:48.890> see<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.130> why<00:03:49.549> they

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
mean I really don't see that why they

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.910 
mean I really don't see that why they
have<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.060> rush<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.510> get<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.920> promoters

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
have to rush to get the promoters

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.030 
have to rush to get the promoters
license<00:03:52.930> when<00:03:53.930> they're<00:03:54.140> in<00:03:54.230> position<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.829> think

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
license when they're in position I think

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.569 
license when they're in position I think
there's<00:03:55.220> something<00:03:55.400> they'll<00:03:55.700> do<00:03:55.880> how<00:03:56.750> about

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
there's something they'll do how about

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.690 
there's something they'll do how about
see<00:03:58.579> see<00:03:59.000> how<00:03:59.060> quick<00:03:59.329> that<00:03:59.480> was
