00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.359
 Good day today we will spend 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.400
 experiences using our having protect for 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.990
 cleaning life systems on the car 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.799
 peugeot 406 engine 2 fire each 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.890
 common rail system 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:27.920
 bosch production services now we 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:30.660
 before holding our note that 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.550
 maximum possible parameters 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.989
 field deviation 2 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.579
 millimeter cubic per cycle 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.629
 we start the car working temperature 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.629
 Approximately 80 degrees 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.520
 diagnose bold adapter lexia 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:02.260
 let the current parameters of the car 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:06.050
 We see the first virgin parcel works 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.300
 perfect almost zero second cylinder 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.590
 correction reach four millimeters 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.970
 street cycle 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.300
 3 your bag with wear and tear 40 percent 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.640
 4 nozzle again exceeds 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.729
 all kinds of tolerance at best 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.280
 car 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.240
 remove the chip from 1 swap 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.240
 connect our rejoice 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.120
 in this car is under we know 2 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:02:03.179
 Dima screwdriver chip shot made 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:08.690
 we meet connections directly 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:11.599
 own water we have reverse flow it 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.830
 where does fuel come from 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.450
 reprocessing fuel residue 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:34.950
 there is a feed pump pump here on such 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:37.019
 quickly renter removed so then we 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.500
 hooked up our unit fuel system 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.220
 peugeot here we see our feed here 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.220
 see processing 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.280
 fuel pressure is inserted here 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.280
 now we fill 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:03:00.950
 clean for diesel fuel systems 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.950
 and not system super clear 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.920
 flooded 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.370
 is disabled 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:35.540
 run the installation awfully please stand 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.540
 and turn on the engine ignition 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.640
 we get 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.340
 time working 15 minutes 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.290
 15 minutes at idle 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.230
 to wait 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.470
 after cleaning see the following result 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.750
 pay attention to our monitor 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.480
 computer 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.170
 all four injector correction is normal 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.620
 admission 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.460
 4 nozzle which was more options 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.570
 three millimeters cubic per cycle 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.240
 see 043 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.790
 perfect result amount 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.670
 injected control quantities and 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.880
 fuel drain decreased from 11 to 7 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.410
 cubic millimeters per cycle is 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:27.390
 says that the car will be reduced 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:29.980
 fuel consumption for better effect and 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.510
 prevention I recommend using 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.510
 fuel tank after so 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.409
 protect common rail system print brother 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.460
 poured it recommended at 80 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.250
 liters of fuel in fact 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.680
 mister is no longer in this car 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.569
 correction can be believed think 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.800
 that she will be 0 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.800
 Thanks for attention
