00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.639
 like the alaska malamud the percheron 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.639
 from North 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.270
 big strong and able to walk 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.920
 great distances 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.719
 this great working race 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.460
 resistance can survive in 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.220
 temperatures of up to 20 degrees under 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
 zero are sturdy and expressive dogs 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.470
 the bad many are known for their 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.119
 barking style singing is a dog bred 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.730
 to get along with the other dogs 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.150
 of his pack 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.130
 puppy 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.289
 the first ancestors of the malamud of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 alaska of which you have record 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.489
 they worked with a native tribe in 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 1700 the bad many use their 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.910
 dogs to hunt and to pull their 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.740
 heavy sledges on covered floors 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.170
 ice snow 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.970
 the explorer and admiral richard bird 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.560
 led a group of evil to many to the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.370
 Antarctic during its expedition in the 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.050
 south pole in 1933 the malamud outperform 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.200
 the other shooting dogs with their size 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.770
 gigantic usually weigh between 35 and 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.810
 45 kilos 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.880
 that weight is due to its bone structure 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.400
 big and dense and its musculature 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.410
 developed the broad chest pushes the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.510
 sled harness and big muscles 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.090
 of the hind legs push the animal 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.670
 forward but there's more 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.729
 of alaska can walk eternally is 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.560
 tireless does not require effort but the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 black pigmentation is common to all 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.880
 arctic animals avoid burns 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.770
 solar and the damage of the powerful rays 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.200
 ultraviolet that are reflected in the ice 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.850
 its oily outer coat repels the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.770
 humidity and retains the hot air 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.229
 inside the insulating bottom layer of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.420
 shaggy hair but its most characteristic 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.310
 valuable are its legs similar to those of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 a bear the claws spread like the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 of the cats to hold on to the ice 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
 and the quilted bases work like 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 snowshoes some owners of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.490
 bad many take advantage of the skills 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.280
 innate of their dogs in the snow in a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.710
 sport called skiing and they cry 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.720
 using cross country or mountain skis 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.390
 the skier and the dog are wearing a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.100
 harness and a rope that connects 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.310
 what makes both work as a team 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.760
 throughout the competition very well 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.760
 here we go 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.110
 terra rail and its bad alaska saya and 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.530
 moon are really happy skiing 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.530
 together 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.900
 that's this so special tie was created 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.520
 already from the beginning terra visited the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.290
 litter of dogs when they had five 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.350
 weeks to choose a bad puppy 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.510
 fashion one day you had there in the skirt and already 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.160
 I had chosen it when the moon started 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.600
 bark all the time they see very well I gave 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.050
 mind that she also wanted to come 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.180
 home with me hug terres lover of 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.060
 nature likes to ski and climb 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.040
 rocks her bitches accompany her in all 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.040
 your outdoor adventures at least it's 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.170
 that as a child I knew there were dogs 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.000
 that dragged their owners over 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.000
 skiing so it includes my pets 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.270
 terror and his sorrows in cross country skiing 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.110
 the mountains of North Seattle 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.630
 we usually get up early 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.780
 to climb the mountain when they see me 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.370
 take the skis gets very excited in 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.400
 As I leave off the auto start 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.500
 to run and discharge energy then they 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.190
 He placed the harness and we spent all day in 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.190
 nature 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.420
 and that is 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.780
 as always they are with me I trust in 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.730
 they trust me so I do not 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.760
 I'm afraid to tie myself with a harness to two 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.590
 bitches of 80 kilos and that tie so 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.110
 special is what allows them to practice 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.150
 skijoring safely one day 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.190
 we were on the track and the bitches 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.810
 they advanced at an angle perpendicular to me 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.360
 mommy and they ended up dragging me with 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.010
 they both worried about me and 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.290
 they ran back to see if I was 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.520
 well then I realized that they know 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.220
 very well what they do when they are 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.790
 with me the snow is a real party 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.790
 for them 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.480
 tough and active dogs the bad 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.640
 many are prepared for 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.290
 inhospitable landscapes if they do not have a 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.160
 assigned activity can become 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.280
 quite sedentary 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.420
 but they still need a lot of exercise 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.300
 it's already a daily hour of exercise 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.300
 quite intense and then another hour of 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.560
 caresses in the armchair usually 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.209
 they get along well with the members of their 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.820
 own pack but if they take them to 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.100
 park be careful not necessarily 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.750
 They get along well with dogs 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.480
 Training a bad bike requires 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.850
 constancy and concentration must be 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.610
 train puppies especially 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.620
 if there are small children that have in 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.390
 account that the malamute is a kind of 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.920
 dog that can not be forced 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.110
 no way to do something you do not want 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.670
 you have to be creative and imagine ways 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.950
 to motivate him to do what he 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.230
 we want created to work as a team 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.850
 the evil master of alaska gets along well 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.620
 with the dogs he knows and with all 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.750
 kind of families but as in the case 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.430
 of any dog malamud should not 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.780
 leave in the company of young children 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.370
 Unsupervised 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.590
 I think the bad many can be 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.890
 good for families with children but 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.430
 remember that they are very large dogs 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.780
 well they are usually friendly with children 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.710
 I would not be surprised if sometimes 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.500
 they will hit by accident 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.300
 he is smiling if he is taken to a park 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.190
 with other dogs and remove the leash 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.320
 so that they run free there can be 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.300
 problems and how they were born to work 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.920
 in packs the alaskan mammoths 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.350
 they are good with all kinds of families 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.450
 you are also and like many races 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.060
 large are likely to have dysplasia 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.040
 of hips in general can walk 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.660
 for hours in high environments and 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.150
 They are also excellent companions in 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.100
 Leisure time is best to avoid going to the 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.710
 park with them are prone to have 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.630
 joint problems is a race 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.360
 stubborn and independent that requires 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.740
 constant training the malamud are 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.669
 excellent for active families 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.669
 that today very well
