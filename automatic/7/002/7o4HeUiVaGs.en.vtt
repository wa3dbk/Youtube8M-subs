hey<00:00:20.030> guys<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:20.630> today's<00:00:21.170> weapon<00:00:21.680> review<00:00:22.100> is<00:00:22.340> all

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
hey guys so today's weapon review is all

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.990 
hey guys so today's weapon review is all
about<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.030> SKS<00:00:23.720> demo<00:00:24.490> with<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.640> recent

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
about the SKS demo with the recent

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.600 
about the SKS demo with the recent
changes<00:00:26.420> to<00:00:26.660> DMR's<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:27.770> thought<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.310> would<00:00:28.460> be<00:00:28.580> a

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
changes to DMR's I thought it would be a

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.229 
changes to DMR's I thought it would be a
good<00:00:29.060> idea<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.690> finally<00:00:30.200> review<00:00:30.740> one<00:00:31.239> before

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
good idea to finally review one before

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.170 
good idea to finally review one before
dice<00:00:32.540> had<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.080> DMR<00:00:33.470> changes<00:00:33.950> I<00:00:34.100> really<00:00:34.910> never

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
dice had the DMR changes I really never

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.420 
dice had the DMR changes I really never
ever<00:00:35.480> used<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.989> Amar's<00:00:36.320> that<00:00:37.160> was<00:00:37.280> so

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
ever used the Amar's that was so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.690 
ever used the Amar's that was so
underpowered<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.960> completely<00:00:39.890> making<00:00:40.430> them

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
underpowered it completely making them

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.490 
underpowered it completely making them
almost<00:00:41.200> useless

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
almost useless

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.580 
almost useless
I<00:00:42.770> mean<00:00:42.950> four<00:00:43.670> shot<00:00:43.970> kills<00:00:44.360> without<00:00:45.230> body

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
I mean four shot kills without body

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.950 
I mean four shot kills without body
armor<00:00:45.680> was<00:00:46.100> just<00:00:46.340> ridiculous<00:00:47.180> for<00:00:47.600> those<00:00:47.720> who

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
armor was just ridiculous for those who

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.380 
armor was just ridiculous for those who
don't<00:00:48.290> know<00:00:48.410> all<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:48.980> DMR's<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:49.790> r3<00:00:50.180> shot

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
don't know all the DMR's and the r3 shot

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.140 
don't know all the DMR's and the r3 shot
kills<00:00:50.690> at<00:00:50.989> any<00:00:51.230> range<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:51.949> two<00:00:52.400> shot<00:00:52.640> kills<00:00:52.909> if

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
kills at any range and two shot kills if

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.390 
kills at any range and two shot kills if
you<00:00:53.180> get<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.449> headshot<00:00:53.870> dice<00:00:54.440> also<00:00:54.949> reduce<00:00:55.280> a

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
you get a headshot dice also reduce a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.939 
you get a headshot dice also reduce a
recon<00:00:55.909> bullet<00:00:56.390> spreads<00:00:56.720> are<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:56.989> bit<00:00:57.260> easier<00:00:57.680> to

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
recon bullet spreads are a bit easier to

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.950 
recon bullet spreads are a bit easier to
shoot<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.820> just<00:00:59.180> handle<00:00:59.480> your<00:00:59.629> weapon<00:00:59.900> a

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
shoot and just handle your weapon a

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.990 
shoot and just handle your weapon a
little<00:01:00.199> better<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.739> all<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.489> boards<00:01:01.850> are

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
little better and all the boards are

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.660 
little better and all the boards are
basically<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:02.839> a<00:01:02.930> tighter<00:01:03.230> spread<00:01:03.830> but<00:01:04.220> even

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
basically in a tighter spread but even

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.700 
basically in a tighter spread but even
with<00:01:04.820> these<00:01:05.059> changes<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:05.600> still<00:01:06.140> wasn't

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
with these changes I still wasn't

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.850 
with these changes I still wasn't
exactly<00:01:07.220> impressed<00:01:07.700> by<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.300> DMS<00:01:08.960> or<00:01:09.260> more

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
exactly impressed by the DMS or more

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.490 
exactly impressed by the DMS or more
specifically<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.550> SKS<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:11.659> think<00:01:12.050> one<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
specifically the SKS I think one of the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.570 
specifically the SKS I think one of the
strongest<00:01:13.100> DMR's<00:01:13.760> is<00:01:14.150> currently<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.750> SKS

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
strongest DMR's is currently the SKS

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.180 
strongest DMR's is currently the SKS
mainly<00:01:16.580> due<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.150> its<00:01:17.360> fastest<00:01:17.990> firing<00:01:18.380> rate<00:01:18.799> of

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
mainly due to its fastest firing rate of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.910 
mainly due to its fastest firing rate of
all<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.520> demos<00:01:19.909> which<00:01:20.690> i<00:01:20.870> think<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.260> really

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
all the demos which i think is really

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.030 
all the demos which i think is really
needed<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.330> SKS<00:01:23.690> also<00:01:24.050> has<00:01:24.170> really<00:01:24.590> good

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
needed and the SKS also has really good

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.280 
needed and the SKS also has really good
manageable<00:01:25.730> recoil<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.750> let's<00:01:26.930> get<00:01:27.110> some

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
manageable recoil so let's get some

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.390 
manageable recoil so let's get some
stats<00:01:27.740> out<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.160> way<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.730> SKS<00:01:29.510> fire<00:01:29.840> rate<00:01:30.200> is

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
stats out the way the SKS fire rate is

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.240 
stats out the way the SKS fire rate is
330<00:01:31.400> rpm<00:01:32.060> which<00:01:32.840> comes<00:01:33.140> out<00:01:33.320> in<00:01:33.620> first<00:01:33.980> place

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
330 rpm which comes out in first place

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.290 
330 rpm which comes out in first place
most<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.510> them<00:01:35.660> are<00:01:35.930> actually<00:01:36.560> only<00:01:36.800> 260<00:01:37.790> rpm

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
most of them are actually only 260 rpm

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.990 
most of them are actually only 260 rpm
one<00:01:38.810> downside<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.650> SKS<00:01:40.160> it<00:01:40.400> has<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> lower

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
one downside to the SKS it has a lower

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.080 
one downside to the SKS it has a lower
damage<00:01:41.750> mold<00:01:42.200> than<00:01:42.500> most<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.100> other<00:01:43.280> demos

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
damage mold than most of the other demos

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.020 
damage mold than most of the other demos
I<00:01:44.420> remember<00:01:45.170> it's<00:01:45.350> still<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.770> 3<00:01:46.250> shot<00:01:46.490> kill<00:01:46.520> 2

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
I remember it's still a 3 shot kill 2

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.460 
I remember it's still a 3 shot kill 2
shot<00:01:47.240> killer<00:01:47.510> to<00:01:47.630> get<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> headshot<00:01:48.290> it's

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
shot killer to get a headshot it's

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.070 
shot killer to get a headshot it's
close-range<00:01:48.890> damage<00:01:49.370> is<00:01:49.550> 43<00:01:50.330> while<00:01:50.570> most<00:01:50.900> of

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
close-range damage is 43 while most of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.440 
close-range damage is 43 while most of
the<00:01:51.230> other<00:01:51.260> DMR's<00:01:51.890> are<00:01:52.100> at<00:01:52.190> 45<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:53.120> damage

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
the other DMR's are at 45 the damage

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.350 
the other DMR's are at 45 the damage
drop<00:01:53.720> ends<00:01:54.110> at<00:01:54.230> 60<00:01:54.710> meters<00:01:54.920> at<00:01:55.340> 34<00:01:56.030> bullet

drop ends at 60 meters at 34 bullet
damage<00:01:56.660> another<00:01:57.140> thing<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.530> guys<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:58.070> medium

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
damage another thing is guys at medium

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.610 
damage another thing is guys at medium
and<00:01:58.670> longer<00:01:58.970> ranges<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.540> 3<00:01:59.780> shot<00:02:00.020> kill<00:02:00.050> is

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
and longer ranges the 3 shot kill is

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.160 
and longer ranges the 3 shot kill is
only<00:02:00.980> for<00:02:01.280> targets<00:02:01.760> who<00:02:02.180> aren't<00:02:02.540> wearing<00:02:02.870> body

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
only for targets who aren't wearing body

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.460 
only for targets who aren't wearing body
armor<00:02:03.530> that's<00:02:03.920> one<00:02:04.100> downside<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:05.000> SKS<00:02:05.570> at

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
armor that's one downside to the SKS at

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.109 
armor that's one downside to the SKS at
close<00:02:06.800> range<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.250> can<00:02:07.430> still<00:02:07.640> three<00:02:07.850> shot

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
close range you can still three shot

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.770 
close range you can still three shot
someone

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
someone

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.150 
someone
even<00:02:09.110> if<00:02:09.200> they're<00:02:09.319> wearing<00:02:09.440> body<00:02:09.679> armor<00:02:10.009> but

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
even if they're wearing body armor but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.190 
even if they're wearing body armor but
if<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.340> facing<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.789> target<00:02:11.239> unfortunately

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
if you facing a target unfortunately

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.350 
if you facing a target unfortunately
does<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.950> body<00:02:13.160> armor<00:02:13.459> perk<00:02:13.730> at<00:02:14.000> longer

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
does have the body armor perk at longer

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.720 
does have the body armor perk at longer
ranges<00:02:14.870> you'll<00:02:15.200> need<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.560> do<00:02:15.709> four<00:02:16.099> body<00:02:16.430> shots

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
ranges you'll need to do four body shots

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240 
ranges you'll need to do four body shots
or<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.480> headshot<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.230> two<00:02:18.500> body<00:02:18.769> shots

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250

now<00:02:19.400> other<00:02:19.700> DMR's<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> higher<00:02:21.080> damage

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
now other DMR's I have a higher damage

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.339 
now other DMR's I have a higher damage
model<00:02:22.040> don't<00:02:22.640> have<00:02:22.909> this<00:02:23.120> problem<00:02:23.420> they<00:02:24.200> are

someone<00:02:27.650> wearing<00:02:27.950> body<00:02:28.130> armor<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:28.850> if<00:02:28.940> you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
someone wearing body armor so if you

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.820 
someone wearing body armor so if you
want<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.420> actually<00:02:29.600> use<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.960> DMR<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.530> might

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
want to actually use a DMR you might

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.650 
want to actually use a DMR you might
want<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.100> consider<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.670> fact

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
want to consider this fact

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.040 
want to consider this fact
you<00:02:32.840> might<00:02:33.050> go<00:02:33.290> for<00:02:33.530> an<00:02:33.650> ace<00:02:33.830> 53<00:02:34.550> SP<00:02:35.000> which<00:02:35.300> is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
you might go for an ace 53 SP which is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.080 
you might go for an ace 53 SP which is
what<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.470> recommend<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.490> want<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.880> higher

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
what I recommend if you want that higher

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.390 
what I recommend if you want that higher
damage<00:02:38.500> however<00:02:39.500> please<00:02:39.980> know<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
damage however please know that the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.060 
damage however please know that the
higher<00:02:40.610> damage<00:02:40.970> DMR's<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.020> lot<00:02:42.680> slower

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
higher damage DMR's have a lot slower

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.550

bullet spread increase ahead of all the
DMR's<00:02:48.230> at<00:02:49.210> 0.18<00:02:50.210> which<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.140> really<00:02:51.650> handy<00:02:52.010> to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
DMR's at 0.18 which is really handy to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.060 
DMR's at 0.18 which is really handy to
have<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.820> also<00:02:53.000> has<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.630> lowest<00:02:54.070> upward

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
have it also has the lowest upward

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.220 
have it also has the lowest upward
recoil<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:56.050> 0.35<00:02:57.310> while<00:02:58.310> left<00:02:58.610> recoil<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.360> 0.3

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
recoil of 0.35 while left recoil is 0.3

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.540 
recoil of 0.35 while left recoil is 0.3
and<00:03:00.410> right<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:01.210> 0.4<00:03:02.210> so<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.550> reasonably

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
and right is 0.4 so it's a reasonably

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.360 
and right is 0.4 so it's a reasonably
easy<00:03:04.580> weapon<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.480> control<00:03:05.720> it's<00:03:06.620> not<00:03:06.950> that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
easy weapon to control it's not that

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.830 
easy weapon to control it's not that
hard<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.940> don't<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.300> really<00:03:08.510> worry

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
hard so you don't have to really worry

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.230 
hard so you don't have to really worry
about<00:03:08.930> countering<00:03:09.860> too<00:03:10.130> much<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.880> weapons

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
about countering too much of the weapons

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.360 
about countering too much of the weapons
recoil<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.930> has<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.080> first<00:03:12.380> shot<00:03:12.560> multiplier<00:03:12.740> of

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.670 
recoil it has a first shot multiplier of
2<00:03:13.760> which<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.570> pretty<00:03:14.750> much<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.110> same<00:03:15.320> as<00:03:15.560> all

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
2 which is pretty much the same as all

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.460 
2 which is pretty much the same as all
the<00:03:15.800> DMR's<00:03:16.250> however<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.270> has<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.750> slowest

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
the DMR's however it has the slowest

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.180 
the DMR's however it has the slowest
muzzle<00:03:19.190> velocity<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:20.140> 440<00:03:21.140> meters<00:03:21.320> per<00:03:21.740> second

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
muzzle velocity of 440 meters per second

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.730 
muzzle velocity of 440 meters per second
which<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.610> rather<00:03:23.450> slow<00:03:24.190> while<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.720> qbu-88

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
which is rather slow while the qbu-88

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.500 
which is rather slow while the qbu-88
DMA<00:03:27.740> has<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.040> fastest<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:29.740> 600<00:03:30.740> m/s<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.420> is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
DMA has a fastest of 600 m/s so this is

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.970 
DMA has a fastest of 600 m/s so this is
one<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.690> those<00:03:32.810> weapons<00:03:33.020> where<00:03:33.410> if<00:03:33.740> you're<00:03:33.890> at

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
one of those weapons where if you're at

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.140 
one of those weapons where if you're at
longer<00:03:34.250> ranges<00:03:34.670> you're<00:03:34.790> gonna<00:03:34.880> have<00:03:35.030> to

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
longer ranges you're gonna have to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.140 
longer ranges you're gonna have to
really<00:03:35.420> aim<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.080> find<00:03:36.830> your<00:03:37.040> tire<00:03:37.280> quite<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> bit

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
really aim to find your tire quite a bit

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.300 
really aim to find your tire quite a bit
because<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.690> travel<00:03:39.260> time<00:03:39.470> for<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.800> board<00:03:40.040> is

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
because the travel time for the board is

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.330 
because the travel time for the board is
going<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.700> be<00:03:40.790> rather<00:03:41.150> slow<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:42.230> SKS<00:03:42.770> has<00:03:43.070> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
reload speed of 2.3 seconds a good

factor<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.900> SKS<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:55.340> carries<00:03:55.700> 21

rounds<00:03:56.330> in<00:03:56.720> its<00:03:56.930> clip<00:03:57.410> which<00:03:57.620> is<00:03:57.650> fairly

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
rounds in its clip which is fairly

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.850 
rounds in its clip which is fairly
decent<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:58.790> what<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.360> would<00:03:59.630> expect<00:03:59.750> I<00:04:00.410> really

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
decent and what I would expect I really

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.710 
decent and what I would expect I really
wouldn't<00:04:01.130> want<00:04:01.310> anything<00:04:01.700> lower<00:04:02.239> than<00:04:02.540> that

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
wouldn't want anything lower than that

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.050 
wouldn't want anything lower than that
so<00:04:03.260> now<00:04:03.410> with<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.709> stats<00:04:03.980> out<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.370> way<00:04:04.520> I<00:04:04.790> was

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
so now with the stats out the way I was

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.440 
so now with the stats out the way I was
pretty<00:04:05.600> excited<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:06.200> use<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.500> DMR's<00:04:07.100> again<00:04:07.450> the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
pretty excited to use a DMR's again the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.180 
pretty excited to use a DMR's again the
improvements<00:04:09.050> are<00:04:09.170> definitely<00:04:09.620> better<00:04:09.890> but<00:04:10.160> I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
improvements are definitely better but I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.250 
improvements are definitely better but I
still<00:04:10.459> feel<00:04:10.760> like<00:04:11.000> they're<00:04:11.330> they<00:04:11.780> need<00:04:12.020> some

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
still feel like they're they need some

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.080 
still feel like they're they need some
more<00:04:12.290> love<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:12.950> would<00:04:13.580> like<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.880> see<00:04:14.060> a

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
more love I would like to see a

the<00:04:31.400> reason<00:04:31.730> why<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.850> suggest<00:04:32.390> this<00:04:32.720> damage

really struggle with close-range fights
I<00:04:37.669> found<00:04:38.510> myself<00:04:38.690> just<00:04:38.960> managing<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.770> kill

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
I found myself just managing to kill

but<00:04:43.760> anything<00:04:44.479> faster<00:04:44.900> than<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.410> really

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
but anything faster than that you really

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.530 
but anything faster than that you really
going<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.520> struggle<00:04:46.850> with<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.330> you're<00:04:47.420> just

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540

gonna be straight at beating however if

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.600 
gonna be straight at beating however if
you<00:04:50.090> do<00:04:50.210> manage<00:04:50.420> to<00:04:50.840> get<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.140> headshot<00:04:51.650> then<00:04:52.340> you

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
you do manage to get a headshot then you

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.370 
you do manage to get a headshot then you
can<00:04:52.790> potentially<00:04:53.270> win<00:04:53.660> most<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.290> the

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
medium to long ranges that's where I

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.010 
medium to long ranges that's where I
felt<00:04:57.980> really<00:04:58.190> strong<00:04:58.550> using<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.240> SKS<00:04:59.750> I

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
felt really strong using the SKS I

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.010 
felt really strong using the SKS I
didn't<00:05:00.620> at<00:05:00.770> all<00:05:00.980> feel<00:05:01.760> overpowered<00:05:02.210> but<00:05:02.780> I

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
didn't at all feel overpowered but I

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.540 
didn't at all feel overpowered but I
feel<00:05:03.410> like<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.620> demos<00:05:03.950> are<00:05:04.100> really<00:05:04.400> well

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
feel like the demos are really well

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.240 
feel like the demos are really well
suited<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> further<00:05:05.540> distances<00:05:06.200> and<00:05:06.470> what

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
suited to the further distances and what

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.880 
suited to the further distances and what
I<00:05:07.280> really<00:05:07.970> enjoyed<00:05:08.360> was<00:05:08.390> counter<00:05:09.170> sniping<00:05:09.710> all

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
I really enjoyed was counter sniping all

it<00:05:44.600> but<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:45.500> had<00:05:46.100> so<00:05:46.310> many<00:05:46.370> cons<00:05:46.880> raging<00:05:47.480> me<00:05:47.570> and

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
it but I had so many cons raging me and

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.450 
it but I had so many cons raging me and
I<00:05:47.900> really<00:05:48.290> wish<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:48.680> had<00:05:48.890> have<00:05:49.010> actually

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
I really wish I had have actually

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.130 
I really wish I had have actually
recorded<00:05:49.940> some<00:05:50.120> of<00:05:50.240> it<00:05:50.360> and<00:05:50.570> I<00:05:50.660> would<00:05:50.930> have

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
recorded some of it and I would have

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.690 
recorded some of it and I would have
included<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.890> in<00:05:52.070> this<00:05:52.160> video<00:05:52.370> but

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
included it in this video but

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.000 
included it in this video but
unfortunately<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.540> didn't<00:05:54.260> in<00:05:54.500> saying<00:05:54.800> that

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
unfortunately I didn't in saying that

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.000 
unfortunately I didn't in saying that
though<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:56.150> time<00:05:56.390> I<00:05:56.420> played<00:05:56.810> with<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:57.170> SKS<00:05:57.740> I

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
though the time I played with the SKS I

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.340 
though the time I played with the SKS I
thought<00:05:58.550> to<00:05:58.700> myself<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:59.180> couldn't<00:05:59.450> easily<00:05:59.750> just

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
thought to myself I couldn't easily just

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.800 
thought to myself I couldn't easily just
done<00:06:00.590> that<00:06:00.830> with<00:06:01.130> an<00:06:01.280> assault<00:06:01.580> rifle<00:06:01.750> and<00:06:02.750> I

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
done that with an assault rifle and I

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.690 
done that with an assault rifle and I
think<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.530> only<00:06:03.680> place<00:06:03.890> two<00:06:04.160> emails<00:06:04.490> I'm

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
think the only place two emails I'm

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.540 
think the only place two emails I'm
really<00:06:05.240> shine<00:06:05.540> to<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.320> point<00:06:06.680> where<00:06:07.310> you

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
really shine to a point where you

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.610 
really shine to a point where you
actually<00:06:07.760> might<00:06:08.240> consider<00:06:08.630> a<00:06:08.750> DMR<00:06:09.230> over

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
actually might consider a DMR over

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.740 
actually might consider a DMR over
anything<00:06:10.070> else<00:06:10.250> is<00:06:10.640> when<00:06:10.970> you<00:06:11.420> have<00:06:11.630> those

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
anything else is when you have those

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.420 
anything else is when you have those
targets<00:06:12.290> that<00:06:12.410> are<00:06:12.530> in<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.740> very<00:06:12.770> tight

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
targets that are in a very tight

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.730 
targets that are in a very tight
concealed<00:06:14.360> positions<00:06:14.990> where<00:06:15.290> you<00:06:15.530> need

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
concealed positions where you need

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.910 
concealed positions where you need
accuracy<00:06:16.460> and<00:06:16.730> those<00:06:17.450> almost<00:06:18.020> sniping<00:06:18.710> light

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
accuracy and those almost sniping light

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.340 
accuracy and those almost sniping light
capabilities<00:06:19.700> I<00:06:19.880> might<00:06:20.450> have<00:06:20.630> a<00:06:20.660> go<00:06:20.930> at<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.140> few

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
capabilities I might have a go at a few

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.290 
capabilities I might have a go at a few
other<00:06:21.500> demos<00:06:22.010> but<00:06:22.220> overall<00:06:22.640> still<00:06:22.700> think<00:06:23.180> they

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
other demos but overall still think they

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.720 
other demos but overall still think they
need<00:06:23.570> a<00:06:23.840> lot<00:06:24.260> of<00:06:24.290> changes<00:06:24.920> just<00:06:25.130> to<00:06:25.310> make<00:06:25.520> them

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
need a lot of changes just to make them

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.060 
need a lot of changes just to make them
a<00:06:25.760> bit<00:06:25.970> more<00:06:26.030> viable<00:06:26.630> as<00:06:26.840> for<00:06:27.350> the<00:06:27.440> attachments

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
a bit more viable as for the attachments

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.160 
a bit more viable as for the attachments
I<00:06:28.220> would<00:06:28.520> say<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:29.090> angled<00:06:29.450> grip<00:06:29.600> and<00:06:29.930> the

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
I would say the angled grip and the

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.170 
I would say the angled grip and the
muzzle<00:06:30.530> break<00:06:30.680> barrel<00:06:31.070> if<00:06:31.520> you<00:06:31.670> want<00:06:31.910> some

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
muzzle break barrel if you want some

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.030 
muzzle break barrel if you want some
