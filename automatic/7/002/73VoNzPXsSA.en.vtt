and to be honest with you it looks like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.440 
and to be honest with you it looks like
how<00:01:25.350> crisis<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.310> when<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> originally<00:01:26.880> played

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
how crisis was when I originally played

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.499 
how crisis was when I originally played
it<00:01:27.600> back<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.050> 2007<00:01:28.860> back<00:01:29.550> then<00:01:29.789> I<00:01:29.820> still<00:01:30.360> had

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it back in 2007 back then I still had

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.139 
it back in 2007 back then I still had
Windows<00:01:30.840> XP<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.649> was<00:01:31.800> running<00:01:32.100> an<00:01:32.250> 8800<00:01:33.119> GT

Windows XP and I was running an 8800 GT
graphics<00:01:33.960> card<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.740> game<00:01:34.920> definitely<00:01:35.070> feels

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
graphics card the game definitely feels

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
graphics card the game definitely feels
like<00:01:35.550> it's<00:01:35.789> running<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.180> DirectX<00:01:36.720> 9<00:01:36.930> mode<00:01:37.259> with

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
like it's running in DirectX 9 mode with

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
like it's running in DirectX 9 mode with
a<00:01:37.890> mix<00:01:38.220> between<00:01:38.369> high<00:01:38.820> detail<00:01:39.210> levels<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a mix between high detail levels and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.499 
a mix between high detail levels and
medium<00:01:40.259> detail<00:01:40.619> levels<00:01:41.030> overall<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.300> not

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
medium detail levels overall that's not

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.419 
medium detail levels overall that's not
bad<00:01:42.810> especially<00:01:43.289> considering<00:01:44.069> the<00:01:44.160> framerate

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
bad especially considering the framerate

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.190 
bad especially considering the framerate
throughout<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.119> vast<00:01:45.390> majority<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> game

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
throughout the vast majority of the game

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.770 
throughout the vast majority of the game
is<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.830> good<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.369> solid<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.119> 30<00:01:48.390> frames<00:01:48.690> per

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
is very good and solid at 30 frames per

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.930 
is very good and solid at 30 frames per
second<00:01:49.349> later<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.520> game<00:01:50.550> the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
second later on in the game the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.880 
second later on in the game the
framerate<00:01:51.209> does<00:01:51.599> drop<00:01:51.929> during<00:01:52.349> intense

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
framerate does drop during intense

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.880 
framerate does drop during intense
sequences<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:54.630> probably<00:01:55.080> about<00:01:55.229> 20<00:01:55.649> frames

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
sequences to probably about 20 frames

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.680 
sequences to probably about 20 frames
per<00:01:56.160> second<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:56.910> does<00:01:57.090> add<00:01:57.270> almost<00:01:57.539> a

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
per second but it does add almost a

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.080 
per second but it does add almost a
cinematic<00:01:58.289> feel<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> game<00:01:59.069> at<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> point

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
cinematic feel to the game at that point

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
cinematic feel to the game at that point
so<00:02:00.599> to<00:02:00.660> be<00:02:01.080> honest<00:02:01.319> with<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.709> actually

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
so to be honest with you it actually

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.190 
so to be honest with you it actually
enhanced<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> gameplay<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.390> didn't<00:02:03.990> hinder

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
enhanced the gameplay and didn't hinder

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.859 
enhanced the gameplay and didn't hinder
it<00:02:04.470> at<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:04.819> during<00:02:05.819> huge<00:02:06.240> battles<00:02:06.599> throughout

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it at all during huge battles throughout

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.889 
it at all during huge battles throughout
the<00:02:07.020> rest<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.470> game<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.340> solid<00:02:08.940> at<00:02:09.090> 30<00:02:09.420> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the rest of the game it's solid at 30 so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.990 
the rest of the game it's solid at 30 so
don't<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.950> gonna<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.280> laggy<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
don't think that it's gonna be laggy and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.240 
don't think that it's gonna be laggy and
if<00:02:12.090> anybody<00:02:12.480> says<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.709> not<00:02:13.950> this

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
if anybody says that it is it's not this

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
if anybody says that it is it's not this
is<00:02:14.459> one<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.819> most<00:02:14.970> solid<00:02:15.510> frame<00:02:15.840> rated

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
is one of the most solid frame rated

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.150 
is one of the most solid frame rated
games<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.739> I've<00:02:16.860> played<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.520> console<00:02:18.180> ever

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
games that I've played on a console ever

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760 
games that I've played on a console ever
so<00:02:20.160> back<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.610> graphics<00:02:21.000> quality

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
so back to the graphics quality

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.530 
so back to the graphics quality
obviously<00:02:22.770> they<00:02:23.010> upgraded<00:02:23.970> from<00:02:24.090> using<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
obviously they upgraded from using the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.050 
obviously they upgraded from using the
CryEngine<00:02:24.810> 2<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> original<00:02:26.069> Crysis<00:02:26.520> to
