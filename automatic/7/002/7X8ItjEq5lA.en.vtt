environment<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.159> there's<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.950> solution

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
environment now there's the solution

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.409 
environment now there's the solution
here<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.939> this<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.389> foldable<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:11.209> there<00:03:12.209> are

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
here and this is foldable so there are

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.009 
here and this is foldable so there are
multiple<00:03:12.599> bytes<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:13.799> rest<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:15.019> so

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
multiple bytes to just rest this so

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.770 
multiple bytes to just rest this so
let's<00:03:16.409> go<00:03:16.639> all<00:03:17.639> right<00:03:17.700> let's<00:03:17.790> look<00:03:18.269> at<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.510> XS
