00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.449 
probably shouldn't have done it there
but<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:34.140> kind<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.409> testing<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:34.950> waters<00:02:35.310> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
but I was kind of testing the waters to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.710 
but I was kind of testing the waters to
see<00:02:35.489> if<00:02:35.609> he<00:02:35.760> was<00:02:35.879> going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> do<00:02:36.209> hopping<00:02:36.629> around

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
see if he was going to do hopping around

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.199 
see if he was going to do hopping around
on<00:02:37.140> me<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.349> my<00:02:37.470> head<00:02:37.680> what<00:02:38.489> she<00:02:38.640> did<00:02:38.879> kind<00:02:39.090> of

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
on me on my head what she did kind of

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.920 
on me on my head what she did kind of
that<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.260> end<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.590> second<00:02:41.310> round<00:02:41.900> one<00:02:42.900> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
that the end of that second round one of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.809 
that the end of that second round one of
the<00:02:43.109> things<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.500> also<00:02:43.739> had<00:02:44.519> kind<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
the things that I also had kind of

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.119 
the things that I also had kind of
figured<00:02:45.150> out<00:02:45.450> after<00:02:46.200> watching<00:02:46.379> some<00:02:46.709> video<00:02:46.829> on

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
figured out after watching some video on

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.789 
figured out after watching some video on
Ani<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.639> that<00:02:47.879> his<00:02:48.030> squid<00:02:48.269> /<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.840> pretty<00:02:49.620> good<00:02:49.769> I

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
Ani is that his squid / is pretty good I

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:50.869 
Ani is that his squid / is pretty good I
think<00:02:49.889> it's<00:02:50.099> what<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.370> called<00:02:50.549> i<00:02:50.609> know<00:02:50.700> it's

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
think it's what it's called i know it's

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.599 
think it's what it's called i know it's
just<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> slash<00:02:51.389> attack<00:02:51.889> and<00:02:52.889> it's<00:02:53.250> really

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
just a slash attack and it's really

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.930 
just a slash attack and it's really
short<00:02:53.849> in<00:02:53.970> space<00:02:54.299> for<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.500> lite<00:02:56.340> version<00:02:56.370> of

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
short in space for the lite version of

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.599 
short in space for the lite version of
it<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.500> there<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:58.709> there<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.400> then

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
it and there it is right there and then

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.849 
it and there it is right there and then
the<00:02:59.790> heavy<00:03:00.090> does<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.480> cross<00:03:00.659> up<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.680> well

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
the heavy does it cross up and as well

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.740 
the heavy does it cross up and as well
as<00:03:01.889> the<00:03:02.099> e<00:03:02.129> x<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:02.970> goes<00:03:03.120> through<00:03:03.359> them<00:03:03.540> if

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
as the e x so it goes through them if

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.940 
as the e x so it goes through them if
they're<00:03:03.900> blocking<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.319> wrong<00:03:04.470> side<00:03:04.739> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
they're blocking the wrong side it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.190 
they're blocking the wrong side it
catches<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.519> kind<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.760> gimmicky<00:03:06.200> catches

issue that i have where i want to attack
I<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.750> if<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:56.419> you<00:03:57.419> know<00:03:57.449> attack<00:03:57.840> maybe<00:03:58.049> I

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
of street fighter is you know I take it

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.340 
of street fighter is you know I take it
with<00:04:33.670> a<00:04:33.700> grain<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.970> salt<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.450> I<00:04:34.510> think<00:04:34.780> that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
with a grain of salt and I think that

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.680 
with a grain of salt and I think that
and<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.950> lot<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.160> games<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.520> see<00:04:36.580> people<00:04:36.880> want

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
and a lot of games you see people want

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.510 
and a lot of games you see people want
that<00:04:37.840> instant<00:04:38.230> gratification<00:04:38.430> instead<00:04:39.430> of

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
that instant gratification instead of

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.580 
that instant gratification instead of
working<00:04:39.790> for<00:04:40.090> wins<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.690> my<00:04:40.930> mindset<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.350> just

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
working for wins and my mindset is just

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.590 
working for wins and my mindset is just
completely<00:04:41.740> different<00:04:42.370> when<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.330> comes<00:04:43.360> to

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
completely different when it comes to

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.480 
completely different when it comes to
that<00:04:43.720> so<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:43.900> think<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.800> should<00:04:45.010> see<00:04:45.310> some

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
that so I think that I should see some

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.970 
that so I think that I should see some
pretty<00:04:45.640> rapid<00:04:46.090> improvement<00:04:46.690> with<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.740> type

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
pretty rapid improvement with that type

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.310 
pretty rapid improvement with that type
of<00:04:48.010> mindset<00:04:48.310> this<00:04:48.580> guy<00:04:48.700> wins<00:04:49.090> but<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.080> just
