top rivals was even more amazing and we

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.860 
top rivals was even more amazing and we
finished<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.430> almost<00:03:03.300> 2am

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.410 

you<00:03:06.830> know<00:03:06.950> when<00:03:07.129> he<00:03:07.250> plays<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.790> big<00:03:07.940> matches

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
you know when he plays in a big matches

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.300 
you know when he plays in a big matches
he<00:03:08.629> is<00:03:08.750> he<00:03:09.080> has<00:03:09.200> no<00:03:09.349> fear<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.680> know<00:03:09.980> he<00:03:10.069> comes

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
he is he has no fear you know he comes

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.250 
he is he has no fear you know he comes
in<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.790> he<00:03:10.849> knows<00:03:11.269> what<00:03:11.510> his<00:03:11.659> mission<00:03:11.870> isn't

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
in and he knows what his mission isn't

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.289 
in and he knows what his mission isn't
that<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.830> win<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.129> match<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.790> believe

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
that is to win the match so I believe

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.860 
that is to win the match so I believe
that<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.810> right<00:03:15.140> mindset<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.400> if<00:03:16.610> he's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
that is the right mindset so if he's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.380 
that is the right mindset so if he's
confident<00:03:17.870> maybe<00:03:18.620> at<00:03:18.890> his<00:03:19.099> age<00:03:19.310> right<00:03:19.760> now<00:03:19.790> you

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
confident maybe at his age right now you

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.589 
confident maybe at his age right now you
can<00:03:20.569> sound<00:03:20.930> maybe<00:03:21.200> too<00:03:21.590> overconfident<00:03:22.159> but<00:03:22.670> I

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
can sound maybe too overconfident but I

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.720 
can sound maybe too overconfident but I
think<00:03:24.170> he<00:03:24.409> still<00:03:24.620> has<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:25.010> keep<00:03:25.159> that<00:03:25.370> kind<00:03:25.610> of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
think he still has to keep that kind of

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.880 
think he still has to keep that kind of
mentality<00:03:25.879> you<00:03:26.299> know<00:03:26.420> any

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.010 

he's<00:03:29.890> got<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.220> experience<00:03:30.490> he<00:03:30.910> was<00:03:31.060> top<00:03:31.690> 20

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
he's got the experience he was top 20

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.080 
he's got the experience he was top 20
player<00:03:32.260> before<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:33.100> he<00:03:33.280> knows<00:03:33.460> what<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.060> feels

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
player before so he knows what it feels

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.510 
player before so he knows what it feels
like<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.480> play<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.930> big<00:03:35.110> stage<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.680> I'm<00:03:35.830> sure

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
like to play in a big stage so I'm sure

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.380 

technology<00:03:42.079> what's<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> going<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.890> do<00:03:42.980> for<00:03:43.010> you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
technology what's it going to do for you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.789 
technology what's it going to do for you
well<00:03:44.390> it's<00:03:44.480> great<00:03:44.659> i<00:03:44.689> mean<00:03:44.810> graphene<00:03:45.319> is<00:03:45.349> the

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
well it's great i mean graphene is the

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.100 
well it's great i mean graphene is the
is<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.390> lightest<00:03:47.390> in<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.689> strongest

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
is the lightest in the strongest

material<00:03:48.680> in<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.280> world<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.819> believe<00:03:50.420> had

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
material in the world so I believe had

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.110 
material in the world so I believe had
has<00:03:50.840> done<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:51.079> terrific<00:03:51.560> job<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.129> coming<00:03:52.879> up

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
has done a terrific job in coming up

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.170 
has done a terrific job in coming up
with<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.510> with<00:03:53.750> material<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:55.090> going<00:03:56.090> to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
with the with material that is going to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.179 
with the with material that is going to
give<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.569> lighter<00:03:56.959> field<00:03:57.439> but<00:03:57.709> also<00:03:57.829> going

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
give you a lighter field but also going

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.309 
give you a lighter field but also going
to<00:03:58.250> give<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.549> an<00:03:58.700> extra<00:03:58.939> speed<00:03:59.329> so<00:03:59.989> I<00:04:00.019> feel

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
to give you an extra speed so I feel

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.300 
to give you an extra speed so I feel
very<00:04:00.470> comfortable<00:04:00.709> with<00:04:01.099> it<00:04:01.340> I've<00:04:02.120> tested<00:04:02.689> it

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
very comfortable with it I've tested it

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.250 
very comfortable with it I've tested it
several<00:04:04.310> times<00:04:04.579> before<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.810> start<00:04:06.109> of<00:04:06.200> the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
several times before the start of the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.920 
several times before the start of the
new<00:04:06.950> season<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.609> really<00:04:08.239> looking<00:04:08.569> forward<00:04:08.870> to

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
new season and really looking forward to

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
play with it I believe that is going to
