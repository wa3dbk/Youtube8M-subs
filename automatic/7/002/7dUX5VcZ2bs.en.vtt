 Asia as you can see, weather is 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.290
 unfortunately not much better 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.189
 in contrast , it is even here 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.770
 come down a bit rain 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.360
 otherwise you have to say that the five 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.820
 units in the last now 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.660
 one and a half days already good in the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.879
 bones have a good reaction 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.250
 many gameplay had four runs in it 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.780

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.480
 yesterday and so it should be we are here 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.920

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.679
 and since we go on here tomorrow 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.570

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.909
 little bit showing where we are here so 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.520
 Incidentally, have stopped last night 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.510
 still growing from ours 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.640
 sponsors or some of the sponsors 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:24.410
 so are now a large number 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.560
 here we go times to errors 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.560
 purely 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.080
 so 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.990
 So here it is in the entrance area 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.939
 you see mixed people and people 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.200
 just come to the spa area as 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.650
 also some sponsors just from 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.350
 Sponsors play here 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:53.509
 bushel our head of the whole journey 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.049
 very big so if we are here now 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.860
 Once the prÃ¤si waving once if we 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.860
 Let's go further 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.119
 Here a little area to the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.610
 hang out there because I do not 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:14.500
 what is there just a high 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:18.980
 hopes to be there in the middle of it all 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.450
 Election tables for the boys for some 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.900
 here on the right also a few yourself and 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.410
 We also have a few crowns 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.500
 special cases very much 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.840
 cosmetics and their optics so place who 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.489
 Buck has what we have internet there 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.230
 not so important on the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.299
 Room if we are here now 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.100
 go on 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:46.370
 We come to our dining caution 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:51.170
 here buffet restaurant whole units 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.579
 that's right and eat here 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.579
 but also a chill area 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.170
 if you go through here now, there is 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.450
 a large spa area with a with 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.810
 a hotel-owned power room here 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.239
 once you look around here like that 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.480
 rooms also angle some of them again 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.250
 our sponsors are both at krone 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.310
 in the yard 4 1 as well as to the outside 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.049
 So you see, we actually miss that 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.880
 at first glance do not and if we 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.570
 the program is pretty much the last 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.730
 have made days or 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.780
 then the last units have done 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.829
 I am optimistic that we are here 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.660
 very successful training camp 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.489
 deny and so fit it is just after 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.319
 Bochum come back the boys are 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.010
 Now on top of the rooms a bit 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.180
 mittagsruhe 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.040
 Immediately continue I already have 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.370
 seen force cas is announced so 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.989
 again and I purely padded 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.129
 and look forward to it, I said then 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.129
