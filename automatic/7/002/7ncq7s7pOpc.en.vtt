00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.040

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.920
 just sit by 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.640
 and yes so if you don't like this you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.100

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.080
 got here that I can come up and yes now 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.519
 first i am recording this video with 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.019
 a new camera from me so I hope 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.260
 really that you see difference as it 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.910
 is not then I feel tonight no 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.899
 moneyball i am recording too 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.969
 new camera this is a know ios 700d 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.340
 and as a dslr camera in spain side 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.960
 a webcam and only one webcam ended 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.430
 broke for a week and maybe you have 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 got it or I have the last 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 days not uploaded and then comes 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.950
 my webcam simply broke 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.260
 and it was coming I knew 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.820
 actually it was going to happen but yes 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 I didn't really know what to do because 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.370
 my webcam started very much the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.039
 craft plate star 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.719
 and when was it Wednesday or so then 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.309
 also walked you very very fixed day and watched 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.519
 this is the straw I can do for nothing 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.900
 do more so bought second room and roll 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.280
 special search for such a school 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.470
 different cameras 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 what the box should you buy and then i came 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.729
 so turn on where you are at this or here 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.560
 I have seen full of this thing and it did 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.670
 I sold that is where you name and look 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.780
 to be 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.189
 now it is possible that you think van der 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.369
 so what's the fuck with the bill bill 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.229
 the bad and blurry and I know a lot 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.549
 Well the cables just got in. She has to 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.040
 anyway see how it all 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.570
 works precisely and ideal settings bla 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.790
 bla bla far the rest i have one here 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.439
 a real boulder country stand beside me 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.390
 is anyway the picture looks a bit 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.400
 strange in terms of colors and that becomes 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.920
 all fixed because in the coming weeks 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 I am going to buy new lamps anyway and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.189
 probably a bluescreen that I 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.079
 Here drop behind 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.090
 well that is already an idea for that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.710
 abandoned and not whole 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 that's how fine the future two weeks three 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.939
 weeks or so and then we go to that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.810
 , and I was as blue split 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.030
 i don't know who this know it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.100
 most people think your blood green 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.030
 screen and blue screen is a principle 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 even a green screen 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.689
 only I first find green color 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.819
 and is also simply blue 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.450
 in my eyes , your work became easier 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.430
 you can use that certain 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.590
 things for your video editing 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.450
 Program stan not really win but 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.530
 it may also be that you have an edge around you 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.940
 then go see if you happen to have green 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.769
 very much like a blue mine 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.670
 of course also less and that is one 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.290
 of the reasons 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.269
 and anyway in my set-up I don't want to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.739
 always use a bluescreen so if 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.819
 you then a green screen you may 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.040
 I think plans are ugly 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.900
 so that will come anyway I know now 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.069
 otherwise like this not to africa but 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.630
 you might wonder what 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.250
 first use to record 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.379
 I have two webcams are located at the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.519
 I have in the past of my 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.040
 youtube channel used 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.980
 sounds so long rows past but me 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.239
 started with this thingy and this is 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.049
 i do n't know who focus because this is 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.049
 one to logitech 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.880
 in doubt c2 70 was my this is 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.250
 logitech g27 female is 720 p webcam 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.510
 he was at that time I got him right in the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.680
 tested for a week and I thought this one was still 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.180
 it turned out that this thing was in the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.069
 klote is so j 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.750
 for that webcam live at the marquee times 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.610
 sometimes to the webcam and then me 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.110
 switch to this webcam and this one 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.819
 I really use extreme for youtubers 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.579
 I think the shortest 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:25.299
 things under youtuber and this is one and 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:27.549
 c9 2022 921 is just logitech c920 it 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.079
 is a 1080p web yes fine thing but 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.540
 it was flickered in front of my glasses 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.480
 heaven from behind my monitor marble 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.970
 a small and therefore has well cures 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.920
 so yes well then we will upgrade that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.359
 that room that you have just seen so that 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.430
 I have since bought it, I hope so 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.230
 so all goes well 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.489
 the rest also some extras such as one 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.829
 try pots and 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.150
 extra batteries I know a lot about one 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.620
 kind of reval 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.510
 something you also important for this 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.069
 video and I just have it here 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.569
 be open why I don't look at it 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.150
 right as they easily get an overview 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.410
 of all I want to tell, only one 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.900
 thing I want to tell you 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.420
 that is something we also the last months me 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.250
 a lot happened on my channel and that is 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.620
 that the fake accounts are so we are 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.049
 fake accounts that copied my name 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.970
 and then my avatar and pose as 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.549

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.959
 comment on this website 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.419

 about making that do well 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.949
 I think it was just about anything 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.240
 a case has gotten a bit I have 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.800

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.590
 I do n't just want something like cure no 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.889
 cure take dennis k 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.270
 red and white legalism not nice and true 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.110
 I personally like a very nice thing 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.880
 is of 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.590

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.180

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.290
 extra nice that the series voucher then arranges 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.300
 he do it himself 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.570
 so that's awesome but the principle is 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.100
 big that is a day where he just 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.860
 so upload videos or a cure no or 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.620
 just crazy challenge something into it 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.720
 that sense, you will find the name and such 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.690
 i personally like and under chappell 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.979
 pioneers so that you have something original 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.150
 So while more information about think 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.470
 if you have ideas 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.720
 leave below i'm whole 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.130
 curious and I can also right now 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.139
 record videos because that means undressing 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.280
 u the my channel so i hope u have this 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:32.139
 I liked update video on it 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.430
 quality was fine if not even 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.200
 I still need the quality a bit 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.030
 tweaking with those settings 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.610
 so it may be that it is not quite 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.560
 good job 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.789
 yes otherwise i have the room upside down 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.860
 media market is if you are interested 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:47.140
 look at the media market website 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.460
 and there I ordered it so you open 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.960
 see the sparks on a new one 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.169
 so video until then 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.169
