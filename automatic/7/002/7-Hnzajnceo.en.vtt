00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 welcome to my second 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.969
 hit kulig was shopping in the second market 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.799
 and thought I just show you 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.420
 something I bought 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.109
 The very first part I have is the one 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.880
 tart the paper here like a fist 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.420
 I think it should be on the back 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.609
 that from the men's department of primark 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.640
 and a bit bigger in between 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.540
 so it sits nicely and badly 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.520
 it has 13 euros I think that costs 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.399
 Next thing I bought is like that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.710
 a really mega cool cuddly socks 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.110
 they cost four euros and the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.340
 are so soft from the inside when you are there 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.980
 Going in with his foot is like that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.750
 you walk on such clouds 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.629
 every step to the cloud people cloud and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.090
 they look a bit like 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.690

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.400

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.000

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.330
 warm and a bit thicker 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.360
 harmonizes even so small palettes 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.250
 and cost 17 euros 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.500

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.170

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.940
