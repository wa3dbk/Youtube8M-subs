00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
places soon you'll know the progression

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.320

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
but the the chorus starts here on the D

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.810 
but the the chorus starts here on the D
position<00:03:07.780> since<00:03:08.050> it<00:03:08.800> goes<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.400> B<00:03:09.610> minor
