you two tips that I think you're gonna

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.269 
you two tips that I think you're gonna
find<00:00:29.210> really<00:00:29.869> valuable<00:00:30.679> that<00:00:30.920> you'll<00:00:31.039> be<00:00:31.189> able

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
find really valuable that you'll be able

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.330 
find really valuable that you'll be able
to<00:00:31.490> use<00:00:31.699> so<00:00:32.330> the<00:00:32.449> first<00:00:32.780> tip<00:00:33.140> has<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:33.620> do<00:00:34.070> with

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
to use so the first tip has to do with

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.130 
to use so the first tip has to do with
something<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:34.850> simple<00:00:35.090> just<00:00:35.300> drawing<00:00:35.780> an<00:00:35.930> art

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
something so simple just drawing an art

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.840 
something so simple just drawing an art
great<00:00:36.410> I'm<00:00:36.589> just<00:00:36.739> gonna<00:00:36.860> go<00:00:37.309> into<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.699> art

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
great I'm just gonna go into the art

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.610 
great I'm just gonna go into the art
command<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.510> I'm<00:00:39.049> gonna<00:00:39.170> do<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.409> center

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
command and I'm gonna do the center

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.020 
command and I'm gonna do the center
option<00:00:39.860> because<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:40.400> think<00:00:40.489> that's<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.850> best

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
option because I think that's the best

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.200 
option because I think that's the best
way<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.239> show<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:41.839> now<00:00:42.559> as<00:00:42.830> you<00:00:43.339> know<00:00:43.549> through

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
way to show this now as you know through

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.600 
way to show this now as you know through
the<00:00:44.360> years<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.989> art<00:00:45.170> command<00:00:45.559> loves<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.400> draw

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
the years the art command loves to draw

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.719 
the years the art command loves to draw
arcs<00:00:46.970> that<00:00:47.299> are<00:00:47.360> counterclockwise<00:00:48.170> I<00:00:48.710> try<00:00:49.670> to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
arcs that are counterclockwise I try to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.240 
arcs that are counterclockwise I try to
talk<00:00:49.940> clockwise<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:50.720> like<00:00:50.930> oh<00:00:51.140> no<00:00:51.170> it's<00:00:52.040> so

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
talk clockwise it's like oh no it's so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.000 
talk clockwise it's like oh no it's so
not<00:00:52.460> gonna<00:00:52.640> go<00:00:52.940> like<00:00:53.150> that<00:00:53.180> right<00:00:54.010> always

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
not gonna go like that right always

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.869 
not gonna go like that right always
wants<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.309> draw<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.610> counterclockwise<00:00:56.409> so

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
wants to draw it counterclockwise so

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.100 
wants to draw it counterclockwise so
really<00:00:58.879> cool<00:00:59.059> feature<00:00:59.299> that<00:00:59.420> was<00:00:59.690> put<00:00:59.900> in<00:01:00.019> a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
really cool feature that was put in a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.049 
really cool feature that was put in a
couple<00:01:00.409> of<00:01:00.470> releases<00:01:01.010> ago<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.549> ability<00:01:02.030> to

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
couple of releases ago is the ability to

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.969 
couple of releases ago is the ability to
override<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.750> simply<00:01:03.320> by<00:01:03.470> holding<00:01:03.619> down<00:01:03.830> the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
override that simply by holding down the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.730 
override that simply by holding down the
control<00:01:04.580> key<00:01:04.909> AutoCAD<00:01:05.869> will<00:01:05.900> let<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.380> break

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
control key AutoCAD will let you break

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.040 
control key AutoCAD will let you break
that<00:01:07.189> rule<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:07.909> now<00:01:08.150> I<00:01:08.180> can<00:01:08.420> draw<00:01:08.570> an<00:01:08.690> arc<00:01:08.870> that

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
that rule and now I can draw an arc that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.410 
that rule and now I can draw an arc that
is<00:01:09.410> clockwise<00:01:09.800> yay<00:01:10.310> one<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:10.970> those<00:01:11.090> things<00:01:11.270> if

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
is clockwise yay one of those things if

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.300 
is clockwise yay one of those things if
nobody<00:01:11.840> tells<00:01:11.990> you<00:01:12.200> about<00:01:12.290> you're<00:01:12.860> never

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
nobody tells you about you're never

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.570 
nobody tells you about you're never
gonna<00:01:13.520> know<00:01:14.230> very<00:01:15.230> very<00:01:15.470> simple<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:16.070> let<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
gonna know very very simple you let it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.320 
gonna know very very simple you let it
go<00:01:16.670> again<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:16.970> goes<00:01:17.060> back<00:01:17.120> to

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
go again it goes back to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.070 
go again it goes back to
counterclockwise

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
counterclockwise

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.870 
counterclockwise
alright<00:01:18.410> so<00:01:18.590> that's<00:01:18.710> my<00:01:18.950> first<00:01:19.130> tip<00:01:19.400> don't

alright so that's my first tip don't

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.090 
alright so that's my first tip don't
forget<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:20.540> when<00:01:21.140> you're<00:01:21.290> doing<00:01:21.650> an<00:01:21.770> arc<00:01:21.950> of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
forget that when you're doing an arc of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.620 
forget that when you're doing an arc of
course<00:01:22.340> over<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.730> years<00:01:22.940> we've<00:01:23.180> managed<00:01:23.570> to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
course over the years we've managed to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.750 
course over the years we've managed to
kind<00:01:23.840> of<00:01:23.930> get<00:01:24.020> around<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.520> now<00:01:25.700> you

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
kind of get around that but now you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.830 
kind of get around that but now you
don't<00:01:25.970> need<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.120> so<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.230> other<00:01:27.590> cool<00:01:28.430> feature

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
don't need to so the other cool feature

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.510 
don't need to so the other cool feature
also<00:01:29.840> put<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.380> couple<00:01:30.620> of<00:01:30.650> Melissa's<00:01:31.070> ago<00:01:31.310> is

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
also put in a couple of Melissa's ago is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.660 
also put in a couple of Melissa's ago is
the<00:01:31.700> ability<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.630> fill<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.650> an<00:01:33.830> open<00:01:34.250> polyline

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
the ability to fill it an open polyline

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.290 
the ability to fill it an open polyline
to<00:01:35.570> itself<00:01:36.040> now<00:01:37.040> in<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.370> past<00:01:37.610> if<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.000> try<00:01:38.240> to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
to itself now in the past if I try to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.480 
to itself now in the past if I try to
fill<00:01:39.050> in<00:01:39.200> an<00:01:39.290> open<00:01:39.500> polyline<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:40.070> itself

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
fill in an open polyline to itself

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.670 
fill in an open polyline to itself
AutoCAD<00:01:40.909> would<00:01:41.180> once<00:01:41.360> again<00:01:41.480> be<00:01:41.659> like<00:01:42.080> oh<00:01:42.290> no

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
AutoCAD would once again be like oh no

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.070 
AutoCAD would once again be like oh no
it's<00:01:42.980> not<00:01:43.130> gonna<00:01:43.340> go<00:01:43.490> like<00:01:43.700> that<00:01:43.940> I<00:01:44.240> see<00:01:44.930> out<00:01:44.960> of
