00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
generally blow dry it with a paddle

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
generally blow dry it with a paddle
brush<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.770> try<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.280> don't<00:00:41.489> loosen

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
brush and just try and you don't loosen

00:00:41.760 --> 00:01:05.080 
brush and just try and you don't loosen
those<00:00:42.059> curls<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.750> bit

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.300 

so<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.049> side<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.649> now<00:01:07.920> done

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so as you can see this side is now done

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
so as you can see this side is now done
so<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.149> continue<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so I'm just going to continue on the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:39.949 
so I'm just going to continue on the
other<00:01:10.770> side<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.299> hair<00:01:39.720> I'm

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
other side so this is the hair I'm

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.070 
other side so this is the hair I'm
completely<00:01:40.500> done<00:01:40.819> as<00:01:41.819> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.780> not

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
completely done as you can see it's not

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.679 
completely done as you can see it's not
bone<00:01:43.409> straight<00:01:43.860> especially<00:01:44.549> at<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.299> front

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
bone straight especially at the front

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.249 
bone straight especially at the front
here<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.950> hopefully<00:01:47.459> when<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.330> flat<00:01:48.750> iron<00:01:49.049> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
here but hopefully when I flat iron it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.529 
here but hopefully when I flat iron it
it<00:01:49.709> will<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.099> rid<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.610> those<00:01:50.880> kinks<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
it will get rid of all those kinks and

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.809 
it will get rid of all those kinks and
this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.349> shedding<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.950> got<00:01:53.310> from

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
this is the shedding that I got from

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.449 
this is the shedding that I got from
that<00:01:53.909> process<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.780> am<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> little<00:01:55.470> rough<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
that process I am a little rough on the

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.419 
that process I am a little rough on the
hair<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.599> me<00:01:57.780> naturally<00:01:58.349> but<00:01:58.590> yeah

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
hair that's just me naturally but yeah

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.580 
hair that's just me naturally but yeah
it's<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.849> too<00:01:59.880> bad<00:02:00.090> considering<00:02:00.959> that<00:02:01.319> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it's not too bad considering that you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
it's not too bad considering that you
know<00:02:01.709> I'm<00:02:01.860> trying<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.429> from<00:02:02.729> curly<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
know I'm trying to get it from curly to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.300 
know I'm trying to get it from curly to
straight<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.530> bound<00:02:04.739> to<00:02:04.890> shed<00:02:05.099> a<00:02:05.130> little

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
straight it is bound to shed a little

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.609 
straight it is bound to shed a little
bit<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.849> I'm<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.539> too<00:02:06.750> fussed<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
bit so I'm not too fussed about that

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.469 
bit so I'm not too fussed about that
obviously<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.429> not<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.609> process<00:02:08.880> i<00:02:09.239> will

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
obviously this is not a process i will

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.630 
obviously this is not a process i will
put<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.869> hair<00:02:10.109> through<00:02:10.440> often<00:02:10.859> because<00:02:11.220> i<00:02:11.400> do

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
put this hair through often because i do

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.580 
put this hair through often because i do
like<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> hair<00:02:12.359> in<00:02:12.540> its<00:02:12.690> natural<00:02:12.780> state<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
like the hair in its natural state and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.979 
like the hair in its natural state and
when<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.549> its<00:02:14.730> natural<00:02:14.910> state<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.569> get

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
when it is in its natural state I get

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.229 
when it is in its natural state I get
very<00:02:16.350> very<00:02:16.620> minimal<00:02:16.859> sheddings<00:02:17.519> also<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
very very minimal sheddings also the

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.780 
very very minimal sheddings also the
texture<00:02:18.780> has<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.260> lot<00:02:19.590> more<00:02:19.620> coarse<00:02:20.220> pneus<00:02:20.549> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
texture has a lot more coarse pneus to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.420 
texture has a lot more coarse pneus to
it<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.359> would<00:02:21.450> expect<00:02:22.040> but<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.190> still

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it as you would expect but it's still

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.879 
it as you would expect but it's still
very<00:02:23.489> soft<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.810> still<00:02:25.109> run<00:02:25.319> my<00:02:25.500> hands

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:25.889 
very soft that I can still run my hands

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.500 
very soft that I can still run my hands
through<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
through it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:40.480 
through it
