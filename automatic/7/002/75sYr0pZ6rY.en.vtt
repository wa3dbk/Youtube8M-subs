front<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.430> us<00:03:31.550> so<00:03:31.880> let's<00:03:32.240> get<00:03:32.480> going

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
front of us so let's get going

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.559 
front of us so let's get going
now<00:03:33.620> at<00:03:33.740> a<00:03:33.830> steady<00:03:34.100> pace<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.580> takes<00:03:34.819> about<00:03:35.000> 10

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
now at a steady pace it takes about 10

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.350 
now at a steady pace it takes about 10
to<00:03:35.870> 15<00:03:36.830> minutes<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.670> get<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:37.970> trail

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
to 15 minutes to get to the trail

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.240 
to 15 minutes to get to the trail
crossing<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.470> think<00:03:39.680> most<00:03:39.950> people<00:03:40.190> are

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
crossing and I think most people are

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.559 
crossing and I think most people are
going<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.430> be<00:03:40.490> pretty<00:03:40.819> satisfied<00:03:41.360> with<00:03:41.390> the
