00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello friends with you veins and me 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.350
 decided to play primal on one server 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.920
 carnage on which there is one bridge under 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.380
 the name of the back which adds one 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.330
 new dinosaur that is none about 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.920
 dinosaur korean new dinosaur 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.740
 this is a spinosaurus and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.869
 and basically I like you now 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.550
 I show it but first we must then play 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.590
 this round how much time is left 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.099
 17 seconds, that is, it is over now 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.099
 I'll show you this new skin of them 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.099
 Spinosaurus 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.310
 so it was over 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.270
 so here he is a new type of dinosaur 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.700
 spinosaurus 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.560
 in principle, he liked again say 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.370
 i liked his skin he is pretty 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.350
 beautiful and he has new features on 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.920
 compared with tireksom generally this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.580
 spinosaur it compare with tireksom 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.870
 by the way so don't be surprised at the weight you 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.000
 see ti rex on this server 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.089
 be surprised because it's all the same 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.440
 spinosaurus and so where are our people 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:15.259
 where are our favorite people where is my food so 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.960
 by the way all three teams are row 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.360
 balanced super and I decided kenzo 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.610
 people 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.409
 kay let's try even so 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.409
 argue what kind of dinosaur 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.990
 after all 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.140
 you do n't want me to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.140
 gobbled up 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:46.400
 running away spinosaur i 'll go out principle yes 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.130
 I liked his model here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.550
 pretty nice if you changed terex 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.630
 on a spinosaur I basically would 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.700
 wait a minute yes gladly would it 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.680
 I would have responded to the pizza 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.050
 I would also like to still go for 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.600
 dinosaurs but for some reason I can't be here 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.130
 choose here only you can clean moon 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.760
 when fewer people or fewer dinosaurs 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.480
 when I can not choose but 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.480
 runaway dinosaurs 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.320
 I'm here 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.069
 boiled down long this time so we 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.580
 again playing for the spinosaur and 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.400
 Yes, it seems that the people are very few 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:50.660
 left after I walked 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:56.870
 and so where are you somewhere man I know what 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.599
 somewhere you're okay by the way can still 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.269
 dinosaurs at the top of the oracle as you see 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.790
 down to on and on more comfortable to grab and 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.250
 there is still here he has hands that is 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.410
 him strong hands what direction he can 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.739
 they give shorter kill and so deshty 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.129
 man, but there is no hike that he is somewhere 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.050
 ran away or search before as many 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.640
 make yes it seems that came out 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.630
 and before him pancakes you will not find such 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.850
 tactics 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:31.360
 thousand so do why so do i don't 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.360
 understand 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.830
 but 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.090
 no nigga 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.569

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:51.790
 still the court ask me a little life yeah 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.290
 that i won't give me more like back 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.920
 In fact, it's sad that on this 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.379
 server 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.599
 few people play so unfortunately and 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.700
 plus it only works in the evening i am so 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.739
 I understand because he is not 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.840
 it works sometimes it works 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.239
 look he did not work but in the evening how 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.819
 you see it works and now I play like 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:15.609
 times when it is necessary to no damn camper me 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.579
 just kills her 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:22.359
 sv arrogance sidushki row in the brazen and him 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.359
 all the shit 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:31.800
 fly like this for him fly 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.800
 far far west and east 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.530
 I hope he will die when I am Russian 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.240
 a guy so that someone threw him you 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:48.600
 what a fool, what if I am a pancake from a shooting gallery dactyl 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.110
 some idiot looks like 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.960
 himself truly in principle that to me 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.120
 Spinozavry liked I would not say that 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.910
 they are so bad then you or some not 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.510
 very normal if you did it like 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.190
 separate species from dinosaurs so I would 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.470
 In general, you are just happy about it and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.440
 would you say well done developers but to 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.280
 Sorry, no, they do n’t want to 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.400
 what is the reason maybe not just 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.850
 there will be funds for although there are no funds 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.740
 Once a week before haircut, I don’t know how 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.100
 that they probably have the means 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.100
 all the same 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:33.069
 okay i think that on this we will 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.970
 probably finish if you 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.069
 liked the video do not forget 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.330

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:42.159
 Like and do not mind if I 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.229
