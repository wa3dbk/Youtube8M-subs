this<00:02:53.620> one<00:02:54.060> without<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.480> bezel<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:55.989> goes

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
this one without the bezel that goes

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.160 
this one without the bezel that goes
around<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.650> all<00:02:56.800> set<00:02:57.459> up<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:58.390> an<00:02:58.540> array<00:02:58.840> and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
around it all set up in in an array and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.520 
around it all set up in in an array and
showing<00:02:59.890> one<00:03:00.130> large<00:03:00.459> image<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.660> place<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.959> a

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
showing one large image so in place of a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.420 
showing one large image so in place of a
projector<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:04.060> could<00:03:04.209> have<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.420> video<00:03:04.750> wall

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
projector you could have a video wall

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.020 
projector you could have a video wall
and<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.910> can<00:03:07.420> be<00:03:07.570> as<00:03:07.690> large<00:03:08.019> as<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.650> want<00:03:08.890> it

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and that can be as large as you want it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.470 
and that can be as large as you want it
so<00:03:10.030> here<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.630> have<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:11.110> 19<00:03:12.070> inch<00:03:12.220> monitor<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.760> a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
so here we have a 19 inch monitor and a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.039 
so here we have a 19 inch monitor and a
30-inch<00:03:14.080> monitor<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.790> these<00:03:16.480> are<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.750> two

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
30-inch monitor and these are just two

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.120 
30-inch monitor and these are just two
examples<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.980> smaller<00:03:18.700> options<00:03:19.600> we<00:03:19.750> have

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
examples of the smaller options we have

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.470 
examples of the smaller options we have
each<00:03:21.130> one<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.489> these<00:03:21.549> comes<00:03:21.820> with<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.030> table

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
each one of these comes with a table

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.570 
each one of these comes with a table
stand<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:22.989> can<00:03:23.140> see<00:03:23.350> these<00:03:24.070> are<00:03:24.220> the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
stand as you can see these are the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.490 
stand as you can see these are the
typical<00:03:24.760> stands<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.480> come<00:03:26.170> with<00:03:26.350> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
typical stands that come with the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.630 
typical stands that come with the
monitor<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.850> are<00:03:28.209> good<00:03:28.420> for<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.690> purpose<00:03:29.140> of

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
monitor and are good for that purpose of

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.320 
monitor and are good for that purpose of
resting<00:03:30.640> on<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> table<00:03:31.299> or<00:03:31.450> another<00:03:31.720> structure

resting on a table or another structure

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.430 
resting on a table or another structure
things<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.480> keep<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.750> mind<00:03:34.780> with<00:03:35.170> these

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
things to keep in mind with these

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.830 
things to keep in mind with these
monitors<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.130> 30-inch<00:03:36.910> monitor<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.450> about<00:03:37.660> the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
monitors a 30-inch monitor is about the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.920 
monitors a 30-inch monitor is about the
smallest<00:03:38.230> one<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:39.700> most<00:03:39.970> cases<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.630> going<00:03:40.840> to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
smallest one in most cases it's going to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.350
