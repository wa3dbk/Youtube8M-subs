necessarily big deer so we were just
hoping<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.870> see<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.229> lot<00:05:14.440> of<00:05:14.470> deer<00:05:14.740> shoot<00:05:15.070> some

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
hoping to see a lot of deer shoot some

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.270 
hoping to see a lot of deer shoot some
pigs<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.990> he<00:05:17.229> was<00:05:17.349> one<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.710> first<00:05:17.949> bucks

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
pigs and he was one of the first bucks

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.770 
pigs and he was one of the first bucks
on<00:05:18.490> camera<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.030> we<00:05:19.180> just<00:05:19.389> couldn't<00:05:19.539> believe

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
on camera and we just couldn't believe

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.300 
on camera and we just couldn't believe
it<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:21.250> I<00:05:21.280> set<00:05:21.639> my<00:05:21.759> heart<00:05:21.910> for<00:05:22.210> this<00:05:22.360> one<00:05:23.160> he<00:05:24.160> was

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
it so I set my heart for this one he was

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.710 
it so I set my heart for this one he was
hitting<00:05:24.759> the<00:05:24.880> theaters<00:05:25.210> in<00:05:25.330> October<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.080> then

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.850 
hitting the theaters in October and then
disappeared<00:05:28.720> in<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.870> middle<00:05:29.080> of<00:05:29.169> October<00:05:29.680> and
