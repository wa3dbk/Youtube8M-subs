 anglet so here I will introduce you 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.210
 the outfits already made already built on 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.469
 will say that like that so I'm not going 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.480
 you present them one by one 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:34.450
 I do not see the interest but I will 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.890
 introduce yourself like that in with a little 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.090
 little accelerate for not that video 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.160
 trade so that's it I hope it 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.810
 you will like it already sorry for the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.720
 lack of videos that's because I 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.720
 wanted to make a video for the dlc and 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.370
 no others before like that like that 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.930
 that was fine and I wanted 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.340
 not make too many videos including rain and 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.860
 I did not really have an idea 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.620
 did not really have time especially 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.270
 so here is so in this dlc there is 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.800
 really a lot of outfit you go 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.049
 see also that there are jackets of 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.490
 costumes of suit pants and he 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.220
 there are also all the spare parts 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.259
 detainees already created so that I find that 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.179
 really nice as usual 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.579
 what are there two new pants 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.380
 robbery so that's way it's not 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.499
 super huh it's not very serious 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.700
 and here it is the famous tokamak gun 1 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:27.189
 this is the gun so that the planes there 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 detect this is the gun that launches a 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.090
 luminous ball so alone 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.820
 if you change the color of the gun 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 it will change the light of the bomb 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.120
 here is the color so we go to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.490
 vehicles so this is one on people there 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.320
 on insurgent jeans I do not know how 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.050
 it starts and its military vehicles 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 shielded or hpt the grating that comes from 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.290
 to fall into the water so it's really a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.100
 super armored vehicles but I prefer 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.200
 this one the pickups insurgents so him 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.420
 it's the same except that it has a sulphat 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.940
 in addition so it is also armored 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.990
 so what's good is that online 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.149
 with your friends you can take it 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 so I do not know if it's available in 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.270
 live mode 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.470
 but if it's available through a friend on 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.690
 you drive the pick up and either 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.000
 you be your opinion but at the tower she 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.130
 is there it's really a carnage you 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 can do and we can see you that 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.600
 in front that by the sides because he 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.500
 was behind there is the cat the capsule 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.170
 who protects you 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.810
 there we go to the third vehicle 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.670
 the savage so I do not know if I 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.310
 is progressing well but Serbian is 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.769
 maybe in English I do not know so 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.330
 left a kopter v10 a bit like the 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.440
 harrier but much bigger the little one 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.080
 little change is that we can 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.650
 return the wheels as in planes 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.500
 and missiles voiceless very quickly 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.600
 I'll say go there is a missile that 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.540
 are seeing all the thousandths of double 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.400
 in every second I think he 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.540
 there is a missile that goes away so that's 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.940
 really great that we can get to 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.200
 buzzard to lift wait for one is 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.400
 launched our two rockets 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.440
 so we're both going to the 4th 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.180
 4th 8 vehicles so the vehicles that 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.900
 everyone was waiting for it is the bed 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.670
 forgiveness sheets 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.010
 gridda a vehicle that everyone 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.780
 so was waiting for the famous fighter 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.900
 which takes off horizontally 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.750
 so frankly it's really great 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.549
 I have a little trouble controlling him 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.640
 but frankly she is really great 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.980
 to help him land and where you 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.329
 will be able to pick up buddies like that or not 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.670
 I can not because it's a 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.000
 born person throne that he is really 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.129
 well 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.030
 so we'll immediately go to 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.379
 fifth vehicle 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.340
 it's valkyrie so he does not pull it 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.650
 rocket launcher 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.859
 he pulls nothing he 'll just have to be 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.260
 accompanied by the debts of two friends who 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.470
 will be at the turrets next to 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.599
 the helicopter after you see that there I 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.480
 will introduce you mask masks 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.970
 sorry so here I will do as for 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.220
 the outfits I do not describe them 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.650
 appearance i let you look at the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.689
 mass number that has the choices that has 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.459
 built in really a lot so I 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.090
 think that everyone will find his 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.430
 happiness 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.750
 a brush functions and 2 put some 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.680
 beautiful masks and full of mask especially 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.360
 So here so that's why I 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.900
 you make this little video it's because 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.940
 that this dlc really pleases me a lot 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.289
 like all dlc what and then want 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.470
 so we'll immediately go to the 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.300
 customization of the armored carob so 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.849
 there I do it in online mode with because 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.159
 that in story mode I have more money 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.229
 down I have no money precisely because 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.080
 that I have not started the mode at all 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.400
 history in fact so that's that I have 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.430
 not make the last robbery of which I 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.650
 can not have money for 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.070
 customize any vehicle 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.090
 in any case the armored karuma is 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.310
 unblocks 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.530
 after making the first robbery I 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.599
 you say no more but that's it for 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.870
 those who will ask me leave and the 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.830
 question so already while I'm doing 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.139
