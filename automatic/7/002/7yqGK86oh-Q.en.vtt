 members meeting was klaus but 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.280

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.039
 president of the kickers 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.350
 Among the 500 13 members present 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 the town hall got the 50 year old 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.949
 Managing Director at the wellness 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.619
 institute only 12 against 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.510
 Of course we want to go over first 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.850
 All figures pay us data completely 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.840
 inform and then the next 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.100
 Of course, the steps will be liquidity 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.390
 in a sense to secure 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 we will see that we are fresh 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.980
 get fresh money and we 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.050
 especially want to be relatively fast too 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.370
 action so that the members start too 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.320
 according to their actionism with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.329
 We want a lot 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.719
 to motivate the members more strongly 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.160
 to gain new members 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.510
 before the new president the future 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.710
 The meeting was ready to tackle 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.109
 in the sign of the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.270
 past coping with the outgoing 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.220
 president frank Kuhl of the OFC according to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.740
 one year ago in one 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.140
 desolate condition had taken over 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 back to his term that became 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.390
 known from the forced descent and the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.040
 insolvency of profi gmbh overshadowed 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.960
 Among other things, describe rest with help 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.509
 e mails in detail like his 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.730
 View to license denial 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.370
 exist dfb had come 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.710
 on the day of license royalty has the with the 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.200
 ofc cooperating bank few 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.050
 minutes before deadline by mail instead 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.670
 the guarantee required by the dfb 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.670
 Only a credit agreement offered 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.350
 that is now I say after the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.490
 denial of license stood at rest in the center 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.820
 the criticism 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.980
 I regret that very much that is the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.480
 has given partial attacks 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.580
 really improperly without any knowledge 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.960
 what actually the reasons for 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 different decisions and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.900
 Measures and developments really was 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.810
 so and I have the club too 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.940
 financially if the result lists 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.810
 better start 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.430
 I believe that we are very honorable 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.970
 the presidency has set goals 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.420
 I think that we meant very well 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.400
 to have 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.870
 I do not think that we as a team 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.640
 worked together very well 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.280
 to have 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.420
 I believe that we have little of the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.680
 really achieved what we did 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.550
 actually want to achieve 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.970
 undoubtedly very difficult conditions 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:07.830
 and I hope that 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.770
 our success big day is better 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.930
 as we go through the insolvency 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.209
 the profi gmbh grants to the club 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.340
 Treasurer thomas thinks that he will not stay away 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.910
 zahnd junior in the current season with 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.170
 a liquidity gap of 180,000 euros 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.270
 time the club won by the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.540
 members ' resolution already makes the contributions 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.340
 to move in on the first of october 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.530
 however, there are considerable demands 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.329
 in the room you are part of 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.549
 insolvent gmbh on the club 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.930
 reach through up to three million 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.150
 euro is the speech 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:46.430
 the hands together will be one 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.109
 Austragung also assumed the altar 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.489
 five years of course 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.620
 liabilities in most states 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.819
 arose 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.349
 kleinschmidt the members but also 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.480
 positive to report 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.280
 he hopes that the insolvency proceedings of 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.599
 profi gmbh still in this season 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.599
 can be completed 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.950
 and a so-called insolvency plan 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.680
 work out 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.829
 a comparison between the new and the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.870
 school society represented where 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.870
 You offer that to him that you different 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.150
 as with the otherwise also runs on 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.000
 end up with a quote now 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.460
 pay immediately with a manageable rate 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.099
 can or can say and in return 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.409
 the believer renounces his 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.840
 claim to all believers 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.510
 The company excuses one can 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.120
 So it will be completely caught up, I think 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.180
 the gmbh succeeds in signing the signage 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.810
 Debt wanted this football 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.919
 GmbH 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.060
 probably the best team is going 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.740
 it probably sounded in the alley 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.050
 are beyond or even more 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.700
 is free of debt in numerous 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.870
 the members of the committee issued wordings on 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.419
 thursday review on outgoing 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.520
 above all, but also in the 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.290
 Board of Directors of the past 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.480
 years his control duties only 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.160
 is insufficient to be the 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.080
 Board of the now again 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.630
 resigned closed was the 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.510
 Relief denied what you clearly 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.830
 notices that the sting is still very deep in 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.810
 We can do that in the past 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.900
 again things out and that very important 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.520
 that we actually show the people 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.630
 what is the past for what? 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.919
 We where we are, too 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.200
 you really have to be responsible there 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.630
 also draw clear borders again and again 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.700
 and on all a lot of explanatory work 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.620
 possibility of doing that 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.540
 The presidium team of klaus work out loud 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.760
 complete the result stump peter 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.460
 red thomas d line and thomas a new 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.590
 york latter is the only member 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.240
 the previous presidency also in the new 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.240
 team represented as treasurer 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:02.280
 I am someone with a lot of commitment 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.500
 I want to move something and I say it 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.300
 she does not want to take all member 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.700
 I would like to ask you the duties 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.539
 them that together we composed this 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:16.289
 bring club back there and this 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.000
 To run for office was from the beginning 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:22.280
 proud of this club 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.280
 may possibly protrude further
