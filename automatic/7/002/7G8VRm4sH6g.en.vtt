00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
like I'm going to do a regular knit but

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.150 
like I'm going to do a regular knit but
instead<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.420> knitting<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.990> I'm<00:02:37.380> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.830> drop

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
instead of knitting it I'm going to drop

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.790 
instead of knitting it I'm going to drop
the<00:02:39.060> boucle<00:02:39.450> yarn<00:02:39.810> which<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.380> what<00:02:40.680> I'm

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
the boucle yarn which is what I'm

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.250 
the boucle yarn which is what I'm
working<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.700> row<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.330> I'll<00:02:42.990> pick

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
working with on this row and I'll pick

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.560 
working with on this row and I'll pick
up<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.650> other<00:02:43.860> two<00:02:44.340> yarns<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.910> are<00:02:45.090> hiding

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
up the other two yarns that are hiding

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.810 
up the other two yarns that are hiding
back<00:02:45.720> behind<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.290> I'm<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.460> put<00:02:47.640> those

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
back behind it I'm going to put those

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.380 
back behind it I'm going to put those
yarns<00:02:48.360> through<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:50.520> going<00:02:51.240> to

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
yarns through just like I'm going to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.960 
yarns through just like I'm going to
knit<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:52.020> I'll<00:02:52.410> place<00:02:53.250> them<00:02:53.490> between<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
knit them I'll place them between the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.940 
knit them I'll place them between the
needle<00:02:54.260> spring<00:02:55.260> leave<00:02:55.410> them<00:02:55.530> there<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:55.920> a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
needle spring leave them there for a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.670 
needle spring leave them there for a
second<00:02:56.310> now<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.570> boucle<00:02:57.930> yarn<00:02:58.320> through

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
second now it's the boucle yarn through

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.340 
second now it's the boucle yarn through
just<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.580> I'm<00:02:59.730> going<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.120> knit<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.960> by<00:03:01.140> all

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
just like I'm going to knit it so by all

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
just like I'm going to knit it so by all
three<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.740> front<00:03:02.270> now<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.360> trick<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.530> need

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
three in front now the trick is I need

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.080 
three in front now the trick is I need
to<00:03:05.610> get<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:07.080> boucle<00:03:07.440> yarns<00:03:08.010> towards<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
to get the boucle yarns towards the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.440 
to get the boucle yarns towards the
front<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.630> my<00:03:09.870> knitting<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.500> place<00:03:11.450> down

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
front of my knitting and place down

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.160 
front of my knitting and place down
towards<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.960> front<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.550> take<00:03:14.550> out<00:03:14.900> their<00:03:15.900> two

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
towards the front and take out their two

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.490 
towards the front and take out their two
yarns<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.980> bring<00:03:17.220> them<00:03:17.460> wrapped<00:03:17.730> around<00:03:18.500> free

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
yarns to bring them wrapped around free

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.120 
yarns to bring them wrapped around free
from<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.890> stitch<00:03:20.160> essentially<00:03:21.770> now<00:03:22.770> I'll<00:03:22.950> go

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
from the stitch essentially now I'll go

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.750
