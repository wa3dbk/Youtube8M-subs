reason is because world of warcraft has

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.440

of<00:02:21.410> all<00:02:21.560> time<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:22.569> think<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.660> case<00:02:23.840> could

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
of all time I think a case could

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.720 
of all time I think a case could
definitely<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.650> made<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.010> world<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.310> warcraft

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
definitely be made the world of warcraft

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.180 
definitely be made the world of warcraft
is<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.180> game<00:02:26.450> or<00:02:27.049> at<00:02:27.170> least<00:02:27.409> one<00:02:27.799> of<00:02:27.920> them<00:02:28.069> at

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
is that game or at least one of them at

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.500 
is that game or at least one of them at
least<00:02:28.250> one<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.760> them<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:29.209> got<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
least one of them so it's got the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.450 
least one of them so it's got the
following<00:02:29.980> now

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
following now

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.450 
following now
going<00:02:31.970> on<00:02:32.120> from<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.510> if<00:02:32.840> you've<00:02:33.110> seen<00:02:33.890> or<00:02:34.190> you

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
do and what the opportunities are I can

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.660 
do and what the opportunities are I can
envision<00:02:57.230> something<00:02:57.860> like<00:02:58.220> Lord<00:02:58.520> of<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
envision something like Lord of the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.370 
envision something like Lord of the
Rings<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.210> know<00:02:59.300> if<00:02:59.420> they<00:02:59.570> did<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.930> like<00:03:00.140> that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
Rings you know if they did it like that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.250 
Rings you know if they did it like that
I<00:03:00.680> think<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.340> would<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.520> amazing<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:03.230> most

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
I think it would be amazing now the most

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.410 
I think it would be amazing now the most
important<00:03:03.860> point<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.340> plot<00:03:04.760> what<00:03:05.300> they

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
important point the plot what they

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.610 
important point the plot what they
decide<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.780> go<00:03:05.960> with<00:03:06.050> with<00:03:06.230> applaud<00:03:06.410> now

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
there's a lot of different options you

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.140 
there's a lot of different options you
know<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.500> who<00:03:09.710> they<00:03:09.920> could<00:03:10.160> make<00:03:10.670> as<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.000> main

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.510 
know of who they could make as the main
character<00:03:11.390> who<00:03:11.780> they<00:03:11.930> could<00:03:12.140> choose<00:03:12.520> which

you know race they want to go with as
being<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.880> core<00:03:17.230> maybe<00:03:18.230> mix<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:18.710> a<00:03:18.770> couple

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
being the core maybe mix in a couple

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.660 
being the core maybe mix in a couple
together<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:20.200> personally<00:03:21.200> if<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.130> was<00:03:22.340> doing<00:03:22.490> it

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
together I personally if I was doing it

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.890 
together I personally if I was doing it
and<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.030> what<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.210> think<00:03:23.480> they<00:03:23.570> should<00:03:23.780> do

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
and this is what I think they should do

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.020 
and this is what I think they should do
is<00:03:23.930> they<00:03:24.170> should<00:03:24.470> take<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.040> story<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.520> arthas

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
is they should take the story of arthas

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.930 
is they should take the story of arthas
I<00:03:26.240> think<00:03:26.960> so<00:03:27.110> from<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> beginning<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:28.100> you

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
I think so from the beginning of you

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.130 
I think so from the beginning of you
know<00:03:29.030> him<00:03:29.210> being<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:30.650> know<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:31.040> good<00:03:31.520> guy

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
know him being you know a good guy

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.440 
know him being you know a good guy

knight<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.020> whole<00:03:36.560> bit<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:37.040> think<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.360> see

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
knight and the whole bit I think to see

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.020 
knight and the whole bit I think to see
that<00:03:38.870> on<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.260> big<00:03:39.470> screen<00:03:39.860> would<00:03:40.130> be<00:03:40.160> amazing

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
that on the big screen would be amazing

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.300 
that on the big screen would be amazing
I<00:03:41.180> really<00:03:41.660> do<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.990> transformation<00:03:42.830> would<00:03:43.070> be

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
I really do that transformation would be

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.140 
I really do that transformation would be
a<00:03:44.650> very<00:03:45.650> epic<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.610> something<00:03:46.970> that<00:03:47.090> we

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
a very epic and something that we

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.340 
a very epic and something that we
haven't<00:03:47.360> probably<00:03:47.780> seen<00:03:47.900> anything<00:03:48.230> like

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
haven't probably seen anything like

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.850 
haven't probably seen anything like
before<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.280> big<00:03:49.430> screen<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.840> that's<00:03:51.050> for

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
before on the big screen so that's for

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.170 
before on the big screen so that's for
me<00:03:52.010> personally<00:03:52.250> that's<00:03:52.550> what<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.760> would<00:03:53.000> pick

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
me personally that's what I would pick

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.260 
me personally that's what I would pick
now<00:03:54.020> what<00:03:54.290> they<00:03:54.440> do<00:03:54.500> with<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.220> think<00:03:56.090> they're

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
now what they do with it I think they're

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.410 
now what they do with it I think they're
probably<00:03:56.510> having<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.670> protagonist<00:03:58.670> like<00:03:59.150> that

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
probably having a protagonist like that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.110 
probably having a protagonist like that
that's<00:03:59.900> kind<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:01.040> know<00:04:01.310> goes<00:04:01.580> from<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.880> good

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
that's kind of you know goes from a good

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.330 
that's kind of you know goes from a good
guy<00:04:02.240> do<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.780> bad<00:04:03.020> guy<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.680> don't<00:04:04.040> know<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:04.220> they

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
guy do to a bad guy I don't know if they

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.760 
guy do to a bad guy I don't know if they
want<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.700> go<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:05.000> route<00:04:05.240> they<00:04:05.870> probably<00:04:06.200> take

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
want to go that route they probably take

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.400 
want to go that route they probably take
it<00:04:06.950> more<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.750> safer<00:04:08.750> route<00:04:08.930> which<00:04:09.170> is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
it more of like a safer route which is

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.100 
it more of like a safer route which is
to<00:04:09.620> do<00:04:09.800> like<00:04:10.130> have<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:11.360> know<00:04:11.480> your<00:04:11.720> human

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
to do like have you know your human

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.720 
to do like have you know your human
characters<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.800> then<00:04:12.890> maybe<00:04:13.100> have<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.370> meet

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
characters and then maybe have a meet

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.430 
characters and then maybe have a meet
along<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.540> way<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.900> some<00:04:15.080> kind<00:04:15.260> of<00:04:15.320> an

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
along the way and some kind of an

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.800 
along the way and some kind of an
adventure<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:16.160> do<00:04:16.310> something<00:04:16.820> other

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
adventure to do something other

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.210 
adventure to do something other
characters<00:04:18.080> from<00:04:18.350> other<00:04:18.500> races<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.980> kind<00:04:19.160> of

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
characters from other races to kind of

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.650 
characters from other races to kind of
bring<00:04:19.400> them<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.670> to<00:04:19.790> get<00:04:19.880> exposure<00:04:20.239> for<00:04:20.540> the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
bring them in to get exposure for the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.240 
bring them in to get exposure for the
world<00:04:22.630> which<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.780> think<00:04:23.960> could<00:04:24.020> also<00:04:24.200> work<00:04:24.560> it

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
world which I think could also work it

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.490 
world which I think could also work it
could<00:04:25.400> also<00:04:25.550> work<00:04:25.850> but<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.630> does<00:04:26.840> run<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.170> risk

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
could also work but it does run the risk

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.860 
could also work but it does run the risk
of<00:04:27.740> people<00:04:28.040> saying<00:04:28.280> it's<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.580> ripoff<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.060> lord

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
of people saying it's a ripoff of lord

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.060 
of people saying it's a ripoff of lord
of<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:29.990> rings<00:04:30.230> of<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.470> hobbit<00:04:30.650> or<00:04:30.890> these

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
of the rings of the hobbit or these

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.310 
of the rings of the hobbit or these
types<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.400> things<00:04:31.460> if<00:04:31.790> it's<00:04:31.970> too<00:04:32.120> similar<00:04:32.450> so

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
types of things if it's too similar so

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.960 
types of things if it's too similar so
they<00:04:33.500> should<00:04:33.680> probably<00:04:33.830> try<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.400> make<00:04:34.820> it

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
they should probably try to make it

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.870 
they should probably try to make it
something<00:04:35.210> really<00:04:35.570> unique<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.550> at<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.730> same

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
something really unique and at the same

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.460 
something really unique and at the same
time<00:04:37.940> make<00:04:38.390> accessible<00:04:38.960> for<00:04:39.140> lots<00:04:39.290> of<00:04:39.410> people

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
time make accessible for lots of people

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.470 
time make accessible for lots of people
the<00:04:40.160> only<00:04:40.400> downside<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.940> doing<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.330> an

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
the only downside of doing like an

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.060 
the only downside of doing like an
Arthas<00:04:41.930> type<00:04:42.200> story<00:04:42.590> would<00:04:43.550> be<00:04:43.790> that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
Arthas type story would be that

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.010 
Arthas type story would be that
you<00:04:45.190> know<00:04:45.310> he<00:04:45.640> eventually<00:04:45.910> turns<00:04:46.390> into<00:04:46.570> the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
you know he eventually turns into the

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.500 
you know he eventually turns into the
bad<00:04:47.200> guy<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.550> don't<00:04:48.850> know<00:04:48.940> if<00:04:49.090> they<00:04:49.210> want<00:04:49.450> to

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
bad guy so I don't know if they want to

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.550 
bad guy so I don't know if they want to
go<00:04:49.570> that<00:04:49.750> route<00:04:49.930> because<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.320> lot<00:04:50.470> of

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
go that route because and a lot of

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.410 
go that route because and a lot of
people<00:04:50.680> might<00:04:50.980> you<00:04:51.220> know<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:52.000> know<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.150> be

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
people might you know you know to be

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.420 
people might you know you know to be
safe<00:04:52.780> in<00:04:53.110> terms<00:04:53.290> of<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.470> story<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:54.190> probably

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
safe in terms of the story you probably

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.680 
safe in terms of the story you probably
want<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.730> go<00:04:54.790> with<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.000> protagonist<00:04:55.570> it's

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
want to go with the protagonist it's

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.970 
want to go with the protagonist it's
always<00:04:55.960> going<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.140> be<00:04:56.200> a<00:04:56.290> good<00:04:56.440> guy<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.800> won't

always going to be a good guy and won't

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.550 
always going to be a good guy and won't
ever<00:04:57.130> turn<00:04:57.400> or<00:04:57.640> anything<00:04:57.880> like<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:58.320> so<00:04:59.320> those

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
ever turn or anything like that so those

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.020 
ever turn or anything like that so those
are<00:04:59.590> my<00:04:59.800> thoughts<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.520> definitely<00:05:00.670> has

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
are my thoughts on it it definitely has

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.700 
are my thoughts on it it definitely has
the<00:05:01.060> potential<00:05:01.510> being<00:05:01.840> something<00:05:02.140> amazing

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
the potential being something amazing

those types of stories everything like

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.840 
those types of stories everything like
that<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:38.050> also<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.740> see<00:05:39.040> how<00:05:39.250> they<00:05:39.460> sort<00:05:39.760> of

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
that and also to see how they sort of

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.270 
that and also to see how they sort of
transition<00:05:40.390> it<00:05:40.540> hopefully<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.830> looks

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
transition it hopefully it looks

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.760 
transition it hopefully it looks
somewhere<00:05:43.120> as<00:05:43.420> good<00:05:43.750> as<00:05:44.020> Lord<00:05:44.440> of<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.590> Rings

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
somewhere as good as Lord of the Rings

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.560 
somewhere as good as Lord of the Rings
did<00:05:45.040> something<00:05:45.940> like<00:05:46.030> that<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.420> hopefully

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
did something like that and hopefully

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.960 
did something like that and hopefully
it's<00:05:47.320> at<00:05:47.500> least<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.830> couple<00:05:47.950> hours<00:05:48.190> long<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:48.850> we

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
it's at least a couple hours long so we

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.460 
it's at least a couple hours long so we
can<00:05:49.090> really<00:05:49.270> get<00:05:49.450> a<00:05:49.510> good<00:05:49.720> story<00:05:50.050> maybe<00:05:50.260> two

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
can really get a good story maybe two

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.630 
can really get a good story maybe two
and<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.620> half<00:05:50.770> hours<00:05:51.130> if<00:05:51.280> they're<00:05:51.400> going<00:05:51.520> to<00:05:51.580> do

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
and a half hours if they're going to do

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.520 
and a half hours if they're going to do
one<00:05:51.820> movie<00:05:51.970> maybe<00:05:52.720> make<00:05:53.020> it<00:05:53.050> two<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:53.320> a<00:05:53.380> half

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
one movie maybe make it two and a half

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.650 
one movie maybe make it two and a half
hours<00:05:53.920> make<00:05:54.100> a<00:05:54.130> dense<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:55.060> really<00:05:55.330> get<00:05:55.450> a<00:05:55.480> good

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
hours make a dense and really get a good

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.320 
hours make a dense and really get a good
story<00:05:55.990> for<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.380> I<00:05:56.970> think<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.060> work<00:05:58.180> out

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
story for it I think to work out

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.290 
story for it I think to work out
perfectly<00:05:59.070> the<00:06:00.070> director<00:06:00.670> who<00:06:00.850> was<00:06:00.970> hired<00:06:01.150> on

code uh I haven't actually seen either
of<00:06:09.070> those<00:06:09.250> but<00:06:09.310> I<00:06:09.550> looked<00:06:09.760> up<00:06:09.910> moon<00:06:10.150> online<00:06:10.570> in

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
never got a chance to see it so if he

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.420 
never got a chance to see it so if he
did<00:06:16.870> the<00:06:17.080> you<00:06:17.350> know<00:06:17.470> moon<00:06:17.770> he<00:06:17.920> directed<00:06:18.280> that

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
did the you know moon he directed that

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.760 
did the you know moon he directed that
you've<00:06:18.700> got<00:06:18.880> all<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.150> outer<00:06:19.630> space<00:06:20.080> type

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
you've got all the outer space type

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.200 
you've got all the outer space type
effects<00:06:21.190> and<00:06:21.370> everything<00:06:21.430> like<00:06:21.760> that<00:06:21.820> with

effects and everything like that with
all<00:06:22.360> that<00:06:22.690> i<00:06:23.350> think<00:06:23.860> that<00:06:24.250> you<00:06:24.370> could<00:06:24.490> probably

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
all that i think that you could probably

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.460 
all that i think that you could probably
pull<00:06:25.450> it<00:06:25.570> off<00:06:25.720> and<00:06:25.900> do<00:06:25.990> a<00:06:26.020> pretty<00:06:26.260> good<00:06:26.350> job

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
pull it off and do a pretty good job

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.110 
pull it off and do a pretty good job
with<00:06:26.680> doing<00:06:27.190> like<00:06:27.400> a<00:06:27.430> you<00:06:28.390> know<00:06:29.850> fantasy<00:06:30.850> type

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
with doing like a you know fantasy type

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.390 
with doing like a you know fantasy type
world<00:06:31.510> of<00:06:31.630> warcraft<00:06:32.080> you<00:06:32.710> know<00:06:32.800> effects<00:06:33.130> and

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
world of warcraft you know effects and

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.460 
world of warcraft you know effects and
land<00:06:33.820> and<00:06:34.240> vision<00:06:34.900> and<00:06:35.020> everything<00:06:35.110> like<00:06:35.410> that

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
land and vision and everything like that

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.350 
land and vision and everything like that
so<00:06:35.650> it<00:06:35.830> should<00:06:35.950> be<00:06:35.980> good<00:06:36.070> anyway<00:06:36.970> let<00:06:37.210> me<00:06:37.240> know
