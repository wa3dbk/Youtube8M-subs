00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.360
 Today I'm going to do it, it's some torrijas 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.349
 ingredients that we need are very 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.880
 simple 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.250
 we need a loaf of bread of the day 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 previous cut to slices as of 2 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.590
 centimeters of thickness approximately 2 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.080
 eggs 1 liter of milk 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.000
 the skin of a lemon 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.110
 here are four tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.850
 soup a cinnamon sugar branch for 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.320
 then our French toast batter 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 sunflower oil for frying 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.460
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.420
 put a saucepan 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 the liter of milk 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.050
 the cinnamon granites 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.720
 the lemon peel look when you go to 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.200
 use lemon skin split it as much 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.630
 finite that you can see white not us 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.490
 It gives bitter taste then avoid cutting 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.580
 what white is only what is the skin 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.790
 yellow that we put it on and all the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.790
 sugar 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.659
 we move it and we're going to let 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.180
 infusions that milk take all the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.689
 flavor of lemon cinnamon and melt 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.689
 all the sugar 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.810
 We have already served it for a little while cooking 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 slow fire so that we do not make the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.799
 milk as it has already caught all the flavor 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.149
 both of cinnamon and of that of 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.149
 lemon we will withdraw 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.760
 and now this milk is going to be 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.770
 a container 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.430
 where later we will lower our 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.920
 French toast 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.110
 to cool it does not have to be 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.550
 cold at all but rather warm 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.150
 because we have to put our hands and not 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.150
 we can burn 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.209
 We have put plenty of sunflower oil 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.569
 to warm up and meanwhile let's go 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.569
 bathing 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.019
 at once 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.019
 that is well soaked 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.220
 being warm milk helps us to 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.220
 let this be faster 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.230
 and we 're going to take it out to a plate 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.040
 to drain a little before 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.040
 pass it in the egg 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.890
 once they are already wet in the milk 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.560
 very carefully because they are very 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.220
 tender appointments we will go through the egg 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.220
 on both sides 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.379
 we have a little too much 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.379
 directly 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.640
 make another 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.480
 web 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.040
 we remove in excess 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.390
 once the two are golden brown 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.350
 sides 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.350
 we are going to take 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.390
 to the plate so they go cold 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.350
 when you are tempered a little 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.080
 let's catch 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.890
 we go through the sugar and put them 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.890
 and our tray 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.730
 we have our french toast lists one 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.290
 typical Easter dessert but that 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.930
 can be enjoyed throughout the year 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.060
