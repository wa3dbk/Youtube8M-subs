way or the three way obviously you need
another<00:01:10.750> set<00:01:11.050> or<00:01:11.080> another<00:01:11.380> two<00:01:11.590> sets<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:13.090> of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
another set or another two sets all of

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.850 
another set or another two sets all of
the<00:01:13.360> scale<00:01:13.570> rider<00:01:13.810> stuff<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.230> compatible<00:01:14.740> with

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
the scale rider stuff is compatible with

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.290 
the scale rider stuff is compatible with
their<00:01:14.950> older<00:01:15.280> sets<00:01:15.550> so<00:01:15.700> if<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:15.880> have<00:01:16.030> one<00:01:16.210> of

their older scale riders these will be

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.320 
their older scale riders these will be
able<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.340> communicate<00:01:18.730> with<00:01:18.880> those<00:01:19.060> though

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
your Bluetooth bike to bike range will

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.010 
your Bluetooth bike to bike range will
be<00:01:21.850> different<00:01:22.240> because<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.600> one's<00:01:22.840> been

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
be different because this one's been

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.120 
be different because this one's been
enhanced<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:24.460> one<00:01:24.670> has<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.910> bike<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.540> bike

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
enhanced this one has a bike to bike

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.320 
enhanced this one has a bike to bike
communication<00:01:27.130> up<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> mile<00:01:27.790> depending<00:01:28.240> on

communication up to a mile depending on
terrain<00:01:28.480> terrain<00:01:29.290> is<00:01:29.470> going<00:01:29.620> to<00:01:29.680> drastically

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
terrain terrain is going to drastically

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.520 
terrain terrain is going to drastically
affect<00:01:30.760> that<00:01:30.910> communication<00:01:31.720> but<00:01:32.260> still<00:01:32.500> a
