is<00:03:14.319> our<00:03:14.470> bead<00:03:15.160> blast<00:03:15.459> machine<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.180> our<00:03:16.269> tank

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
is our bead blast machine and our tank

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.140 
is our bead blast machine and our tank
for<00:03:17.230> washing<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.950> blocks<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.760> do<00:03:18.940> all<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
for washing the blocks we do all the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.930 
for washing the blocks we do all the
grinding<00:03:19.600> back<00:03:19.810> here<00:03:20.079> so<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:21.670> don't<00:03:21.850> affect

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
grinding back here so that don't affect

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:57.120 
grinding back here so that don't affect
their
