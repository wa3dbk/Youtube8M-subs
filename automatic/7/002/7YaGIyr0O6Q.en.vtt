00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.850 
can the reason for most of this stuff
especially<00:04:44.340> being<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.090> can<00:04:45.410> it's<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.590> summer

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.240 
release and I think they do it so you
can<00:04:49.140> bring<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.590> beach<00:04:49.890> because<00:04:50.160> you

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250
