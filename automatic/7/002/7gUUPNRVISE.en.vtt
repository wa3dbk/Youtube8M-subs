but to me I always look at it as one
instrument<00:01:09.260> like<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.410> piano<00:01:10.580> because<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:12.060> I

instrument like the piano because if I
take<00:01:12.479> these<00:01:13.020> four<00:01:13.380> Tom's<00:01:13.619> away<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:15.450> snare

recording the instrument has to sound

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.310 
recording the instrument has to sound
great<00:01:21.740> because<00:01:22.820> you're<00:01:23.840> you're<00:01:24.840> starting<00:01:25.259> on

so<00:01:27.000> acoustically<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.050> instruments<00:01:28.740> got

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so acoustically the the instruments got

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.040 
so acoustically the the instruments got
to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.460> tuned<00:01:29.759> right<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.300> got<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> sound<00:01:30.750> right

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
to be tuned right it's got a sound right

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.100 
to be tuned right it's got a sound right
and<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.650> certain<00:01:32.130> things<00:01:32.160> that<00:01:33.110> over

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and there are certain things that over

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.320 
and there are certain things that over
time<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.399> know<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> microphone

record a bass drum suddenly there was
this<00:02:18.459> much<00:02:18.940> thicker<00:02:19.540> sound<00:02:20.190> distortion<00:02:21.190> which

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
this much thicker sound distortion which

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.350 
this much thicker sound distortion which
we<00:02:22.209> use<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.720> our<00:02:22.750> advantage<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.030> old

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
we use to our advantage but that old

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.820 
we use to our advantage but that old
bass<00:02:25.569> drum<00:02:25.780> wasn't<00:02:26.050> cutting<00:02:26.230> through<00:02:26.530> and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
bass drum wasn't cutting through and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.920 
bass drum wasn't cutting through and
then<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.670> don't<00:02:27.880> know<00:02:27.940> who<00:02:28.060> first<00:02:28.390> took<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
then I don't know who first took the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.290 
then I don't know who first took the

head off but somebody did I don't know
who's<00:02:31.510> responsible<00:02:31.720> for<00:02:32.350> that

who's responsible for that
but<00:02:33.430> somebody<00:02:33.970> figured<00:02:34.420> out<00:02:34.600> by<00:02:35.320> taking<00:02:36.130> that

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
but somebody figured out by taking that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.820 
but somebody figured out by taking that
front<00:02:36.550> head<00:02:36.700> off<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.510> could<00:02:37.720> get<00:02:38.050> rid<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.470> that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
front head off you could get rid of that

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
instant sound that was more recordable

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.840 
instant sound that was more recordable
and<00:02:44.769> more<00:02:45.430> useful<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:48.190> was<00:02:48.459> even<00:02:48.730> before

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and more useful and that was even before

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.390 
and more useful and that was even before
I<00:02:49.420> think<00:02:49.540> anybody<00:02:50.110> figured<00:02:50.709> out<00:02:50.860> about

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
I think anybody figured out about

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.509 
I think anybody figured out about
putting<00:02:51.880> stuff<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> bass<00:02:53.050> drum<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:54.370> know

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
putting stuff in the bass drum you know

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.080 
putting stuff in the bass drum you know
so<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.569> was<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.260> overcoats<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.160> piano

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
so that was that the overcoats and piano

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.830 
so that was that the overcoats and piano
piano<00:02:58.540> covers<00:02:59.080> yes<00:02:59.680> all<00:03:00.220> sorts<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.150> newspapers

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
piano covers yes all sorts of newspapers

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.780 
piano covers yes all sorts of newspapers
people<00:03:02.260> used<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.470> tear<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.040> newspapers<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
people used to tear up newspapers and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.210 
people used to tear up newspapers and
put<00:03:03.850> them<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> bass<00:03:04.329> drum<00:03:05.010> when<00:03:06.010> did<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
put them in the bass drum when did the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.140 
put them in the bass drum when did the
when<00:03:06.519> did<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.670> idea<00:03:07.440> happen<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.910> hold<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.030> in

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
when did the idea happen to hold it in

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.250 
when did the idea happen to hold it in
to<00:03:10.299> put<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.480> hole<00:03:10.660> in<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.900> foot<00:03:10.989> in<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.170> front

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
to put a hole in the foot in the front

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.410 
to put a hole in the foot in the front
head<00:03:11.500> well<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.579> think<00:03:12.670> when<00:03:12.910> drummers<00:03:13.269> got

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
head well I think when drummers got

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.080 
head well I think when drummers got
tired<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.110> look<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.650> bass<00:03:15.160> drum<00:03:15.190> like

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
tired of the look of a bass drum like

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.729 
tired of the look of a bass drum like
this<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.540> also<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.900> rattling<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.410> all<00:03:17.560> these

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
this and also the rattling of all these

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.770 
this and also the rattling of all these
by<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.160> time<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.610> take<00:03:18.790> an<00:03:18.910> old<00:03:19.000> tension<00:03:19.390> rods

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
by the time you take an old tension rods

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.810 
by the time you take an old tension rods
out<00:03:19.900> these<00:03:20.140> rattle<00:03:20.500> like<00:03:20.620> crazy<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.640> rather

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
out these rattle like crazy and rather

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.940 
out these rattle like crazy and rather
putting<00:03:22.150> them<00:03:22.420> putting<00:03:22.690> tape<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.110> each<00:03:23.260> one<00:03:23.890> of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
putting them putting tape on each one of

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.420 
putting them putting tape on each one of
these<00:03:24.160> it's<00:03:24.790> easier<00:03:25.269> to<00:03:25.390> just<00:03:25.570> get<00:03:25.690> ahead<00:03:25.959> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
these it's easier to just get ahead and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.520 
these it's easier to just get ahead and
cut<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.459> out<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.910> put<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.540> back<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.930> but<00:03:29.170> the

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
cut it out and put it back on but the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.099 
cut it out and put it back on but the
head<00:03:29.890> itself<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.250> quite<00:03:30.430> slack<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.390> oh<00:03:31.600> no

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
head itself is quite slack is it oh no

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.220 
head itself is quite slack is it oh no
actually<00:03:32.500> my<00:03:32.950> front<00:03:33.220> hand<00:03:33.989> was<00:03:34.989> actually

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
actually my front hand was actually

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.130 
actually my front hand was actually
quite<00:03:35.380> tight<00:03:35.620> yes<00:03:36.959> sometimes<00:03:37.959> especially

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
quite tight yes sometimes especially

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.440 
quite tight yes sometimes especially
live<00:03:38.620> if<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.070> too<00:03:39.310> loose<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:40.000> get<00:03:40.209> some

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
live if it's too loose and get some

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.690 
live if it's too loose and get some
feedback<00:03:40.780> problems<00:03:41.320> seems<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.100> work<00:03:42.250> better<00:03:42.459> a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
feedback problems seems to work better a

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.900 
feedback problems seems to work better a
little<00:03:42.970> tighter<00:03:44.310> but<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.370> would<00:03:45.609> but<00:03:45.790> we're

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
little tighter but I would but we're

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.120 
little tighter but I would but we're
still<00:03:46.120> hearing<00:03:46.480> with<00:03:46.690> mostly<00:03:47.320> this<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.829> sound

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
still hearing with mostly this the sound

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.640 
still hearing with mostly this the sound
of<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.549> of<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.810> head<00:03:49.959> being<00:03:50.200> hit<00:03:50.380> right

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
of the of the the head being hit right

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.960 
of the of the the head being hit right
not<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.220> flop<00:03:51.489> funny

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
not the flop funny

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.690 
not the flop funny
I<00:03:52.000> see<00:03:52.780> no<00:03:52.959> that's<00:03:53.590> why<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.859> used<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.250> run<00:03:54.489> head

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
I see no that's why I used to run head

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.210 
I see no that's why I used to run head
it<00:03:54.850> really<00:03:55.209> changes<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.739> way<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:57.010> drum

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
it really changes that the way the drum

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.789 
it really changes that the way the drum
sounds<00:03:57.700> basically<00:03:58.540> what's<00:03:58.660> happening<00:03:59.140> right

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
sounds basically what's happening right

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.340 
sounds basically what's happening right
now<00:03:59.859> is<00:04:00.579> all<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.540> airs<00:04:01.750> coming<00:04:01.989> straight

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
now is all of the airs coming straight

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.690 
now is all of the airs coming straight
out<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:03.250> we've<00:04:03.430> lost<00:04:03.609> a<00:04:03.820> lot<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.680> volume<00:04:05.700> we've

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
out so we've lost a lot of volume we've

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.820 
out so we've lost a lot of volume we've
lost<00:04:06.849> a<00:04:07.030> lot<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.269> low-end<00:04:07.870> we've<00:04:08.349> lost<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.709> lot

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
lost a lot of low-end we've lost a lot

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.200 
lost a lot of low-end we've lost a lot
of<00:04:08.980> high-end<00:04:09.400> it's<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.970> very<00:04:10.180> mint<00:04:10.510> mid

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
of high-end it's a very mint mid

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.410 
of high-end it's a very mint mid
sounding<00:04:11.930> thump<00:04:12.380> at<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.650> moment<00:04:13.040> which<00:04:13.670> for

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
sounding thump at the moment which for

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.350 
sounding thump at the moment which for
some<00:04:14.630> music<00:04:15.530> is<00:04:15.680> great<00:04:15.830> but<00:04:16.670> it's<00:04:16.820> very<00:04:16.940> Undine

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
some music is great but it's very Undine

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.900 
some music is great but it's very Undine
amic<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.870> personally<00:04:18.860> I<00:04:19.040> find<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.520> very<00:04:19.550> hard

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
amic and personally I find it very hard

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.980 
amic and personally I find it very hard
to<00:04:20.000> play<00:04:20.300> and<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:21.170> little<00:04:21.380> unmusical<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.780> what<00:04:23.960> I

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
to play and a little unmusical so what I

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.220 
to play and a little unmusical so what I
do<00:04:24.140> is<00:04:24.590> there's<00:04:25.550> another<00:04:25.790> little<00:04:26.390> technique

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
do is there's another little technique

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.590 
do is there's another little technique
is<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:30.530> well<00:04:30.770> as<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.250> dampening<00:04:31.730> there<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.240> take

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
is as well as the dampening there I take

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.500 
is as well as the dampening there I take
a<00:04:32.630> paint<00:04:32.990> can<00:04:33.230> what<00:04:33.980> that<00:04:34.160> does<00:04:34.430> it's<00:04:35.270> just

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
a paint can what that does it's just

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.940 
a paint can what that does it's just
mass<00:04:36.100> again<00:04:37.750> microphone<00:04:38.750> friendly<00:04:39.230> it<00:04:39.650> makes

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
mass again microphone friendly it makes

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.850 
mass again microphone friendly it makes
a<00:04:40.100> very<00:04:40.130> complex<00:04:41.000> sound<00:04:41.420> with<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.350> lot<00:04:42.710> of

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
a very complex sound with a lot of

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.370 
a very complex sound with a lot of
low-end<00:04:43.040> floating<00:04:43.730> around<00:04:43.820> it<00:04:44.390> tightens<00:04:45.260> up

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
low-end floating around it tightens up

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.710 
low-end floating around it tightens up
that<00:04:45.620> low-end<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:46.550> makes<00:04:46.910> it<00:04:47.090> easier<00:04:47.540> for

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
that low-end and makes it easier for

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.770 
that low-end and makes it easier for
this<00:04:47.870> boy<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.830> understand<00:04:49.450> by<00:04:50.450> putting

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
this boy to to understand by putting

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.070 
this boy to to understand by putting
this<00:04:50.990> off<00:04:51.610> what<00:04:52.610> that<00:04:52.820> does<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.390> it<00:04:53.900> brings

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
this off what that does is it brings

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.950 
this off what that does is it brings
back<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.800> little<00:04:55.370> more<00:04:55.580> low-end<00:04:55.960> definitely

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
back a little more low-end definitely

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:05.400 
back a little more low-end definitely
more<00:04:57.200> high-end<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.890> more<00:04:58.670> dynamics

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.070 

if<00:05:06.040> you<00:05:06.160> push<00:05:06.400> here<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.750> weight<00:05:07.900> goes

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
if you push here and the weight goes

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.510 
if you push here and the weight goes
onto<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.410> rim<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:08.920> going<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.100> tighten<00:05:09.310> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
onto the rim it's going to tighten the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
onto the rim it's going to tighten the
bottom<00:05:09.640> head<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:11.200> if<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:12.010> do<00:05:12.070> it<00:05:12.160> there<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.180> I'm

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
bottom head so if I do it there so I'm

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.440 
bottom head so if I do it there so I'm
pushing<00:05:13.870> against<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.410> head<00:05:14.650> then<00:05:15.490> it'll<00:05:16.120> also

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
pushing against the head then it'll also

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.030 
pushing against the head then it'll also
stretch<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.410> bottom<00:05:17.650> head<00:05:18.090> so<00:05:19.620> if<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:20.980> do

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
stretch to the bottom head so if I do

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.150 
stretch to the bottom head so if I do
this<00:05:21.660> right<00:05:22.660> that's<00:05:23.320> fine<00:05:23.590> but<00:05:23.800> I'll<00:05:23.950> go<00:05:24.100> to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
this right that's fine but I'll go to

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.410 
this right that's fine but I'll go to
this<00:05:24.370> head<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:28.470> so<00:05:29.470> you<00:05:29.560> drop<00:05:29.770> down<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:31.000> now<00:05:31.330> if

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
this head and so you drop down so now if

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.820 
this head and so you drop down so now if
that<00:05:31.540> was<00:05:31.660> a<00:05:31.690> new<00:05:31.930> head<00:05:32.140> it<00:05:32.320> would<00:05:32.410> do<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.620> even

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
that was a new head it would do it even

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.410 
that was a new head it would do it even
more<00:05:32.980> and<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.090> use<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.420> same<00:05:36.360> concept<00:05:37.360> for

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
more and I use the same concept for

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.400 
more and I use the same concept for
every<00:05:37.750> job<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.570> tune<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.930> top<00:05:41.140> on<00:05:41.350> the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
every job and I tune the top on the

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.190 
every job and I tune the top on the
bottom<00:05:41.530> hair<00:05:41.830> exactly<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.580> same<00:05:42.790> as<00:05:43.750> Simon

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
bottom hair exactly the same as Simon

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.690 
bottom hair exactly the same as Simon
said<00:05:44.230> it's<00:05:44.620> important<00:05:45.100> to<00:05:45.160> take<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.490> same

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
said it's important to take the same

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.640 
said it's important to take the same
approach<00:05:45.820> with<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.390> tuning<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:46.780> each<00:05:46.930> time<00:05:47.260> so

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
approach with the tuning of each time so

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.720 
approach with the tuning of each time so
that<00:05:47.800> they<00:05:47.920> work<00:05:48.160> well<00:05:48.400> together<00:05:50.610> what<00:05:51.610> did

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
that they work well together what did

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.070 
that they work well together what did
you<00:05:51.820> do<00:05:51.970> -<00:05:52.120> what<00:05:52.600> did<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.780> do

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
you do - what did you do

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.720 
you do - what did you do
tuning<00:05:53.410> wise<00:05:53.560> -<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.920> to<00:05:54.070> achieve<00:05:54.160> that<00:05:54.490> I've

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
tuning wise - it to achieve that I've

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.840 
tuning wise - it to achieve that I've
just<00:05:55.270> detuned<00:05:55.690> it<00:05:55.930> just<00:05:56.830> undid<00:05:57.100> couple<00:05:57.730> of<00:05:57.790> the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
just detuned it just undid couple of the

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.250 
just detuned it just undid couple of the
bottom<00:05:58.090> ones<00:05:58.240> and<00:05:58.480> a<00:05:58.510> couple<00:05:58.690> of<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.900> top<00:05:59.050> ones

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
bottom ones and a couple of the top ones

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.980 
bottom ones and a couple of the top ones
so<00:06:00.130> it's<00:06:00.250> really<00:06:00.490> reverb<00:06:00.910> reverb<00:06:01.390> so<00:06:01.870> the

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
so it's really reverb reverb so the

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.900 
so it's really reverb reverb so the
tension<00:06:02.350> is<00:06:02.440> not<00:06:02.650> even<00:06:03.040> around<00:06:03.250> it's<00:06:03.490> not<00:06:03.610> even

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
tension is not even around it's not even

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.430 
tension is not even around it's not even
at<00:06:04.000> all<00:06:04.150> no<00:06:04.450> I've<00:06:04.630> actually<00:06:04.750> loosen<00:06:05.290> these<00:06:05.380> two

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
at all no I've actually loosen these two

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.460 
at all no I've actually loosen these two
off<00:06:05.800> and<00:06:06.040> two<00:06:06.640> down<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:07.060> bottom<00:06:07.330> a<00:06:07.510> drum<00:06:07.900> is<00:06:08.140> a

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
off and two down the bottom a drum is a

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.140 
off and two down the bottom a drum is a
completely<00:06:08.890> airtight<00:06:09.070> container<00:06:09.700> is<00:06:09.850> it<00:06:09.970> no

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
completely airtight container is it no

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.630 
completely airtight container is it no
no<00:06:10.330> no<00:06:10.450> no<00:06:10.720> it<00:06:10.810> has<00:06:10.930> to<00:06:10.960> let<00:06:11.200> arrow<00:06:11.460> right<00:06:12.460> there

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
no no no it has to let arrow right there

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.280 
no no no it has to let arrow right there
and<00:06:13.030> in<00:06:13.150> fact<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.450> amount<00:06:13.720> of<00:06:13.810> air<00:06:14.020> you<00:06:14.140> get

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
and in fact the amount of air you get

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.450 
and in fact the amount of air you get
out<00:06:14.410> of<00:06:14.440> there<00:06:14.650> is<00:06:14.740> incredible

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.520 

it<00:06:18.460> shoots<00:06:18.820> out<00:06:19.000> I<00:06:19.270> can<00:06:19.420> actually<00:06:19.810> sometimes

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
it shoots out I can actually sometimes

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.070 
it shoots out I can actually sometimes
I'll<00:06:20.920> be<00:06:21.070> playing<00:06:21.370> here<00:06:23.520> yeah<00:06:24.520> oh<00:06:24.760> yeah<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.480> lot

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
I'll be playing here yeah oh yeah a lot

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.670 
I'll be playing here yeah oh yeah a lot
of<00:06:26.200> that<00:06:26.670> fact<00:06:27.670> I<00:06:27.820> seem<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.180> remember<00:06:28.680> Alan

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
of that fact I seem to remember Alan

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.430 
of that fact I seem to remember Alan
white<00:06:29.860> with<00:06:30.100> yes<00:06:30.430> years<00:06:30.850> ago<00:06:31.090> had<00:06:31.330> a<00:06:31.440> tube

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
white with yes years ago had a tube

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.570 
white with yes years ago had a tube
coming<00:06:32.710> out<00:06:32.830> of<00:06:32.980> here

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
coming out of here

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.360 
coming out of here
connect<00:06:34.060> to<00:06:34.210> connected<00:06:34.810> to<00:06:34.840> a<00:06:35.160> compressed<00:06:36.160> air

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
connect to connected to a compressed air

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.460 
connect to connected to a compressed air
and<00:06:37.120> you<00:06:37.240> could<00:06:37.330> change<00:06:37.510> the<00:06:37.720> tone<00:06:37.930> by<00:06:38.410> the

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
and you could change the tone by the

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.020 
and you could change the tone by the
amount<00:06:38.710> of<00:06:38.770> air<00:06:38.920> going<00:06:38.950> in<00:06:39.340> coming<00:06:39.580> out<00:06:39.790> yeah

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
amount of air going in coming out yeah

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.500 
amount of air going in coming out yeah
yeah<00:06:40.810> it's<00:06:40.960> quite<00:06:41.170> fun

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.570 

you
