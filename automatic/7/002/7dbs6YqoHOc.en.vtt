as<00:00:39.270> big<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.780> thought<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.260> was<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.530> be

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
as big as I thought it was going to be

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.290 
as big as I thought it was going to be
when<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> downloaded<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.910> still<00:00:42.090> really

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
when I downloaded it it's still really

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750 
when I downloaded it it's still really
cool<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.780> kind<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> mid<00:00:43.950> evil<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
cool it's kind of like a mid evil I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
cool it's kind of like a mid evil I
never<00:00:45.210> know<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.539> type<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.739> you're

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
never know what type what you're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100

supposed<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> call<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.969> age<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.690> hot<00:00:49.079> air

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
supposed to call that age with hot air

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.650 
supposed to call that age with hot air
balloons<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.219> flying<00:00:50.969> ships<00:00:51.449> I'm

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
balloons like this and flying ships I'm

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330 
balloons like this and flying ships I'm
not<00:00:51.809> sure<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.110> should<00:00:52.140> call<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.500> fantasy<00:00:52.920> /

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
not sure if I should call it fantasy /

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
not sure if I should call it fantasy /
medieval<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.170> only

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
medieval so I don't know the only

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.139 
medieval so I don't know the only
downfall<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.190> map<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
downfall about this map is there's a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.889 
downfall about this map is there's a
huge<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:58.410> long<00:00:58.710> train<00:00:59.219> ride<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
huge really long train ride to get to it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
huge really long train ride to get to it
that<00:01:01.020> everyone<00:01:01.320> has<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.710> take<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.340> gets

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that everyone has to take which gets

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000 
that everyone has to take which gets
complicated<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.960> people<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.530> messed<00:01:04.830> up

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
complicated because people get messed up

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
complicated because people get messed up
and<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.240> hard<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.659> take<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and then it's just it's hard to take a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
and then it's just it's hard to take a
lot<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> trains<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.130> one<00:01:08.400> place<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.670> another

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lot of trains from one place to another

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.030 
lot of trains from one place to another
with<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.689> many<00:01:09.810> players<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.380> here's<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
with as many players and here's kind of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
with as many players and here's kind of
just<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> start<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.930> looked<00:01:13.229> around

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
just the start here and I looked around

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.539 
just the start here and I looked around
for<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.680> few<00:01:13.830> minutes<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.189> couldn't

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
for a few minutes but I couldn't

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.100 
for a few minutes but I couldn't
actually<00:01:14.760> find<00:01:15.270> whatever<00:01:15.540> you're<00:01:15.720> supposed

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
actually find whatever you're supposed

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.770 
actually find whatever you're supposed
to<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:16.979> start<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> red

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to be to actually start it I see the red

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
to be to actually start it I see the red
stone<00:01:19.020> stuff<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.740> don't<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.040> where

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
stone stuff here but I don't see where

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
stone stuff here but I don't see where
the<00:01:20.549> host<00:01:20.820> starts<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.900> game<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the host starts the game which is a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
the host starts the game which is a
little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.310> confusing<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:23.939> whatever<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.140> I

here<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.770> well<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> mean<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.790> between

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
here as well I mean you can get between

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.850 
here as well I mean you can get between
them<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.600> why<00:01:39.990> though<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
them I don't know why though it just

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.399 
them I don't know why though it just
doesn't<00:01:41.250> seem<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.960> legit<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.140> okay

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
doesn't seem really legit but okay

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
doesn't seem really legit but okay
anyway<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.250> city<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> site<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.119> city

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
anyway was city like a site with city

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.450

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
steampunk yeah I guess I guess that's

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.710 
steampunk yeah I guess I guess that's
what<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.620> can<00:02:56.769> call<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.069> that's<00:02:57.610> kind<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.540> the

what we can call it that's kind of the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.800 
what we can call it that's kind of the
time<00:02:59.290> zone<00:02:59.739> thing<00:02:59.769> we<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.940> give<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.660> a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
time zone thing we like to give that a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.710 
time zone thing we like to give that a
name<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.319> either<00:03:02.739> way<00:03:02.920> as<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.940> can<00:03:04.060> see<00:03:04.180> cool

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
are some hidden about the place but for

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.810 
are some hidden about the place but for
the<00:03:10.360> most<00:03:10.480> part<00:03:10.569> it's<00:03:10.870> not<00:03:11.019> too<00:03:11.230> many<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.069> um

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
the most part it's not too many so um

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.370 
the most part it's not too many so um
like<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.269> said<00:03:13.299> I<00:03:13.600> don't<00:03:13.750> want<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.019> spoil<00:03:14.200> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
like I said I don't want to spoil it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.140 
like I said I don't want to spoil it
because<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> smaller<00:03:15.340> city<00:03:15.670> map<00:03:15.880> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
because this is a smaller city map and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.340 
because this is a smaller city map and
