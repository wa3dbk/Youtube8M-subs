 Activities have continued even now after 4 years since I was small 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:44.240
 In any event who came is amazing a lot of people 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.500
 There is also a kind of feeling that you are delighted 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.040
 Really 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:59.720

 If you have prepared 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:37.540

 This app makes using the bus you use at school more convenient 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:34.419
 You can easily search the bus time by selecting the departure point and the destination point 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.419

 ur Humanities and science people have quite different ways of thinking 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.840
 We can see the differences in our values 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.840
 I think that you said the most that you can learn 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:32.740

 This guy is quite that 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.310
 I can do what I want to do freely 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:08.580
 A real Once in the university, which I believe Well there is an environment 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:13.830
 Be careful with what you put in yourself 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:17.370
 I would like to ask, and then I can have a friend who has something similar to myself 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:22.680
 So I think I can do something interesting in the arm zone 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:28.410
 Even if I still get angry and I don't know what I'm doing, it looks like something interesting is my own 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.949
 If there is something stuck in the sense that you should try various challenges 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.949

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.860
 Something to be crazy 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.699
 Believe in yourself 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.699
 Believe in friends
