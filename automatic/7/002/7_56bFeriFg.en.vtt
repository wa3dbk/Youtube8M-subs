therapy one of the main tools we use for
color<00:00:06.720> therapy<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.319> sound<00:00:07.560> therapy<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.130> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
color therapy and sound therapy is the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.629 
color therapy and sound therapy is the
laser<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:11.630> show<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.840> looks<00:00:12.960> like

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
laser and show you what that looks like

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.170 
laser and show you what that looks like
there's<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.730> red<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.330> purple<00:00:16.100> laser<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.430> you

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
there's a red and a purple laser and you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.740 
there's a red and a purple laser and you
can<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> flashing<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.800> red<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
can see the flashing here the red is

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.140 
can see the flashing here the red is
resting<00:00:21.750> digesting<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.710> kind<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> balancing

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
resting digesting or kind of balancing

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570 
resting digesting or kind of balancing
and<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.570> purple<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> fight-or-flight

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and the purple is the fight-or-flight

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
and the purple is the fight-or-flight
nervous<00:00:27.240> system<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.710> stimulate<00:00:28.920> both

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
nervous system so we can stimulate both

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.529 
nervous system so we can stimulate both
sides<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> nervous<00:00:29.789> system<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> same

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
sides of the nervous system at the same

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.319 
sides of the nervous system at the same
time<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.430> bigger<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.759> longer<00:00:33.000> lasting

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
time and get a bigger and longer lasting

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.920 
time and get a bigger and longer lasting
balancing<00:00:34.110> effect<00:00:35.270> okay<00:00:36.270> shall<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.780> at

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
balancing effect okay shall we look at

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270 
balancing effect okay shall we look at
the<00:00:37.110> glasses<00:00:37.739> we're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> find<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the glasses we're going to find that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
the glasses we're going to find that
glasses<00:00:38.760> their<00:00:38.850> bodies<00:00:39.180> choosing<00:00:39.660> by<00:00:39.780> testing

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
glasses their bodies choosing by testing

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.610 
glasses their bodies choosing by testing
the<00:00:40.350> muscle<00:00:40.680> look<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.370> red<00:00:42.079> look<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.230> orange

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the muscle look at red look at orange

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.330 
the muscle look at red look at orange
look<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.579> yellow<00:00:44.789> look<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.840> green<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.469> she

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
look at yellow look at green and she

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.750 
look at yellow look at green and she
weekends<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.850> green<00:00:48.149> yeah<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:50.520> ever<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
weekends on green yeah you ever the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.670 
weekends on green yeah you ever the
green<00:00:50.969> lenses<00:00:52.760> will<00:00:53.760> take<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.320> laser<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
green lenses will take the laser and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.049 
green lenses will take the laser and
we'll<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> organ<00:00:57.390> stress<00:00:59.059> she

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
we'll look for the organ stress she

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.149 
we'll look for the organ stress she
needs<00:01:00.239> support<00:01:00.739> at<00:01:01.739> heart<00:01:02.250> add<00:01:02.820> adrenals<00:01:04.850> and

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
needs support at heart add adrenals and

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.780 
needs support at heart add adrenals and
it's<00:01:08.159> spleen<00:01:10.130> might<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.460> both<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
it's spleen might go to get both of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's spleen might go to get both of
these<00:01:11.880> together<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:14.280> we'll<00:01:14.369> laser<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> heart

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
these together and we'll laser the heart

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.370 
these together and we'll laser the heart
and<00:01:15.350> hold<00:01:16.350> strong<00:01:16.650> I'll<00:01:17.520> check<00:01:17.640> again<00:01:18.380> how's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and hold strong I'll check again how's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.469 
and hold strong I'll check again how's
the<00:01:19.590> heart<00:01:20.630> strong<00:01:21.630> spleen<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.119> she's<00:01:24.119> strong

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the heart strong spleen and she's strong

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.570 
the heart strong spleen and she's strong
on<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> color<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> check

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
on the color now we can go and check

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
on the color now we can go and check
lobes<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> brain<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.320> there's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
lobes of the brain and see if there's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.819 
lobes of the brain and see if there's
any<00:01:29.630> weakness<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> brain<00:01:31.140> relative<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
any weakness and the brain relative to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
any weakness and the brain relative to
that<00:01:31.860> color<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> occipital<00:01:33.509> cortex

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that color we see the occipital cortex

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.920 
that color we see the occipital cortex
or<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> vision<00:01:34.680> cortex<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> wait<00:01:36.600> until<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
or the vision cortex so wait until that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.420 
or the vision cortex so wait until that
turns<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:37.799> 30<00:01:38.070> seconds<00:01:38.930> held<00:01:39.930> strong

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
turns on about 30 seconds held strong

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.899 
turns on about 30 seconds held strong
good<00:01:41.430> we'll<00:01:41.759> check<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.829> corpus<00:01:44.189> callosum<00:01:44.310> or

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
good we'll check the corpus callosum or

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.389 
good we'll check the corpus callosum or
the<00:01:45.290> communication<00:01:46.290> fibers<00:01:46.829> between<00:01:47.189> both

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the communication fibers between both

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.940 
the communication fibers between both
hemispheres<00:01:50.990> hold<00:01:52.040> good<00:01:53.149> parietal<00:01:54.149> lobes
