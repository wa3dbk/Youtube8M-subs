00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.209 
mount off of the roll bar of your atv or
UTV<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.020> would<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.380> around<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.770> bar<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
UTV so this would go around the bar and

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.700 
UTV so this would go around the bar and
then<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.600> one-inch<00:01:10.170> ball<00:01:10.409> onto

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
then you can get the one-inch ball onto

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.240 
then you can get the one-inch ball onto
the<00:01:11.189> top<00:01:11.399> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.149> mount<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.590> utility

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the top of the mount so this utility

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
the top of the mount so this utility
strap<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:15.060> accommodate<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.600> bar<00:01:15.840> with

middle<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.379> what<00:03:13.829> we're<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.099> do<00:03:14.250> is

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
middle and what we're going to do is

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.339 
middle and what we're going to do is
just<00:03:14.790> insert<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.540> strap<00:03:15.810> through<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.170> piece

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
just insert the strap through the piece

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.899 
just insert the strap through the piece
of<00:03:16.530> rubber<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.920> does<00:03:17.069> make<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.370> easier<00:03:17.670> if<00:03:17.790> you

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
of rubber it does make it easier if you

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.849 
of rubber it does make it easier if you
straighten<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.389> out<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.540> little<00:03:18.750> bit<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.139> just

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
straighten it out a little bit and just

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.189 
straighten it out a little bit and just
get<00:03:20.609> that<00:03:20.730> through<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.299> comes<00:03:21.540> out<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
get that through so it comes out the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.069 
get that through so it comes out the
other<00:03:22.470> side<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.970> rubber<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.480> going<00:03:25.019> to

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
other side now this rubber is going to

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.750 
other side now this rubber is going to
serve<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> couple<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.620> purposes<00:03:25.709> number<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:26.579> it

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
serve a couple of purposes number one it

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.520 
serve a couple of purposes number one it
helps<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.090> protect<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.480> bar<00:03:27.690> number<00:03:28.169> two<00:03:28.410> it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
helps to protect the bar number two it

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.559 
helps to protect the bar number two it
also<00:03:28.650> helps<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.220> create<00:03:29.400> friction<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.449> it

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
also helps to create friction so that it

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.819 
also helps to create friction so that it
is<00:03:30.660> going<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.930> hold<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.290> little<00:03:31.440> bit<00:03:31.650> more

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
is going to hold a little bit more

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.369 
is going to hold a little bit more
secure<00:03:32.280> what<00:03:32.940> we'll<00:03:33.090> do<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:33.389> is<00:03:33.419> we'll<00:03:34.169> get

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
secure what we'll do now is we'll get

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.750 
secure what we'll do now is we'll get
our<00:03:34.500> bar<00:03:34.739> set<00:03:35.040> up<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.370> we'll<00:03:35.549> show<00:03:35.579> you

our bar set up and we'll show you

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.819 
our bar set up and we'll show you
exactly<00:03:36.030> how<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.599> finish<00:03:37.049> installing<00:03:37.290> this

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
exactly how to finish installing this

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.180 
exactly how to finish installing this
