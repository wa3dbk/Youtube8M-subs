but<00:00:36.239> i'll<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.540> round<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.430> 12<00:00:38.670> volt

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
but i'll get round to that and a 12 volt

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.069 
but i'll get round to that and a 12 volt
power<00:00:39.090> supply<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:41.570> add<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> little<00:00:42.840> bit<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
power supply and add a little bit of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.920 
power supply and add a little bit of
trouble<00:00:43.260> getting<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:45.210> power<00:00:45.600> supply<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
trouble getting a power supply that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
would work on UK voltage from the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
would work on UK voltage from the
supplier<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:48.719> he<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:48.989> i<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.860> was

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
instead of a power supply and i didn't

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.420 
instead of a power supply and i didn't
get<00:01:07.140> round<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.439> sending<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> back<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> him<00:01:08.250> yet

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
him so I went out and bought another

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
him so I went out and bought another
power<00:01:13.770> supply<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.549> he<00:01:14.670> sent<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.570> new

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
power supply and then he sent me a new

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.060 
power supply and then he sent me a new
one<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.250> got<00:01:18.229> two<00:01:19.229> power<00:01:19.500> supplies<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
one so I've got two power supplies and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
one so I've got two power supplies and
two<00:01:20.220> amps<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:20.670> only<00:01:21.119> paid<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.869> i<00:01:21.930> feel
