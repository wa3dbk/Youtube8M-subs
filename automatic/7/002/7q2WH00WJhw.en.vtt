Davis or blasting let's step Lennar the
doors<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.430> think<00:01:17.060> art<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.480> music<00:01:17.540> are<00:01:17.900> super

connected and I think it's the same kind
of<00:01:20.420> energy<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.140> use<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.590> create<00:01:21.740> with<00:01:22.040> it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.120

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
so when my wife became pregnant that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.200 
so when my wife became pregnant that
really<00:01:30.560> kind<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> put<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:30.950> move<00:01:31.550> on<00:01:31.700> things<00:01:32.030> to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
really kind of put a move on things to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.460 
really kind of put a move on things to
get<00:01:32.330> back<00:01:32.480> where<00:01:32.690> we<00:01:32.750> belong
