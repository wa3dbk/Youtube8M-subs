00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.960
 your muscles have no third interest in getting bigger than 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.599
 they would prefer to go to sleep and watch television all day 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.139
 becoming super muscular and marked is your goal not your body's 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.179
 God created your body to survive 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.429
 not for it to be strong and beautiful 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.509
 put that in your head 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.720
 When you visit the gym and expose your body to the same intensity as the 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.790
 last week your muscles laugh at your back and say good try that 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.170
 it was his attempt to challenge us 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.730
 once your body must face a new stress says saints heaven 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.350
 what is your problem 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.870
 I do not want to experience that discomfort and stress again so 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.170
 so much I'm going to develop new muscle to protect myself 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 It's like when you lie under the sun to get a tan 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.000
 your body darkens to protect you from a future attack or damage 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 how to apply this principle in today's training 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.739
 raise 5 pounds more than last week 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.340
 raise the same weight as last week but add an extra repetition 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.190
 that is to say the repetition that is worth money 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.350
 lift the same weight with the same number of repetitions but take a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.640
 rest period fifteen seconds shorter 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.850
 Take two extra seconds to lower the prey 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.280
 move the same weight as last week through a range of movement more 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.320
 large 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 so the same weight and number of repetitions but add an extra series 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.940
 You must apply at least one of these techniques to successfully achieve the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.680
 progressive overload 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.160
 it is better to choose a technique and stick to it until you pond during 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.330
 two workouts in a row 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.140
 apply this principle is your highest point of leverage and the first thing 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.680
 what you should do before considering the second things 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.460
 the principle of progressive overload also satisfies the pareto 80 rule 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.560
 over 20 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.270
 this means that 80 percent of your results will come from 20% of 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.429
 the available tools 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.719
 continues to expose your body to unusual stress and continue 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.719
 helping your muscles a reason to blow up growth 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.769
 muscular in its entire structure and you will be the reason for your conversation 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.929
