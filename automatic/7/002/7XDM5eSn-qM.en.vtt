00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:08.397
 A bomb exploded in the Kremlin an hour ago. 

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:15.971
 The President launched the Spirit protocol. 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.506
 The entire IMF has been denied. 

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:21.284
 BORN 

00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:23.517
 I was called to take you to Washington. 

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:26.244
 ... where to hang a bomb attack on your team. 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.319
 Unless you escape after you attack Brent and me. 

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:34.222
 But if someone in your team gets caught ... 

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:37.128
 ... will be labeled a terrorist ... 

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:40.031
 ... on the run to stimulate a global nuclear war. 

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.447
 So what happens now? 

00:00:45.973 --> 00:00:46.931
 Your mission ... 

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:48.994
 ... if you accept it. 

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:54.432
 YEARS IN DECEMBER 

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:55.955
 So, what's the game? 

00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:03.035
 THINK again 

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.004
 About Impossible 

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:23.663
 TOM CRUISE 

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:38.149
 Who are you really, Brent? 

00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:39.521
 We all have secrets. 

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:42.328
 That, Ethan ... 

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:53.482
 Well, remember now, blue means glue. 

00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:54.869
 - And when they're red? - You are dead. 

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:03.480
 You can't do that. 

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:04.601
 It's not help. 

00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:12.711
