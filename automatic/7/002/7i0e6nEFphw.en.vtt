00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello everyone, resman and today I 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.540
 I will tell you about smoking sides 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.139
 the mechanism that we will have 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.969
 cannon and shoot any 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 falling blocks but at the moment on 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.350
 blocks i know three is gravel and sand and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.670
 anvil well let's see 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 we load cannon with dynamite 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.019
 the principle is the same as in a conventional gun 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.670
 whether only such a in these petrov and in this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.660
 system 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.660
 let's load and try anvil 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.660
 Fire 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.070
 here we see how far it flies to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.409
 the vampire and that's where she fell at us 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 let's mark this place red 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.820
 wool is our critical point 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.469
 farther further this gun on 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.719
 practically doesn't shoot we need a couple 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.750
 blocks but is it insignificant also 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.939
 this gun is height adjustable and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 shot range 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:07.320
 Well, I'll show you the same way she can 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.520
 work with sand and gravel create not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.119
 I will show the same 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.549
 Fire 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.130
 at the same time trillian three by whom 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.049
 and see all three distances on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.530
 who can shoot a gun also 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.119
 visually see the height 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.119
 so here we make a shot 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.229
 here's a shot you had mean 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.110
 we have this minimum range 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:41.170
 let's mark the greenbacks we have it 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.920
 let's mark yellow and he is the son of the novel 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.100
 red fell right just on her for sure 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.759
 so well and actually about how 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 to regulate 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:57.300
 flight range load the projectile 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.700
 load the gun 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.350
 gunpowder, and here we have this repeaters 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.289
 adjusts the flight range ie it 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.330
 here we have the farthest bit of it 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.759
 open and put it on 1 delay 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.709
 already a little farther up third even further and 4 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.910
 generally maxim is generally minimal 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.420
 what can only be 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.459
 let's try to fire minimum salary 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.200
 she will be very close memory she 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.980
 fly that is how they would be up into the distance 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.980
 here you go 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.760
 well here is available minimum in general 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.330
 let's move on now to building this 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.960
 guns are built on very easily become 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.520
 This option is obtained 6 7 8 9 10 11 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:47.010
 12 13 14 blocks 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:49.520
 letter n close about salaries like this 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.520
 here is roadstone 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.450
 so here so here so 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.450
 here we have 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.819
 now then let's see 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.170
 here 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.569
 and now we have been carrying on here 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.790
 Repeaters on our scheme take repeaters 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.469
 put the days of all the maximum delay 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.069
 that kind of last weird 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.069
 as much as possible 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:35.150
 first here we put a block on it 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.109
 I wanted to put on this block 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.109
 directly piston can usually 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.140
 turns is not important and here on this piston 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.920
 so can be but for convenience 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.200
 to pawn any block already 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.430
 falling let's try sand or something 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.330
 chon from there well let's get better gravel so 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.120
 how his 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:03.410
 in this flat world it will be better 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.410
 seen now here gravel take gravel 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.520
 load our soup cannon and 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 activate 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.820
 Well, I die we flew about this 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.160
 the same distance as the anvil 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.490
 further since it was in my not 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.670
 lighter structure on here it is a little 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.160
 then leave very anvil Well on 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.680
 that's all thanks to everyone for watching 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.580
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.580
 bye everyone
