00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.839
 so that there is 8 

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.030
 for this to come this world 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.580
 to be able to answer these questions you need to understand God 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:13.539
 you will see the Bible says that God is love does not say that God has love but that He 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.439
 is love 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.130
 it is part of its nature and character 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.650
 it is essentially its very serra 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.999
 God is love 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.829
 now love has no value if I do not show it deposit something good 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.829
 someone and the bible says that God created us to love us 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.409
 we were created to be the focus of God's love 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.370
 if you do not believe it then ask yourself how you can breathe in this 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.620
 moment or how is it that your heart is beating right now 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.700
 there is only one reason god loves you 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.520
 God created you for Mars and to delight with you God wants you to 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.570
 we also learn to love him in that is the purpose of life to know him 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.550
 and love him 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.210
 one day Jesus was walking and a man approached him and asked him 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.790
 what was the most important commandment in the bible 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.140
 he answered and said I'll summarize the whole bible in one sentence am al 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.390
 Lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.010
 your strength this is the great commandment 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.260
 God wants us to know him and love him in return 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.830
 this means that every morning when you wake up you should say goodbye, sir, no 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 I know what awaits me this day but all I know is that at the end of the day 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.800
 I want to have known you called a little more than yesterday if you do it you will have 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.640
 fulfilled one of the greatest purposes of your life on the other hand if it is 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.020
 one of those people who get up with an agenda full of goals to reach and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.700
 commitments to be fulfilled and achieves them successfully but at the end of the day 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.680
 account that none of them helped him to know more God and love him more 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.400
 then the fundamental purpose of life has passed away and it is 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.659
 why he ends up tired is subject to tensions and feels empty 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 God has not put him in this world to live by crossing out a long list of 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.950
 things to be heard I created it for you to know it and not love
