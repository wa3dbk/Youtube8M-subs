as well the team will be pleased to go

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:12.379 
as well the team will be pleased to go
in<00:06:06.419> with<00:06:06.599> a<00:06:06.629> two-goal<00:06:07.019> advantage<00:06:10.969> to<00:06:11.969> nil<00:06:12.179> now

can we expect either side to start
making<00:06:14.549> changes<00:06:15.229> well<00:06:16.229> I<00:06:16.259> think<00:06:16.439> the<00:06:16.679> two<00:06:16.889> goal

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
making changes well I think the two goal

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.739 
making changes well I think the two goal
they<00:06:17.309> could<00:06:17.549> make<00:06:17.729> all<00:06:17.969> the<00:06:17.999> difference<00:06:18.239> in

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:18.749
