what these boats are built for it as

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.300 
what these boats are built for it as
they're<00:02:54.360> coming<00:02:54.510> into<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.260> fire<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.160> go

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
they're coming into the fire we can go

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.370 
they're coming into the fire we can go
with<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.670> more<00:02:56.910> direct<00:02:57.330> nozzle<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.230> then

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
with the more direct nozzle and then

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.870 
with the more direct nozzle and then
when

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
when

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.710 
when
closer<00:02:59.060> we<00:02:59.450> get<00:03:00.190> we<00:03:01.190> can<00:03:01.340> pan<00:03:01.640> out<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.180> kind<00:03:02.540> of

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
closer we get we can pan out to kind of

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.920 
closer we get we can pan out to kind of
drown<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.820> before<00:03:04.820> this<00:03:04.940> we<00:03:05.120> had<00:03:05.240> a<00:03:05.270> little<00:03:05.450> 16

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
drown it before this we had a little 16

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.570 
drown it before this we had a little 16
foot<00:03:06.200> boat<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.650> we'd<00:03:06.770> get<00:03:06.920> down<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> river

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
foot boat and we'd get down on the river

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.780 
foot boat and we'd get down on the river
to<00:03:07.850> stretch<00:03:08.120> booms<00:03:08.420> for<00:03:09.100> fuel<00:03:10.100> leaks<00:03:10.220> or<00:03:10.670> those

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
to stretch booms for fuel leaks or those

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.100 
to stretch booms for fuel leaks or those
kinds<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.180> things<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.630> really<00:03:11.780> wasn't

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
kinds of things and it really wasn't

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.160 
kinds of things and it really wasn't
enough<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.980> safely<00:03:13.820> maneuver<00:03:14.060> our<00:03:14.480> people<00:03:14.930> and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
enough to safely maneuver our people and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.920 
enough to safely maneuver our people and
so<00:03:15.500> we<00:03:15.620> went<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.890> this<00:03:16.070> boat<00:03:16.660> provides<00:03:17.660> us<00:03:17.840> a

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
so we went to this boat provides us a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.170 
so we went to this boat provides us a
much<00:03:18.080> safer<00:03:18.290> platform<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.100> work<00:03:19.280> off<00:03:19.520> of<00:03:19.550> it

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
much safer platform to work off of it

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.810 
much safer platform to work off of it
also<00:03:20.330> has<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.630> 350<00:03:21.260> gallon<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:21.800> minute<00:03:21.830> pump<00:03:22.340> so

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
also has a 350 gallon a minute pump so

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.580 
also has a 350 gallon a minute pump so
that<00:03:22.850> we<00:03:23.090> can<00:03:23.270> provide<00:03:23.540> water<00:03:23.840> supply<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.380> our

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
that we can provide water supply to our

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.290 
that we can provide water supply to our
land-based<00:03:24.920> operations<00:03:25.250> we<00:03:25.880> have<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> lot<00:03:26.180> of

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
how about rescue with this boat same

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.490 
how about rescue with this boat same
thing<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:44.420> provides<00:03:44.810> an<00:03:44.960> excellent<00:03:45.170> rescue
