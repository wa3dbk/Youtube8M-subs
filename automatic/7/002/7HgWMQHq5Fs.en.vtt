00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.440
 occasion we are going to do a craft 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.599
 for the date is about 14 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.509
 February sometimes many of us do not even have 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.059
 idea what to give him and well this is a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.580
 very funny and original idea that you 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.330
 can do your boy or girl are the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 Scratch cards where he or she 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.970
 and will not know that the prize goes to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.689
 get for this we're going to need the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.949
 following materials we will occupy in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 this case we did it with chips 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.370
 bibliographies are already cut or in 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.590
 in your case if you want to do it more more 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.180
 big because it would be according to the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 size you want if you want 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.700
 problems a drawing or a thought that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.350
 it's up to your creativity and your 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 taste in this case we have with these 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.470
 small cards we are going to occupy 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.670
 stickers 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.230
 so this little heart of 22 everything 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 related so you want to tell 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 that special person 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.969
 we are going to need painting 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.969
 Gray 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.940
 we will also occupy colors 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.150
 that's also to decorate our 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.150
 card 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.000
 and good for us to see also 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 decorate the card as we occupy scissors 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.680
 with different shapes figures since not 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.500
 you have them creatively with the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 scissors you can go rounding or making 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.540
 tips in what is the size of the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.540
 cookies and good friends let's start 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.980
 as a first step that comes what 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:51.230
 fun and creative is to make him either 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.020
 a drawing or a thought or what to 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:59.200
 you guys out of your imagination already 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.200
 be a thought or a verse a drawing 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.930
 once we have finished our 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.310
 beautiful design for our boy girl 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.320
 now we are going to make prize boxes 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.220
 they can be what you want in 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.550
 this case then 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.780
 let's do 3 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.750
 and in the square that is uniformly 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.900
 in the three that will not be seen and one more 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.150
 big and the smallest 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.129
 and in them they will place the prize that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 you most want to beat him or 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:46.239
 she on her special day be it a little kiss 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.640
 a sexy dance a hug a way out 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.069
 cinema a dinner 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.020
 so that's the other part of the 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.380
 surprise and gift a rose 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.060
 then traction to the squares and in 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.780
 the center we are going to register our 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.780
 three gifts 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.250
 already once we have our 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.730
 possible gifts we will indicate our 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.379
 card 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.989
 This detail is very nice because 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.810
 regularly the couples then on that day 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.799
 if they go to the cinema and they go to eat they go to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.950
 make a diet that is very interesting 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.140
 that you have planned some of those 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.090
 three places and well now yes that the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.580
 destiny and luck decide for her by 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.769
 you and is father because the girl is going to 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.660
 decide which prize is the one that goes to 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.060
 get or separate the gift and the area 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.239
 of a teddy bear and for this we are going to 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.480
 need our paper contact and we're going 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.349
 to cut the size of the card but 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.790
 that is about 21 centimeters so that 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.459
 let's have your chance that well of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.010
 cut it or until the doubles it's like 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.109
 decide it once we have already 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.239
 had our cut out of our paper 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.840
 contact now we will proceed to paste it in 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.840
 that card 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.440
 this will serve us as protection 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.240
 for because later on we are going to 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.640
 put our painting vinci 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.230
 and this is going to make you scratch yourself because no 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.840
 take the paper and you can see 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.190
 perfectly what is written in 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.070
 each of the boxes 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.320
 a tip is to pass either with scissors 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.320
 or with a card so you do not stay 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.970
 bubbles or lumps or anything you can 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.530
 interrupt the visibility of our 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.330
 cute card 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.160
 now we take it off and cut all 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.090
 the leftovers left over from 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.090
 our paper contact 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.060
 ah 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.830
 and that is how we have stayed and now to give it 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.170
 another decorative touch and that does not look 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.930
 cancer of james pretty in this case 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.430
 we are going to cut the edges 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.440
 so that it looks cuter and later 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.110
 I tell you that you can not get 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.690
 this type of scissors although it has design 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.360
 in each cut can occupy the scissors 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.200
 commonly and do either waves 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.320
 or piquitos this to make it look was more 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.980
 original and it will serve us as very square 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.980
 of the tape 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.940
 since we have our card well 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.580
 decorated and indicated and trimmed 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.620
 Now we are going to fill our 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.670
 award boxes with our painting 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.400
 silver 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.860
 that is well covered what is the 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.040
 prize if not the bride or the groom is going to 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.920
 be cheating and then luck would no longer be 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.290
 and it would not be so much anymore and then slowly 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.920
 let's discover all our prize in 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.920
 the three boxes 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.320
 once we have filled 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.650
 our paintings now we proceed to 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.650
 dry off 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:17.520
 and when dry and not that card we 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.460
 it's going to stay that way and the fun comes 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.120
 with a coin that you have 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.669
 at hand she or he will proceed to 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.949
 start your prize and as you will see 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.720
 because the paint is going to come off very 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.080
 very easily because that's why we 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.539
 it served the role tell 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.280
 and as you will see this is the prize that has been 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:40.000
 pulled out the lucky one 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.000
