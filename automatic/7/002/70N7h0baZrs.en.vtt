00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.779
 paula arÃ³sio fernando gomes is a pleasure to be with you today that goes 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.630
 work with this service 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 for the musician natural conservation 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.739
 until the produce sector produced natural yeast 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.869
 let's use 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.330
 two hundred grams of wheat flour 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.130
 250 ml of filtered or natural water ' 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 no dramas of natural yogurt 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.929
 35 grams of brown sugar to produce the segment 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.929
 let's use the leaders in the wheat flour sequence 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.040
 mix 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 past mineral ' 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.110
 the yogurt 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.110
 to last something 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.210
 the brown sugar 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 mix 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.240
 mix well 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 therefore it is an illegal action in the united kingdom 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.490
 after all mixed we will give a rest in this mixture for 48 hours 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.930
 8 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.070
 I will have 48 hours notice that the consistency has completely changed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 a smell is also very characteristic 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.290
 after all this time 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.290
 must be added 50 grams of wheat flour 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 with this mixture 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.659
 mixed to the mass 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659
 we have to take another 12-hour rest 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.109
 fully enclosed 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.420
 it's natural 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.159
 muricy streak 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.119
 the film shot 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.119
 air 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:38.369
 then the services produced 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.719
 Let's add it now flour 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.869
 the water 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.959
 but just like the US our calls marilia masks wigs 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.549
 together 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.549
 j 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.919
 thirteen because the ready-made pasta 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.939
 we have totally here 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.979
 beat 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 Let's get out of the mixer. 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.269
 It is a rest in this mass. 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.899
 first 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.899
 the ball of mass in the sizes of 300 grams 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.299
 constant 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.299
 claudio dedecca 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.419
 Let's do it now 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.429
 if the model of the dogs we could the apple is that the balls 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.299
 pulling the line arrived on the marking 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.319
 confidence movement 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.439
 after negotiating with the 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.439
 occurs on the walls of the property 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.330
 he was hardly the only one 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
 between these and other chairs 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.370
 after that 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.050
 the guards session 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.569
 left 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.449
 strong dem-pi wind and humidity 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.449
 for approximately 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.289
 of this total spam 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.620
 It's two hours and even years on the floor. 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.370
 a scalpel or a stylus 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.370
 bring this movement here after the Flemish 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.069
 fermented 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.349
 so let's take the form 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.419
 the temperature of 200 degrees 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.409
 or approximately 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.729
 in the attic 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.810
 but it turns into japan so after roasting 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.729
 already in the temperature of 200 degrees approximately 25 minutes that is the 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.879
 our bread after assad 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.879
 listen to white house 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.009
 enough space in this recipe and with only one
