firstly<00:00:04.589> we<00:00:05.069> need<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.339> turn<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.640> machine<00:00:05.910> on<00:00:05.940> a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
firstly we need to turn the machine on a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.169 
firstly we need to turn the machine on a
movement<00:00:07.080> speed<00:00:07.470> lever<00:00:07.740> into<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.760> fastest

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
movement speed lever into the fastest

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.709 
movement speed lever into the fastest
position<00:00:10.309> this<00:00:11.309> allows<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.910> top<00:00:12.090> pulley<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
position this allows the top pulley to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.320 
position this allows the top pulley to
open<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.230> which<00:00:13.920> makes<00:00:14.190> fitting<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> new<00:00:15.059> belt

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
open up which makes fitting the new belt

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.150 
open up which makes fitting the new belt
far<00:00:16.199> easier<00:00:18.109> now<00:00:19.109> loosen<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> two<00:00:19.920> grub

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
far easier now loosen the two grub
