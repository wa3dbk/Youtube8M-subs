00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.289 

it<00:01:12.399> just<00:01:12.609> looks<00:01:12.789> like<00:01:12.909> it's<00:01:13.090> not<00:01:13.240> like

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
it just looks like it's not like

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.319 
it just looks like it's not like
interlaced<00:01:13.990> or<00:01:14.200> anything<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:15.310> I'm<00:01:15.490> playing<00:01:16.380> so

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
interlaced or anything so I'm playing so

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.270 
interlaced or anything so I'm playing so

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
we're basically going to start we

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.310 
we're basically going to start we
already<00:01:21.789> started<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.119> project<00:01:22.299> in<00:01:22.600> our<00:01:23.049> due

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320

I've been trying to get clips lately and

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.880 
I've been trying to get clips lately and
I've<00:02:00.670> been<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:01.619> experimenting<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.679> bit<00:02:02.709> i

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
I've been a experimenting a bit i

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.219 
I've been a experimenting a bit i
remember<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> while<00:02:03.610> back<00:02:03.670> i<00:02:04.119> use<00:02:04.299> an<00:02:04.479> mp5<00:02:04.929> with

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
remember a while back i use an mp5 with

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.639 
remember a while back i use an mp5 with
silencer<00:02:05.770> una<00:02:06.039> you<00:02:06.610> maybe<00:02:06.789> jammer<00:02:07.209> that<00:02:07.659> got

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
silencer una you maybe jammer that got

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.910 
silencer una you maybe jammer that got
some<00:02:08.890> pretty<00:02:09.069> good<00:02:09.190> footage<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.000> uh<00:02:10.739> lately<00:02:11.739> i

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
some pretty good footage but uh lately i

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.259 
some pretty good footage but uh lately i
have<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.190> been<00:02:12.310> getting<00:02:12.489> games<00:02:12.879> where<00:02:13.150> i<00:02:13.209> do

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
have just been getting games where i do

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.900 
have just been getting games where i do
good<00:02:13.709> but<00:02:14.709> i<00:02:14.769> don't<00:02:15.099> get<00:02:15.370> any<00:02:15.640> good<00:02:16.180> clips<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:18.400> i

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
good but i don't get any good clips so i

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.090 
good but i don't get any good clips so i
just<00:02:19.569> have<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> keep<00:02:19.930> doing<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.680> for<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.980> while

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
just have to keep doing this for a while

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.599 
just have to keep doing this for a while
I<00:02:21.160> guess<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.760> clips<00:02:21.970> will<00:02:22.150> eventually<00:02:22.510> happen

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
I guess the clips will eventually happen

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.009 
I guess the clips will eventually happen
think<00:02:24.609> I've<00:02:24.700> only<00:02:24.850> got<00:02:25.060> about<00:02:25.150> three<00:02:25.540> clips<00:02:25.810> so

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019

think I've only got about three clips so
far<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.920> 40<00:02:27.670> games<00:02:27.940> oh<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:33.430> using

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579

g36<00:03:38.040> again<00:03:38.370> um<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:39.450> playing<00:03:39.720> pretty<00:03:39.900> smart

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
g36 again um I'm playing pretty smart

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.350 
g36 again um I'm playing pretty smart
here<00:03:40.440> I'm<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.890> camping<00:03:41.220> around

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
here I'm just kind of camping around

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:51.460 
here I'm just kind of camping around
that's<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> benefit<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.870> having<00:03:43.050> UAV<00:03:43.500> jammer

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.850 

I've<00:03:52.470> kind<00:03:52.740> of<00:03:52.770> dissected<00:03:53.400> call<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.760> duty<00:03:54.060> as

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
I've kind of dissected call of duty as

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.330 
I've kind of dissected call of duty as
long<00:03:55.860> as<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.130> played<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:57.200> why<00:03:58.200> some<00:03:59.010> like

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
long as I played it and to why some like

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.650 
long as I played it and to why some like
why<00:03:59.580> I've<00:03:59.730> been<00:03:59.940> doing<00:04:00.180> getting<00:04:00.390> why<00:04:00.570> I've

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
why I've been doing getting why I've

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.330 
why I've been doing getting why I've
been<00:04:00.780> doing<00:04:01.020> bad<00:04:01.200> why<00:04:01.470> people<00:04:01.830> do<00:04:01.950> get<00:04:02.100> why

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
been doing bad why people do get why

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.340 
been doing bad why people do get why
people<00:04:02.670> do<00:04:02.790> bad<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.270> whatnot<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.640> I<00:04:06.350> think

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
people do bad and whatnot and I think

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.130 
people do bad and whatnot and I think
it's<00:04:07.530> just<00:04:07.620> because<00:04:07.950> uh<00:04:08.420> if<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.540> do<00:04:09.690> good<00:04:09.900> it's

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
it's just because uh if you do good it's

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.050 
it's just because uh if you do good it's
usually<00:04:10.380> because<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:11.610> people<00:04:11.910> you're

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
usually because the people you're

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.990 
usually because the people you're
playing<00:04:12.300> against<00:04:12.540> soup<00:04:13.010> soup<00:04:14.010> how<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.310> play

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.990 

when<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.030> first<00:04:18.390> started<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:18.870> game<00:04:19.110> I<00:04:19.820> was<00:04:20.820> an

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
when I first started this game I was an

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.150 
when I first started this game I was an
all-out<00:04:21.230> rusher<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:22.410> actually<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.710> still<00:04:22.980> kind

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
all-out rusher and actually I still kind

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.790 
all-out rusher and actually I still kind
of<00:04:23.220> am<00:04:23.400> but<00:04:23.930> since<00:04:24.930> I'm<00:04:25.050> going<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.470> footage

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
of am but since I'm going for a footage

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.950 
of am but since I'm going for a footage
I<00:04:26.190> kind<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.820> can't<00:04:27.090> back<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.540> hope<00:04:27.690> for<00:04:27.720> the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
I kind of can't back and hope for the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.720 
I kind of can't back and hope for the
best<00:04:28.020> hopefully<00:04:28.800> three<00:04:29.040> people<00:04:29.310> will<00:04:29.400> run<00:04:29.640> out

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
best hopefully three people will run out

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.950 
best hopefully three people will run out
or<00:04:29.970> something<00:04:30.210> or<00:04:30.300> four<00:04:30.540> people<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:30.870> all

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
or something or four people in all

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.210 
or something or four people in all
quantum<00:04:31.440> but<00:04:32.180> depending<00:04:33.180> on<00:04:33.300> how<00:04:33.420> you<00:04:33.480> play

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
quantum but depending on how you play

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.730 
quantum but depending on how you play
also<00:04:35.220> determines<00:04:35.700> your<00:04:35.760> consistency<00:04:36.390> like

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
also determines your consistency like

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.730 
also determines your consistency like
whew<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.160> like<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.520> rush<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.730> lot<00:04:39.740> you're

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
whew if you like to rush a lot you're

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.930 
whew if you like to rush a lot you're
probably<00:04:41.100> going<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.610> one<00:04:41.730> of<00:04:41.790> those

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
probably going to be one of those

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.580 
probably going to be one of those
players<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.330> doesn't<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:42.930> as<00:04:43.140> high<00:04:43.290> of<00:04:43.440> a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
kill death ratio as others but you know

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.080 
kill death ratio as others but you know
you<00:04:47.070> get<00:04:47.810> good<00:04:48.810> things<00:04:49.080> happen<00:04:49.440> all<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.710> time

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
you get good things happen all the time

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.580 
you get good things happen all the time
or<00:04:51.090> most<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.600> time<00:04:51.810> not<00:04:52.050> all<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.440> time

long<00:05:14.220> time<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.490> get<00:05:14.700> like<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.240> good<00:05:15.420> clip<00:05:15.920> but

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
long time to get like a good clip but

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.840

your<00:05:17.070> kill<00:05:17.220> death<00:05:17.370> ratio<00:05:17.490> is<00:05:17.880> ridiculous<00:05:18.420> I<00:05:19.850> I

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
your kill death ratio is ridiculous I I

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.159 
your kill death ratio is ridiculous I I
used<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.270> say<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.600> didn't<00:05:21.810> really<00:05:21.900> like

playing<00:05:22.410> like<00:05:22.710> this<00:05:22.919> but<00:05:23.160> it's<00:05:23.600> if<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.930> get<00:05:25.169> a

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
playing like this but it's if I get a

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.750 
playing like this but it's if I get a
good<00:05:25.650> kill<00:05:25.860> death<00:05:25.980> ratio<00:05:26.100> i<00:05:26.340> don't<00:05:26.580> i<00:05:26.730> don't
