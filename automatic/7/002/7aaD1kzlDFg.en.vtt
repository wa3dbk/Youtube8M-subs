there's not many people on auntie autumn
team<00:00:51.030> anymore<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
team anymore just as it is and so I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
team anymore just as it is and so I
would<00:00:53.460> recommend<00:00:53.640> doing<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.449> defensive<00:00:54.989> one

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
would recommend doing the defensive one

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
would recommend doing the defensive one
instead<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> offensive<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.579> because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
instead the offensive them just because

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.330 
instead the offensive them just because
there's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.329> lot<00:00:57.469> less<00:00:58.469> higher<00:00:58.739> rated<00:00:59.129> players

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
