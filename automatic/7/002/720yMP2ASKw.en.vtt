captain<00:01:30.030> Pablo<00:01:31.020> Phegley<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.329> think<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
captain Pablo Phegley I think that the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.370 
captain Pablo Phegley I think that the
sevens<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.380> help<00:01:35.070> us<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.210> 15th<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
sevens can help us a lot in the 15th in

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.670 
sevens can help us a lot in the 15th in
in<00:01:37.829> many<00:01:37.979> ways<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> team<00:01:40.350> grow

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
in many ways I think that the team grow

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.520 
in many ways I think that the team grow
up<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> last<00:01:43.170> year<00:01:43.350> because

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
up a lot in the in the last year because

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
up a lot in the in the last year because
we<00:01:44.430> made<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.829> full<00:01:46.829> full-time<00:01:47.549> professional

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
we made a full full-time professional

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.630 
we made a full full-time professional
squad<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.200> 12<00:01:49.950> players<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.610> think

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
squad we have 12 players and I think

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.179 
squad we have 12 players and I think
that<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.869> experience<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.740> get<00:01:52.950> in

that the the experience that we get in

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
that the the experience that we get in
it<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.700> each<00:01:53.909> tournament<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.840> IRB
