00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
a dishonest under the new regulations

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.750 
a dishonest under the new regulations
they<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.989> clear<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.579> thing

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
they do not make it clear that the thing

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.010 
they do not make it clear that the thing
has<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.090> been<00:01:03.420> tested<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.339> see<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> works

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
has not been tested to see if it works

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.060 
has not been tested to see if it works
when<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> say<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:08.040> will<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.869> honest

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
when you say they will not be honest

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.740 
when you say they will not be honest
this<00:01:11.070> presumably<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.270> done<00:01:12.510> by

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
this presumably is going to be done by

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.100 
this presumably is going to be done by
the<00:01:12.810> official<00:01:13.790> licensing<00:01:14.869> organization<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the official licensing organization and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890 
the official licensing organization and
therefore<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.369> honest<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.060> far<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
therefore will be honest as far as the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.359 
therefore will be honest as far as the
fact<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.530> safe<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.220> not

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
fact that they are safe you're not

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
fact that they are safe you're not
suggesting<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.909> they're<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> on

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
suggesting that they're not going to on

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.510 
suggesting that they're not going to on
the<00:01:22.229> truth<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.710> whether<00:01:22.950> they're<00:01:23.159> safe<00:01:23.340> or

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the truth about whether they're safe or

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.429 
the truth about whether they're safe or
not<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> only<00:01:24.689> requirement

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
not but that is the only requirement

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
not but that is the only requirement
isn't<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.460> licensed<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.299> show<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
isn't it they are licensed to show that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
they are safe and that will be honestly

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
they are safe and that will be honestly
done<00:01:30.420> yeah<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.110> that'll<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.409> honestly

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
done yeah I think that'll be honestly

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.310 
done yeah I think that'll be honestly
gonna<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.250> absolutely<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:34.110> rather

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
gonna so absolutely and that's rather

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
gonna so absolutely and that's rather
necessary<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.189> lot<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.549> things

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
necessary because a lot of things

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
necessary because a lot of things
specially<00:01:36.420> Chinese<00:01:36.840> medicines<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.799> actually

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
specially Chinese medicines are actually

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.440 
specially Chinese medicines are actually
quite<00:01:38.159> toxic<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.909> end<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.360> hospital

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
quite toxic people end up in hospital

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.030 
quite toxic people end up in hospital
after<00:01:39.810> taking<00:01:40.170> them<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:40.920> quite

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
after taking them so that's quite

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.499 
after taking them so that's quite
important<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.820> only<00:01:41.939> half<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.210> story

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
important but it's only half the story

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.170 
important but it's only half the story
the<00:01:43.320> first<00:01:43.590> thing<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.399> surely<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> know

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the first thing you surely want to know

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
the first thing you surely want to know
about<00:01:45.299> any<00:01:45.630> medicine<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.140> does<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> work<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
about any medicine is does it work and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.300 
about any medicine is does it work and
that<00:01:47.939> question<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.540> simply<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.619> taken<00:01:50.220> into

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that question is simply not taken into

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.490 
that question is simply not taken into
account<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.810> horrible<00:01:51.960> things<00:01:52.350> is
