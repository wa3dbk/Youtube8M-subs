00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello to you tolyan and today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.850
 video review on the game assassins creed 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.090
 revelation 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.170
 on and multiplayer mode I 'll probably start 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 your review 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.269
 I mean that as many know in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.760
 assassin's creed and the early part of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.850
 precisely assassin's creed brotherhood was 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.609
 multiplayer and in the new part of assassin's 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.760
 credo developers are not lazy and also 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.529
 it was added here let's look at 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.480
 new assassin's creed pie 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.050
 each of the modes that us 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.730
 provided by developers 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.390
 The first mode of the Crimea is to collect each 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.050
 alinka 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 the task of this mode is to find and kill your 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.600
 I recommend this mode to those who 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.309
 just started playing 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.399
 for those who just want to practice their 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.399
 skills 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.840
 the second game mode is again every 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.840
 altogether 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 but this time just every 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.660
 what is the difference he refused easily 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.700
 different in that everyone is himself 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.980
 can use up which 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.250
 developers every man for himself is easy and 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.250
 churches 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.240
 the next mode is called growth the same 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.240
 very similar to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.330
 differs in the first place so that below 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.710
 screen we have a radar how to show where 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.970
 us plot 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.170
 what have you done and then what is everyone 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.810
 for myself 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.320
 the card is trimmed and they are on the wanted list 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.540
 shift 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.540
 so play gets harder 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.830
 next board mode 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.369
 This mode is very similar to a certain mode. 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.870
 zombies where these not spoiled spoiled 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.750
 task unsafe survive 4 minutes 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.870
 tasks spoiled kill unspoiled 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.420
 so when he kills you spoiled 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.340
 become yourself spoiled and must 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.340
 run and kill the uncorrupted 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.090
 next mode 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.030
 a theft artifact at a certain place 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.630
 an artifact appears which the player must 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.310
 teach yes he keeps artifact 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.460
 for him all must fear and drink it 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.060
 tormented 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.920
 brought artifact you get points by 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.130
 most who have more points here 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.130
 here 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.690
 he 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.409
 next mode 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.950
 killing this mode is similar to everyone myself 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:36.439
 yourself apron the purpose of this mode on these c 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.439

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.150
 this mode is for you what 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.140
 enrolled in that portrait became 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.870
 while sometimes you even have to guess 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.410
 colo you have to kill most often you 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.459
 you will be wrong 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.850

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.770
 teams and cottage cheese round 1 however even 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.380

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.830
 and requires a good command next 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.980

 to change the torus took points 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.129
 also developers have added to the game 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.139
