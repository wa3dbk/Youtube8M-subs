00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
a back flip with the legs separated like

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950 
a back flip with the legs separated like
this<00:00:50.330> first<00:00:51.330> things<00:00:51.540> first

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
there's three steps to make a J not a 90

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.469 
there's three steps to make a J not a 90
degree<00:01:08.070> angle<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.880> straight<00:01:09.119> back<00:01:09.329> on

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
degree angle not straight back on

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.110 
degree angle not straight back on
yourself<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.960> J<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:12.450> -<00:01:12.799> J

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
yourself a J like down and then - J

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.190 
yourself a J like down and then - J
fantastic<00:01:15.120> but<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> first<00:01:15.630> step<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> take<00:01:16.050> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
to swing then you take your third step

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.980 
to swing then you take your third step
and<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.150> step<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.720> you're<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.870> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
jump off kick the sky or the moon that's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.880 
jump off kick the sky or the moon that's
why<00:01:30.780> I've<00:01:30.870> got<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.229> mm-hmm
