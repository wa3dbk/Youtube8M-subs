so<00:00:01.920> here's<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.280> view<00:00:02.520> under<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.000> car<00:00:03.330> of<00:00:03.570> the

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so here's a view under the car of the

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.599 
so here's a view under the car of the
battery<00:00:04.410> pack

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
battery pack

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.540 
battery pack
I<00:00:05.640> removed<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.750> two<00:00:07.049> access<00:00:07.799> covers<00:00:08.309> that

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
I removed the two access covers that

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.690 
I removed the two access covers that
were<00:00:08.700> underneath<00:00:09.269> there<00:00:09.630> which<00:00:10.380> are<00:00:10.700> these

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
were underneath there which are these

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.509 
were underneath there which are these
things<00:00:12.290> just<00:00:13.290> kind<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> protective<00:00:14.280> plate

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
things just kind of a protective plate

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.750 
things just kind of a protective plate
has<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> gasket<00:00:16.039> which<00:00:17.039> seem<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.520> good<00:00:17.699> at

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
has a gasket which seem to be good at

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.290 
has a gasket which seem to be good at
keeping<00:00:18.660> water<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:20.010> once<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.000> there

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
keeping water in once it got in there

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.200 
keeping water in once it got in there
but<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.439> remove<00:00:22.800> those<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.519> thing<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:23.939> trying

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
but I remove those the thing I'm trying

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.359 
but I remove those the thing I'm trying
to<00:00:24.390> figure<00:00:24.660> out<00:00:24.810> next<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.529> we've<00:00:25.769> got<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> high

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to figure out next is we've got the high

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.240 
to figure out next is we've got the high
voltage<00:00:26.820> orange<00:00:27.240> cables<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:28.170> first<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.070> wasn't

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
voltage orange cables at first I wasn't

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
voltage orange cables at first I wasn't
sure<00:00:29.400> how<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:30.000> those<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.449> there's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
sure how to get those out there's a that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.959 
sure how to get those out there's a that
holds<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> outside<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.820> that's

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
holds it in from the outside but that's

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.959 
holds it in from the outside but that's
obviously<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> electrical<00:00:34.320> connection

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
obviously not the electrical connection

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.470 
obviously not the electrical connection
so<00:00:36.739> since<00:00:37.739> I've<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.309> daylight<00:00:38.550> again<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
so since I've got some daylight again I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.920 
so since I've got some daylight again I
was<00:00:40.260> able<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.800> dry<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:42.000> under<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> car<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
was able to dry it out under the car a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
was able to dry it out under the car a
little<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.920> could<00:00:44.040> slide<00:00:44.370> under

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
little bit just so I could slide under

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.369 
little bit just so I could slide under
there<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> ice

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
there in here you can see all the ice

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.430 
there in here you can see all the ice
coming<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:51.510> access<00:00:51.989> ports

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
coming out from the the two access ports

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.979 
coming out from the the two access ports
and<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.420> use<00:00:54.960> my

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and what I have to do now is use my

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
and what I have to do now is use my
Harbor<00:00:55.710> Freight<00:00:55.949> heat<00:00:56.250> gun<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.760> melt<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> ice

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
Harbor Freight heat gun to melt the ice

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.470 
Harbor Freight heat gun to melt the ice
to<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.100> electrical<00:00:59.699> connections<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to get at the electrical connections to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.720 
to get at the electrical connections to
unbolt<00:01:00.989> those<00:01:01.320> once<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
unbolt those once I get all the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
unbolt those once I get all the
electrical<00:01:03.210> connections<00:01:03.719> off<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.110> should<00:01:04.170> be

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
electrical connections off I should be

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.740 
electrical connections off I should be
able<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> drop<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.129> battery<00:01:05.460> pack<00:01:05.750> battery

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
able to drop the battery pack battery

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
able to drop the battery pack battery
pack<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.290> under<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> middle<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> car

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
pack is up under the middle of the car

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
pack is up under the middle of the car
and<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.630> held<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> place<00:01:10.140> by<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.470> number<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and it's held in place by a number of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.789 
and it's held in place by a number of
bolts<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.260> connected<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
bolts like this that connected the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.910 
bolts like this that connected the
battery<00:01:13.830> pack<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.150> frame<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.320> should<00:01:16.830> be

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
battery pack to the frame so I should be

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
battery pack to the frame so I should be
able<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> trolley<00:01:18.750> jack<00:01:19.200> under<00:01:19.770> there

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
able to do a trolley jack under there

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.359 
able to do a trolley jack under there
and<00:01:20.250> drop<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.060> similar<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> large

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and drop it down similar to how a large

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.380 
and drop it down similar to how a large
heavy<00:01:23.700> gas<00:01:24.030> tank<00:01:24.390> would<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.720> removed<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:26.390> looks

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
heavy gas tank would be removed so looks

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.550 
heavy gas tank would be removed so looks
like<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> next<00:01:28.049> step<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
like that's the next step in this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.859 
like that's the next step in this
project<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.549> disappointed<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
project I'm a little disappointed at the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
project I'm a little disappointed at the
battery<00:01:31.170> pack<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> knew

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
battery pack there but you know I knew

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
battery pack there but you know I knew
this<00:01:33.420> could<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> worst<00:01:34.049> worst-case

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
this could be the worst worst-case

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.620 
this could be the worst worst-case
scenario<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.729> certainly<00:01:36.000> looks<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
scenario and it certainly looks like it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
scenario and it certainly looks like it
is<00:01:37.070> for<00:01:38.070> everybody<00:01:38.340> who<00:01:38.520> said<00:01:38.880> things<00:01:39.060> like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
is for everybody who said things like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.940 
is for everybody who said things like
hey<00:01:39.509> anything<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.110> got<00:01:40.259> salt<00:01:40.500> water<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.829> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
hey anything that's got salt water in it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
hey anything that's got salt water in it
rinse<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.610> fresh<00:01:41.850> water<00:01:42.439> sounds

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
rinse it out with fresh water sounds

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.020 
rinse it out with fresh water sounds
like<00:01:43.560> great<00:01:43.740> advice<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.399> unless<00:01:44.820> it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
like great advice but unless it's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.789 
like great advice but unless it's
something<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.570> take<00:01:45.750> off<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.079> car<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
something I can take off the car and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.810 
something I can take off the car and
into<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.700> bathroom<00:01:48.149> sink<00:01:48.600> or<00:01:48.840> bathtub<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:50.310> can't

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
into my bathroom sink or bathtub I can't

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
into my bathroom sink or bathtub I can't
really<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.920> like

really do that you know it's a it's like

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.999 
really do that you know it's a it's like
ten<00:01:53.520> degrees<00:01:53.880> outside<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.009> below

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
ten degrees outside right now it's below
