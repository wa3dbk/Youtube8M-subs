head<00:00:15.509> I'm<00:00:15.660> creating<00:00:16.139> but<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.619> gonna<00:00:16.740> require

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
head I'm creating but it's gonna require

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.179 
head I'm creating but it's gonna require
a<00:00:17.279> lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.640> 3/4<00:00:18.390> MDF<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.320> whole<00:00:19.619> bunch<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a lot of 3/4 MDF and a whole bunch of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.570 
a lot of 3/4 MDF and a whole bunch of
cutting<00:00:21.590> this<00:00:22.590> whole<00:00:22.859> thing<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.189> made<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.490> of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
cutting this whole thing is made up of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.939 
cutting this whole thing is made up of
layers<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:24.090> MDF<00:00:24.600> stacked<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.170> lot<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.560> Roman

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
layers of MDF stacked a lot like Roman

layers of MDF stacked a lot like Roman
columns<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.580> make<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> whole<00:00:27.180> shape<00:00:27.500> we

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
columns to make up the whole shape we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.810 
columns to make up the whole shape we
add<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> little<00:00:28.800> bit<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.010> trial<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.519> error<00:00:29.640> with

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
add a little bit of trial and error with

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
add a little bit of trial and error with
this<00:00:29.939> whole<00:00:30.119> thing<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.109> was<00:00:31.230> literally

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
this whole thing so it was literally

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
this whole thing so it was literally
building<00:00:31.859> three-quarters<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.610> an<00:00:32.790> inch<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
building three-quarters of an inch at a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.180 
building three-quarters of an inch at a
time<00:00:33.270> by<00:00:33.780> cutting<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.170> shape<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.649> guessed<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.070> be

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
time by cutting a shape we guessed to be

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.920 
time by cutting a shape we guessed to be
just<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> don't<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
just about right but you don't have to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330 
just about right but you don't have to
do<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.410> head<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> link<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.309> your

screen right now and print out these
how-to<00:00:40.290> sheets<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> template<00:00:42.510> we

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
how-to sheets now this is a template we

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.840 
how-to sheets now this is a template we
made<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.350> cut<00:00:44.010> along<00:00:44.250> these<00:00:44.430> edges

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
made just for you cut along these edges

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.220 
made just for you cut along these edges
and<00:00:45.030> you'll<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.660> pieces<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and you'll have the right pieces to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.840 
and you'll have the right pieces to
stack<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.829> homemade<00:00:47.190> moose<00:00:47.399> head

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
stack up your homemade moose head

stack up your homemade moose head
it's<00:00:48.600> another<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.020> down<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> still<00:00:49.770> got<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it's another one down but I still got a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's another one down but I still got a
bunch<00:00:50.129> more<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:54.199> layering<00:00:55.199> MDF<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.949> get

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
bunch more to go layering MDF can get

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500 
bunch more to go layering MDF can get
really<00:00:56.460> heavy<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.969> fast

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
really heavy really fast

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
really heavy really fast
we<00:00:57.960> hollowed<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.379> each<00:00:58.620> layer<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.100> we

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
we hollowed out each layer as we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.610 
we hollowed out each layer as we
attached<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.820> together<00:01:00.050> this<00:01:01.050> project<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
attached it all together this project is

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
attached it all together this project is
a<00:01:01.649> good<00:01:01.829> chance<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.250> test<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:02.760> jigsaw

you<00:01:05.390> need<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.630> make<00:01:05.750> precise<00:01:06.200> cuts<00:01:06.560> if<00:01:06.860> you

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
you need to make precise cuts if you

a<00:01:17.509> template<00:01:17.929> we<00:01:18.049> cut<00:01:18.229> out<00:01:18.380> with<00:01:18.560> luan<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.429> we

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
a template we cut out with luan then we

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.609 
a template we cut out with luan then we
lay<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.850> on<00:01:19.939> acid-free<00:01:20.420> tissue<00:01:20.600> paper<00:01:21.200> using

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.969 

after<00:01:26.659> about<00:01:26.780> six<00:01:27.140> sheets<00:01:27.380> we<00:01:27.619> cut<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:27.950> excess

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
after about six sheets we cut the excess

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.550 
after about six sheets we cut the excess
edges<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.850> our<00:01:29.060> antlers<00:01:29.390> were<00:01:29.539> ready<00:01:29.780> you

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
edges and our antlers were ready you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.749 
edges and our antlers were ready you
could<00:01:30.710> even<00:01:30.829> add<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.039> couple<00:01:31.310> coats<00:01:31.549> of<00:01:31.700> shellac

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
could even add a couple coats of shellac

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.580 
could even add a couple coats of shellac
for<00:01:32.329> a<00:01:32.390> little<00:01:32.569> bit<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.720> color<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.170> help<00:01:33.439> keep

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
for a little bit of color and help keep
