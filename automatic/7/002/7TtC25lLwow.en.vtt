athlete<00:00:23.939> doesn't<00:00:24.510> explode<00:00:25.140> well<00:00:25.560> thus

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
athlete doesn't explode well thus

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
doesn't finish that great at the rim so

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.679 
doesn't finish that great at the rim so
it's<00:00:29.010> two<00:00:29.160> point<00:00:29.460> has<00:00:30.029> finished<00:00:30.300> his<00:00:30.480> field

it's two point has finished his field
opportunities<00:00:31.199> rim<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.560> actually<00:00:31.830> kind<00:00:32.009> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
opportunities rim is actually kind of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.380 
opportunities rim is actually kind of
down<00:00:33.440> it's<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.860> weird<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.210> how

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
down it's going to be weird to see how

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.910 
down it's going to be weird to see how
he<00:00:36.450> plays<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> lot<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.649> he<00:00:37.710> does

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
he plays because a lot of what he does

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.569 
he plays because a lot of what he does
is<00:00:38.160> basically<00:00:38.760> scrapping<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:40.469> buckets<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is basically scrapping for buckets and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.130 
is basically scrapping for buckets and
outside<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> hitting<00:00:42.329> his<00:00:42.420> outside<00:00:42.780> jump<00:00:43.079> shot

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
outside of hitting his outside jump shot

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.369 
outside of hitting his outside jump shot
so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> gave<00:00:44.250> him<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> 65<00:00:45.030> overall<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.050> saw

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
so I gave him a 65 overall as you saw

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.720 
so I gave him a 65 overall as you saw
and<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.750> categorized<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> raw<00:00:49.920> scrapper

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and he is categorized as a raw scrapper

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
and he is categorized as a raw scrapper
which<00:00:50.969> i<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.600> pretty<00:00:51.870> accurate<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.559> like

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
which i think is pretty accurate I like

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.799 
which i think is pretty accurate I like
it<00:00:53.219> when<00:00:53.340> i<00:00:53.399> plug<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> ratings<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.539> all

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it when i plug in the ratings and all

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.500 
it when i plug in the ratings and all
that<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> stuff<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.360> know

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that kind of stuff and then the you know

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569 
that kind of stuff and then the you know
the<00:00:57.930> summary<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.920> call<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the summary of what they call the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.490 
the summary of what they call the
players<00:00:59.850> actually<00:01:00.210> kind<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> fits<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.469> I

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
players actually kind of fits what I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.009 
players actually kind of fits what I
think<00:01:01.739> their<00:01:01.890> style<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.629> means<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
think their style is so that means that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
think their style is so that means that
at<00:01:04.110> least<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.559> did<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.640> basically

towards the bottom of this list for sure
it<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.689> justice<00:01:37.650> Winslow<00:01:38.130> got<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> 72<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.799> Duke

it is justice Winslow got to 72 for Duke
justice<00:01:42.180> Winslow<00:01:42.360> reminds<00:01:42.960> me<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> lot<00:01:43.560> of

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
justice Winslow reminds me a lot of

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.240 
justice Winslow reminds me a lot of
Jimmy<00:01:44.369> Butler<00:01:44.939> he<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.600> physically<00:01:46.350> strong<00:01:46.829> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
Jimmy Butler he is physically strong a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.130 
Jimmy Butler he is physically strong a
pretty<00:01:47.939> good<00:01:48.119> athlete<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.570> think<00:01:48.780> Jimmy's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
pretty good athlete I think Jimmy's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
pretty good athlete I think Jimmy's
probably<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.070> bit<00:01:50.280> better<00:01:50.520> run<00:01:51.270> jump

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
probably a little bit better run jump

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200 
probably a little bit better run jump
athlete<00:01:52.110> than<00:01:52.350> him<00:01:52.640> but<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:53.759> he's<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
athlete than him but I think he's a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
athlete than him but I think he's a
better<00:01:54.450> jump<00:01:54.810> shot<00:01:55.020> shooter<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.920> well<00:01:56.250> he

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
better jump shot shooter at this well he

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
better jump shot shooter at this well he
may<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.000> better<00:01:57.149> jump<00:01:57.390> shot<00:01:57.570> shooter<00:01:57.750> than

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
may be a better jump shot shooter than

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.810 
may be a better jump shot shooter than
Jimmy<00:01:58.170> period<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.250> he's<00:01:59.369> definitely<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
Jimmy period but he's definitely a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
Jimmy period but he's definitely a
better<00:02:00.000> jump<00:02:00.450> shot<00:02:00.659> shooter<00:02:00.990> than<00:02:01.110> Jimmy<00:02:01.469> was

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
three a game so that that tells you he

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.080 
three a game so that that tells you he
can<00:02:39.780> actually<00:02:40.200> shoot<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.560> ball<00:02:40.970> pretty<00:02:41.970> well

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
can actually shoot the ball pretty well

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.430 
can actually shoot the ball pretty well
but<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.700> guess<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.450> look<00:02:45.690> at<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.140> his

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
but I guess you look at like his

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.260 
but I guess you look at like his
field-goal<00:02:46.740> percentage<00:02:46.890> at<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.640> rim<00:02:47.940> it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
field-goal percentage at the rim it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.170 
field-goal percentage at the rim it
wasn't<00:02:48.840> quite<00:02:49.230> as<00:02:49.440> high<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.310> expected<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.090> to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
wasn't quite as high as I expected it to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.530 
wasn't quite as high as I expected it to
be<00:02:52.220> defensively<00:02:53.220> yeah<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:53.910> had<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.300> give<00:02:54.420> him

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
be defensively yeah I had to give him

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.840 
be defensively yeah I had to give him
some<00:02:54.750> give<00:02:55.380> him<00:02:55.500> some<00:02:55.530> love<00:02:55.830> on<00:02:55.980> reputation

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
some give him some love on reputation

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.570 
some give him some love on reputation
but<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.780> look<00:02:57.900> at<00:02:58.080> like<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.620> steals<00:02:58.950> 1.3

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
but if you look at like it steals 1.3

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.820 
but if you look at like it steals 1.3
steals<00:02:59.820> is<00:03:00.000> good<00:03:00.210> no<00:03:00.510> point<00:03:01.080> nine<00:03:01.260> blocks<00:03:01.590> is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
steals is good no point nine blocks is

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.740 
steals is good no point nine blocks is
really<00:03:02.400> pretty<00:03:02.610> good<00:03:02.880> really<00:03:03.270> good<00:03:03.300> for<00:03:03.720> a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
really pretty good really good for a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.680 
really pretty good really good for a
small<00:03:04.740> forward<00:03:05.100> small<00:03:06.000> forward<00:03:06.330> shooting<00:03:06.600> guy

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
small forward small forward shooting guy

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.920 
small forward small forward shooting guy
I<00:03:06.840> think<00:03:07.110> he's<00:03:07.230> more<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> small<00:03:07.770> forward<00:03:08.220> so

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
I think he's more of a small forward so

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.990 
I think he's more of a small forward so
it<00:03:09.930> was<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.380> weird<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.160> rating<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.850> me

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
it was a weird kind of a rating to me

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.660 
it was a weird kind of a rating to me
for<00:03:12.360> him<00:03:12.860> potential<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.010> definitely<00:03:14.520> up<00:03:14.640> there

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
for him potential is definitely up there

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.180 
for him potential is definitely up there
but<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.780> gave<00:03:15.960> him<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.170> 72<00:03:17.990> because<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.470> don't

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
but I gave him a 72 because it I don't

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.699 
but I gave him a 72 because it I don't
know<00:03:20.280> since<00:03:20.730> ball<00:03:21.270> handling<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.870> good<00:03:22.260> not

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
know since ball handling is good not

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.060 
know since ball handling is good not
super<00:03:23.070> great<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.930> was<00:03:25.170> weird<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.800> he's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
super great it was weird it's like he's

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.699 
super great it was weird it's like he's
good<00:03:26.400> at<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:27.209> about<00:03:27.420> everything<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.590> I'm

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
good at just about everything but I'm

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.710 
good at just about everything but I'm
not<00:03:28.860> sure<00:03:28.890> he's<00:03:29.220> great<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.790> anything<00:03:30.030> outside

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
not sure he's great in anything outside

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.000 
not sure he's great in anything outside
of<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.220> defensive<00:03:32.640> side<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.970> ball<00:03:33.030> so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
of on the defensive side of the ball so

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.890 
of on the defensive side of the ball so
we'll<00:03:35.010> see<00:03:35.250> but<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> said<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.390> hooked

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
we'll see but the like I said I hooked

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.199 
we'll see but the like I said I hooked
him<00:03:36.990> up<00:03:37.110> on<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.290> potential<00:03:37.650> gave<00:03:38.340> him<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.610> 72

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
him up on the potential gave him a 72

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.960 
him up on the potential gave him a 72
overall<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.740> render<00:03:41.580> came<00:03:41.790> out

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
overall I think the render came out

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.229 
overall I think the render came out
pretty<00:03:42.120> good<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.500> that's<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.910> let's<00:03:44.910> move<00:03:45.060> on

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239
