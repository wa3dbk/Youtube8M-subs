00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680 
able to get something done really
quickly<00:00:47.550> let's<00:00:47.940> say<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> deadline<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
quickly let's say you have a deadline of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
quickly let's say you have a deadline of
just<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.110> few<00:00:49.289> days<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> piece<00:00:50.670> together

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
just a few days to get a piece together

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
just a few days to get a piece together
for<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> producer<00:00:51.600> well<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.440> where<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
for a producer well that's where the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
for a producer well that's where the
instant<00:00:53.039> orchestra<00:00:53.460> comes<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.390> grab

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
instant orchestra comes in you just grab

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510 
instant orchestra comes in you just grab
easy<00:00:54.870> string<00:00:55.379> patches<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.980> are<00:00:56.100> mapped<00:00:56.280> all

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
easy string patches that are mapped all

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.580 
easy string patches that are mapped all
the<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.699> across<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.270> keyboard<00:00:57.510> such<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the way across the keyboard such as this

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:14.130 
the way across the keyboard such as this
patch

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.180 

and<00:01:15.140> again<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.470> comes<00:01:15.620> with<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.860> lot<00:01:16.100> of

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
and again it comes with a lot of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.830 
and again it comes with a lot of
different<00:01:16.460> articulations<00:01:16.910> anywhere<00:01:17.660> from

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
different articulations anywhere from

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.900 
different articulations anywhere from
harmonics<00:01:18.500> :<00:01:19.010> yo<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.250> name<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.730> they're

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
harmonics : yo you name it they're

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.120 
harmonics : yo you name it they're
probably<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:20.660> there<00:01:20.930> another<00:01:21.830> thing<00:01:21.980> about

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
probably in there another thing about

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.280 
probably in there another thing about
the<00:01:22.340> library<00:01:22.730> it<00:01:22.880> has<00:01:23.000> big<00:01:23.270> brass<00:01:23.630> sounds<00:01:24.200> they

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
the library it has big brass sounds they

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.710 
the library it has big brass sounds they
could<00:01:24.470> just<00:01:24.680> grab<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.280> play<00:01:25.520> woodwinds<00:01:26.240> and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
could just grab and play woodwinds and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.510 
could just grab and play woodwinds and
even<00:01:27.350> mixtures<00:01:27.800> of<00:01:27.950> all<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.190> different

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
even mixtures of all the different

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.760 
even mixtures of all the different
instruments<00:01:28.610> has<00:01:29.090> got<00:01:29.270> strings<00:01:29.750> brass<00:01:30.260> and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
instruments has got strings brass and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.290 
instruments has got strings brass and
woodwinds<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.790> could<00:01:31.940> put<00:01:32.090> them<00:01:32.210> all

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
woodwinds you could put them all

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.790 
woodwinds you could put them all
together<00:01:32.450> at<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.870> same<00:01:33.050> time<00:01:33.320> we're<00:01:33.590> throwing

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
together at the same time we're throwing

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.400 
together at the same time we're throwing
a<00:01:33.950> choir<00:01:34.250> it's<00:01:34.850> all<00:01:35.090> designed<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.660> do<00:01:35.810> that

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
and go and that's the main feature of

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.070 
and go and that's the main feature of
the<00:01:42.440> library<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:42.920> just<00:01:43.100> fast<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.120> quick<00:01:44.390> can

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
the library it's just fast and quick can

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.630 
the library it's just fast and quick can
we<00:01:45.170> hear<00:01:45.320> one<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.500> these<00:01:45.619> multi<00:01:46.009> section

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
pencil tool exactly here's a little demo

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.020 
pencil tool exactly here's a little demo
here<00:04:19.570> this<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.229> sequenced<00:04:20.829> with<00:04:21.639> one<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
here this is sequenced with one of the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:52.480 
here this is sequenced with one of the
ensembles

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.660 

about<00:04:53.490> 16<00:04:54.210> instruments<00:04:54.900> 16<00:04:55.650> no<00:04:56.190> it's<00:04:56.340> just<00:04:56.520> one

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
about 16 instruments 16 no it's just one

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.330 
about 16 instruments 16 no it's just one
very<00:04:57.090> nice<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.630> mean<00:04:57.780> sounds<00:04:58.290> like<00:04:58.980> an<00:04:59.100> Argus

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
very nice I mean sounds like an Argus

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.750 
very nice I mean sounds like an Argus
root<00:05:01.220> cross<00:05:02.220> cross<00:05:02.430> platform<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:04.700> so<00:05:05.700> it

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
root cross cross platform and so it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.150 
root cross cross platform and so it
works<00:05:05.910> in<00:05:06.090> your<00:05:06.120> dog<00:05:06.480> toys

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
works in your dog toys

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.830 
works in your dog toys
exactly<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:08.940> we<00:05:09.120> can<00:05:09.240> get<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.420> for<00:05:09.540> how<00:05:09.660> much

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
exactly and we can get it for how much
