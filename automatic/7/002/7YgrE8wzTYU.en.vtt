00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 very good to all here sites 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.580
 commenting and in this video I want 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.290
 answer all your doubts all that I 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.400
 they have asked in the comments 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.830
 in general not so good let's see 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.020
 I have been asked to upload to my folder 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 motorcycles in which I have same of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 minecraft because some people will have 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.050
 the interaction worked and well so 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.330
 that I'm going to leave good that bring 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.340
 my folder the folder that I'm going to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.400
 leave as I have come here because rap 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 I do it so good, it brings the code that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.320
 we are going to use now, I will soon 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.280
 I'm going to apply how to install all of you 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 they are simply going to have to follow the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 good video steps 3 mi folder 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.079
 modes with minimal king of my two rivers 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 galactic craft too many temps and the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.690
 folder versions that is where they are 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.690
 installed and good optifast 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.230
 but 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.230
 kane 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.969
 I did not know what to say 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.969
 what was he going to say 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.299
 good so what we will do will 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.580
 be to follow the installation that I left in 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.860
 this video to install the files 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.540
 that I left here and to make it work 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.850
 exactly how they should work 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.009
 also the other doubt that I will answer 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.229
 is that someone missed the sound of 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.740
 done I do not know why it can be but 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.740
 try installing this and I calculate that you 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.659
 may serve and the following if you can 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.789
 play online I answer tomÃ¡s yes 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.920
 because in fact I can play online 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.530
 because I've tried servers 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.080
 I'm going to show you but first we're going to 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.049
 see how the following is installed 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.369
 the most important thing of the good video we go 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.369
 let's see we 're going to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.630
 percent percentage data percentage and you 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.149
 we give center now 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.799
 we wrote we entered the point folder 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.850
 minecraft sorry and we erase our 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:05.050
 version folder and modes we delete it 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.780
 let's go where I have we copy this 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.840
 and we paste it in the point folder 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.490
 minecraft ready ready now we can already 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.280
 close now the next thing is to open 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.000
 our minecraft launcher 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 we follow 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.050
 let's first save the profiles that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.000
 I had this before 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.500
 and this if you do not have others 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.300
 profiles in our lack to do this 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.430
 but if they have others if they want 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.410
 keep it there's no problem 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.230
 Now let's profile to create a 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.880
 profile a new profile sorry and I in 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.250
 this case I will put profile as 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.030
 you can put whatever you want 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 they want good and now what are we to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.940
 do in their versions let's change 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:54.190
 newsletters version put by kings 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.030
 relais 1.6 point 2 fox 9.10 point zero 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.030
 800 point 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.590
 we just have to change three things 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.840
 missing one that is the next as you see 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.000
 there is a text file called code 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.890
 what is this that we are going to use here 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.480
 we copy from here for everything that 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.660
 we left the space that is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.110
 fundamental now 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:21.520
 what we click to the last where 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.070
 is the g and we copy then it's not going to 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.460
 to be this way not this space that we have left 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.440
 this walk there is fundamental or 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.810
 make sure it's been like that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.750
 how good we give to be profile as 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.390
 come we change only three things here 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.460
 we choose our profile we put our 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.430
 user I do not know why some have 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.250
 said that you see password here 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.830
 I know what can be 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.600
 because it has not happened to me and how it did not happen to me 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.730
 I can not, I did not have the opportunity to 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.530
 look for a solution dried me what can 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.350
 be the solution because it does not happen to me and 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.630
 I have a way of knowing it so good 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.670
 we give play as he will start us 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.580
 load this as we always give to play 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.810
 off line to start loading everything 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.480
 Well sure you're going to delay 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.370
 little more to install and the reason for 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.990
 that is, you have to go down 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.840
 all configurations because it 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.390
 they go down alone so I do not know why 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.510
 they opened two minecraft 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.430
 it does not matter we're going to close one 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.690
 this code we can close it from 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.690
 made him do this too 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.480
 and I'll be the two of you that boludo we're going to give you 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.480
 play off line back 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.260
 single 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.030
 this is all because I'm going to upload the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.889
 moss folder to leave it in the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.310
 description 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.930
 and as you see here I charge as they see 15 8 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.270
 charged means we have 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.600
 loaded all and active means that 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.060
 we have installed ppd and find 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.000
 and as you can see here is that if 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.110
 worked and fine in fact I have left 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.870
 the configuration by the versions 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.390
 previous this version of optimal in the 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.450
 last one that came out the standard but the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.870
 last one that came out or is it just came out today 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.850
 19 good let's create let's go into 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.040
 any world in this case between 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.190
 this high we give him yes I do not know why 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.190
 is 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.900
 As you can see, we are inside the world 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.699
 we can walk do everything 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.409
 we always do in fact to me a 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.009
 little the guide because I'm recording and 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.619
 all that 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.669
 but how do you see if I take things away and 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:41.669
 it makes sound 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.270
 when putting blocks it also makes sound and 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.650
 I calculate that all the other sounds do not 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.669
 they will work 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.530
 well another one of his questions was if 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.139
 you can play online good look 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.880
 any server and in this case 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:06.180
 I found this and how do I come in if I 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.590
 entered the server, so I do not think 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.310
 there may be some problem 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.740
 then that has been all I can already 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.450
 disconnect and as you see the two doubts that 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.880
 you say I think it works for me if I 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.280
 they work so I do not have 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.230
 way to solve your problem because 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.660
 I do not know how to do it so it does not work for me 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.390
 yes at least it could be that not the 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.990
 officials would already know the solution well 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.700
 that good 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.700
 let's do it here we're going to do it 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:40.599
 As you can see there is no problem, I hope 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:43.599
 that you really liked if you 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:46.150
 He served as the sign is like going to 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.659
 come more videos and see you in the 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.659
 next
