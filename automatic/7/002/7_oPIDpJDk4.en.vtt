00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.669
 Haydn tea or subtitles

 Do you enjoy summer vacation or I work 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.560
 That's right-I think there are still more people working like me 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.590
 But there is another one needle, and the bon vacation rest sea ​​mountain river 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.650

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.580
 This is the product I want to bring to such a vacation 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:43.350
 Bluetooth speaker provided by a large manufacturer this time m 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.350
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:57.550
 In fact, I opened this already and tried it for a while 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 And if you say the result first, it's really nice. 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.480
 Thank you very much 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:11.650
 It is good enough to finish here, though, but what was wrong with it? 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.650
 I think that I would like to open the product box once again 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.409
 The contents of the box are the instruction cards, etc. 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.610
 3.5 mm aux audio cable body micro usb cable for charging 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.479
 Accessories are more with a strap Yes Yes I will go to the body 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.479
 Elite 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.820
 I will continue to make promises at the best e 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:44.780
 It's be like this Truly small body appearance 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:52.130
 I think I already understand but this is so small 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is a monaural speaker of the body size is 81 × 81 × 46 mm weight is 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.410
 It is 159g and the caravali is already transplanted with this green. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.410
 Orange is prepared 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.369
 Four button Volume General button, and the like to the upper part of the main body 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.700
 There is an earpiece button and a power button. 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:20.090
 Yes this also supports pairing with nfc 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.319
 I see it here, and the skill appropriate mark is also properly attached, so it is waterproof on the left side toward the main unit 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.090
 It will be covered by a cap 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.250
 Such a feeling when opening the lid 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.840
 Since the micro-usb port body battery for charging is when the 1500 mA 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:40.660
 About 3 hours until 12 hours of continuous playback time until full charge 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:45.110
 It's so small but it's tough but this middle part is used for wired connection aux nice 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.310
 And the right end is the reset switch as you just saw 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:53.120
 I'm a waterproof cap I mean this big maker's m 4 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:58.370
 It is a waterproof speaker but it is completely submerged 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 The neighborhood in the such like is not suitable for the body wash is with the bath I'd caution is required 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.490
 If it's about raining when it's about to get in the water and bring it to the outdoors for a while 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.100
 All right 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.730
 This little bit 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.710
 The sense of security is greatly improved just by having waterproof performance 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.710
 Yes then turn on the power 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:21.780
 The power button offers long press and malfunction is also alleviated 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:25.890
 When this led lamp is the red alternating flashing state 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.599
 It is bluetooth pairing mode, but this time it is troublesome nfc 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.380
 I would like to use it 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:35.340
 If you have a smartphone that supports nfc, just hold it over here 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.660
 Press Yes to complete pairing 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.569
 It's pretty easy-it's just handy, but it's usually useful 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.750
 Because it is not a big deal even with bluetooth pairing 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:51.870
 Please rest assured also for ios users Adjust the volume by pressing and holding the volume button 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.330
 You can push back and back by pushing close to you 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:00.910
 And when the receiver button smartphone and pairing state telephone 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.960
 It is equipped with a hands-free function that can be done with this button if it is received Yes Description is 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.820
 Like this 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.810
 The point is that it looks tough and heavy duty waterproof wireless speaker that can be used for a long time 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.220
 is 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:16.049
 Do not you think that you can not expect so much sound when it becomes this small ? 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.780
 In Monet guy you quite spear 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.780
 ni 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.780
 Hmm 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.420
 Hmm 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.620
 of 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.900
 ame 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.000
 Uka 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.620
 me 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.830
 Hmm 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.830
 Yup 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.360
 tan tan 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.710
 Of course I do not seem to let you know, so there is a pretty good sound out there 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.970
 I guess it's not a problem 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.970
 It sounds better than the cheap pc speakers I introduced earlier 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:07.110
 It is tea or subtitles for the first time xperia z 3 use you passed since half a year soon 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:10.619
 I intend to use it carefully, but because I use it for work, it is a car 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.729
 It looks like two more hot youtube like this look 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:18.280
 Sound gap does not feel so much either- this big maker m 4 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:21.639
 Of course it's waterproof outdoors so I can use it in the bath 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.700
 I think I got the death in the kitchen of water work 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.970
 But such places are noisy, though 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.180
 As to be used is that had you ask you now in such 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.660
 I felt that the sound quality was satisfactory enough 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.270
 Absolute speakers may be stereo and not suitable for people 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:43.850
 But it works long time with this size and can be waterproof 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:48.380
 For those who want to watch videos on a tablet in the middle of moving in a daytime car like me who also sounds pretty good 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:55.780
 It is also a speaker I want to recommend by all means m 4 of the large manufacturer introduced this time 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.780
 Today the price at Amazon is as complete as 399 yen now 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:05.950
 As a monaural speaker after this, it is a little expensive 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:09.310
 I think that Cospa is high enough when considered as a waterproof speaker 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.900
 Waterproof bluetooth of big maker that we introduced this time with yes 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.040
 Speaker m 4 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.600

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.440
