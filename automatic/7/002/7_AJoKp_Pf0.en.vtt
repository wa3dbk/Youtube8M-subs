00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.750 
after that we're going to apply the
frosting<00:03:47.109> but<00:03:47.560> before<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.069> do<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.609> is

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
frosting but before we do that it is

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.940 
frosting but before we do that it is
very<00:03:49.090> very<00:03:49.419> important<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.019> we<00:03:50.079> cut<00:03:50.530> off<00:03:50.680> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
very very important that we cut off the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.909 
very very important that we cut off the
cakes<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.730> cake<00:03:52.450> cast<00:03:52.780> will<00:03:53.019> be<00:03:53.049> very<00:03:53.380> flat

cakes that cake cast will be very flat

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.180 
cakes that cake cast will be very flat

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
so that way like layers won't fall

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.430 
so that way like layers won't fall
because<00:03:57.669> we're<00:03:57.970> gonna<00:03:58.120> add<00:03:58.419> like<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.840> couple<00:03:59.380> of
