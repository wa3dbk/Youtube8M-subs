00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
under conservation takes a while if you

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.399 
under conservation takes a while if you
look<00:01:39.700> on<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:39.939> side<00:01:40.179> here<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.929> sort<00:01:41.259> of

look on the side here you can sort of

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.749 
look on the side here you can sort of
see<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.619> it's<00:01:42.249> made<00:01:42.579> up<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:42.999> two<00:01:43.479> sections

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
see that it's made up of two sections

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.309 
see that it's made up of two sections
that<00:01:45.759> are<00:01:45.999> held<00:01:46.479> together<00:01:46.659> by<00:01:46.960> these

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
that are held together by these

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.010 
that are held together by these
alignment<00:01:48.310> pins<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:49.240> are<00:01:49.299> not<00:01:49.509> fastened

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
alignment pins that are not fastened

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.590 
alignment pins that are not fastened
they're<00:01:50.289> just<00:01:50.499> used<00:01:50.770> as<00:01:50.920> guides<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:52.149> it's<00:01:52.450> as

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
they're just used as guides so it's as

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.789 
they're just used as guides so it's as
if<00:01:52.719> this<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.729> an<00:01:54.729> element<00:01:54.999> that<00:01:55.659> required<00:01:56.619> to

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
if this is a an element that required to

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.510 
if this is a an element that required to
be<00:01:56.920> parted<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:58.030> put<00:01:58.509> back<00:01:58.659> together

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
be parted and put back together

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.169 
be parted and put back together
often<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.729> wasn't<00:02:00.999> a<00:02:01.060> permanent<00:02:01.659> attachment

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
often it wasn't a permanent attachment

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.819 
often it wasn't a permanent attachment
and<00:02:04.179> then<00:02:04.389> it<00:02:04.719> has<00:02:04.869> little<00:02:05.229> grooves<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.740> the

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
and then it has little grooves on the

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.850 
and then it has little grooves on the
inside<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.850> our<00:02:07.299> idea<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.229> perhaps<00:02:08.590> it

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
inside and our idea is that perhaps it

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.150 
inside and our idea is that perhaps it
is<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.429> coupling<00:02:10.420> device<00:02:10.720> for<00:02:11.110> two<00:02:11.410> sections<00:02:12.010> of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
is a coupling device for two sections of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.480 
is a coupling device for two sections of
pipe<00:02:12.370> perhaps<00:02:13.020> lead<00:02:14.020> pipe<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:15.069> pipe<00:02:15.280> of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
pipe perhaps lead pipe the pipe of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.480 
pipe perhaps lead pipe the pipe of
another<00:02:15.790> type<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> material<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.860> then<00:02:18.340> this

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
another type of material and then this

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.710 
another type of material and then this
would<00:02:18.670> be<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.819> area<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.300> which<00:02:19.450> they<00:02:19.660> were

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
would be the area in which they were

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.649 
would be the area in which they were
joined<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.680> thinking<00:02:20.980> about<00:02:21.069> pipes<00:02:21.520> may<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
joined so thinking about pipes may be a

joined so thinking about pipes may be a
well<00:02:22.959> we<00:02:23.920> know<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.099> they<00:02:24.400> had<00:02:24.640> a
