a<00:01:45.070> lot<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.490> high<00:01:45.820> ground<00:01:46.120> on<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.840> seems

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
a lot of high ground on this it seems

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.930 
a lot of high ground on this it seems
like<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.200> bigger<00:01:47.470> map<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:48.100> very<00:01:48.400> good<00:01:48.700> the

love these bigger maps but also that
have<00:01:53.440> enough<00:01:53.800> playability<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:54.790> them<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:55.450> it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
have enough playability to them that it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.840 
have enough playability to them that it
can<00:01:55.690> still<00:01:55.930> go<00:01:56.230> fast<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:56.800> you<00:01:57.280> can<00:01:57.400> still<00:01:57.610> find

interesting map dynamic with this it has

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.560 
interesting map dynamic with this it has
a<00:02:02.590> water<00:02:02.920> purification<00:02:03.310> system<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:04.090> does<00:02:04.360> in

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
a water purification system that does in

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.960 
a water purification system that does in
fact<00:02:04.600> go<00:02:05.080> offline<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.860> it's<00:02:06.340> almost<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970

trailer<00:03:49.640> here<00:03:50.030> but<00:03:50.630> from<00:03:51.110> what<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.320> looks<00:03:51.350> like

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
trailer here but from what it looks like

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.440 
trailer here but from what it looks like
it's<00:03:51.980> going<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.250> be<00:03:52.400> able<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.790> read<00:03:52.970> Jim<00:03:53.240> its

it's going to be able to read Jim its

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.420 
it's going to be able to read Jim its
power<00:03:53.780> each<00:03:54.110> grapple<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.680> going<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:54.980> drain<00:03:55.280> it

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
power each grapple is going to drain it

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.670 
power each grapple is going to drain it
a<00:03:55.550> bit<00:03:55.910> but<00:03:56.510> there<00:03:56.720> will<00:03:56.930> be<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.140> cool-down<00:03:57.470> time

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
a bit but there will be a cool-down time

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.740 
a bit but there will be a cool-down time
where<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.490> can<00:03:58.670> come<00:03:58.910> back<00:03:59.090> up<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.570> can

where it can come back up and you can
use<00:03:59.990> it<00:04:00.020> again<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.740> it<00:04:00.800> will<00:04:01.010> be<00:04:01.040> reusable<00:04:01.790> so

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
I'll slow it down you can see that it

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.860 
I'll slow it down you can see that it
actually<00:04:51.040> literally<00:04:51.669> blows<00:04:52.090> up<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.510> zombie

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
actually literally blows up the zombie

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.320 
actually literally blows up the zombie
like<00:04:53.440> he's<00:04:53.620> going<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.979> explode<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:55.180> next

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
like he's going to explode so the next

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.210 
like he's going to explode so the next
thing<00:04:55.449> here<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.169> warbird<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.860> seems<00:04:57.100> you

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
thing here is the warbird it seems you

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.700 
thing here is the warbird it seems you
can<00:04:57.370> actually<00:04:57.610> grapple<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:59.320> leads<00:04:59.530> me<00:04:59.590> to

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
can actually grapple on that leads me to

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.379 
can actually grapple on that leads me to
believe<00:04:59.770> that<00:04:59.919> we<00:05:00.130> may<00:05:00.430> actually<00:05:00.639> see<00:05:01.060> an<00:05:01.150> out

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
believe that we may actually see an out

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.780 
believe that we may actually see an out
to<00:05:01.720> this<00:05:01.840> chapter<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.410> EXO<00:05:03.070> zombies<00:05:03.100> where<00:05:03.699> if

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
to this chapter of EXO zombies where if

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.100 
to this chapter of EXO zombies where if
you<00:05:03.880> do<00:05:04.060> complete<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.479> Easter<00:05:04.750> egg<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.990> can

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
you do complete the Easter egg you can

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.170 
you do complete the Easter egg you can
actually<00:05:05.470> end<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.800> game<00:05:06.010> rather<00:05:06.699> than<00:05:06.850> just

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
actually end the game rather than just

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.330 
actually end the game rather than just
have<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.540> warbird<00:05:07.930> crash<00:05:08.350> land<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:09.040> we<00:05:09.190> did

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
have the warbird crash land like we did

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.100 
have the warbird crash land like we did
in<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.580> first<00:05:09.850> chapter<00:05:10.120> but<00:05:10.960> that's

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
in the first chapter but that's

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.480 
in the first chapter but that's
something<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:11.410> time<00:05:11.680> would<00:05:11.830> sell<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.280> we'll

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
something that time would sell and we'll

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.490 
something that time would sell and we'll
probably<00:05:12.760> know<00:05:13.030> about<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.389> day<00:05:13.720> after<00:05:14.229> the

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
probably know about a day after the

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.800 
probably know about a day after the
actual<00:05:14.919> DLC<00:05:15.370> drops<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:16.270> next<00:05:16.449> thing<00:05:16.600> being

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
actual DLC drops the next thing being

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.840 
actual DLC drops the next thing being
here<00:05:17.110> at<00:05:17.169> lead<00:05:17.290> toxic<00:05:17.800> gas<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:18.400> seems<00:05:18.669> like

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
here at lead toxic gas it seems like

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.430 
here at lead toxic gas it seems like
there<00:05:19.090> will<00:05:19.210> be<00:05:19.360> one<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.870> those<00:05:19.960> rounds

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
there will be one of those rounds

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.010 
there will be one of those rounds
similar<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.310> our<00:05:21.520> infected<00:05:21.850> or<00:05:22.120> dogs<00:05:22.510> rounds

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
similar to our infected or dogs rounds

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.930 
similar to our infected or dogs rounds
in<00:05:23.110> which<00:05:23.560> just<00:05:23.919> gas<00:05:24.130> spews<00:05:24.610> out<00:05:24.760> from

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
in which just gas spews out from

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.580 
in which just gas spews out from
everywhere<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.539> probably<00:05:26.020> does<00:05:26.199> a<00:05:26.260> lot<00:05:26.530> of

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
everywhere and probably does a lot of

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.740 
everywhere and probably does a lot of
damage<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:27.070> you<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.850> last<00:05:28.120> thing<00:05:28.300> here

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
damage to you so the last thing here

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.909 
damage to you so the last thing here
that<00:05:28.870> we're<00:05:28.990> going<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.139> talk<00:05:29.320> about<00:05:29.470> part<00:05:29.830> of

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
that we're going to talk about part of

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.189

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.650 
seems to be the boss of the level so I'm
not<00:05:39.789> sure<00:05:39.850> if<00:05:40.090> it's<00:05:40.180> going<00:05:40.360> to<00:05:40.449> be<00:05:40.510> anything

not sure if it's going to be anything

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.480 
not sure if it's going to be anything
