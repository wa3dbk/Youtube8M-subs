00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
like to explain to you how to set up and

like to explain to you how to set up and
use<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.910> Sun<00:00:06.299> Oven<00:00:06.560> when<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.620> Sun<00:00:07.830> Oven<00:00:08.010> arrives

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
use a Sun Oven when the Sun Oven arrives

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.860 
use a Sun Oven when the Sun Oven arrives
it<00:00:08.639> will<00:00:08.670> come<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.120> box<00:00:09.269> with<00:00:09.690> packing

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
it will come in a box with packing

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.930 
it will come in a box with packing
material<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.860> course<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> first<00:00:11.460> step<00:00:11.580> is

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
material and of course the first step is

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.670 
material and of course the first step is
to<00:00:12.269> remove<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.740> box

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
when you remove it from the box you just

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.880 
when you remove it from the box you just
want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.539> open<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.519> and<00:00:23.519> initially<00:00:24.150> take
