00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
they smell them is because they are

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.970 
they smell them is because they are
picked<00:00:46.210> fresh<00:00:46.690> either<00:00:47.140> that<00:00:47.320> morning<00:00:47.710> or<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.060 
you're getting in the grocery stores so
I<00:00:52.329> think<00:00:52.539> it's<00:00:52.629> funny<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:52.960> I'm<00:00:53.199> asked<00:00:53.559> what

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
I think it's funny that I'm asked what

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.130 
I think it's funny that I'm asked what
my<00:00:54.219> favorites<00:00:54.609> are<00:00:54.789> because<00:00:55.210> every<00:00:55.840> single

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.700

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
because our freeze-dried products are

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.760 
because our freeze-dried products are
picked<00:01:02.949> vine<00:01:03.129> ripened<00:01:03.550> then<00:01:04.360> they<00:01:05.320> maintain

their<00:01:05.950> nutrients<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.810> grow<00:01:07.810> all<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.020> my<00:01:08.259> own

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
their nutrients I grow all of my own

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.670 
their nutrients I grow all of my own
stuff<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.979> bought<00:01:09.250> all<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.610> my<00:01:09.820> own<00:01:09.970> stuff<00:01:10.270> but

it's done in raspberry juice to make

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.399 
it's done in raspberry juice to make
them<00:01:24.130> healthier<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:25.210> yet<00:01:25.600> what<00:01:25.840> do<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.020> do<00:01:26.140> to

them healthier and yet what do I do to

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.050 
them healthier and yet what do I do to
this<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.920> give<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.189> shelf<00:01:27.400> life<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.790> have<00:01:27.970> to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
this to give it a shelf life I have to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.120 
this to give it a shelf life I have to
boil<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.509> death<00:01:28.659> so<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.530> nutrients<00:01:29.950> are

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
boil it to death so the nutrients are

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.460 
boil it to death so the nutrients are
depleted<00:01:30.939> if<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.570> cannot<00:01:31.899> grow<00:01:32.140> your<00:01:32.439> own
