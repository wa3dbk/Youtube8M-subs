00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.880
 Hello everyone, today we will prepare holes 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.040
 salty which will also prove to be excellent 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.350
 empty fridge recipe let's see together the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:31.950
 ingredients 220 grams of flour 200 g 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.580
 of diced salami 150 g of 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.239
 scamorza also of diced 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.420
 150 g of Greek yogurt 100 grams of 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:48.120
 milk 15 grams of instant yeast 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:54.200
 for pies 30 g of Parmesan 50 g 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.640
 of seed oil 3 eggs salt and pepper 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.180
 Let's start by opening the eggs I already have 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180
 washed and dried 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.979
 always keep one at hand 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.320
 bowl where you can put the waste 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:22.740
 type english of the eggs but in this 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.740
 in case you start working with a whip 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 now add the oil and the milk 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.759
 now let's pass the yogurt 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.530
 I used Greek yogurt but 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.539
 you can also use simple 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.920
 plain yogurt as long as it is not sweetened 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.380
 if you don't have yogurt you can 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.490
 replace it with 80 grams of milk and 30 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.190
 grams of seed oil now add the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.989
 rain flour and baking powder 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.989
 I've already scoured it before 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.060
 here is the flour 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.200
 and instant yeast 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.690
 now add salt pepper 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.850
 finished preparing the dough 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.300
 add the salami scamorza and of 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.130
 Parmesan I chose salami and 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.200
 cheeses I had in the fridge 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.680
 but if you want you can take a look at 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.190
 your fridge and see what it suggests 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.190
 and a Parmesan 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.120
 this recipe is ideal if you have 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.280
 feel like rustic but you don't have the time 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.860
 to wait for the leaven to rise 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.470
 of beer or that mother in fact col 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.230
 this instant chemical yeast there vi 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.750
 just prepare the dough and do it 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.980
 cook directly in the oven and it is there 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.770
 that will grow 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.620
 now take a kate io mold 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.480
 I took one of 30 centimeters that I already have 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.480
 buttered and pour the mixture 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.760
 level the surface a little with the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.580
 spatula now cook in the oven 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.390
 preheated ventilated at 170 degrees for 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.390
 about 30 minutes 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.579
 this is the freshly baked plumcake and 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.879
 now we let it cool for good 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.739
 before removing it from the mold here is the 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.819
 cooled plumcake which we will now cut 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.879
 affected 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.489
 if you don't have a plumcake mold 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.310
 you can use the same recipe for 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.220
 make savory muffins by cooking them 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.139
 obviously for less time 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.510
 if you prepare one the day before 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.970
 Once cooled, wrap it well 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.410
 in the film and keep it so long 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.410
 the next day so as not to do it 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:38.710
 drying has a scent of brioche that does not 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.710
 I tell you 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.159
 here it is 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.589
 for a vegetarian version as always 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.229
 you can replace the salami with 

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:52.269
 cooked vegetables cut into cubes 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.609
