highly suggest for you guys to find a
silicone<00:01:22.060> one<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.510> just<00:01:22.750> more<00:01:22.810> easier<00:01:23.590> for

silicone one is just more easier for

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
them to be preserved properly so I would

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.580 
them to be preserved properly so I would
definitely<00:01:27.600> also<00:01:28.600> get<00:01:28.930> one<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.260> does<00:01:29.560> have

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
definitely also get one that does have

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.440 
definitely also get one that does have
like<00:01:29.830> a<00:01:29.890> cover<00:01:30.250> just<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:30.909> doesn't<00:01:31.180> get<00:01:31.270> any

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
like a cover just so it doesn't get any

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.930 
like a cover just so it doesn't get any
kind<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.690> frostbite<00:01:32.290> than<00:01:33.159> any<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.820> ice

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940

cubes

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.260 
cubes
so<00:01:34.720> make<00:01:35.650> sure<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.430> can<00:01:36.640> find<00:01:36.970> one<00:01:37.150> that

you<00:03:21.440> smack<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.069> powder<00:03:22.310> use<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.090> bunch<00:03:23.480> of

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
you smack the powder use a bunch of

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.750 
you smack the powder use a bunch of
other<00:03:23.780> kind<00:03:24.049> of<00:03:24.079> superfood<00:03:24.769> super<00:03:25.220> seeds<00:03:25.519> as

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
other kind of superfood super seeds as

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.050 
other kind of superfood super seeds as
well

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
well

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.390 
well
amaranth<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.780> also<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.109> good<00:03:27.290> one<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:28.130> know<00:03:28.280> a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
amaranth is also a good one you know a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.699 
amaranth is also a good one you know a
little<00:03:28.579> bit<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.819> sesame<00:03:29.030> seed<00:03:29.569> as<00:03:29.750> well<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.319> you

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
little bit of sesame seed as well so you

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.280 
little bit of sesame seed as well so you
can<00:03:30.859> really<00:03:31.190> vary<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.579> flavors<00:03:32.030> too<00:03:32.359> so<00:03:33.109> it'll

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
can really vary the flavors too so it'll

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.720 
can really vary the flavors too so it'll
look<00:03:33.440> something<00:03:33.500> like<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:34.069> once<00:03:34.310> everything

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
look something like this once everything

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.520 
look something like this once everything
is<00:03:34.849> done<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.780> adds<00:03:36.109> has<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.410> look

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
is done and that adds has to look

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.190 
is done and that adds has to look
perfect<00:03:36.590> for<00:03:37.370> anything<00:03:37.609> it's<00:03:38.540> really<00:03:39.019> quick

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
perfect for anything it's really quick

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.500 
perfect for anything it's really quick
and<00:03:39.410> simple<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.829> do<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.340> now<00:03:41.180> we're<00:03:41.239> going<00:03:41.450> to

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
and simple to do and now we're going to

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.900 
and simple to do and now we're going to
be<00:03:41.599> using<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.260> buttery<00:03:42.530> spread<00:03:42.819> that<00:03:43.819> I'm

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
be using the buttery spread that I'm

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.909 
be using the buttery spread that I'm
using<00:03:44.090> here<00:03:44.269> butter<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.260> I'm<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.650> going<00:03:45.829> to

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
using here butter and I'm just going to

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.039 
using here butter and I'm just going to
melt<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.849> little<00:03:47.150> bit<00:03:47.419> I<00:03:47.450> don't<00:03:47.569> want<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:47.900> to

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
melt it a little bit I don't want it to

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.500 
melt it a little bit I don't want it to
be<00:03:48.169> very<00:03:48.620> very<00:03:48.919> hot<00:03:49.280> at<00:03:49.459> all<00:03:49.669> because<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.359> don't

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
be very very hot at all because I don't

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.199 
be very very hot at all because I don't
want<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.720> cook<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.260> basil<00:03:51.709> once<00:03:52.400> I'm<00:03:52.609> topping

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
want to cook the basil once I'm topping

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.420 
want to cook the basil once I'm topping
this<00:03:53.389> up<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.900> just<00:03:54.079> want<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.319> make<00:03:54.440> it<00:03:54.470> just<00:03:55.340> a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
this up I just want to make it just a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.629 
this up I just want to make it just a
little<00:03:55.609> bit<00:03:56.090> above<00:03:56.870> room<00:03:57.109> temperature<00:03:57.489> so<00:03:58.489> now

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
little bit above room temperature so now

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.150 
little bit above room temperature so now
I<00:03:58.669> have<00:03:58.970> all<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.269> my<00:03:59.389> basil<00:03:59.900> here<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.470> again

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
I have all of my basil here and again

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.470 
I have all of my basil here and again
I'm<00:04:01.250> gonna<00:04:01.370> do<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.700> same<00:04:01.880> thing<00:04:01.940> as<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.359> was

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
I'm gonna do the same thing as I was

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.759 
I'm gonna do the same thing as I was
doing<00:04:02.599> with<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.840> parse<00:04:03.139> it<00:04:03.349> just<00:04:03.560> chop<00:04:03.739> it

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
doing with the parse it just chop it

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.250 
doing with the parse it just chop it
finely<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.760> add<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.389> our<00:04:05.540> little<00:04:05.660> ice<00:04:05.900> cube

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
finely and add it to our little ice cube

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.349 
finely and add it to our little ice cube
trays<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.889> then<00:04:07.370> after<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.880> we're<00:04:08.120> going<00:04:08.209> to

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
trays and then after that we're going to

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.479 
trays and then after that we're going to
start<00:04:08.660> pouring<00:04:08.959> in<00:04:09.319> our<00:04:09.530> little<00:04:09.799> buttery

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
start pouring in our little buttery

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.530 
start pouring in our little buttery
spread

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.509 

and<00:04:16.540> one<00:04:17.200> of<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.440> reasons<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:17.859> suggest<00:04:18.340> a

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
and one of the reasons I suggest a

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.210 
and one of the reasons I suggest a
silicon<00:04:19.209> if<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:19.630> can't<00:04:19.959> find<00:04:20.350> one<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.650> silicon

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
silicon if you can't find one a silicon

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.460 
silicon if you can't find one a silicon
on<00:04:21.489> ice<00:04:21.730> couch<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.210> it's<00:04:22.780> just<00:04:22.840> it's<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.200> little

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
on ice couch a it's just it's a little

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.290 
on ice couch a it's just it's a little
bit<00:04:23.620> more<00:04:23.770> smoother<00:04:24.370> especially<00:04:24.940> for<00:04:25.180> those

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
bit more smoother especially for those

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.020 
bit more smoother especially for those
buttery<00:04:26.020> ones<00:04:26.350> who<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:27.370> off<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.730> tray

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
buttery ones who get off the tray

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.790 
buttery ones who get off the tray
especially<00:04:28.990> you're<00:04:29.080> not<00:04:29.229> using<00:04:29.590> something

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
especially you're not using something

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.460 
especially you're not using something
that<00:04:30.100> it's<00:04:30.250> super<00:04:30.700> fatty<00:04:31.660> such<00:04:31.930> as<00:04:32.110> butter

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
that it's super fatty such as butter

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.440 
that it's super fatty such as butter
because<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.669> one's<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:34.060> little<00:04:34.150> bit<00:04:34.419> more

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
because this one's a little bit more

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.040 
because this one's a little bit more
plant-based<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.560> it's<00:04:36.930> definitely<00:04:37.930> much

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
plant-based so it's definitely much

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.379 
plant-based so it's definitely much
easier<00:04:38.500> with<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.800> silicon<00:04:39.220> one<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:40.210> up<00:04:40.360> next

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
easier with this silicon one so up next

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.060 
easier with this silicon one so up next
we're<00:04:40.780> gonna<00:04:40.840> make<00:04:41.020> our<00:04:41.200> broth<00:04:41.410> ones<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.950> this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
we're gonna make our broth ones and this

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.890 
we're gonna make our broth ones and this
one's<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.340> really<00:04:42.700> fun<00:04:42.940> one<00:04:43.120> because<00:04:43.330> all<00:04:43.780> you

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
one's a really fun one because all you

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.060 
one's a really fun one because all you
do<00:04:44.080> is<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.260> add<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:44.380> little<00:04:44.530> bit<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.740> oil<00:04:44.889> just

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
do is you add a little bit of oil just

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.820 
do is you add a little bit of oil just
so<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.970> know<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:46.120> can<00:04:46.479> also<00:04:46.630> save<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.620> lot<00:04:47.800> of

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
so you know you can also save a lot of

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.409 
so you know you can also save a lot of
time<00:04:48.130> when<00:04:48.340> preparing<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.880> soup<00:04:49.120> you'll<00:04:49.300> have

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
time when preparing a soup you'll have

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.670 
time when preparing a soup you'll have
to<00:04:49.479> take<00:04:49.660> out<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.900> oil<00:04:49.960> or<00:04:50.290> anything<00:04:50.470> like

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
to take out the oil or anything like

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.770 
to take out the oil or anything like
that<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.550> mix<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:51.820> with<00:04:51.850> just<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.389> little<00:04:52.419> bit

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
that you mix it with just a little bit

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.480 
that you mix it with just a little bit
of<00:04:52.990> broth<00:04:53.200> now<00:04:53.590> if<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.800> want<00:04:53.979> to<00:04:54.070> stretch<00:04:54.280> your

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
of broth now if you want to stretch your

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.550 
of broth now if you want to stretch your
money<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.700> lot<00:04:54.940> more<00:04:55.180> you'd<00:04:55.840> actually<00:04:56.020> Findus

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
money a lot more you'd actually Findus

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.170 
money a lot more you'd actually Findus
out<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.950> add<00:04:57.070> a<00:04:57.100> little<00:04:57.280> bit<00:04:57.370> more<00:04:57.460> water<00:04:57.850> and

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
out and add a little bit more water and
