The square alternator involves switching back and forth between a square stitch and a circle

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:09.055
stitch. So before watching this video,

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:16.051
you should have already have done a square stitch lanyard and a circle stitch lanyard.

00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:20.091
So after doing a starting square stitch,

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:50.002
we'll do a circle stitch.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:01:18.052
Then we'll do a square stitch.

00:01:18.052 --> 00:02:13.045
Then we'll do another circle stitch,

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:26.008
followed by another square stitch.

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:35.047
You'll just keep switching back and forth between the square and circle stitches until you're

00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:38.003
ready to finish with the finishing square stitch.
