how<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.460> through<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> bright<00:00:36.059> spark

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
how to get one is through a bright spark

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.280 
how to get one is through a bright spark
you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:36.960> free<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.230> your

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you can get it for free for your

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.080 
you can get it for free for your
students<00:00:37.710> other<00:00:37.890> than<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.610> tough<00:00:38.850> luck

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
students other than that tough luck

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.400 
students other than that tough luck
because<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.629> difficult<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> one

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
because it's really difficult to get one

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
because it's really difficult to get one
so<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> only<00:00:41.670> legal<00:00:42.090> way

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
so this is actually the only legal way

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119 
so this is actually the only legal way
to<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.690> I'll<00:00:43.079> fold<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> only<00:00:43.980> other

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to do it and I'll fold the only other

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
to do it and I'll fold the only other
way<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.940> basically<00:00:45.300> you're<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> need<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
way so basically you're going to need a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.190 
way so basically you're going to need a
Windows<00:00:46.379> Phone<00:00:46.410> 8<00:00:46.680> device<00:00:47.210> ok<00:00:48.210> now<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> can

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
Windows Phone 8 device ok now you can

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
Windows Phone 8 device ok now you can
also<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.770> technique<00:00:49.950> usually<00:00:50.280> works<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.700> -1

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
also this technique usually works for -1

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.619 
also this technique usually works for -1
7<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.360> well

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
7 as well

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.740 
7 as well
a<00:00:51.660> USB<00:00:52.140> cable<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.329> micro

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
a USB cable and you need to have a micro

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.500 
a USB cable and you need to have a micro
sim<00:00:54.960> inside<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.710> phone<00:00:56.340> device<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> sim

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
sim inside your phone device so a sim

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.200 
sim inside your phone device so a sim
inside<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.680> you're<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.090> to

focus you have application deployment

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.330 
focus you have application deployment
once<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.830> run<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:15.830> you're<00:04:16.830> going<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.040> have<00:04:17.220> the

don't<00:05:10.850> worry<00:05:10.970> about<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.750> most<00:05:11.930> difficult

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
don't worry about it the most difficult

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.629 
don't worry about it the most difficult
part<00:05:12.440> is<00:05:12.590> getting<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.919> DreamSpark<00:05:13.400> account

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
part is getting the DreamSpark account

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.010 
part is getting the DreamSpark account
which<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:13.940> a<00:05:13.970> bit<00:05:14.120> difficult<00:05:14.270> but<00:05:14.660> hopefully

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
which is a bit difficult but hopefully

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.330
