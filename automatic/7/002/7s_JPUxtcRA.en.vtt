00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
you can hear as ik just come through
what<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.439> effectively<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.040> double<00:01:56.430> marathon

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
what is effectively a double marathon

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.719 
what is effectively a double marathon
and<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.990> under<00:01:58.350> 10<00:01:58.619> hours<00:01:58.920> give<00:01:59.610> us

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and I think just under 10 hours give us

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.849 
and I think just under 10 hours give us
an<00:01:59.820> idea<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.630> how<00:02:00.689> tough<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.170> was

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.910 

it<00:02:04.859> was<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.179> it<00:02:06.179> started<00:02:06.359> off<00:02:06.749> okay<00:02:07.140> except<00:02:07.859> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it was a it started off okay except that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.119 
it was a it started off okay except that
we<00:02:08.099> had<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> start<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.140> later<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.890> first

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
we had to start and later on the first

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.490 
we had to start and later on the first
50<00:02:11.750> 50<00:02:12.750> runners<00:02:14.420> started<00:02:15.420> at<00:02:15.569> midday<00:02:15.780> who<00:02:16.260> just

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
50 50 runners started at midday who just

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.740 
50 50 runners started at midday who just
under<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.580> started<00:02:17.910> off<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.269> searing

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
under so we started off in the searing

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.660 
under so we started off in the searing
heat<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.349> aim<00:02:19.470> was<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.040> keep<00:02:20.519> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
heat so the aim was just to keep the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.080 
heat so the aim was just to keep the
pace<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.769> steady<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.459> then<00:02:23.610> hopefully

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
pace you know steady and then hopefully

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.270 
pace you know steady and then hopefully
as<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.299> day<00:02:24.450> goes<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.080> pick<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.379> up<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.830> it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
as the day goes on to pick it up but it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.960 
as the day goes on to pick it up but it
was<00:02:26.459> quite<00:02:26.760> relentless<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:27.870> was<00:02:27.959> no<00:02:28.140> breeze

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
was quite relentless there was no breeze

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.330 
was quite relentless there was no breeze
and<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.319> don't<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.680> don't<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.190> much

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
