00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.780 
same unit you'll find in the new clean
19<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> maybe<00:01:40.260> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:40.890> me<00:01:41.550> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
19 but here and maybe this is just me it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.520 
19 but here and maybe this is just me it
does<00:01:42.150> feel<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.510> little<00:01:42.630> smoother<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
does feel a little smoother and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
does feel a little smoother and
definitely<00:01:44.010> sounds<00:01:44.520> better<00:01:44.810> 0<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> 60<00:01:46.320> in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
definitely sounds better 0 to 60 in

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.680 
definitely sounds better 0 to 60 in
about<00:01:46.470> three<00:01:46.860> seconds<00:01:47.369> sure<00:01:47.790> no<00:01:48.060> problem

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
about three seconds sure no problem

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.540 
about three seconds sure no problem
and<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> 390<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.800> do<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.130> second<00:01:50.520> gear

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
and the 390 will do it in second gear

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.460 
and the 390 will do it in second gear
without<00:01:50.880> sounding<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.840> entire<00:01:52.170> thing

I to slow down for a corner and that is

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:29.320 
I to slow down for a corner and that is
pretty<00:02:21.690> fast

too fast times when I thought the bike
would<00:03:51.159> actually<00:03:51.610> go<00:03:51.819> down<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.810> rc390

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
would actually go down so the rc390

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.890 
would actually go down so the rc390
didn't<00:03:54.129> fail<00:03:54.400> me<00:03:54.430> like<00:03:55.090> they<00:03:55.239> say<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:55.659> more

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
didn't fail me like they say it's more
