00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
marble at the screen we see a pattern on

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:32.930 
marble at the screen we see a pattern on
the<00:00:31.079> back<00:00:31.259> wall<00:00:31.559> where<00:00:32.189> they<00:00:32.399> went<00:00:32.610> through

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the back wall where they went through

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.580 
the back wall where they went through
the<00:00:33.120> slit<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.600> hit<00:00:34.550> now<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.630> add<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> second

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the slit and hit now if we add a second

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.610 
the slit and hit now if we add a second
slit<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.850> would<00:00:39.000> expect<00:00:39.359> to<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.539> a<00:00:40.019> second

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

band<00:00:41.120> duplicated<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> right<00:00:44.780> now<00:00:45.890> let's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
band duplicated to the right now let's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.069 
band duplicated to the right now let's
look<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.309> waves<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.350> waves<00:00:49.649> hit<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.460> slit<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
look at waves the waves hit the slit and

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.220 
look at waves the waves hit the slit and
radiate<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.550> striking<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.910> wall<00:00:54.269> with

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
radiate out striking the back wall with

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.130 
radiate out striking the back wall with
the<00:00:55.289> most<00:00:55.550> intensity<00:00:56.550> directly<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.690> line<00:00:57.749> with

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the most intensity directly in line with

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.729 
the most intensity directly in line with
the<00:00:58.949> slit<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> line<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.899> brightness<00:01:01.409> on<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the slit the line of brightness on the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.690 
the slit the line of brightness on the
back<00:01:02.190> screen<00:01:02.550> shows<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.749> intensity<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
back screen shows that intensity this is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.399 
back screen shows that intensity this is
similar<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> line<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.380> marbles<00:01:07.830> make<00:01:08.090> but

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
similar to the line the marbles make but

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.330 
similar to the line the marbles make but
when<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.710> add<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.579> second<00:01:12.119> slit<00:01:13.340> something

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
when we add the second slit something

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.719 
when we add the second slit something
different<00:01:14.909> happens<00:01:15.350> if<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.590> top<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.399> wave

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
different happens if the top of one wave

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.530 
different happens if the top of one wave
meets<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.689> bottom<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> another<00:01:19.860> way<00:01:20.540> they

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
meets the bottom of another way they

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.760 
meets the bottom of another way they
cancel<00:01:22.079> each<00:01:22.200> other<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.630> now<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> an

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
cancel each other out so now there is an

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.330 
cancel each other out so now there is an
interference<00:01:26.520> pattern<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> back<00:01:27.630> wall

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
interference pattern on the back wall

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
interference pattern on the back wall
places<00:01:29.340> where<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> two<00:01:29.909> tops<00:01:30.509> meet<00:01:30.899> are<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
places where the two tops meet are the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.370 
places where the two tops meet are the
highest<00:01:32.040> intensity<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.360> bright<00:01:33.630> lines<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
highest intensity the bright lines and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.639 
highest intensity the bright lines and
where<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.159> cancel<00:01:35.789> there<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.539> nothing<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
where they cancel there is nothing so

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.420 
where they cancel there is nothing so
when<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.759> throw<00:01:39.119> things<00:01:39.719> that<00:01:40.649> is<00:01:40.890> matter

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
when we throw things that is matter

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.010 
when we throw things that is matter
through<00:01:42.360> two<00:01:42.750> slits<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.570> two<00:01:45.570> bands

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
through two slits we get this two bands

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.730 
through two slits we get this two bands
of<00:01:46.380> hits<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.240> with<00:01:48.240> waves<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.590> an

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
of hits and with waves we get an

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.080 
of hits and with waves we get an
interference<00:01:50.280> pattern<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:51.090> many<00:01:51.719> bands<00:01:53.090> good

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
interference pattern of many bands good

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.590 
interference pattern of many bands good
so<00:01:54.539> far<00:01:54.780> now<00:01:55.909> let's<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:57.450> quantum

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.810 

an<00:02:03.600> electron<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:05.100> tiny<00:02:05.760> tiny<00:02:06.420> bit<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:07.050> matter

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
an electron is a tiny tiny bit of matter

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.140 
an electron is a tiny tiny bit of matter
like<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:09.060> tiny<00:02:09.479> marble<00:02:10.370> let's<00:02:11.370> fire<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> stream

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.070 
like a tiny marble let's fire a stream
through<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:12.780> slit<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.850> behaves<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.450> like

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
through one slit it behaves just like

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.930 
through one slit it behaves just like
the<00:02:16.260> marble<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.830> single<00:02:17.640> band<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:19.710> if<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.640> shoot

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
the marble a single band so if we shoot

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.050

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
these tiny bits through two slits we

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.240 
these tiny bits through two slits we
should<00:02:24.390> get<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.680> marbles<00:02:26.130> two<00:02:26.610> bands

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
should get like the marbles two bands

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
what an interference pattern we fired

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.640 
what an interference pattern we fired

electrons tiny bits of matter through

but<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> pattern<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.520> waves<00:02:39.080> not<00:02:40.080> like

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
but we get a pattern like waves not like

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.780 
but we get a pattern like waves not like
little<00:02:40.500> marbles<00:02:41.270> how<00:02:42.980> how<00:02:43.980> could<00:02:44.190> pieces<00:02:44.640> of

little marbles how how could pieces of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.150 
little marbles how how could pieces of
matter<00:02:45.060> create<00:02:46.020> an<00:02:46.200> interference<00:02:46.890> pattern

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
matter create an interference pattern

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
matter create an interference pattern
like<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> wave<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:49.320> doesn't<00:02:50.130> make<00:02:50.400> sense

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
like a wave it doesn't make sense

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.740 
like a wave it doesn't make sense
lot<00:02:52.160> physicists<00:02:53.160> are<00:02:53.280> clever<00:02:53.550> they<00:02:54.420> thought

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
lot physicists are clever they thought

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.590 
lot physicists are clever they thought
maybe<00:02:55.620> those<00:02:56.190> little<00:02:56.580> balls<00:02:56.760> are<00:02:57.120> bouncing

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
maybe those little balls are bouncing

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.160 
maybe those little balls are bouncing
off<00:02:57.750> each<00:02:57.810> other<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.470> creating<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.610> pattern

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
off each other and creating that pattern

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.740 
off each other and creating that pattern
so<00:03:01.170> they<00:03:01.980> decide<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.489> shoot<00:03:03.030> electrons

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
so they decide to shoot electrons
