of<00:02:31.519> them<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.700> use<00:02:31.730> mostly<00:02:32.269> for<00:02:32.510> doing<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
of them we use mostly for doing the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.759 
of them we use mostly for doing the
oilseed<00:02:33.290> rape<00:02:33.500> s--

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
oilseed rape s--

oilseed rape s--
potatoes<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.640> bins<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.269> doesn't<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.870> the

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
potatoes in bins which doesn't have the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.680 
potatoes in bins which doesn't have the
herbicide<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.790> machine<00:02:38.180> here<00:02:38.360> we're

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
herbicide in this machine here we're

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.630 
herbicide in this machine here we're
looking<00:02:38.870> at<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.349> covers<00:02:39.920> mostly<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.459> wheat

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
looking at and covers mostly the wheat

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.690 
looking at and covers mostly the wheat
in<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.090> bottle<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.709> any<00:02:42.709> grass<00:02:43.190> water<00:02:43.459> and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
in the bottle is on any grass water and

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.729 
in the bottle is on any grass water and
it's<00:02:43.790> done<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:44.989> machine<00:02:45.170> here<00:02:45.530> we

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
it's done so in this machine here we

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.009 
it's done so in this machine here we
have<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.489> Norwalk<00:02:46.790> leveling<00:02:47.299> system<00:02:47.690> fitted

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
have the Norwalk leveling system fitted

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.360 
have the Norwalk leveling system fitted
on<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.290> machine<00:02:48.620> which<00:02:48.860> seems<00:02:49.069> to<00:02:49.220> work

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
on this machine which seems to work

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.970 
on this machine which seems to work
really<00:02:49.400> well<00:02:49.700> now<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.349> keeps<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.739> Boomer

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
really well now and it keeps the Boomer

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.190 
really well now and it keeps the Boomer
a<00:02:52.010> nice<00:02:52.280> constant<00:02:52.880> height<00:02:53.060> above<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.569> crop<00:02:53.810> as

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
a nice constant height above the crop as

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.289 
a nice constant height above the crop as
you're<00:02:54.380> working<00:02:54.739> in<00:02:54.950> fields<00:02:55.430> which<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.640> uneven

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
you're working in fields which is uneven

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.660 
you're working in fields which is uneven
the<00:02:57.110> bins<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.470> self<00:02:57.739> travel<00:02:58.190> really<00:02:58.489> well

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the bins of self travel really well

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.880 
the bins of self travel really well
across<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.450> field<00:02:59.780> even<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.140> slight<00:03:00.410> hold<00:03:00.620> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
across the field even a slight hold the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.410 
across the field even a slight hold the
whole<00:03:01.040> thing<00:03:01.250> levels<00:03:01.610> itself<00:03:01.880> out<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.329> it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
whole thing levels itself out and it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.030 
whole thing levels itself out and it
does<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.569> good<00:03:02.780> job<00:03:02.840> we<00:03:03.530> notice<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.829> big

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
does a good job we notice a big

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.069 
does a good job we notice a big
difference<00:03:04.430> with<00:03:05.090> these<00:03:05.299> booms<00:03:05.569> compared<00:03:05.930> the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
difference with these booms compared the

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.280 
difference with these booms compared the
machine<00:03:06.349> we<00:03:06.470> had<00:03:06.560> before<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:08.540> table<00:03:08.870> plus<00:03:09.079> is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
machine we had before this table plus is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.680 
machine we had before this table plus is
really<00:03:09.590> comfortable<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.340> smooth<00:03:10.579> it<00:03:11.000> was

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
really comfortable and smooth it was

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.440 
really comfortable and smooth it was
like<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:11.959> trailer<00:03:12.380> buck<00:03:12.590> rocking<00:03:13.130> an<00:03:13.190> axle<00:03:13.549> and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
like a trailer buck rocking an axle and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.509 
like a trailer buck rocking an axle and
it<00:03:14.989> makes<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.410> whole<00:03:15.590> thing<00:03:15.620> smooth<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.430> it

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
it makes the whole thing smooth and it

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.920 
it makes the whole thing smooth and it
keeps<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.910> booms<00:03:17.090> nice<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.540> level<00:03:17.690> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
keeps the booms nice and level and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:34.660 
keeps the booms nice and level and
smooth<00:03:18.170> at<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.380> same<00:03:18.560> time

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.730
