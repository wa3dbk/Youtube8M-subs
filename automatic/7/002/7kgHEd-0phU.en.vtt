00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.529
 so people welcome to one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.450
 new video because now finally the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.610
 not premium users at least so far 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.710
 I finally know china rising 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.349
 I thought I could play 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.740
 look at the weapon from the dlc before and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.150
 Although the 11 85 2 is definitely good 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 From the thing I have the now 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 Last days actually, mainly 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.880
 I've played a few hundred now 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.859
 cancer with and i have to say that thing 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.689
 is good that thing is a beast and it 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.910
 yes many videos or synonymous 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.320
 many opinions in chat in game became 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.829
 also often liked about ringier 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.450
 aci 23 oberbauer the new m 16 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.980
 and here and there first I hold off 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.399
 this the new in the 16 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.890
 Not much but a weapon 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.219
 the title the new m 16 earned 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.640
 then not the ac 23 but if then 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.860
 the l 85 a2 so here now all 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.760
 polls and rumbles bmw already come like 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 the thing now at all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.820
 unlocks what you actually too 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.030
 relatively easy to look in the battlelog 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 can 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.600
 but many are too lazy for that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.949
 or no idea whatsoever 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.539
 In any case I'll tell you shortly 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.589
 in an asi needs the whole in 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.000
 make a round 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.330
 You have to kill a defibrillator 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.939
 make 1 km m 320 and a child with one 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.250
 gun and then you have the great 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.479
 medal which means fire free or it 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.590
 a medal is not a clue to anyone 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 case gets this fire fridinger 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.780
 and then the weapon gets that way too 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.220
 they said you like it the fastest 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.409
 But the simplest thing is not how it works 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.509
 How best to do it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.880
 First the defibrillator is now 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.350
 not necessarily hard because you think 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.759
 actually relatively easy together 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.170
 get if I will eventually have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.270
 flaps makes the first 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.720
 defibrillator can and then the chamberlain 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.729
 20 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 In any case with the pistol 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.880
 First, the defibrillator because that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 the most difficult first is always one 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.210
 a little bit better and you are seeing here now 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.979
 in the background so a few scenes with 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.530
 the same weapon on one for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.930
 the non premium user new map say 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.090
 I times green summit is called the queen 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.680
 summit and I say that it is so now 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.970
 just a little digressive the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.490
 the best web 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.370
 for me now at least that way 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.440
 Battlefield 4 is a pure one 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.390
 One would like to say that infantry meppen 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.470
 also in conquest and so on is on 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.270
 every case a really cool map man 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.190
 can be really cool infantry action 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.290
 make and that's why I've also 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.970
 Mostly used around their few clips 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.770
 For example , the weapon opens 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.130
 definitely from that had pretty good 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.880
 Fire rate of 835 even higher 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.130
 Fire rate than the aci I just believe 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.990
 700 I look short 770 has the aci 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.640
 a higher firewheel I always thought so 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.200
 the 11880 as the two were battlefield 3 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.060
 that was more of a middle thing now 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.230
 and so a bit with the aok three too 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.860
 compare but here she is really 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.060
 in the front of 800 as I said 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 but is not really shit 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.240
 the main thing the opponents fall to it 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.490
 So my weapons tip of the week or 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.040
 of the month and or my weapons tip 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.590
 the DLC or just generally my 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.300
 Weapons tip to you try this weapon 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.060
 out play with it you become 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.820
 Remember the thing is a damn reads 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.180
 and as I said when a weapon is the title 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:08.610
 the new m 16 earned then it is 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.500
 the l 85 2 yes there are definitely 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.060
 something else to say about the weapon and that 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.709
 even something pretty important is so 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.530
 I think many probably wtf 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.459
 but why many also confirm this 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.320
 I mean that often times 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.489
 addressed the feeling and what 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.200
 you have it with your weapon 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.030
 played as it sounds like the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.830
 feels like when you shoot with it and 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.090
 also as she reloads and has the eleventh 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.980
 yes, two has exactly as in 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.470
 Battlefield 3 also reload this horny 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.080
 Wise that you think you hold it that way 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.060
 diagonally and sees the thing out and 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.290
 the thing is in and out again 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.910
 because if we keep talking about it now 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.709
 we come to a very wrong 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.019
 rail here really does not belong 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.459
 In any case that's it from the videos 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.660
 I will drop out a few infos 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.310
 if you do not care so 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.310
 main channel already concerns this and that 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.450
 Tomorrow was a qual second 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.769
 part in probably 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.000
 most likely you do not want anything now 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.370
 promise but I think so 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.070
 Yesterday came the first part I 've got 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.989
 the relatively late uploaded and 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.489
 because of this, if you have not seen it yet 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.810
 have and then look at a channel 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.430
 is also under the video in 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.620
 linked to the video description and 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.450
 probably also in the car and in the end 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.569
 yesterday was the first part of eur 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.280
 was a qual now 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.769
 also as I said finally back in 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.449
 Battlefield 4 and tomorrow comes 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.259
 because the second part I will then 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.690
 record tomorrow 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.519
 and I hope it will be fun I am 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.410
 sure it will be fun and it will open 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.600
 any case, I'm happy and me 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.009
 Just say that from the video 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.320
 if you liked it you are welcome 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.030
 a rating thumbs up thumbs up 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.590
 Who's great thumb down who shit 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.669
 otherwise I say goodbye wish 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 Have a nice evening 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.300
 Whatever your video that day 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.449
 see until the next video to people 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.449
 then
