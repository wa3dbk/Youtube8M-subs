like<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.680> said<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.070> perfect<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.909> can

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
like I said it's not perfect but you can

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.170 
like I said it's not perfect but you can
see<00:02:03.420> he<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:04.110> hold<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.030> nice

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
see he does hold it so that's a nice

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.270 
see he does hold it so that's a nice
touch<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.810> only<00:02:06.960> problem<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.039> bulky

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
touch the only problem is it's so bulky

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.889 
touch the only problem is it's so bulky
back<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.300> hard<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.569> him<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
back here it's really hard for him to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.710 
back here it's really hard for him to
get<00:02:10.440> too<00:02:10.619> much<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> risk<00:02:11.250> posed<00:02:11.849> rich<00:02:12.330> wrist

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
get too much of a risk posed rich wrist

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.920 
get too much of a risk posed rich wrist
articulation<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
articulation you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.869 
articulation you
so<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:14.980> would<00:02:15.069> have<00:02:15.159> been<00:02:15.219> nice<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.400> kind<00:02:15.819> of

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
so it would have been nice to kind of

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.550 
so it would have been nice to kind of
carve<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.269> out<00:02:16.329> just<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.810> little<00:02:16.840> bit<00:02:17.109> even<00:02:17.409> if

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
carve that out just a little bit even if

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.470 
carve that out just a little bit even if
it's<00:02:17.709> not<00:02:17.859> game<00:02:18.609> accurate<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.239> he<00:02:19.359> can

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
it's not game accurate so he can

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.759 
it's not game accurate so he can
actually<00:02:19.750> hold<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.049> like<00:02:20.170> he<00:02:20.290> does<00:02:20.439> in<00:02:20.469> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
actually hold it like he does in the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.530 
actually hold it like he does in the
game<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.519> either<00:02:21.640> way<00:02:21.849> it's<00:02:22.150> still<00:02:22.180> awesome

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
game but either way it's still awesome

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.349 
game but either way it's still awesome
great<00:02:23.170> work<00:02:23.379> does<00:02:24.010> have<00:02:24.219> the<00:02:24.519> whole<00:02:24.909> there<00:02:25.180> to

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
great work does have the whole there to

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.599 
great work does have the whole there to
receive<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.810> peg<00:02:26.079> for<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.409> weapon<00:02:26.739> which<00:02:27.459> I

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
receive the peg for the weapon which I

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.300 
receive the peg for the weapon which I
just<00:02:27.849> left<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.569> his<00:02:28.659> back<00:02:28.920> alright<00:02:29.920> let's<00:02:30.159> talk

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
just left in his back alright let's talk

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.649 
just left in his back alright let's talk
about<00:02:30.400> articulation<00:02:30.879> real<00:02:31.180> quick<00:02:31.389> and<00:02:31.569> we'll

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
about articulation real quick and we'll

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.300 
about articulation real quick and we'll
call<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:32.019> rep<00:02:32.200> since<00:02:32.469> all<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.739> Spartans<00:02:33.099> are

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
call it a rep since all the Spartans are

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.490 
call it a rep since all the Spartans are
the<00:02:33.489> same<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:34.209> got<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.359> double<00:02:34.719> ball<00:02:35.019> jointed

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the same it's got a double ball jointed

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.190 
the same it's got a double ball jointed
bar<00:02:35.879> joint<00:02:36.879> in<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.389> neck<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.019> can<00:02:38.139> get

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
bar joint in the neck so you can get

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.720 
bar joint in the neck so you can get
some<00:02:38.379> really<00:02:38.620> nice<00:02:38.829> movement<00:02:39.099> out<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.459> there

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
some really nice movement out of there

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.629 
some really nice movement out of there
full<00:02:40.420> range<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.780> motion<00:02:40.840> looks<00:02:41.769> great<00:02:42.040> some

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
full range of motion looks great some

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.160 
full range of motion looks great some
really<00:02:42.819> natural<00:02:43.299> poses<00:02:43.659> you<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.900> tilt<00:02:44.139> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
really natural poses you can tilt the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.569 
really natural poses you can tilt the
head<00:02:44.349> to<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> side<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.129> do<00:02:45.250> whatever<00:02:45.370> you

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
want ball join his shoulder with

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.319 
want ball join his shoulder with
ratcheting<00:02:48.220> only<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.639> ratcheting<00:02:49.000> doesn't

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
ratcheting only the ratcheting doesn't

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.740 
ratcheting only the ratcheting doesn't
work<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.659> this<00:02:49.840> one<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.030> one<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.450> don't

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
work on this one or this one I don't

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.360 
work on this one or this one I don't
know<00:02:52.810> why<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.379> doesn't<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:54.189> tight

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
know why but it doesn't but it's tight

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.159 
know why but it doesn't but it's tight
enough<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.669> it's<00:02:54.879> okay<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:55.900> got<00:02:56.049> the

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
enough so it's okay it's got the

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.259 
enough so it's okay it's got the
standard<00:02:56.620> elbow<00:02:57.220> joint<00:02:57.459> with<00:02:57.669> the<00:02:57.819> ratchet<00:02:58.180> in

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
standard elbow joint with the ratchet in

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.270 
standard elbow joint with the ratchet in
there<00:02:58.480> which<00:02:58.930> doesn't<00:02:59.319> really<00:02:59.409> work<00:02:59.709> again<00:03:00.069> I

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
there which doesn't really work again I

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.709 
there which doesn't really work again I
mean<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.730> can<00:03:00.849> kind<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.209> feel<00:03:01.389> it<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:01.689> it's

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
mean you can kind of feel it but it's

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.619 
mean you can kind of feel it but it's
very<00:03:02.079> very<00:03:02.409> loose<00:03:03.090> rotates<00:03:04.090> at<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.389> top<00:03:04.599> of

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
very very loose rotates at the top of

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.289 
very very loose rotates at the top of
the<00:03:04.870> elbow<00:03:05.169> and<00:03:05.400> inside<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.549> forearm<00:03:07.090> so

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
the elbow and inside the forearm so

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.679 
the elbow and inside the forearm so
plenty<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.560> articulation<00:03:09.459> there<00:03:09.760> same<00:03:10.450> joint

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
plenty of articulation there same joint

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.770 
plenty of articulation there same joint
for<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.169> wrist<00:03:11.469> rotates<00:03:12.250> into<00:03:12.480> forearm<00:03:13.480> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
for the wrist rotates into forearm and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.709 
for the wrist rotates into forearm and
in<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.049> hand<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:15.189> is<00:03:15.340> ratcheted<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:16.180> well

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:16.719 
in the hand and it is ratcheted as well

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.610 
in the hand and it is ratcheted as well
so<00:03:16.989> plenty<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:18.069> motion<00:03:18.669> there<00:03:19.449> looks<00:03:20.349> great

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
so plenty of motion there looks great

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.619 
so plenty of motion there looks great
too<00:03:20.849> he's<00:03:21.849> got<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.349> bar<00:03:23.349> jointed<00:03:24.250> torso<00:03:24.909> so

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
too he's got the bar jointed torso so

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.390 
too he's got the bar jointed torso so
you<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:25.900> get<00:03:26.049> full<00:03:26.500> range<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.859> motion<00:03:26.919> out<00:03:27.340> of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
you can get full range of motion out of

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.809 
you can get full range of motion out of
that<00:03:27.699> looks<00:03:28.239> great<00:03:28.599> happy<00:03:29.260> about<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:29.819> his

that looks great happy about that his
hips<00:03:31.060> are<00:03:31.269> with<00:03:31.419> his<00:03:31.659> legs<00:03:31.900> on<00:03:32.109> mine<00:03:32.319> his<00:03:33.040> legs

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
hips have the forward backward motion

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.259 
hips have the forward backward motion
there<00:03:38.379> then<00:03:38.919> they<00:03:39.069> have<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> rotation<00:03:40.030> and

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
there then they have the rotation and

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.319 
there then they have the rotation and
the<00:03:41.010> joints<00:03:42.010> whatever<00:03:42.549> joint<00:03:42.819> that<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.150> it's

still even always a little bit loose you

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.839 
still even always a little bit loose you
can<00:04:21.669> still<00:04:21.940> pose<00:04:22.120> them<00:04:22.300> pretty<00:04:22.539> well<00:04:22.599> and<00:04:23.849> it

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
application and really the only

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.000 
application and really the only
complaint<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.290> this<00:04:32.500> one's<00:04:32.710> just<00:04:32.830> a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
complaint is that this one's just a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.640 
complaint is that this one's just a
little<00:04:33.250> bit<00:04:33.370> loose<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:34.200> if<00:04:35.200> i<00:04:35.350> had<00:04:35.560> to
