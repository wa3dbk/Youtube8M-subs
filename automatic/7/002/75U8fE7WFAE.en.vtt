00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.660
 well 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.150
 Hello dear friends, today we are going 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.590
 to make a very simple recipe we are going to 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.450
 make a syrup to bathe cakes for 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.620
 make this friend we only need sugar 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.070
 and water 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.080
 the same amount of sugar and water is 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.380
 say 100 grams of sugar for example 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.900
 they say grams of water but I always 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.020
 I put the syrup a little bit of liquor in 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:50.660
 this case I'm going to put 4 so 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:54.790
 as there are 65 millimeters of 4 there are 165 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.270
 grams of sugar 100 millimeters of water 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.060
 and 65 control the same amount of 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.930
 sugar than of liquids 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.930
 we started 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.189
 we can a case in the fire 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.189
 and in the we will put the water 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.399
 and then the sugar 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.710
 and we remove a little 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.460
 we will lower the fire because we have to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.820
 reduce the water is boiling but 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.829
 still have to make a point yet 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.990
 a little thicker and we still have to 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.229
 to add the liquor that does not get 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.500
 because if not boiling it would lose all the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.500
 alcohol 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.970
 about ten minutes boiling and that's when 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.970
 we are going to add the 4 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.620
 and the control or orange liqueur or 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.810
 any other you want terms I've 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.140
 said that you can do it without anything 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.140
 alcohol 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.249
 when we had already sneaked a 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.609
 little bit of alcohol we will stop the fire 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:25.840
 you see and do a little more olive and 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.840
 now we will not let cool 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.320
 once and we have already cooled down the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.320
 syrup we will pass it in a jar 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.110
 what will we do well 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:58.110
 and we already have a delicious syrup 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.910
 to make all kinds of cakes I hope 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.710
 I wish that when you do, it will come out so 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.710
 good like this friends 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.610
 all
