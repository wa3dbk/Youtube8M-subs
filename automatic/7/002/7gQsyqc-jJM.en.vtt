activity about what types of superpowers
do<00:00:26.849> superheroes<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.230> are<00:00:28.619> super<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
do superheroes have that are super and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.859 
do superheroes have that are super and
what<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.490> their<00:00:29.609> human<00:00:29.970> powers<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.570> empathy

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
what are their human powers like empathy

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.709 
what are their human powers like empathy
and<00:00:31.710> respect<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.460> other<00:00:32.610> people<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.600> can

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and respect for other people you can

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.200 
and respect for other people you can
hypnotize<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.620> their<00:00:34.770> eyes<00:00:35.030> she<00:00:36.030> can

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
write a poem about the different layers

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.310 
write a poem about the different layers
that<00:00:40.920> superheroes<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.960> put<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.079> some

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that superheroes have put on some

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990 
that superheroes have put on some
superhero<00:00:43.739> music<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.250> helps<00:00:44.670> does<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
superhero music if that helps does that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
superhero music if that helps does that
help<00:00:45.180> yeah<00:00:48.500> just<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.620> humans<00:00:50.100> have

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
help yeah just like humans have

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.350 
help yeah just like humans have
different<00:00:50.579> layers<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.940> identity

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
different layers and identity

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930 
different layers and identity
superheroes<00:00:51.960> into<00:00:52.320> under<00:00:53.219> my<00:00:53.340> superhero's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
superheroes into under my superhero's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.270 
superheroes into under my superhero's
sidekick<00:00:54.180> scales<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> skin<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:55.980> skin

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
sidekick scales it's a skin on your skin

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.150 
sidekick scales it's a skin on your skin
is<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.760> under<00:00:57.210> start<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.750> imperative

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
is very under start is imperative

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
is very under start is imperative
transform<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.760> took<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.780> stretch<00:01:01.020> break

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
transform we took a little stretch break

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
transform we took a little stretch break
and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.670> went<00:01:02.789> into<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.420> engineering

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and then we went into the engineering

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
and then we went into the engineering
portion<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.799> lesson<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> guys<00:01:05.729> want

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
portion of the lesson do you guys want

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
portion of the lesson do you guys want
to<00:01:06.030> make<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.210> plans<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.110> imagine

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to make some plans right now imagine

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.320 
to make some plans right now imagine
that<00:01:08.130> you're<00:01:08.400> super<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:08.760> doesn't<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that you're super here doesn't have the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
that you're super here doesn't have the
ability<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.990> fly<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.680> his<00:01:10.830> own<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.430> type

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
ability to fly on his own so what type

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.429 
ability to fly on his own so what type
of<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.760> plane<00:01:12.000> would<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> design<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:13.290> your

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
of a plane would you design for your

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
of a plane would you design for your
superheroes<00:01:14.040> today<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> most

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
superheroes today I think that the most

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
superheroes today I think that the most
important<00:01:15.750> takeaways<00:01:16.110> work<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.710> today<00:01:16.860> were

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
important takeaways work for today were

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.550 
important takeaways work for today were
to<00:01:17.430> allow<00:01:17.939> students<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.720> design<00:01:19.229> thinkers

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to allow students to be design thinkers

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
to allow students to be design thinkers
and<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.820> think<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.119> how<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.570> were

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and and so think about how they were

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.840 
and and so think about how they were
going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.840> design<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.650> plane<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.369> two<00:01:23.520> designs

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
going to design a plane or two designs

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.539 
going to design a plane or two designs
of<00:01:24.030> planes<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.540> we're<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.560> work<00:01:26.520> with

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
of planes that we're going to work with

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.480 
of planes that we're going to work with
speed<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:26.970> velocity<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.650> travel<00:01:29.130> far

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
speed and velocity and travel far

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
speed and velocity and travel far
distances<00:01:30.000> or<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.630> gliders<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:32.340> have

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
distances or be gliders and really have

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.520 
distances or be gliders and really have
them<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.750> elements<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.380> their

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
them think about what elements in their

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.710 
them think about what elements in their
designs<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:35.430> allow<00:01:35.700> their<00:01:35.970> gliders<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.570> do

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
designs would allow their gliders to do

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.030 
designs would allow their gliders to do
and<00:01:36.990> their<00:01:37.110> planes<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.650> different<00:01:37.979> things

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and their planes to do different things

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.069 
and their planes to do different things
today<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.939> made<00:01:39.119> these<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.420> cool<00:01:39.780> paper

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
today we made these really cool paper

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.380 
today we made these really cool paper
airplanes<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.970> really

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
airplanes it was really really

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.570 
airplanes it was really really
I<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.350> pick<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.770> backstory<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.400> my

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
I like to pick the backstory of my

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.310 
I like to pick the backstory of my
superhero<00:01:45.120> it's<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.900> having<00:01:46.080> an

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
superhero it's kind of like having an

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:56.870 
superhero it's kind of like having an
imaginary<00:01:46.530> friend<00:01:55.280> some<00:01:56.280> students<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
imaginary friend some students in the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.999 
imaginary friend some students in the
class<00:01:57.060> who<00:01:57.330> more<00:01:57.659> inclined<00:01:58.380> towards<00:01:58.590> writing

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
class who more inclined towards writing

00:01:59.009 --> 00:01:59.990 
class who more inclined towards writing
and<00:01:59.190> then<00:01:59.250> there's<00:01:59.430> some<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> are<00:01:59.880> more

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and then there's some that are more

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
and then there's some that are more
inclined<00:02:00.150> towards<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:01.050> science<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.650> math

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
inclined towards the science and math

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
inclined towards the science and math
and<00:02:02.160> engineering<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.960> I've<00:02:04.080> seen<00:02:04.320> both<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and engineering but I've seen both of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.680 
and engineering but I've seen both of
those<00:02:04.890> types<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.520> students<00:02:05.880> sort<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> crossing

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
those types of students sort of crossing

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.620 
those types of students sort of crossing
over<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.170> well<00:02:07.350> having<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.220> ty<00:02:09.030> seamlessly

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
over really well having it ty seamlessly

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.150 
over really well having it ty seamlessly
together<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.259> way<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.649> having<00:02:10.800> students

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
together in that way and having students

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
together in that way and having students
be<00:02:11.310> engaged<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.819> hands-on<00:02:12.270> things<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
be engaged in hands-on things and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.330 
be engaged in hands-on things and
interacting<00:02:13.739> with<00:02:13.860> these<00:02:13.980> different

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
interacting with these different

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.340 
interacting with these different
experiments<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:14.940> activities<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:15.780> you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
experiments and activities and then you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.479 
experiments and activities and then you
know<00:02:16.440> thinking<00:02:16.830> about<00:02:16.920> their<00:02:17.220> character

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
know thinking about their character

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.100 
know thinking about their character
their<00:02:17.640> superhero<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.570> what<00:02:18.959> they're

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
their superhero and what they're

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.229 
their superhero and what they're
superheroes<00:02:19.500> DNA<00:02:20.070> looks<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.489> as<00:02:20.670> opposed<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
superheroes DNA looks like as opposed to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.540 
superheroes DNA looks like as opposed to
their<00:02:21.660> DNA<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:22.920> important<00:02:23.370> way<00:02:23.519> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
their DNA is a really important way to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.820 
their DNA is a really important way to
sort<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.330> these<00:02:24.570> concepts<00:02:25.230> across<00:02:25.350> and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
sort of get these concepts across and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.160 
sort of get these concepts across and
and<00:02:26.670> really<00:02:26.790> make<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.330> natural<00:02:27.540> genuine

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and really make a really natural genuine

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:39.309 
and really make a really natural genuine
connection<00:02:28.709> between<00:02:28.860> stem<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.970> writing

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319
