00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
my experience while I was using the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.359 
my experience while I was using the
computer<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.720> quite<00:00:19.470> an<00:00:19.590> extensive<00:00:19.980> amount

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
computer for quite an extensive amount

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.670 
computer for quite an extensive amount
of<00:00:20.430> time<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.420> Apple<00:00:21.660> Store<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.470> wasn't

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
of time at the Apple Store this wasn't

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.960 
of time at the Apple Store this wasn't
just<00:00:22.830> some<00:00:23.100> quick<00:00:23.279> thing<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> did<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
just some quick thing that I did I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.490 
just some quick thing that I did I
actually<00:00:24.240> tested<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.779> pretty<00:00:25.050> thoroughly<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
actually tested it pretty thoroughly I

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
actually tested it pretty thoroughly I
even<00:00:25.830> ran<00:00:26.010> two<00:00:26.279> separate<00:00:26.699> benchmarking

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
even ran two separate benchmarking

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.570 
even ran two separate benchmarking
programs<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.650> some<00:00:28.859> comparisons<00:00:29.429> with

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
programs to make some comparisons with

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.569 
programs to make some comparisons with
performance<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.929> let's<00:00:31.080> take<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> look<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.650> will

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
performance so let's take a look I will

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.370 
performance so let's take a look I will
say<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> Retina<00:00:33.239> display<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.630> absolutely

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
say the Retina display is absolutely

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.290 
say the Retina display is absolutely
amazing<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.489> using<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.120> general

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
amazing I was using it for just general

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.060 
amazing I was using it for just general
things<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.989> video<00:00:37.290> editing<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.710> Final<00:00:37.860> Cut

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
things and video editing in Final Cut

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.160 
things and video editing in Final Cut
Pro<00:00:38.190> was<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.850> great<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:40.020> cool

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Pro was really great it was really cool

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.630 
Pro was really great it was really cool
to<00:00:40.230> see<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> sharp<00:00:40.890> graphics<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> UI

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
to see all the sharp graphics in the UI

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.760 
to see all the sharp graphics in the UI
of<00:00:41.940> course<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> best<00:00:43.140> thing<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.500> being

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of course but the best thing was being

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
of course but the best thing was being
able<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.070> native<00:00:44.550> 1080p<00:00:44.760> video<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
able to see native 1080p video in the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
able to see native 1080p video in the
canvas<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.469> wasn't<00:00:47.309> possible<00:00:47.489> until<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:48.059> had

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
canvas that wasn't possible until we had

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
canvas that wasn't possible until we had
something<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.750> Retina<00:00:49.079> display<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
something like a Retina display and the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
something like a Retina display and the
quality<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:51.030> also<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.170> are

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
quality was really good also if you are

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
quality was really good also if you are
worried<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:52.680> glare<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.120> heard<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
worried about glare if you heard that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.910 
worried about glare if you heard that
they<00:00:54.600> reduced<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> glare<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.590> screen

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
they reduced the glare in this screen

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
they reduced the glare in this screen
well<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.579> good<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
well that's good for you to know and I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.360 
well that's good for you to know and I
will<00:00:58.079> tell<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.710> weren't<00:00:58.859> lying<00:00:59.129> about

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
will tell you they weren't lying about

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.400 
will tell you they weren't lying about
that<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> glare<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.090> greatly<00:01:00.660> reduced<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that the glare is greatly reduced the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
that the glare is greatly reduced the
color<00:01:01.949> quality<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.489> way<00:01:02.699> better<00:01:02.910> than<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
color quality is way better than the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
color quality is way better than the
previous<00:01:03.300> displays<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.920> reflection

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
previous displays and the reflection

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.210 
previous displays and the reflection
that<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> gives<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.119> blurred<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.799> bit<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that it gives is blurred a little bit so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640 
that it gives is blurred a little bit so
it<00:01:08.430> doesn't<00:01:08.460> reflect<00:01:09.000> light<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.630> much<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it doesn't reflect light as much so you

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.870 
it doesn't reflect light as much so you
don't<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> worry<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.189> glare<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
don't have to worry about glare the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.070 
don't have to worry about glare the
glare<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.180> reduced<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.750> looks<00:01:12.930> really

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
glare is reduced and it looks really

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
glare is reduced and it looks really
nice<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.680> angle<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> view<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.340> really

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
nice and the angle of view is really

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
nice and the angle of view is really
good<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.630> display<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> closed<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
good on the display I closed it and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.530 
good on the display I closed it and
opened<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.090> looking<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
opened it up and I was looking at the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
opened it up and I was looking at the
screen<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> color<00:01:19.320> didn't<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> store

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
screen and the color didn't get to store

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
screen and the color didn't get to store
it<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> quality<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.450> very<00:01:21.479> good<00:01:21.869> in

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it at all so the quality is very good in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
it at all so the quality is very good in
the<00:01:22.650> display<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.640> tested<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the display I also tested up the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.300 
the display I also tested up the
speakers<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.830> kind<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> hard<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
speakers and it's kind of hard to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
speakers and it's kind of hard to
describe<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.640> things<00:01:26.939> sound<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.810> give

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
describe how things sound but I can give

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.770 
describe how things sound but I can give
you<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.350> context<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> used<00:01:30.030> an<00:01:30.180> iMac<00:01:30.600> or

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you some context if you used an iMac or

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.569 
you some context if you used an iMac or
something<00:01:31.110> before<00:01:31.470> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.490> an

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
something before kind of like an

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.340 
something before kind of like an
all-in-one<00:01:32.820> computer<00:01:33.270> from<00:01:33.360> Apple<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
all-in-one computer from Apple in the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.109 
all-in-one computer from Apple in the
past<00:01:34.560> few<00:01:34.770> years<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.759> kind<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.000> what

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
past few years or so that's kind of what

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
past few years or so that's kind of what
it<00:01:36.210> sounds<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:38.009> baseless

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
it sounds like so it's not as baseless

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
it sounds like so it's not as baseless
and<00:01:38.970> tinny<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.329> guess<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> mean<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> speaker's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and tinny I guess I mean the speaker's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
and tinny I guess I mean the speaker's
nowadays<00:01:40.710> are<00:01:40.920> still<00:01:41.130> good<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.880> ones<00:01:42.119> in

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
nowadays are still good but the ones in

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
nowadays are still good but the ones in
the<00:01:42.299> new<00:01:42.420> MacBook<00:01:42.750> Pro<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.079> even<00:01:43.290> better<00:01:43.500> so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the new MacBook Pro are even better so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.679 
the new MacBook Pro are even better so
if<00:01:44.159> you've<00:01:44.280> used<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:44.610> iMac<00:01:45.030> before<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
if you've used an iMac before like the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
if you've used an iMac before like the
speakers<00:01:46.049> built<00:01:46.290> into<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> cinema<00:01:46.860> display

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
speakers built into the cinema display

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.319 
speakers built into the cinema display
that's<00:01:47.369> kind<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.670> what<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> sounds<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.210> now

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that's kind of what it sounds like now

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.420 
that's kind of what it sounds like now
there's<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> lot<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.140> bass<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there's a lot more bass so that is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
there's a lot more bass so that is
really<00:01:50.670> nice<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.939> tested<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.390> some<00:01:51.540> videos

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
really nice I tested it with some videos

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
really nice I tested it with some videos
and<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.470> tested<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.130> music<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and I tested it with some music and it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
and I tested it with some music and it
sounds<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.810> good<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
sounds really really good also with the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.980 
sounds really really good also with the
fans<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.850> asymmetric<00:01:57.270> blades

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
fans I know they have asymmetric blades

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
fans I know they have asymmetric blades
in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> fan<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> lot<00:01:59.100> quieter<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.759> was

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
in the fan so it's a lot quieter I was

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
in the fan so it's a lot quieter I was
rendering<00:02:00.420> video<00:02:00.750> inside<00:02:01.020> Final<00:02:01.320> Cut<00:02:01.409> Pro<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
rendering video inside Final Cut Pro and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.109 
rendering video inside Final Cut Pro and
I<00:02:01.740> put<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:01.979> ear<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> computer

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I put my ear right up to the computer

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
I put my ear right up to the computer
and<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.240> could<00:02:03.390> barely<00:02:03.719> hear<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.469> course<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and I could barely hear it of course the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
and I could barely hear it of course the
store<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> noisy<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.119> can't<00:02:06.360> give

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
store was kind of noisy so I can't give

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
store was kind of noisy so I can't give
a<00:02:06.570> fair<00:02:06.899> judgment<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.439> how<00:02:07.590> quiet<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> really

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
a fair judgment on how quiet it really

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
a fair judgment on how quiet it really
is<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.239> usually<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.080> ear

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
is but usually if you have your ear

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.460 
is but usually if you have your ear
right<00:02:10.410> next<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> computer<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
right next to the computer you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.170 
right next to the computer you
here<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.220> could<00:02:12.400> barely<00:02:12.610> hear<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
here it and I could barely hear it so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.030 
here it and I could barely hear it so
with<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> fans<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.380> up<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> full<00:02:14.890> speed

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
with the fans going up to full speed

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.070 
with the fans going up to full speed
while<00:02:15.370> rendering<00:02:15.580> video<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.630> stayed<00:02:16.900> pretty

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
while rendering video it stayed pretty

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200 
while rendering video it stayed pretty
quiet<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:17.650> that's<00:02:17.770> another<00:02:18.040> plus<00:02:18.340> okay<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.120> I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
quiet so that's another plus okay so I

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.790 
quiet so that's another plus okay so I
ran<00:02:19.420> some<00:02:19.600> benchmarking<00:02:20.110> software

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
ran some benchmarking software

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.070 
ran some benchmarking software
I<00:02:20.830> ran<00:02:21.220> Nova<00:02:21.700> bench<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.510> disk<00:02:22.720> speed<00:02:23.020> test

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
I ran Nova bench and the disk speed test

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.530 
I ran Nova bench and the disk speed test
by<00:02:23.680> black<00:02:24.010> magic<00:02:24.280> alright<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> did<00:02:25.360> some

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
by black magic alright so I did some

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.900 
by black magic alright so I did some
comparisons<00:02:26.170> here<00:02:26.470> here<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.070> my<00:02:27.100> current

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
comparisons here here is my current

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.450 
comparisons here here is my current
computer<00:02:28.060> with<00:02:28.960> its<00:02:29.200> disk<00:02:29.500> speed<00:02:29.770> benchmarks

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
computer with its disk speed benchmarks

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.730 
computer with its disk speed benchmarks
now<00:02:31.330> as<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.630> see<00:02:31.780> that's<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:32.140> decent<00:02:32.560> speed

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
now as you can see that's a decent speed

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.290 
now as you can see that's a decent speed
that's<00:02:32.920> about<00:02:33.100> average<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:33.910> if<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.060> look<00:02:34.210> at

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
that's about average but if you look at

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.940 
that's about average but if you look at
the<00:02:34.420> flash<00:02:34.660> architecture<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> MacBook

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the flash architecture in the MacBook

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.640 
the flash architecture in the MacBook
Pro<00:02:36.160> here<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.820> what<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.240> sport<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.320> numbers

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
Pro here is what that sport the numbers

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.350 
Pro here is what that sport the numbers
were<00:02:38.800> way<00:02:39.130> higher<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.760> boot<00:02:39.940> time<00:02:40.150> was

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
were way higher and the boot time was

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.240 
were way higher and the boot time was
amazing<00:02:40.930> when<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.170> saw<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.440> Apple<00:02:41.860> logo<00:02:41.950> it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
amazing when you saw the Apple logo it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.160 
amazing when you saw the Apple logo it
was<00:02:42.340> about<00:02:42.580> maybe<00:02:42.820> five<00:02:43.480> seconds<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.959> loading

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
was about maybe five seconds of loading

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.960 
was about maybe five seconds of loading
and<00:02:44.560> then<00:02:44.920> five<00:02:45.160> seconds<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.610> loading<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
and then five seconds of loading the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.550 
and then five seconds of loading the
desktop<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.720> overall<00:02:46.959> boot<00:02:47.200> time<00:02:47.410> was

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
desktop so the overall boot time was

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.410 
desktop so the overall boot time was
like<00:02:47.650> ten<00:02:47.890> seconds<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.490> if<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.580> count<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
like ten seconds and if you count the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.180 
like ten seconds and if you count the
power-on<00:02:49.810> self-test<00:02:49.870> before<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.860> Apple<00:02:51.100> logo

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
power-on self-test before the Apple logo

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.580 
power-on self-test before the Apple logo
shows<00:02:51.550> up<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:52.060> was<00:02:52.180> about<00:02:52.300> 15<00:02:52.750> seconds<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.380> a

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
shows up it was about 15 seconds so a

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.020 
shows up it was about 15 seconds so a
very<00:02:54.070> fast<00:02:54.370> boot<00:02:54.610> time<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:55.090> computer<00:03:00.030> now

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
very fast boot time in this computer now

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.300 
very fast boot time in this computer now
when<00:03:01.240> I<00:03:01.270> ran<00:03:01.510> Nova<00:03:01.930> Bench<00:03:02.170> overall<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> score

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
when I ran Nova Bench overall the score

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.490 
when I ran Nova Bench overall the score
was<00:03:03.430> only<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:04.030> couple<00:03:04.600> points<00:03:04.870> higher<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.110> think

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
was only a couple points higher I think

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.750 
was only a couple points higher I think
maybe<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:05.800> twenty<00:03:06.160> or<00:03:06.190> thirty<00:03:06.430> points

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
maybe like twenty or thirty points

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.360 
maybe like twenty or thirty points
higher<00:03:06.940> than<00:03:06.970> my<00:03:07.270> computer<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.920> processor

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
higher than my computer so the processor

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.920 
higher than my computer so the processor
of<00:03:09.459> course<00:03:09.670> isn't<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.150> much<00:03:10.300> faster<00:03:10.660> than<00:03:10.750> my

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
of course isn't that much faster than my

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.050 
of course isn't that much faster than my
configuration<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.459> little<00:03:12.730> bit<00:03:12.820> faster

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
configuration it is a little bit faster

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.490 
configuration it is a little bit faster
at<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.209> clock<00:03:13.420> speed<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:13.930> Ivy<00:03:14.260> Bridge

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
at the clock speed and it's Ivy Bridge

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.229 
at the clock speed and it's Ivy Bridge
but<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.280> biggest<00:03:15.430> thing<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.030> Kepler

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
but the biggest thing is with the Kepler

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.090 
but the biggest thing is with the Kepler
graphics<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.080> really<00:03:17.500> couldn't<00:03:17.650> test<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
graphics I really couldn't test the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.920 
graphics I really couldn't test the
Kepler<00:03:18.400> graphics<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.880> their<00:03:19.030> full<00:03:19.209> extent<00:03:19.360> and

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
Kepler graphics to their full extent and

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.509 
Kepler graphics to their full extent and
I'm<00:03:20.470> not<00:03:20.590> even<00:03:20.709> sure<00:03:20.920> if<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.070> benchmarking

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
I'm not even sure if the benchmarking

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.340 
I'm not even sure if the benchmarking
software<00:03:21.730> was<00:03:22.090> using<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.690> Kepler<00:03:22.959> graphics

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
software was using the Kepler graphics

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.810 
software was using the Kepler graphics
but<00:03:23.440> I'm<00:03:23.560> pretty<00:03:23.709> sure<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.010> was<00:03:24.040> because<00:03:24.610> the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
but I'm pretty sure it was because the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.970 
but I'm pretty sure it was because the
lists<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.360> Nova<00:03:26.170> bench<00:03:26.320> software<00:03:26.739> said

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
lists in the Nova bench software said

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.300 
lists in the Nova bench software said
NVIDIA<00:03:27.730> GeForce<00:03:28.110> 650<00:03:29.110> M<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.680> when<00:03:30.070> it<00:03:30.220> was

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
NVIDIA GeForce 650 M so when it was

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.100 
NVIDIA GeForce 650 M so when it was
testing<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.180> got<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.360> good<00:03:31.540> score<00:03:31.840> as<00:03:31.930> well

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
testing that it got a good score as well

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.259 
testing that it got a good score as well
but<00:03:32.650> overall<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.519> didn't<00:03:33.850> really<00:03:34.090> get<00:03:34.209> that

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
but overall it didn't really get that

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.810 
but overall it didn't really get that
much<00:03:34.420> higher<00:03:34.840> because<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:36.070> graphics<00:03:36.459> are<00:03:36.610> way

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
much higher because the graphics are way

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.850 
much higher because the graphics are way
faster<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:37.510> computer<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.380> because<00:03:38.709> it's

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
faster in this computer but because it's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.400 
faster in this computer but because it's
powering<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.459> many<00:03:39.670> pixels<00:03:40.269> there<00:03:41.170> won't

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
powering so many pixels there won't

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.930 
powering so many pixels there won't
really<00:03:41.620> be<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.860> huge<00:03:42.100> difference<00:03:42.610> for<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
really be a huge difference for the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.270 
really be a huge difference for the
software<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.810> detect<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.470> with<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.010> display

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
software to detect and with the display

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.440 
software to detect and with the display
of<00:03:45.400> course<00:03:45.610> there<00:03:45.760> are<00:03:45.820> different<00:03:46.090> settings

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
of course there are different settings

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.850 
of course there are different settings
so<00:03:46.510> if<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.750> want<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.019> have<00:03:47.140> more<00:03:47.320> work<00:03:47.530> space

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
so if you want to have more work space

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.680 
so if you want to have more work space
or<00:03:48.040> higher<00:03:48.220> quality<00:03:48.700> graphics<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.540> can

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
or higher quality graphics you can

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.810 
or higher quality graphics you can
choose<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:49.930> in<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.320> Preferences<00:03:50.890> however

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
choose that in the Preferences however

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.460 
choose that in the Preferences however
you<00:03:52.000> can't<00:03:52.269> run<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.600> display<00:03:52.930> at<00:03:53.049> its<00:03:53.170> native

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
you can't run the display at its native

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.990 
you can't run the display at its native
resolution<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.130> there's<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.340> good<00:03:54.459> reason<00:03:54.519> for

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
resolution but there's a good reason for

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.490 
resolution but there's a good reason for
that<00:03:55.090> if<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:55.360> did<00:03:55.600> that<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.900> would<00:03:56.019> be<00:03:56.110> pretty

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
that if you did that it would be pretty

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.900 
that if you did that it would be pretty
impossible<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.160> see<00:03:57.280> anything<00:03:57.310> because<00:03:57.700> the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
impossible to see anything because the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.210 
impossible to see anything because the
pixels<00:03:58.299> are<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.630> darn<00:03:59.049> small<00:03:59.440> but<00:04:00.040> there<00:04:00.160> are

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
pixels are so darn small but there are

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.620 
pixels are so darn small but there are
still<00:04:00.400> five<00:04:00.610> presets<00:04:01.120> in<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.360> system

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
still five presets in the system

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.390 
still five presets in the system
preferences<00:04:02.110> for<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:03.070> still<00:04:03.130> have

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
preferences for you and you still have

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.310 
preferences for you and you still have
total<00:04:03.670> flexibility<00:04:04.299> with<00:04:04.720> other<00:04:04.870> monitors

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
total flexibility with other monitors

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.840 
total flexibility with other monitors
that<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.500> plug<00:04:05.739> in<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.430> course<00:04:06.640> there<00:04:06.790> are

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
that you plug in and of course there are

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.039 
that you plug in and of course there are
some<00:04:06.970> other<00:04:07.060> side<00:04:07.390> things<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.810> are<00:04:07.900> great

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
some other side things that are great

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.259 
some other side things that are great
like<00:04:08.230> dual<00:04:08.440> Thunderbolt<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.130> really<00:04:09.549> nice<00:04:09.760> USB

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
like dual Thunderbolt is really nice USB

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.910 
like dual Thunderbolt is really nice USB
3<00:04:10.570> is<00:04:10.720> really<00:04:11.019> nice<00:04:11.200> those<00:04:11.530> are<00:04:11.680> some<00:04:11.799> other

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
3 is really nice those are some other

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.440 
3 is really nice those are some other
really<00:04:12.220> convenient<00:04:12.700> things<00:04:12.850> an<00:04:12.970> HDMI

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
really convenient things an HDMI

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.270 
really convenient things an HDMI
built-in<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:13.989> also<00:04:14.200> really<00:04:14.440> handy<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.799> well<00:04:14.830> as

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
built-in is also really handy as well as

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.159 
built-in is also really handy as well as
you<00:04:15.670> know<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:16.330> isn't<00:04:16.600> really<00:04:16.720> something<00:04:16.989> you

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
you know this isn't really something you

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.229 
you know this isn't really something you
need<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.320> use<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.950> computer<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.400> tell<00:04:18.700> but<00:04:19.030> you

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
need to use the computer to tell but you

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.909 
need to use the computer to tell but you
know<00:04:19.419> there's<00:04:19.660> no<00:04:19.780> firewire<00:04:20.200> or<00:04:20.289> Ethernet<00:04:20.709> but

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
know there's no firewire or Ethernet but

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.110 
know there's no firewire or Ethernet but
if<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.160> need<00:04:21.340> those<00:04:21.489> things<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.940> can<00:04:22.090> just

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
if you need those things you can just

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.580 
if you need those things you can just
use<00:04:22.330> Thunderbolt<00:04:22.750> adapters<00:04:23.229> because

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
use Thunderbolt adapters because

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.500 
use Thunderbolt adapters because
under<00:04:23.800> both<00:04:23.949> supports<00:04:24.460> legacy<00:04:24.940> technology

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
under both supports legacy technology

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.330 
under both supports legacy technology
there<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:25.930> also<00:04:26.110> no<00:04:26.290> disk<00:04:26.530> drive<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:26.980> we<00:04:27.160> know

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
there is also no disk drive as we know

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.010 
there is also no disk drive as we know
because<00:04:27.669> it's<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:27.880> darn<00:04:28.300> thin<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.870> will

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
because it's so darn thin and I will

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.080 
because it's so darn thin and I will
tell<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.830> new<00:04:29.980> design<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.580> really<00:04:30.910> nice

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
tell you the new design is really nice

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.600 
tell you the new design is really nice
it's<00:04:31.389> really<00:04:31.810> light<00:04:32.080> it's<00:04:32.560> really<00:04:32.889> thin<00:04:33.190> it

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
it's really light it's really thin it

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.070 
it's really light it's really thin it
was<00:04:33.729> really<00:04:33.970> nice<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.270> hold<00:04:34.389> in<00:04:34.540> my<00:04:34.630> hands<00:04:34.870> it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
was really nice to hold in my hands it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.140 
was really nice to hold in my hands it
was<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.199> really<00:04:35.410> cool<00:04:35.740> looking<00:04:36.010> computer<00:04:36.460> but

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
was a really cool looking computer but

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.370 
was a really cool looking computer but
yes<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.449> disk<00:04:37.600> drive<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.870> not<00:04:37.960> in<00:04:38.110> there<00:04:38.229> but

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
yes the disk drive is not in there but

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.600 
yes the disk drive is not in there but
if<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:38.560> need<00:04:38.710> an<00:04:38.800> external<00:04:39.040> disk<00:04:39.250> drive<00:04:39.460> you

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
if you need an external disk drive you

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.760 
if you need an external disk drive you
can<00:04:39.760> get<00:04:39.910> one<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:40.990> heard<00:04:41.260> all<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.470> pros

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
can get one so you heard all the pros

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.710 
can get one so you heard all the pros
that<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:42.160> have<00:04:42.490> about<00:04:42.729> macbook<00:04:43.210> pro<00:04:43.449> but<00:04:43.630> i'm

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.659 
that I have about macbook pro but i'm
gonna<00:04:43.840> talk<00:04:43.990> about<00:04:44.169> some<00:04:44.290> of<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.410> cons<00:04:44.680> now<00:04:44.949> of

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
gonna talk about some of the cons now of

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.580 
gonna talk about some of the cons now of

Ethernet firewire that might be a bit of
a<00:04:49.630> problem<00:04:49.870> but<00:04:50.139> you<00:04:50.260> can<00:04:50.410> get<00:04:50.500> adapters<00:04:50.979> for

on this computer they used make safe too
you<00:04:57.400> can<00:04:57.550> get<00:04:57.669> an<00:04:57.760> adapter<00:04:57.970> for<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.419> I'm<00:04:58.600> not

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
you can get an adapter for that I'm not

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.060 
you can get an adapter for that I'm not
sure<00:04:59.020> if<00:04:59.110> they<00:04:59.200> charge<00:04:59.440> you<00:04:59.620> for<00:04:59.800> that<00:04:59.830> they

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
sure if they charge you for that they

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.620 
sure if they charge you for that they
might<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.610> think<00:05:00.910> it's<00:05:01.030> ten<00:05:01.180> dollars<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.570> could

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
might I think it's ten dollars I could

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.060 
might I think it's ten dollars I could
be<00:05:01.870> wrong<00:05:02.020> don't<00:05:02.290> take<00:05:02.470> my<00:05:02.590> word<00:05:02.740> for<00:05:02.770> that

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
be wrong don't take my word for that

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.409 
be wrong don't take my word for that
also<00:05:03.340> there<00:05:03.580> is<00:05:03.669> no<00:05:03.700> disk<00:05:04.030> drive<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.240> that's

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
also there is no disk drive but that's

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.850 
also there is no disk drive but that's
not<00:05:04.570> really<00:05:04.750> much<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:05.080> problem<00:05:05.290> for<00:05:05.500> a<00:05:05.650> lot

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
not really much of a problem for a lot

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.230 
not really much of a problem for a lot
of<00:05:05.919> us<00:05:06.160> these<00:05:06.310> days<00:05:06.370> but<00:05:06.729> if<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:06.850> burn<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.060> lot

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
of us these days but if you burn a lot

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.210 
of us these days but if you burn a lot
of<00:05:07.419> disks<00:05:07.780> this<00:05:08.229> computer<00:05:08.620> may<00:05:08.740> not<00:05:08.889> be<00:05:09.070> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
of disks this computer may not be the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.650 
of disks this computer may not be the
best<00:05:09.400> for<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.700> but<00:05:09.880> if<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.330> would<00:05:10.479> rather

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
best for you but if you would rather

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.030 
best for you but if you would rather
have<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.110> computer<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.620> all<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.770> its<00:05:11.889> nice

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
have the computer and all of its nice

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.100 
have the computer and all of its nice
new<00:05:12.220> features<00:05:12.610> just<00:05:13.389> a<00:05:13.479> substitute<00:05:13.900> for<00:05:14.050> a

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
new features just a substitute for a

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.140 
new features just a substitute for a
disk<00:05:14.320> drive<00:05:14.380> that's<00:05:15.310> fine<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.580> think<00:05:15.910> you'd<00:05:16.000> be

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
disk drive that's fine I think you'd be

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.700 
disk drive that's fine I think you'd be
worth<00:05:16.330> carrying<00:05:16.720> around<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:16.990> USB<00:05:17.320> disk<00:05:17.500> drive

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
worth carrying around a USB disk drive

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.650 
worth carrying around a USB disk drive
if<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.950> need<00:05:18.130> it<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.580> this<00:05:19.090> one's<00:05:19.300> more<00:05:19.510> of<00:05:19.570> a

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
if you need it and this one's more of a

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.600 
if you need it and this one's more of a
significant<00:05:20.260> con<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.919> course<00:05:21.190> when<00:05:21.370> you<00:05:21.430> buy

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
significant con of course when you buy

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.340 
significant con of course when you buy
the<00:05:21.669> computer<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.300> can't<00:05:22.600> upgrade<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.080> later

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
the computer you can't upgrade it later

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.200 
the computer you can't upgrade it later
because<00:05:23.650> everything<00:05:24.039> is<00:05:24.160> so<00:05:24.310> custom<00:05:24.729> ly<00:05:24.880> built

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
because everything is so custom ly built

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.420 
because everything is so custom ly built
so<00:05:25.990> don't<00:05:26.500> think<00:05:26.710> you're<00:05:26.800> gonna<00:05:26.889> be<00:05:27.039> adding<00:05:27.400> a

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
so don't think you're gonna be adding a

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.620 
so don't think you're gonna be adding a
ram<00:05:27.610> or<00:05:27.639> something<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.300> this<00:05:28.389> because

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
ram or something to this because

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.700 
ram or something to this because
everything<00:05:28.930> is<00:05:29.110> all<00:05:29.229> put<00:05:29.410> together<00:05:29.470> so

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
everything is all put together so

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.890 
everything is all put together so
precisely<00:05:30.520> it's<00:05:30.850> all<00:05:30.940> soldered<00:05:31.210> together<00:05:31.450> and

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
precisely it's all soldered together and

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.900 
precisely it's all soldered together and
I've<00:05:32.410> also<00:05:32.590> noticed<00:05:32.950> this<00:05:33.310> was<00:05:33.490> being<00:05:33.700> talked

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
I've also noticed this was being talked

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.180 
I've also noticed this was being talked
about<00:05:33.970> on<00:05:34.180> some<00:05:34.330> websites<00:05:35.190> performance

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
about on some websites performance

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.129 
about on some websites performance
overall<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.850> really<00:05:36.880> really<00:05:37.510> good<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.900> course

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
overall is really really good of course

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.810 
overall is really really good of course
and<00:05:38.410> graphics<00:05:38.830> performance<00:05:39.010> is<00:05:39.370> great<00:05:39.610> too

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
and graphics performance is great too

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.790 
and graphics performance is great too
but<00:05:40.360> when<00:05:40.450> it<00:05:40.539> comes<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.900> scrolling<00:05:41.470> because

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
but when it comes to scrolling because

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.710 
but when it comes to scrolling because
the<00:05:41.979> computer<00:05:42.430> has<00:05:42.639> to<00:05:42.789> do<00:05:42.940> such<00:05:43.240> intensive

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
the computer has to do such intensive

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.570 
the computer has to do such intensive
processing<00:05:44.200> while<00:05:44.320> scrolling<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:44.950> powering

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
processing while scrolling and powering

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.969 
processing while scrolling and powering
5<00:05:45.910> million<00:05:46.300> pixels<00:05:46.750> it's<00:05:47.169> really<00:05:47.590> not<00:05:47.770> the

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
5 million pixels it's really not the

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.500 
5 million pixels it's really not the
fastest<00:05:48.520> now<00:05:48.789> it's<00:05:48.940> not<00:05:49.120> like<00:05:49.240> it's<00:05:49.389> gonna

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
fastest now it's not like it's gonna

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.930 
fastest now it's not like it's gonna
kill<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.320> it<00:05:50.830> will<00:05:50.919> still<00:05:51.220> look<00:05:51.370> fine<00:05:51.700> on

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
kill you and it will still look fine on

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.580 
kill you and it will still look fine on
external<00:05:52.330> monitors<00:05:52.840> but<00:05:52.990> with<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.229> built-in

external monitors but with the built-in
screen<00:05:53.860> scrolling<00:05:54.460> performance<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:55.450> a<00:05:55.510> little

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
screen scrolling performance is a little

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.570 
screen scrolling performance is a little
bit<00:05:56.260> slower<00:05:56.500> than<00:05:56.590> you<00:05:56.860> would<00:05:56.889> see<00:05:57.160> even<00:05:57.460> on<00:05:57.520> a

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
bit slower than you would see even on a

bit slower than you would see even on a
MacBook<00:05:57.940> Air<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.360> compared<00:05:58.810> webpages<00:05:59.680> on<00:05:59.950> the

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
MacBook Air I compared webpages on the

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.589 
MacBook Air I compared webpages on the
MacBook<00:06:00.220> Air<00:06:00.370> scrolling<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:01.180> new<00:06:01.300> MacBook

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
MacBook Air scrolling to the new MacBook

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.029 
MacBook Air scrolling to the new MacBook
Pro<00:06:01.780> and<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:01.960> MacBook<00:06:02.110> Air<00:06:02.289> scrolling<00:06:02.800> was<00:06:03.010> a

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
Pro and the MacBook Air scrolling was a

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.950 
Pro and the MacBook Air scrolling was a
lot<00:06:03.280> smoother<00:06:03.820> but<00:06:04.419> you<00:06:04.479> also<00:06:04.599> have<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:04.840> keep

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
lot smoother but you also have to keep

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.659 
lot smoother but you also have to keep
in<00:06:05.080> mind<00:06:05.289> how<00:06:05.530> many<00:06:05.590> more<00:06:05.830> pixels<00:06:06.280> this<00:06:06.460> thing

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
in mind how many more pixels this thing

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.490 
in mind how many more pixels this thing
is<00:06:06.760> driving<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.360> I'm<00:06:07.660> sure<00:06:07.870> in<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.050> future<00:06:08.110> as

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
is driving and I'm sure in the future as

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.900 
is driving and I'm sure in the future as
we<00:06:08.620> go<00:06:08.770> on<00:06:08.950> we'll<00:06:09.130> get<00:06:09.220> more<00:06:09.400> performance<00:06:09.520> and

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
we go on we'll get more performance and

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.760 
we go on we'll get more performance and
that<00:06:10.060> won't<00:06:10.210> be<00:06:10.389> much<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.110> an<00:06:11.289> issue<00:06:11.410> in

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
that won't be much of an issue in

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.490 
that won't be much of an issue in
addition<00:06:12.430> for<00:06:13.060> scrolling<00:06:13.360> in<00:06:13.690> webpages<00:06:14.169> it

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
addition for scrolling in webpages it

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.260 
addition for scrolling in webpages it
may<00:06:14.770> not<00:06:14.919> be<00:06:15.130> that<00:06:15.160> big<00:06:15.610> of<00:06:15.700> an<00:06:15.789> issue<00:06:15.970> with<00:06:16.180> the

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
may not be that big of an issue with the

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.150 
may not be that big of an issue with the
next<00:06:16.479> version<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.810> Safari<00:06:16.990> because<00:06:17.889> we<00:06:18.039> all

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
next version of Safari because we all

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.730 
next version of Safari because we all
know<00:06:18.370> it<00:06:18.520> uses<00:06:18.789> core<00:06:19.030> animation<00:06:19.780> well<00:06:20.110> maybe

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
know it uses core animation well maybe

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.080 
know it uses core animation well maybe
we<00:06:20.889> all<00:06:21.070> don't<00:06:21.340> know<00:06:21.400> that<00:06:21.610> but<00:06:21.700> now<00:06:21.820> you<00:06:21.880> do

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
we all don't know that but now you do

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.879 
we all don't know that but now you do
know<00:06:22.210> that<00:06:22.360> it<00:06:22.510> uses<00:06:22.780> core<00:06:22.960> animation<00:06:23.139> so<00:06:23.770> the

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
know that it uses core animation so the

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.260 
know that it uses core animation so the
scrolling<00:06:24.130> is<00:06:24.280> a<00:06:24.310> lot<00:06:24.490> better<00:06:24.700> so<00:06:24.910> maybe<00:06:25.030> that

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
scrolling is a lot better so maybe that

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.550 
scrolling is a lot better so maybe that
will<00:06:25.389> be<00:06:25.479> a<00:06:25.510> non-issue<00:06:25.750> in<00:06:26.139> the<00:06:26.200> next<00:06:26.410> version

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
will be a non-issue in the next version

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.860 
will be a non-issue in the next version
of<00:06:26.740> OS<00:06:26.950> 10<00:06:27.190> which<00:06:27.700> is<00:06:27.729> coming<00:06:28.030> out<00:06:28.180> later<00:06:28.720> this
