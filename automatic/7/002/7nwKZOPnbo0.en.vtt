00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
be crazy because we'd never actually
seen<00:01:21.540> him<00:01:21.600> without<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> suit<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
seen him without the suit on but it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740 
seen him without the suit on but it
looks<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.520> somebody<00:01:23.909> without<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.240> suit<00:01:24.540> or

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
any type of armor at least from this

any type of armor at least from this
angle<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:28.259> looks<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
angle and then what looks to be that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.499 
angle and then what looks to be that
looks<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.520> strange<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.180> me<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.390> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
looks really strange to me it kind of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.990 
looks really strange to me it kind of
looks<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:31.009> human<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.759> why<00:01:32.970> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
looks like a human I don't know why I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
looks like a human I don't know why I
got<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> human<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> mask<00:01:34.650> or

something<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
something but I know that's not what it

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.210 
something but I know that's not what it
is<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.960> maybe<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> giant<00:01:37.560> statue<00:01:37.920> or

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
is like maybe just a giant statue or

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
is like maybe just a giant statue or
something<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.689> looks<00:01:39.869> really

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
something like that but it looks really

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
something like that but it looks really
cool<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.579> lot<00:01:42.119> there's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
cool and just like really a lot there's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.819 
cool and just like really a lot there's
like<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> looks<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.229> there's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> lot<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> be

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
like it looks like there's a lot to be

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
like it looks like there's a lot to be
discovered<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> there's<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.750> nothing<00:01:46.079> on

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
discovered and there's really nothing on

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
discovered and there's really nothing on
it<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.560> far<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:47.880> found<00:01:48.329> out

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it so far but what I have just found out

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.149 
it so far but what I have just found out
and<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.470> reason<00:01:49.590> why<00:01:49.740> I'm<00:01:49.799> making<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.009> video

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and the reason why I'm making this video

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.819 
and the reason why I'm making this video
is<00:01:50.340> because<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.729> DN<00:01:51.240> our<00:01:51.600> game<00:01:51.869> informa<00:01:52.229> IGN<00:01:52.590> has

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is because I DN our game informa IGN has

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.359 
is because I DN our game informa IGN has
just<00:01:53.520> found<00:01:53.939> out<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.540> hint<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
just found out this little hint on that

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.770 
just found out this little hint on that
now<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.939> confirmed<00:01:57.240> they<00:01:57.390> could<00:01:57.509> speak

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
now then confirmed they could speak

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
now then confirmed they could speak
something<00:01:57.990> completely<00:01:58.469> off<00:01:58.590> topic<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.250> as

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
something completely off topic but as

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.760 
something completely off topic but as
you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.570> guardians<00:02:01.020> are<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> race

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you can see the guardians are not a race

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.520 
you can see the guardians are not a race

what<00:03:04.140> they<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.770> be<00:03:04.950> until<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.880> has

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
what they actually can be until this has

just been announced halo 5 Guardians so
what<00:03:08.070> they're<00:03:08.220> thinking<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.240> all

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
what they're thinking is is this is all

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.810 
what they're thinking is is this is all
some<00:03:09.540> type<00:03:09.720> somehow<00:03:10.410> connected<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.520> we<00:03:11.640> don't

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
some type somehow connected but we don't

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.150 
some type somehow connected but we don't
know<00:03:11.940> how<00:03:11.970> yet<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:13.080> as<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.680> see<00:03:13.860> it's<00:03:14.010> just

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
know how yet so as you can see it's just

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160 
know how yet so as you can see it's just
like<00:03:14.310> basically<00:03:14.730> saying<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.120> nobody<00:03:15.930> knows

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
like basically saying that nobody knows

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.080 
like basically saying that nobody knows
what<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.980> yet<00:03:17.280> or<00:03:17.730> even<00:03:17.820> if<00:03:17.940> they're

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
