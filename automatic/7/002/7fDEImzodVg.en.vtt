00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.009 
you could use two and a half inch hard
drives<00:03:28.739> or<00:03:29.090> solid-state<00:03:30.090> drives<00:03:30.419> for<00:03:30.720> extra

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
drives or solid-state drives for extra

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.099 
drives or solid-state drives for extra
performance<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:33.150> simply<00:03:33.510> slot<00:03:33.750> back<00:03:33.900> in

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
performance I just simply slot back in

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.589 
performance I just simply slot back in
very<00:03:34.530> very<00:03:34.799> easily<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.519> then<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.150> push<00:03:36.359> the

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
very very easily and then we push the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.809 
very very easily and then we push the
latch<00:03:36.750> back<00:03:37.019> down<00:03:37.319> pop<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.040> lid<00:03:38.190> back<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.430> and

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
latch back down pop the lid back on and

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.020 
latch back down pop the lid back on and
you<00:03:39.659> are<00:03:39.690> good<00:03:40.199> to<00:03:40.560> go<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.549> now<00:03:41.669> let's<00:03:41.849> have<00:03:41.970> a

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
you are good to go so now let's have a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.520 
you are good to go so now let's have a
look<00:03:42.180> round<00:03:42.359> on<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.629> side<00:03:42.900> we've<00:03:43.319> got<00:03:43.379> some

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
look round on the side we've got some

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.740 
look round on the side we've got some
quick<00:03:44.010> setup<00:03:44.430> information<00:03:44.639> here<00:03:45.299> how<00:03:45.479> to<00:03:45.540> get

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
quick setup information here how to get

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.300 
quick setup information here how to get
things<00:03:45.959> up<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.229> running<00:03:46.319> with<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.949> cloud

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
things up and running with the cloud

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.729 
things up and running with the cloud
services<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.150> then<00:03:48.810> let's<00:03:49.049> look<00:03:49.290> around<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
services and then let's look around the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.439 
services and then let's look around the
back<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.639> where<00:03:50.819> all<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> extra

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
back this is where all of the extra

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.080 
back this is where all of the extra
ports<00:03:51.810> are<00:03:52.159> so<00:03:53.159> we've<00:03:53.280> got<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.489> input<00:03:53.849> here

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
ports are so we've got the input here

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.969 
ports are so we've got the input here
for<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.540> power<00:03:54.750> supply<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.739> get<00:03:55.889> that

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
for the power supply you get that

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.460 
for the power supply you get that
included<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.729> box<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.120> course<00:03:57.329> we've<00:03:58.290> also

mentioned<00:04:18.570> before<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.169> idea<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.799> and

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
mentioned before the idea of a and

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.670 
mentioned before the idea of a and
there's<00:04:20.340> normally<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.329> just<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.019> centrally

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
there's normally is just to centrally

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.620 
there's normally is just to centrally
store<00:04:23.039> your<00:04:23.400> files<00:04:23.729> so<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.210> would<00:04:24.300> put<00:04:24.479> all<00:04:24.599> of

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
store your files so you would put all of

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.810 
store your files so you would put all of
your<00:04:24.900> work<00:04:25.500> files<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:26.099> here<00:04:26.400> or<00:04:26.580> with<00:04:26.700> your

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
then you can access all of that content

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.119 
then you can access all of that content
on<00:04:33.060> another<00:04:33.990> device<00:04:34.199> so<00:04:34.680> perhaps<00:04:34.949> is<00:04:35.099> a
