00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
noise but do you know it better than I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.010 
noise but do you know it better than I
do<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:28.280> there<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.000> go<00:01:29.210> they<00:01:29.479> go<00:01:29.630> you're<00:01:29.840> here

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
do this there you go they go you're here

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.690

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.279 
like it
they<00:01:31.149> block<00:01:31.360> out<00:01:31.539> all<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.810> background<00:01:32.229> noise

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
they block out all the background noise

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.990 
they block out all the background noise
and<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:32.860> all<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.159> hear<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.369> your<00:01:33.549> music<00:01:33.850> there

plus they

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.090 
plus they
but<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:40.520> don't<00:01:40.640> fall<00:01:40.760> out

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.410 

really<00:01:48.100> are<00:01:48.190> comfortable<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.970> you<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.360> you

really are comfortable and you and you

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.060 
really are comfortable and you and you
make<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.570> great<00:01:49.750> point<00:01:49.870> because<00:01:50.230> you<00:01:50.740> don't

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
make a great point because you don't

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.340 
make a great point because you don't
have<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.520> turn<00:01:51.760> them<00:01:52.000> up<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:52.870> able<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.110> hear

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
have to turn them up to be able to hear

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.980 
have to turn them up to be able to hear
everything<00:01:53.710> very<00:01:54.520> clearly<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:55.150> very<00:01:55.720> low

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
everything very clearly a very low

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.450 
everything very clearly a very low
volume<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:56.830> we'll<00:01:56.979> hear<00:01:57.220> a<00:01:57.250> thing

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
volume and so we'll hear a thing

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
volume and so we'll hear a thing

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
connection look at that yep so now it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.030 
connection look at that yep so now it
goes<00:04:40.480> straight<00:04:40.630> into<00:04:40.930> your<00:04:41.020> USB<00:04:41.350> five<00:04:41.770> past
