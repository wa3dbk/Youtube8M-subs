as<00:00:54.809> modern<00:00:55.289> warfare<00:00:55.440> 2<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.760> played<00:00:57.120> with

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
as modern warfare 2 but I played with

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.660 
as modern warfare 2 but I played with
team<00:00:58.199> tactical<00:00:58.649> settings<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> little

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
team tactical settings so it's a little

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
team tactical settings so it's a little
different<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.149> me<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:01.199> why<00:01:01.320> you'll<00:01:01.500> see

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
different for me that's why you'll see

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.479 
different for me that's why you'll see
me<00:01:01.829> try<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> duck<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.239> knife<00:01:03.949> but<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
me try to duck in a knife but on the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.960 
me try to duck in a knife but on the
sniper<00:01:05.790> rifle<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.070> don't<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.909> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
sniper rifle it's kind of I don't know I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.399

don't<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.780> probably<00:01:10.229> cuz<00:01:10.350> they

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
don't really like it probably cuz they

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.460 
don't really like it probably cuz they
don't<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.740> scope<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.780> probably

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
don't have a scope on it and probably

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.300 
don't have a scope on it and probably
cuz<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> stuck<00:01:14.100> too<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.500> well<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.979> stuck
