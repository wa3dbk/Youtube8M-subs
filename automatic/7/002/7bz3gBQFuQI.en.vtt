out<00:04:23.000> since<00:04:23.240> they're<00:04:23.510> like<00:04:23.630> cousins<00:04:24.130> in<00:04:25.130> the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
out since they're like cousins in the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.330 
out since they're like cousins in the
Dino<00:04:25.580> world<00:04:26.350> because<00:04:27.350> like<00:04:27.620> they're<00:04:28.010> like

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
Dino world because like they're like

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.550 
Dino world because like they're like
pretty<00:04:28.880> much<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.180> same<00:04:29.390> except<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.260> Cerreta

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
pretty much the same except the Cerreta

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.900 
pretty much the same except the Cerreta
source<00:04:30.800> has<00:04:31.010> three<00:04:31.490> horns<00:04:32.270> instead<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.840> two<00:04:33.910> so

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
source has three horns instead of two so

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.430 
source has three horns instead of two so
yeah<00:04:36.490> he<00:04:37.490> actually<00:04:37.610> has<00:04:38.060> like<00:04:38.360> three<00:04:38.930> horns<00:04:39.200> in

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
yeah he actually has like three horns in

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.420 
yeah he actually has like three horns in
the<00:04:39.530> corn<00:04:39.770> source<00:04:40.010> has<00:04:40.670> two<00:04:41.240> horns<00:04:42.430> that's

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
the corn source has two horns that's

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.200 
the corn source has two horns that's
pretty<00:04:44.090> obvious<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:46.300> yeah<00:04:49.090> they're<00:04:50.090> pretty

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
pretty obvious so yeah they're pretty

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:58.930 
pretty obvious so yeah they're pretty
has<00:04:50.450> two<00:04:50.660> horns<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:56.500> um<00:04:57.500> yes<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.430> feet<00:04:58.670> are

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.610 
spikes on them so yeah that's right a
source<00:05:39.230> and<00:05:40.840> this<00:05:41.840> is<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.140> another

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
source and this is the another

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.470 
source and this is the another
straightest<00:05:43.220> source<00:05:43.430> not<00:05:43.850> on<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.030> wipe<00:05:44.210> on

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
straightest source not on the wipe on

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.930 
straightest source not on the wipe on
the<00:05:44.600> south<00:05:44.810> but<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:45.830> feels<00:05:45.980> smaller<00:05:46.400> like<00:05:46.669> that

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
the south but it feels smaller like that

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.330 
the south but it feels smaller like that
you<00:05:47.360> tell<00:05:47.570> me<00:05:47.690> if<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:48.020> would<00:05:48.530> work<00:05:48.770> for<00:05:49.250> a

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
you tell me if that would work for a

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.510 
you tell me if that would work for a
serrated<00:05:49.550> source<00:05:50.230> so<00:05:51.230> I<00:05:51.260> start<00:05:52.100> on<00:05:52.160> the<00:05:52.220> Y<00:05:52.340> from

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
serrated source so I start on the Y from

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
serrated source so I start on the Y from
metal<00:05:52.910> and<00:05:53.830> this<00:05:54.830> is<00:05:55.010> one<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:55.220> my<00:05:55.460> small<00:05:56.210> connor

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
metal and this is one of my small connor

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.830 
metal and this is one of my small connor
Tauruses<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.430> I<00:05:58.430> think<00:05:58.729> this<00:05:59.150> is<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.419> good<00:05:59.600> size

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
Tauruses I I think this is a good size

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.940 
Tauruses I I think this is a good size
for<00:05:59.870> a<00:06:00.140> baby<00:06:00.410> Carnotaurus<00:06:01.120> for<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.150> juvenile<00:06:02.660> I

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
for a baby Carnotaurus for a juvenile I

for a baby Carnotaurus for a juvenile I
know<00:06:03.950> baby<00:06:04.729> kind<00:06:05.540> of<00:06:05.600> horses<00:06:05.900> are<00:06:06.110> like<00:06:06.200> that

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
know baby kind of horses are like that

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.760 
know baby kind of horses are like that
small<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:07.370> a<00:06:07.690> mother<00:06:08.690> Carnotaurus<00:06:09.350> but<00:06:09.740> I

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
small to a mother Carnotaurus but I

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.790 
small to a mother Carnotaurus but I
think<00:06:10.160> this<00:06:10.220> is<00:06:10.310> a<00:06:10.340> good<00:06:10.490> size<00:06:10.640> for<00:06:10.669> a<00:06:10.850> juvenile

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
think this is a good size for a juvenile

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.020 
think this is a good size for a juvenile
so<00:06:12.800> yeah<00:06:12.950> juvenile<00:06:13.580> kind<00:06:13.760> of<00:06:13.820> Taurus

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
so yeah juvenile kind of Taurus

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.280 
so yeah juvenile kind of Taurus
and<00:06:16.870> this<00:06:17.020> is<00:06:17.230> the<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:18.610> Disney's<00:06:19.570> dinosaur

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
and this is the the Disney's dinosaur

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.160 
and this is the the Disney's dinosaur
Carnotaurus<00:06:21.240> this<00:06:22.240> looks<00:06:22.480> good<00:06:22.750> for<00:06:22.960> light

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
Carnotaurus this looks good for light

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.690 
Carnotaurus this looks good for light
this<00:06:23.470> could<00:06:23.710> be<00:06:23.830> you<00:06:24.100> know<00:06:24.220> if<00:06:24.340> you've<00:06:24.520> seen

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
this could be you know if you've seen

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.010 
this could be you know if you've seen
the<00:06:24.820> movie<00:06:24.850> this<00:06:25.270> could<00:06:25.450> be<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:25.630> smaller

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
the movie this could be the smaller

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.470 
the movie this could be the smaller
Carnotaurus<00:06:26.820> this<00:06:27.820> could<00:06:28.030> be<00:06:28.090> the<00:06:28.210> smaller

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
Carnotaurus this could be the smaller

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.390 
Carnotaurus this could be the smaller
Carnotaurus<00:06:28.930> that<00:06:29.110> dies<00:06:29.350> like<00:06:29.770> in<00:06:29.980> the<00:06:30.160> cave

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
Carnotaurus that dies like in the cave

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.700 
Carnotaurus that dies like in the cave
and<00:06:30.700> this<00:06:31.540> could<00:06:31.780> be<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:31.930> kind<00:06:32.200> of<00:06:32.320> tourists

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
and this could be the kind of tourists

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.640 
and this could be the kind of tourists
that<00:06:32.740> uh<00:06:33.450> survives<00:06:34.450> and<00:06:34.780> dies<00:06:34.930> in<00:06:35.140> the<00:06:35.260> end<00:06:35.410> of

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
that uh survives and dies in the end of

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.580 
that uh survives and dies in the end of
the<00:06:35.860> movie<00:06:36.180> so<00:06:37.180> yeah<00:06:37.420> they're<00:06:38.200> pretty<00:06:38.440> much

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
the movie so yeah they're pretty much

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.370 
the movie so yeah they're pretty much
the<00:06:38.800> same<00:06:39.010> I<00:06:39.400> think<00:06:40.000> yeah<00:06:40.300> they're<00:06:41.200> pretty

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
the same I think yeah they're pretty

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.710 
the same I think yeah they're pretty
much<00:06:41.530> the<00:06:41.590> same<00:06:41.830> I<00:06:41.950> don't<00:06:42.100> see<00:06:42.190> no<00:06:42.280> difference

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
much the same I don't see no difference

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.910 
much the same I don't see no difference
except<00:06:43.720> this<00:06:43.840> one<00:06:43.990> has<00:06:44.140> more<00:06:44.290> texture<00:06:44.740> and<00:06:44.770> all

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
except this one has more texture and all
