00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
coming in the other microphone because

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.220 
coming in the other microphone because
the<00:03:00.060> phantom<00:03:00.360> powers<00:03:00.630> turned<00:03:00.810> off<00:03:01.019> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
the phantom powers turned off and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.630 
the phantom powers turned off and
therefore<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.709> condenser<00:03:02.250> microphone

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
therefore the condenser microphone

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.800

on<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:58.109> side<00:03:58.320> I've<00:03:58.470> noticed<00:03:58.769> when<00:03:58.890> recording

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
on that side I've noticed when recording

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
on the second computer but honestly I

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.090 
on the second computer but honestly I
think<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.230> may<00:04:01.350> be<00:04:01.410> coming<00:04:01.709> from<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
think that may be coming from the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.190 
think that may be coming from the
condenser<00:04:02.340> microphone<00:04:03.000> since<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.840> picks<00:04:04.049> up

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
condenser microphone since it picks up

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.050 
condenser microphone since it picks up
more<00:04:04.350> than<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> dynamic<00:04:05.160> rather<00:04:05.670> than<00:04:05.910> from

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
more than the dynamic rather than from

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.090 
more than the dynamic rather than from

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.000 
the interface itself this interface has
virtually<00:04:08.370> no<00:04:08.910> circuit<00:04:09.420> noise<00:04:09.630> which<00:04:10.560> is

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
virtually no circuit noise which is

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.890 
virtually no circuit noise which is
frankly<00:04:11.340> quite<00:04:11.730> amazing<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.269> other<00:04:12.540> mixers

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
frankly quite amazing the other mixers

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.240 
frankly quite amazing the other mixers
that<00:04:13.109> I've<00:04:13.230> used<00:04:13.410> pretty<00:04:13.590> much<00:04:13.680> all<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:13.980> them

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
that I've used pretty much all of them

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.710 
that I've used pretty much all of them
have<00:04:14.430> their<00:04:14.609> own<00:04:14.670> noise<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.329> some<00:04:15.480> sort

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
have their own noise of some sort

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.060 
have their own noise of some sort
literally<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.500> could<00:04:16.620> have<00:04:16.739> everything

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
literally you could have everything

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.890 
literally you could have everything
muted<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.700> they're<00:04:17.910> still<00:04:18.209> electrical

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
muted and they're still electrical

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.469 
muted and they're still electrical
hissing<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.410> noise<00:04:19.530> going<00:04:19.829> back<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.220> the

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
hissing and noise going back in the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.490 
hissing and noise going back in the
behringer<00:04:21.479> ones<00:04:21.690> I've<00:04:21.870> used<00:04:21.900> before<00:04:22.229> and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
behringer ones I've used before and

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.150 
behringer ones I've used before and
things<00:04:22.680> like<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.310> this

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
things like that so this

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.310 
things like that so this
is<00:04:24.220> amazing<00:04:24.790> so<00:04:25.600> what's<00:04:25.780> not<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.930> love<00:04:26.170> about

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
is amazing so what's not to love about

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.680 
is amazing so what's not to love about
this<00:04:26.530> interface<00:04:26.920> well<00:04:27.310> obviously<00:04:28.270> not<00:04:28.630> a

this interface well obviously not a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.020 
this interface well obviously not a

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
that so it's just a matter of making

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.550 
that so it's just a matter of making
sure<00:04:49.480> you<00:04:49.570> put<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:49.990> straight<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.470> don't

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
sure you put it in straight and don't

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.960 
sure you put it in straight and don't
pull<00:04:50.770> on<00:04:50.920> it<00:04:51.040> too<00:04:51.130> much<00:04:51.310> which<00:04:51.550> kind<00:04:51.790> of<00:04:51.880> you

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
pull on it too much which kind of you

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.240 
pull on it too much which kind of you
have<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.210> do<00:04:52.330> with<00:04:52.510> any<00:04:52.690> audio<00:04:53.440> jacks<00:04:53.740> anyway

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
have to do with any audio jacks anyway
