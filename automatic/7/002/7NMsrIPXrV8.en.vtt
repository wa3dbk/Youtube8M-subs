00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.250
 This is my 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:13.830
 machine for distributing disks that he from 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.990
 represents himself 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.440
 welded 2 parallel two pipes 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:28.960
 profile 20 to 40 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:32.529
 it means that it is for the hammer for the lever and 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.170
 emphasis on which they rely sound 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:40.690
 move can be adjusted under 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.879
 different means the diameter of the saw emphasis this one 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.249
 here is beveled at a certain angle 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.089
 so under pressure 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:52.179
 leverage means certain 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:57.850
 wiring angle 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:01:02.769
 well let's say making this bevel experienced 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:07.890
 by picking up numbers I donâ€™t know the disk itself 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.890
 I imagine a nut sharpened 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:20.500
 mean axis 20 millimeter with thread pitch 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.070
 a half 5 6 bolts for 8, too, turned into 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.640
 sweat from the side that's not seen that 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.010
 grab made here the disc is drilled 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.760
 small turns good drill 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:41.050
 drilled then it is done here 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.560
 such a drill for this is a drill with 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.560
 pobedit soldering 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.050
 everything is then delayed 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.240
 Well, as if some kind of movement 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.230
 bolts I do not notice that is, there are 5 cubes 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.360
 birch sawed almost movement 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.880
 Bolt did not notice that is holding 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.400
 reliably enough 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.420
 here 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.420
 such a system
