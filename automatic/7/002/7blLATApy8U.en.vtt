program<00:00:20.150> for<00:00:20.390> running<00:00:20.600> tournaments<00:00:21.080> called

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
program for running tournaments called

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.590 
program for running tournaments called
sths<00:00:21.980> I<00:00:22.340> really<00:00:22.940> listened<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.270> there's<00:00:23.480> an

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
sths I really listened to there's an

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.420 
sths I really listened to there's an
official<00:00:23.960> code<00:00:24.170> on<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.350> program<00:00:24.770> called<00:00:25.010> mantis

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
official code on a program called mantis

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.400 
official code on a program called mantis
and<00:00:25.460> I<00:00:25.700> actually<00:00:25.820> also<00:00:26.180> have<00:00:26.540> this<00:00:26.720> but<00:00:27.350> I

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
and I actually also have this but I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.080 
and I actually also have this but I
believe<00:00:27.439> that<00:00:27.800> this<00:00:27.920> program<00:00:28.279> is<00:00:28.310> much<00:00:28.820> much

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
believe that this program is much much

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.730 
believe that this program is much much
easier<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.540> use<00:00:29.660> especially<00:00:30.110> for<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
easier to use especially for the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.250 
easier to use especially for the
purposes<00:00:31.189> of<00:00:31.250> an<00:00:31.460> amateur<00:00:31.939> tournament<00:00:32.419> and<00:00:33.140> it

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
purposes of an amateur tournament and it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.410 
purposes of an amateur tournament and it
completes<00:00:33.620> completely<00:00:34.489> defeats<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.940> for<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
completes completely defeats the for the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.880 
completes completely defeats the for the
need<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.550> have<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.579> pirated<00:00:38.090> copy<00:00:38.150> of<00:00:38.570> mantis<00:00:39.020> so

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
need to have a pirated copy of mantis so

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.620

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
around floor you'll have a top four so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.950 
around floor you'll have a top four so
that's<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:38.400> around<00:02:39.400> four<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.540> here's<00:02:40.780> what's

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
that's a around four so here's what's

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.650 
that's a around four so here's what's
gonna<00:02:41.050> happen<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.880> for<00:02:43.150> some<00:02:43.330> reason<00:02:43.600> you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
gonna happen and for some reason you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.260 
gonna happen and for some reason you
didn't<00:02:43.900> make<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.470> I'm<00:02:44.560> going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.770> swap<00:02:44.980> out

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
didn't make it so I'm going to swap out

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.490 
didn't make it so I'm going to swap out
so<00:02:46.270> what<00:02:46.600> you're<00:02:46.720> gonna<00:02:46.780> want<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.140> do<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.380> just

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
seat the seat it's the the first to play

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.170 
seat the seat it's the the first to play
the<00:02:51.550> first<00:02:51.760> two<00:02:52.030> groups<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.390> players<00:02:53.550> right<00:02:54.550> at

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the first two groups of players right at

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.810 
the first two groups of players right at
the<00:02:55.300> top<00:02:55.510> table<00:02:55.960> wanted<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.470> able<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.730> I'm

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
the top table wanted to able to but I'm

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.900 
the top table wanted to able to but I'm
gonna<00:02:57.940> do<00:02:58.150> since<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.600> had<00:02:58.750> like<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.080> glitch<00:02:59.470> is

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
gonna do since we had like a glitch is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.310 
gonna do since we had like a glitch is
I'm<00:03:00.910> just<00:03:01.030> gonna<00:03:01.240> do<00:03:01.450> with<00:03:01.600> logical<00:03:02.110> I'm<00:03:02.200> going

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
I'm just gonna do with logical I'm going

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.050 
I'm just gonna do with logical I'm going
to<00:03:02.380> swap<00:03:02.650> out<00:03:02.860> play<00:03:03.070> or<00:03:03.220> seven<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.640> player<00:03:03.790> two

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
to swap out play or seven and player two

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.320 
to swap out play or seven and player two
so<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.740> top<00:03:05.980> four<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.310> would<00:03:06.580> see<00:03:06.760> player<00:03:07.030> five

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
so for top four I would see player five

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.780 
so for top four I would see player five
versus<00:03:07.750> player<00:03:07.959> 3<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.530> player<00:03:08.920> two<00:03:09.370> bridges

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
versus player 3 and player two bridges

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.870 
versus player 3 and player two bridges
player<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:11.370> then<00:03:12.370> it'll<00:03:12.520> be<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.670> simple

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
player one and then it'll be a simple

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.610 
player one and then it'll be a simple
bracket<00:03:13.480> like<00:03:13.630> whoever<00:03:13.870> wins<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.350> duel<00:03:14.500> with

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
bracket like whoever wins the duel with

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.760 
bracket like whoever wins the duel with
player<00:03:14.800> 3<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.130> player<00:03:15.280> 5<00:03:16.200> let's<00:03:17.200> say<00:03:17.380> that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
player 3 and player 5 let's say that

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.610 
player 3 and player 5 let's say that
player<00:03:18.100> five<00:03:18.370> when<00:03:18.959> anyone<00:03:19.959> wins<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.410> players

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
player five when anyone wins and players

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.580 
player five when anyone wins and players
have<00:03:20.830> enough<00:03:21.010> layer<00:03:21.190> 1<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:22.840> kind<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.200> wind<00:03:23.380> so

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
have enough layer 1 it's kind of wind so

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.100 
have enough layer 1 it's kind of wind so
let's<00:03:23.739> say<00:03:23.860> player<00:03:24.100> 1<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.600> final<00:03:25.900> rounds

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
let's say player 1 so the final rounds

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.890 
let's say player 1 so the final rounds
been<00:03:26.260> player<00:03:26.530> 1<00:03:26.769> versus<00:03:27.130> player<00:03:27.370> 5<00:03:27.900> exactly

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
been player 1 versus player 5 exactly

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.410 
been player 1 versus player 5 exactly
what<00:03:29.260> makes<00:03:29.500> just<00:03:29.769> logical<00:03:30.310> sense<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:30.820> really

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420
