00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
because it really arose isn't very

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.759 
because it really arose isn't very
difficult<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:19.080> start<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:19.619> doing<00:00:19.650> your<00:00:20.130> pedals

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
difficult you start by doing your pedals

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:29.900 
difficult you start by doing your pedals
pedals<00:00:22.769> overlap<00:00:26.210> you<00:00:27.210> start<00:00:27.539> by<00:00:27.720> doing<00:00:28.910> also

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
pedals overlap you start by doing also

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.630 
pedals overlap you start by doing also
the<00:00:30.060> bottom<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> rose<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> leaves<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the bottom of the rose the leaves that

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920 
the bottom of the rose the leaves that
are<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.149> bottom<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.570> then<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> can

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
are from the bottom and then you can

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.479 
are from the bottom and then you can
create<00:00:34.050> any<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:35.149> stem<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> rose<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
create any kind of stem for the rose and

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.040 
create any kind of stem for the rose and
then<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.879> tops<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.450> tops<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.809> very

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
then you do your tops your tops is very

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
then you do your tops your tops is very
simple<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.770> matter<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.480> bunch<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
simple it's just a matter of a bunch of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.549 
simple it's just a matter of a bunch of
interlocking<00:00:43.469> circles<00:00:47.270> like<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.289> might

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
interlocking circles like this you might

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
interlocking circles like this you might
have<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.760> comes<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.570> like

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
have one that comes a little bit like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
have one that comes a little bit like
this<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:53.280> comes<00:00:53.520> from<00:00:53.760> behind<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:56.300> then

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this one that comes from behind and then

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.920 
this one that comes from behind and then
one<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> fall<00:00:58.260> apart<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:59.280> I

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.649 

also<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:04.890> leaves<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:08.090> make<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.360> seem

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
also put in some leaves to make it seem

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.990 
also put in some leaves to make it seem
like<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.710> Rose<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.159> actually<00:01:11.549> still<00:01:11.970> alive

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
like your Rose is actually still alive

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.330 
like your Rose is actually still alive
you<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:12.960> dead<00:01:13.140> roses<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.770> then

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you don't want some dead roses and then

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.740 
you don't want some dead roses and then
what<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> wind<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.939> doing<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.420> maybe

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
what I wind up doing is it maybe

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.850 
what I wind up doing is it maybe
sometimes<00:01:16.409> along<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> way<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.310> put<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.150> rose

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
sometimes along the way I put in a rose

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.030 
sometimes along the way I put in a rose
that<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.159> full<00:01:20.490> bloom<00:01:21.740> those<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:22.920> usually

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that is in full bloom those are usually

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.289 
that is in full bloom those are usually
a<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.700> difficult<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.240> not

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
a little bit more difficult but not

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
a little bit more difficult but not
really<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.860> realize<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
really you just have to realize that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.990 
really you just have to realize that
they're<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.740> circles<00:01:28.909> amongst<00:01:29.909> each

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
they're all just circles amongst each

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.980 
they're all just circles amongst each
other<00:01:33.890> it's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.979> little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.490> further<00:01:35.759> open

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.390 

and<00:01:39.890> again<00:01:40.370> you've<00:01:41.000> got<00:01:41.030> your<00:01:41.619> leaves<00:01:42.619> here

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.810 

and<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:47.690> can<00:01:47.840> do<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.080> with<00:01:48.229> one<00:01:48.260> color<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:51.790> had<00:01:52.790> a

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
and you can do it with one color I had a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.340 
and you can do it with one color I had a
lot<00:01:53.060> more<00:01:53.090> time<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.690> could<00:01:53.810> show<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.049> how<00:01:54.200> you

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
lot more time I could show you how you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.010 
lot more time I could show you how you
can<00:01:54.530> basically<00:01:54.710> create<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:56.420> color<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:56.900> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
can basically create the color of the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.719 
can basically create the color of the
Roses<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:59.649> the<00:02:00.649> depth<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.220> need<00:02:01.460> to

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
Roses and the depth that you need to

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.490 
Roses and the depth that you need to
create<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:02.000> really<00:02:02.240> beautiful<00:02:02.600> rose<00:02:02.750> but

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
create a really beautiful rose but

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.649 
create a really beautiful rose but
that's<00:02:03.649> pretty<00:02:03.890> simple<00:02:04.100> once<00:02:05.030> again<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:05.540> is

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
that's pretty simple once again this is

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.070 
that's pretty simple once again this is
Carlos<00:02:05.960> Navarro<00:02:06.229> thank<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.649> for<00:02:06.770> watching
