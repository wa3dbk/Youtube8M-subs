there<00:00:06.720> transcription<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.010> link<00:00:08.220> under

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
there transcription on the link under

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:35.479 
there transcription on the link under
the<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:08.970> let's<00:00:09.660> check<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:09.990> out<00:00:34.100> now<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.309> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the video let's check it out now this is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.520 
the video let's check it out now this is
a<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.969> really<00:00:36.090> cool<00:00:36.270> egg<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.230> fairly

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
a really really cool egg and it's fairly

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.799 
a really really cool egg and it's fairly
challenging<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> expanded<00:00:39.690> all

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
challenging because it is expanded all

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.470 
challenging because it is expanded all
over<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> string<00:00:40.559> set<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.210> it's<00:00:42.210> really

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
over the string set and it's really

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.819 
over the string set and it's really
important<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> you've<00:00:43.020> nailed<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.440> muting

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
important that you've nailed a muting

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
important that you've nailed a muting
technique<00:00:43.860> before<00:00:44.489> tackling<00:00:45.480> things<00:00:45.690> like

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
technique before tackling things like

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.229 
technique before tackling things like
that<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.190> simple<00:00:47.730> way<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.120> about

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that and a really simple way to go about

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.369 
that and a really simple way to go about
it<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.530> stop<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.950> picking<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> scale<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.379> try

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it is to stop up picking a scale and try

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.700 
it is to stop up picking a scale and try
playing<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.010> scale<00:00:54.140> accenting<00:00:55.140> every<00:00:55.500> note

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
playing this scale accenting every note

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.430 
playing this scale accenting every note
by<00:00:56.340> doing<00:00:56.579> quite<00:00:56.850> wide<00:00:57.210> motions<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> making

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
by doing quite wide motions and making

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.410 
by doing quite wide motions and making
sure<00:00:58.710> you're<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.219> hearing<00:00:59.520> any<00:00:59.820> other<00:01:00.180> note

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
sure you're not hearing any other note

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
sure you're not hearing any other note
but<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.719> ones<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> scale

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
but the ones the one out of the scale

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
but the ones the one out of the scale
because<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> think<00:01:03.510> about

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
because what you have to think about

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.719 
because what you have to think about
funk<00:01:04.080> music<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.589> very<00:01:04.769> expressive<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.640> it's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
funk music is very expressive and it's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
funk music is very expressive and it's
all<00:01:05.880> about<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> group<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.659> cannot<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.200> too

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
all about the group so you cannot be too

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
all about the group so you cannot be too
careful<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.670> able<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.970> play

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
careful so you want to be able to play

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
careful so you want to be able to play
freely<00:01:10.549> without<00:01:11.549> having<00:01:12.180> any<00:01:12.990> noise<00:01:13.290> in

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
freely without having any noise in

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.850 
freely without having any noise in
between<00:01:13.890> noise<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:15.270> let<00:01:15.810> me<00:01:15.930> explain<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
between noise so let me explain the the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
between noise so let me explain the the
riff<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.400> we're<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> start<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
riff now we're going to start and I'm a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.740 
riff now we're going to start and I'm a
on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.740> fret<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.670> low<00:01:20.759> E<00:01:21.119> string<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> I'll

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
on the fret of the low E string so I'll

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.640 
on the fret of the low E string so I'll
started<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> Down<00:01:25.409> stroke

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
started with a Down stroke

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.640 
started with a Down stroke
and<00:01:28.130> then<00:01:28.970> what<00:01:29.090> I'm<00:01:29.180> doing<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.630> I'm<00:01:29.960> playing<00:01:30.170> G

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
and then what I'm doing is I'm playing G

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.980 
and then what I'm doing is I'm playing G
on<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.670> eighth<00:01:31.850> fret<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.270> b-string<00:01:32.510> so<00:01:32.870> as

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
on the eighth fret of the b-string so as

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.650 
on the eighth fret of the b-string so as
you<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.290> see<00:01:33.440> it's<00:01:33.560> quite<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.740> big<00:01:33.950> leap<00:01:34.660> with

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
you can see it's quite a big leap with

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:46.240 
you can see it's quite a big leap with
an<00:01:35.780> upstroke<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:42.340> yeah<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:44.360> then<00:01:45.250> handing

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
always D on the g string and c on the g

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.690 
always D on the g string and c on the g
string<00:01:58.960> an<00:01:59.960> A<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.740> D<00:02:01.250> string<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:03.340> then<00:02:04.340> G<00:02:04.640> on

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
string an A and D string and then G on

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
back to C on the g string so we've got

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:36.610 
back to C on the g string so we've got
that<00:02:19.700> little<00:02:19.880> melody<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
first part and the second part starts on

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.020 
first part and the second part starts on
a<00:02:39.080> again<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:42.950> had<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> G<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.880> B

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
a again and we had on the G on the B

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.570 
a again and we had on the G on the B
string<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.590> g<00:02:49.010> string<00:02:50.800> then<00:02:51.800> C<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> g

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
string the g string then C on the g

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.530 
string the g string then C on the g
string<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> D<00:02:55.520> string
