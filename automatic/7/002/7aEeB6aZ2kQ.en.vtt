00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:09.190
 Speak personal beauty and fiddle here. 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.530
 bringing you a video of molds and 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.930
 skins for those who can not serve to 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.359
 to change something in the game is a costume 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.160
 change graphics and there are several 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.079
 on youtube tutorials 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.720
 It's very easy and anyone can do it 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:24.880
 and even install in some cases 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.339
 You can put a new clothes on 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.769
 some character or putting off a weapon 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.720
 known in some other video game 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.490
 I'm going to show you today. 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.930
 some elements of the assassin saga 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.930
 believe in other games 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.300
 in the saga in if you do not find much at 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.550
 Sometimes it 's a mote of graphics or some 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.190
 change of clothes but that's all 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.560
 now in other games like prototype 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.840
 skyrim and mostly gta 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.850
 you can find some corners that 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.310
 leaves the main character with the clothes 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.950
 order of murderers in the case of 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.020
 skyrim modified it very realistic 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.520
 you can notice that it is practically the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.019
 or color 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.920
 if it were not for the ugly face of 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.920
 character 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.720
 on the team itself was not very realistic 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.910
 as in skyrim but only to beat the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.160
 Look, you can already notice that the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.750
 Alex is expected in the clothes that 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.750
 killers use in the game 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.520
 now gta san andreas the thing starts to 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.440
 to get better 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.410
 was inserted practically all the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.350
 characters from the whole saga as leonardo 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.600
 10 hand and even the Templars 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.080
 Imagine you walking the streets stealing 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.300
 cars doing that dirt br br com 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.750
 a character from assassin's creed a lot 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.750
 Crazy 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.459
 if it was not enough, imagine 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.860
 still has the ability to parkour 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.260
 yes, that's right, of course it does not stay so 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.629
 realistic as well as in the game but 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.049
 possible was cool bag 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.049
 just there 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.060
 gta 4 also you will find the 15 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.220
 assassin's creed this time with graphics 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.290
 and gameplay much better and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.290
 consequently becomes more realistic 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.810
 and last but not least 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.880
 minecraft has many and / or tubes that 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.069
 make this type of series with 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.720
 assassin's creed in the game I do not Manjo 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.700
 a lot of that so I can not give my 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.130
 opinion but I could not 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.660
 that both the animations and the 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.660
 gameplay looked cool 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.380
