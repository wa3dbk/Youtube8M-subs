00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
know that's not good that was weird

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
know that's not good that was weird
I<00:02:59.540> know<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:00.709> good<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.250> uh<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:03.380> know

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
I know it's not good but uh you know

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.850 
I know it's not good but uh you know
whatever<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:04.190> mean<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:05.380> don't<00:03:06.380> really<00:03:06.650> need

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
whatever I mean I don't really need

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.120 
whatever I mean I don't really need
Islander<00:03:07.310> they're<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:07.970> way<00:03:08.209> too<00:03:08.270> expensive

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
Islander they're just way too expensive

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.060 
Islander they're just way too expensive
so<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.190> think<00:03:10.310> what<00:03:10.970> was<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.120> going<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.330> do<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.920> was

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
so I think what was I going to do it was

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.520 
so I think what was I going to do it was
like<00:03:13.220> diamond<00:03:13.640> blue<00:03:13.850> or<00:03:14.060> something

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.820 

I've<00:03:18.040> seen

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
I've seen

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.339 
I've seen
yeah<00:03:20.830> that's<00:03:21.099> pretty<00:03:21.370> cool<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.640> guess<00:03:22.300> should<00:03:23.290> I

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
yeah that's pretty cool I guess should I

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.869 
yeah that's pretty cool I guess should I
get<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
get it

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.850 
get it
it's<00:03:24.879> actually<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.750> much<00:03:25.959> usually<00:03:26.440> it's

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
it's actually not that much usually it's

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.360 
it's actually not that much usually it's
a<00:03:27.099> lot<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.400> money<00:03:28.530> maybe<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.769> on<00:03:29.920> sale<00:03:30.160> or

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
a lot of money maybe it's on sale or

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.479 
a lot of money maybe it's on sale or
something<00:03:31.319> okay<00:03:32.319> so<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.650> crew<00:03:32.860> emblem<00:03:33.250> that

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
something okay so the crew emblem that

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.460 
something okay so the crew emblem that
would<00:03:33.700> look<00:03:33.910> really<00:03:34.239> nice<00:03:34.569> I<00:03:34.900> really<00:03:35.230> want<00:03:35.379> to

would look really nice I really want to
put<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.800> on<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:37.239> problem<00:03:37.599> is<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:37.900> really

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
put that on the problem is it's really

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.229 
put that on the problem is it's really
expensive<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.730> look<00:03:42.910> closely

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
expensive and if you look closely

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.170 
expensive and if you look closely
there's<00:03:43.840> like<00:03:44.340> there's<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.400> lines<00:03:45.760> around
