00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.170
 until they control again with m23 Cen today there is one 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.179
 Percent you can not do it to them 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.909
 as a car that's the way it is 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.919
 Rockets can shoot down in masses 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.050
 then all the people have to follow 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.220
 that sounds pretty complicated and it actually is 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.230
 but to 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.080
 the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 In principle, all of this really works for the most part only with one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.479
 a single each 2 Tel 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.650
 around 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.910
 if you idiots are so right time is so fun all the more 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.620
 more important, it seems Abstoss 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 "He's gone," he says 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.320
 then you should be correct then percent 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 so far feeds 8 to 12 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.130
 definitely sort 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.160
 around 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.370
 watch that he did not let percent go into servers and then 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.670
 a Gilli without rockets on people Steinbauer I think Kack to Take 2 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 2 met 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.130
 around 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.070
 so yours 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.160
 the chip 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.310
 because I did not do it myself, I did more 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.410
 by a buddy in front of percent 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.340
 yes that was 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.999
 brazen thieves League or is the counter support in front 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 was supposed to be numbers too 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.300
 the percent definitely 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.860
 made and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.170
 Slade Sweet continues to move around 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.749
 I think I poster where you have the description of the whole chaotic ca 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.120
 Believing that sticking Dan Prof here Allegri are her talisman 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.500
 Car approx 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.640
 Andrej w 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.060
 good old gay 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.770
 Tel the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.480
 at the networks new versions of hotlines and again is India 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.960
 so far always the worst 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.270
 The worst model has somehow leaves three bars off actually 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.729
 if you co-patate the office Slate 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.619
 Heco RÃ¤te looks horny more 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.869
 he looks more horny and the elite unit KSK outside does not even have 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:16.849
 engine 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.079
 or father 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.409
 but he concluded that &amp; Day since there is everything in it, he says 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.839
 Perchtold Herbert Reul are doing more 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.380
 The culprit was all that stupid shit chip 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.060
 after the German participant in% 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.620
 the transport controller picture Peter needs 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.430
 There he needs a rocket which surprise you need 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.569
 PX easily it gets more and more bells from people who do not know that SEPA Rex such 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.549
 Lists that I am already at 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.149
 around Gary is just as much as percent as well as Oye Mr 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.649
 Mammals again and duration yes and then under 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.769
 Percent Tropez Obama 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.019
 therefore needs 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 Now he just needs to protect the input 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.839
 just have to look like he is important to Sal 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.259
 that should not continue here 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.229
 yes, what we can do 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.819
 As you can see, this code is really not very short 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.189
 and I think that somehow it all in one 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.189
 he closed at 2 11 and high that loud better 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.269
 all this took up HR 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.249
 that would do all departments so on it he should be synonymous problems 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.039
 work if not around 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.039
 Everything goes on the Place area 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.399
 Bayer must be there in Dschalal-Abad spot controller 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.889
 with the stomach 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.709
 Percent fall with what 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.629
 Arla eig 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.629
 right way once 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.479
 Dr 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.909
 the father is still alive 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.909
 Elsewhere, okay, now came 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.729
 Transport controller 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.189
 Keynote speaker is gone 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.459
 link 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.559
 around 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.559
 Now look 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:25.809
 Arbon 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:30.769
 Uma Thurman Intuit Chips Barner Heinz messuziere zol 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.469
 Probst explained 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.270
 So who around at this check currently gives even more output 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.880
 Percent one was also still so I think in total one can many train on 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.800
 Stick with this Savard 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.069
 Rain and polished from Omaha Â»this should be enough 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.389
 then you should also the thing to the author 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:57.990
 a then Med
