00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.040
 in the alexander show and I'm coming 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.660
 short out of small studies but already 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 for seven and eight years now 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.950
 graz and rubber and meanwhile market 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.400
 work in the field of analytical 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.830
 chemistry 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.140
 what fascinates you about the analytical 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 chemistry is just that fascinating 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.759
 the components of certain of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.439
 Solutions of all kinds we can 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.439
 the transactions in the track area 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.570
 So really minimal 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.630
 prove concentrations and then just 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.330
 to decide yes are the poisonous ones 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.160
 things or do we have certain 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.800
 metabolites that and that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.410
 make us save further 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.990
 questions that we pursue and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.880
 why are you doing the famelab wistfully 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.020
 on the one hand, of course, because one 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.000
 especially then can present 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 life scientist so actually 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.220
 rarely can and second, of course, with it 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.110
 you bring the whole closer to someone 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.290
 the less to do with science than 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.000
 best case even your own mother 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.039
 dose makes the poison 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.479
 and sometimes the dose is on 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.560
 decisive difference between poison 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 and medicine 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 So it's not just necessary to 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
 Know if a certain substance is toxic 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.530
 It is the same for our body 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.689
 important to determine the limits 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.460
 and have clever scientists for that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.439
 a special instrument that develops 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.869
 so-called mass spectrometer that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.850
 Mass spectrometer allows us atoms and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.189
 salt and even big molecules like 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.119
 identify proteins and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.689
 count 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.200
 the limit of determination is here 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.200
 unbelievably low 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.659
 I'm talking about a particle in one 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.590
 billion i speak of one 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.170
 greater salt in 50 baths of water 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.979
 that is, we are looking for the proverbial 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.219
 needle in a haystack 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.069
 like this one but how does that work? 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.829
 whole now in the mass spectrometer itself 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.719
 if the particles become one to a kind 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.729
 Electromagnet I have now 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.850
 once a strong magnet here in 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.770
 this carafe attached and the task 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.350
 that one evaluates it is part of one 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.480
 certain pecking out and certain 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.890
 to lead to the detector where they then 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.630
 counted when we accept 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.270
 that this needle is a nasty one here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.780
 heavy metal is lead and the couscous 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.550
 here in the cup water molecules then 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.480
 we can separate the lead from the water 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.980
 by saying our magnets he should 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.190
 only particles with the mass of lead 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.340
 pick it out and then 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.860
 we transport the whole thing to ours 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.660
 covered and also have it 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.390
 our eyes and count them off 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.160
 particles with other words this 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.550
 magnet works that one kind of filter 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.680
 for masses and the great thing about it is 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.769
 We can do it within a fraction 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.989
 one second a whole series of 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.739
 determine the elements 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.870
 I work with one like that 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.980
 mass spectrometer and the goal of my 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.410
 It is accurate and very sensitive work 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.670
 So sensitive methods for the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.400
 determination of trace elements 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.170
 be it now in the blood in 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.180
 foodstuffs in steel and even them 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.370
 so shit if you are the next 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 time the table with the ingredients 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.709
 your favorite is complex and in demand 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.630
 that the first one is really healthy 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.390
 keep in mind that somewhere 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.329
 Analytical comedians like you one 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.329
 Thank you
