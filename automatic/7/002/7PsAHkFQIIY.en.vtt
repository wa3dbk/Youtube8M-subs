00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:08.930
 Hello everyone, we are now on the beach and saw 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.830
 I don't see the sun like that 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:16.160
 prevents you see you 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.199
 but I hope that it can be seen in general 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.850
 mug in it some kind of garbage lives only 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.490
 I now do not know what kind of garbage we are 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.960
 at first they thought it was a crab but it 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.960
 some owls is it not crabs 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.770
 and here she just got out to 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.330
 turn over and now can 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.330
 see here he climbs again 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.090
 some kind of snail 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.160
 Well, I do not know if anyone knows how this 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:54.930
 trash inside is called here tell us 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:58.600
 that we are now on the shore and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.790
 here is where the ebb is 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.220
 the chairs cost us another water was in the morning 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:12.909
 and that's where she already has this thing 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:17.310
 was was underground in the water the water was gone and 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.310
 she stayed underground no longer in the water 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:36.250
 she apparently wanted back water 2 and grosses 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:39.539
 to drink water and now we will see that she 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.539
 will do in the water 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.890
 there her eyes are so unlike you 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.890
 video shows out there right just two eyes 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.570
 let let long-pinching 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.729
 know what she will do 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.120
 she is 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.010
 I'm not interested yes 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.570
 she must have been hot and so she 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.600
 wanted to water and now mine closer to the water 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.750
 brought it already kicks itself and already 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.750
 climbs no longer turns 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.940
 what a slug 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.890

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.670
 seashells on shore 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:57.640
 and here they only bring them immediately to 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:01.890
 sand themselves are buried here now 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.630
 number here here here and how much, and that's 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.390
 they could direct all all all all escape 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.390

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:27.490

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31.470
