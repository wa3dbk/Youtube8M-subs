 you have to see a video right now 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.670
 for 18 million cupcakes you need for the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:39.000
 dough 4 133 grams of sugar one-third 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 vanilla pod 50 grams butter 40 grams 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.610
 flour seven grams cacau a third 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 teaspoon baking powder 34 concert 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 bitter chocolate and two tablespoons 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 then you need milk for the cream 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.190
 still 70 grams of double ram cream cheese ten 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.190
 powdered sugar and 70 grams of cream 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.200
 First, the oreo would have biscuits through 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.670
 solve each other's training 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.350
 the wise cream with a spoon 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.190
 to have in a bowl and for later 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.190
 put aside 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.979
 the biscuit eleven small crumbs 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.820
 I always imagine a tablespoon 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.680
 of it for the deco later to the side for 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.220
 then do you need 33 grams of sugar 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 turn 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.670
 then you separate three eggs 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.850
 and beat the protein with a pinch 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.850
 salt stiff 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.230
 trend then a third of the vanilla bean 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.010
 from 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.010
 cut open the shoulder 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.050
 and shaaf that likes with a teaspoon 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.050
 and there is snow for it 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:28.460
 it goes after that under stirring the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.140
 sugar for example in another 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.950
 bowl mashed the yolks with the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.060
 butter then you have the act 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.060
 bitter chocolate small 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.099
 and give it with the miniature biscuit 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.400
 thinks to butter machines then good 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.400
 Mix 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.319
 in another bowl he mixes 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.860
 the flour with the cocoa and the 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.860
 baking powder 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.170
 you then lift this mixture alternately 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.530
 with the milk under the chocolate butter 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.530
 do 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.580
 then quickly the eischnee 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.580
 mix in 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.930
 and you can do the dough in the mini 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.930
 fill in the form 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.980
 the 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.380
 The dough would then have to be preheated 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:28.660
 Oven about 15 to 20 minutes at 180 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:30.220
 baking degrees for the frosting you give 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.020
 the cream cheese and the blob of cream 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.570
 together with the icing sugar in one 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.840
 mixing bowl then the cream stiff 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.840
 beat 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.180
 fits that the seed too long impact 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.550
 otherwise happens with my distributed 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.770
 friend the cream is in fact from to 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.960
 long beat liquid again is the 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.210
 cream stiff struck first 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.840
 the cream cheese and then loads the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.840
 long under 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.580
 fill the topping in a syringe and 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.580
 distribute on the cooled biscuit 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.930
 I'm really happy with it 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.030
 I like to inject her if you still 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.930
 no you have the link below in 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.930
 the video description 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.980
 I have a big one here, for example 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.930
 taken abroad for this simple 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.760
 Of course we can also drop others 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.940
 towers use depending on how are you 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.940
 like 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.639
 Finally, the finished cap then 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.600
 also fast with the lifted biscuit 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.600
 decorate crumbly 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:07.580
 and here are the finished mini cup 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.530
 cakes if you make twelve big ones 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.310
