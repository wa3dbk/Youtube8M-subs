00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
Linden just race around the track

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.680 
Linden just race around the track
probably<00:05:42.020> do<00:05:42.110> a<00:05:42.140> lap<00:05:42.410> or<00:05:42.560> so<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:44.030> again<00:05:44.210> it's

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
probably do a lap or so and again it's

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.710 
probably do a lap or so and again it's
the<00:05:45.110> you<00:05:46.040> know<00:05:46.100> the<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.820> device<00:05:47.330> feels

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
the you know the the device feels

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.560 
the you know the the device feels
slightly<00:05:48.500> warm<00:05:48.950> and<00:05:49.340> usually<00:05:49.820> around<00:05:50.360> the

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
slightly warm and usually around the

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.140 
slightly warm and usually around the
bottom<00:05:50.900> half<00:05:51.110> here<00:05:51.220> but<00:05:52.220> it's<00:05:52.370> it's<00:05:52.730> pretty

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
bottom half here but it's it's pretty

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.060 
bottom half here but it's it's pretty
much<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.660> think<00:05:53.720> in<00:05:54.080> tune<00:05:54.320> more<00:05:54.530> with<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.860> fact

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
much I think in tune more with the fact

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.060 
much I think in tune more with the fact
that<00:05:55.130> it's<00:05:55.340> all<00:05:55.430> metal<00:05:55.670> than<00:05:56.000> it<00:05:56.120> is<00:05:56.300> the

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
that it's all metal than it is the

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.350 
that it's all metal than it is the
processor<00:05:58.070> itself<00:05:58.220> so<00:05:58.640> let's<00:05:58.760> jump<00:05:59.000> into<00:05:59.210> the

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
processor itself so let's jump into the

00:05:59.360 --> 00:07:16.890 
processor itself so let's jump into the
game

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.050 

all<00:07:17.900> right<00:07:18.080> so<00:07:18.860> there<00:07:19.100> you<00:07:19.190> have<00:07:19.220> it<00:07:19.340> guys<00:07:19.640> you

well<00:07:38.330> with<00:07:38.660> this<00:07:38.780> device<00:07:39.140> it<00:07:39.470> does<00:07:39.650> won't<00:07:39.980> run

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 
well with this device it does won't run

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.070 
well with this device it does won't run
warm<00:07:40.970> especially<00:07:41.390> towards<00:07:41.690> the<00:07:41.720> bottom<00:07:41.930> here

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.150 
I'm guessing that's where the processor

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.810
