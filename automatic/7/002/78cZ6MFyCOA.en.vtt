00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.530
 Everyone knows all the questions we ask ourselves 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.290
 about our life and our future 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.930
 make ideas that drive us 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.029
 develop to answer this question 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.439
 our world needs people who love theirs 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.990
 ideas believe 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.539
 especially young people people 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.740
 Their talents use the learning and themselves 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.199
 want to try 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:38.470
 best in an environment in which one 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:40.030
 Feeling great, of course , that's great 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.010

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.739
 time in the bus from the university to the beach 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.229
 Can take that bike everything like that 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.180
 This can be achieved in the cinema 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.460
 all uni programs these offered 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.589
 will go to the market and sprayed 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.830
 let and on board a lot right against 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.350
 feeling well also means studying 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.250
 with leisure hobbies or top sports 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.250
 to be able to agree 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.440
 all very calm and early outside 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.900
 with around 23,000 young students in 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.820
 almost 150 courses 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.460
 live and do research and christian 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.230
 Albrecht University too keel over 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.330
 2000 scientist and 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.250
 scientists they work with 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.870
 the facilities of top research 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.600
 and give young people one 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.630
 perspective into the research 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:40.630
 and the possibility of new ideas together 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:42.550
 to develop and always a good one 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.980
 Dialogue between the students and the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.420
 Professors prevail when you poll 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.470
 you can find someone in any case 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.590
 expected 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.840
 We have lots of terrain that we use 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.300
 use and take students and the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.950
 students then in the lab already 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.600
 ready to teach you how to do such a thing 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.060
 do not study with the war 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.979
 challenge for us it is her 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.290
 efficiency of the electronic 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.330
 to increase components and we want that 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.140
 through a textured surface 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.050
 to reach 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.660
 As a student you have the opportunity on 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.940
 little hand to grasp the then later on 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.519
 the mars somewhere on the way for example 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.230
 that means the people have a project 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.700
 are in the interaction with the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.730
 cooperation partners directly with 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.450
 involved and can self 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.640
 scientifically in these areas 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.680
 realize we deal 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.870
 especially with the civil right 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.500
 in eastern european states 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.590
 economic sector 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.140
 we are just beginning to examine hearts 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.180
 hypertrophy as well as enlargement me 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.860
 Never work so much nasris green 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.380
 rich with the research ship 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.210
 regularly in the weser and the same 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.800
 If I had a wish would be free 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.550
 I wish us a wish too 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.860
 drives 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.070
 our world needs its people 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.370
 Ideas believe kiel offers this 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:04.410
 proper space and learning to research 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.700
 and new ideas are lonely to develop 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.700
 the people are huge and
