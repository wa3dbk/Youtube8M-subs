seed<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.610> comes<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> way<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.329> onto

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
seed so it comes all the way down onto

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.870 
seed so it comes all the way down onto
his<00:02:06.689> waist<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.229> angle<00:02:08.220> these<00:02:08.340> back<00:02:08.610> just

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
his waist and angle these back just

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.810 
his waist and angle these back just
slightly<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.709> these<00:02:10.799> arms<00:02:11.160> shoulder

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
slightly and then these arms shoulder

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.000 
slightly and then these arms shoulder
arms<00:02:12.060> come<00:02:12.239> down<00:02:12.620> they<00:02:13.620> come<00:02:13.769> down<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
arms come down they come down to the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.530 
arms come down they come down to the
ball<00:02:14.220> joint<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.670> then<00:02:14.760> under<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> ball<00:02:15.299> joint

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
ball joint and then under the ball joint

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.930 
ball joint and then under the ball joint
you<00:02:15.630> rotate<00:02:16.079> it<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:17.220> little<00:02:17.400> hinge<00:02:17.700> right

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
you rotate it on this little hinge right

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.509 
you rotate it on this little hinge right
here<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:20.480> flip<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.600> up<00:02:21.750> onto<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.049> top<00:02:22.519> and

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
here to flip that up onto the top and

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.629 
here to flip that up onto the top and
same<00:02:24.359> over<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:24.720> we'll<00:02:24.900> bring<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.500> down<00:02:25.650> I'll

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:26.639 
same over here we'll bring it down I'll

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.970 
same over here we'll bring it down I'll
pop<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.000> off<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> ball<00:02:27.329> joint<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.720> course

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
pop it off the ball joint of course

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.800 
pop it off the ball joint of course
you<00:02:29.459> rotate<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> hinge<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.390> actually

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
you rotate the hinge like that actually

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
you rotate the hinge like that actually
that's<00:02:30.930> actually<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.230> good<00:02:31.580> demonstration<00:02:32.580> see

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
that's actually a good demonstration see

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
that's actually a good demonstration see
it's<00:02:33.269> it's<00:02:33.599> like<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:34.349> mode<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.069> you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it's it's like that in one mode and you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.759 
it's it's like that in one mode and you
want<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.580> rotate<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.970> around<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.769> to

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
want to rotate it around like that to

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.740 
want to rotate it around like that to
sit<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.220> shoulder<00:02:38.519> properly<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.659> that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
sit on the shoulder properly and that

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.509 
sit on the shoulder properly and that
comes<00:02:39.989> down<00:02:40.049> like<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.409> then<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> back

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
comes down like that then the back

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.160 
comes down like that then the back
assembly<00:02:41.970> comes<00:02:42.150> down<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.510> course<00:02:42.540> onto<00:02:43.019> his

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
assembly comes down of course onto his

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.860 
assembly comes down of course onto his
back<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:44.129> rotate<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.549> flags<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
back you rotate the flags up and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.229 
back you rotate the flags up and
bringing<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.200> whole<00:02:46.379> assembly<00:02:46.620> down<00:02:47.239> like

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
bringing this whole assembly down like

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.089 
bringing this whole assembly down like
so<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:50.209> there<00:02:51.209> he<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.360> all<00:02:51.720> armed<00:02:52.080> up<00:02:52.200> ready<00:02:53.010> to

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
sword the gun itself is actually really

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.710

cool it's got like a little DJ scratch
pad<00:03:33.989> up<00:03:34.139> here<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:35.040> he<00:03:35.130> uses<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.609> arm<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.970> and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
pad up here that he uses to arm it and

pad up here that he uses to arm it and
there's<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.319> little<00:03:37.470> knob<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:38.190> he<00:03:38.489> can<00:03:38.609> change

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
there's a little knob that he can change

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.830 
there's a little knob that he can change
just<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.419> speed<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.079> tempo<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.720> speed<00:03:42.720> of

when speeds it up it uh it performed the
gun<00:03:47.730> performs<00:03:48.120> more<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.419> machine<00:03:48.720> gun

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
gun performs more like a machine gun

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.809 
gun performs more like a machine gun
with<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.079> lot<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.319> rapid-fire<00:03:49.650> shots<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.730> when

with a lot of rapid-fire shots and when

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.069

steadily<00:04:30.960> maybe<00:04:31.169> it's<00:04:31.349> just<00:04:31.410> because<00:04:31.590> because

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
steadily maybe it's just because because

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.189 
steadily maybe it's just because because
it's<00:04:32.430> not<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.610> curved<00:04:32.880> handle<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:33.810> he<00:04:33.870> does<00:04:34.050> get

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
it's not a curved handle but he does get

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.010 
it's not a curved handle but he does get
a<00:04:34.260> much<00:04:34.470> better<00:04:34.620> grip<00:04:35.010> on<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:36.000> weapon<00:04:36.330> when<00:04:36.990> I

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
a much better grip on the weapon when I

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.370 
a much better grip on the weapon when I
it's<00:04:37.560> when<00:04:37.979> it's<00:04:38.099> in<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.340> sword<00:04:38.610> form<00:04:39.380> which

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
it's when it's in the sword form which

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.050 
it's when it's in the sword form which
is<00:04:40.530> generally<00:04:40.830> high<00:04:40.950> prefer<00:04:41.250> to

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
is generally high prefer to

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.140 
is generally high prefer to
prefer<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.360> anyway<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.760> if<00:04:44.760> you're<00:04:44.910> missing

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
prefer it anyway but if you're missing

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.520 
prefer it anyway but if you're missing
with<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.300> toy<00:04:45.450> this<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:45.960> easily<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.320> more

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
with the toy this is easily the more

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.409 
with the toy this is easily the more
stable<00:04:46.740> configuration<00:04:47.520> of<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.700> two<00:04:47.880> if<00:04:48.330> you

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
stable configuration of the two if you

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.580 
stable configuration of the two if you
want<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.660> hold<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.050> course<00:04:49.230> you<00:04:49.320> do<00:04:49.440> have

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
want to hold it of course you do have

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.750 
want to hold it of course you do have
this<00:04:49.710> extra<00:04:50.010> one<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.250> if<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.400> want<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.610> hold

this extra one so if you want to hold
him<00:04:50.880> have<00:04:51.270> both<00:04:51.570> hold<00:04:52.440> both<00:04:52.620> weapons<00:04:52.830> you

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
him have both hold both weapons you

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.840 
him have both hold both weapons you
could<00:04:53.250> do<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.430> too

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
could do that too

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.420 
could do that too
that'd<00:04:54.210> be<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.330> little<00:04:54.510> overpowered<00:04:55.020> but<00:04:55.430> but

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
that'd be a little overpowered but but

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.030 
that'd be a little overpowered but but
yeah<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.669> is<00:04:56.790> possible<00:04:57.300> if<00:04:57.450> you<00:04:57.540> choose<00:04:57.780> to

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
yeah it is possible if you choose to

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.170 
yeah it is possible if you choose to
like<00:04:59.040> I<00:04:59.100> said<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.310> think<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.520> think<00:04:59.790> this<00:04:59.880> one<00:05:00.030> may

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
like I said I think I think this one may

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.879 
like I said I think I think this one may
be<00:05:00.240> my<00:05:00.450> favorite<00:05:00.660> of<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.110> arms<00:05:01.350> change<00:05:01.590> figure

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
be my favorite of the arms change figure

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.550 
be my favorite of the arms change figure
so<00:05:02.070> far<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:03.150> close<00:05:03.630> second<00:05:04.020> would<00:05:04.169> be<00:05:04.200> his

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
so far a close second would be his

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.430 
so far a close second would be his
current<00:05:05.520> nemesis<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.300> if<00:05:06.660> I'm<00:05:06.870> reading<00:05:07.320> this
