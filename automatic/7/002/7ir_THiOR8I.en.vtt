00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello very good to all and good me 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.420
 I wanted to do something different I'm going to 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.420
 explain a little what are the what to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.120
 I think it's a fashion for this summer 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 quite absurd and good because I wanted you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.210
 comment a little over these fashions 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.580
 that the truth is that I do not understand and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.880
 well I will start counting by the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.590
 Tingling ar so it will move some 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 image I will not put for you 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.540
 see exactly what is already a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.239
 fashion that this summer says it's going 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.790
 to extend and well then I with this 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.550
 video what I want is to alert everyone to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 do not do this because I'm going to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.430
 count exactly the dangers that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.020
 have to do the su um bar as I am 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 counting and apparently could be the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 specialists saying that it is not done 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.629
 that are not mentioned and that people 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.420
 do and the people who see it doing it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.280
 it catches your attention so you leave 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.280
 to do these things 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.229
 I do not know how to say it no and well 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 consists of exposing yourself directly to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 the sun's rays apart from this well 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.580
 they do different things very good because the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 practice is to catch and put as 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.990
 who says a blocker for those who 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.750
 make drawings on your skin and then what 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.810
 What it does is bleach the areas where 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.330
 the drawing is exactly that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.369
 it has on the skin printed and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.520
 Well, they have warned the population 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.369
 the dermatologists because it's an idea 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.560
 pretty bad and it's becoming 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.960
 in a trend that is being seen in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.110
 the beach mostly of united state and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.720
 let's hope this is not there and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.179
 Well, this can cause burns 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.659
 and permanent damage as you already know 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.490
 everyone then always keep what 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.819
 it's skin hydrated with creams 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.710
 protective skins and well between 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.700
 other things that can happen in 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.280
 general 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.390
 wrinkles that you can even cancer of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.000
 melanoma skin as it is known and it is a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.180
 very dangerous practice and that brings 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.150
 long-term consequences in a time frame 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.269
 short will not have consequences but to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.940
 short long long time for forgiveness 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.459
 will have consequences to your skin then 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.950
 what it does is draw the skin with the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.050
 Sun 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.239
 That tattoo may last a week 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.900
 two weeks but what you have done is 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.920
 burn your skin to make a drawing 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.980
 I would not do it and I think that people 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.500
 that you see this video so that you find out 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.290
 do not do these things because you have a 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.190
 tattoo if a person does not want no 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.040
 have to pay for a tattoo because you 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.110
 you will tattoo the skin with sunlight is 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.010
 better do you with henna tattoo or 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.250
 of another type of material but not using the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.620
 sun to tattoo you skin are very 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.349
 dangerous and the fact of 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.349
 put on cream and put yourself in the sun, imagine 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.680
 if you leave yourself like that to make yourself a 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.349
 tattoo in broad daylight imagined 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.900
 the hours five hours four hours 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.630
 in front of the sun all afternoon and 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.370
 giving you the sun and the back or in the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.940
 arm where you want to be is acting you 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.519
 this solar tattoo is a neighborhood because it 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.700
 do it and that 's my advice not what 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.220
 do not do it 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.010
 for your good because I care about 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.690
 you and well you know that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.900
 do not do this and go to someone 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.840
 tell him not to buzz like 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.319
 I'm counting and we've gone to the last 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.120
 to the latest fashion too and it's called the 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:05.530
 bonsai necklace ying the challenge to know if 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.080
 a person is thin so apparently 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.299
 You can use what currencies are the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.540
 puts in what is the clavicle and 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.840
 then the more number of coins 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.109
 glove must be given the clavicle 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.919
 he supposedly says that that's how 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.520
 say that she is thin like that and neither is 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.370
 I understand this fashion that has been created 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.800
 about three china and good because the challenge is 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.740
 is spreading and they are doing it 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.560
 many people there are people who have 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.800
 done and well well I do not see it well that 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.169
 use this very rudimentary method 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.330
 to say that a person is thin 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.000
 or is not thin 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.020
 a thousand ways of each person is a world 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.539
 and not because I say is this actress that 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.240
 putting itself in currency thus thus in the 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.569
 clavicle says it 's thin either 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.419
 I see well that they alert the 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.840
 people with this with this fashion is so 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.449
 absurd but what worries me the most 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.810
 is the zumba ar this fashion of this 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.210
 act on the skin with sunlight and 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.569
 good nothing else and if you liked it you can 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.319
 give ay ay well then share it so that 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:27.219
 More people know that they do not know 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:29.400
 make this buzzing challenge fashion this 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.169
 fashion to get in the sun as I am 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.289
 saying give them favorite and well then if 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.529
 wants to be informed of the news 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:42.449
 of what its vital then subscribe to me 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.449
 channel a big hug to all
