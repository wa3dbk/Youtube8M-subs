00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
transmissions cars that you'll find is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.039 
transmissions cars that you'll find is
different<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.970> has<00:01:45.149> three<00:01:45.600> pedals<00:01:45.780> as

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
different is it has three pedals as

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.300 
different is it has three pedals as
opposed<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.950> an<00:01:47.040> automatic

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
opposed to two in an automatic

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.190 
opposed to two in an automatic
transmission<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.630> still<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:49.049> gas

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
transmission so you still have your gas

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
transmission so you still have your gas
pedal<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.530> right<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.979> brake<00:01:50.220> pedal<00:01:50.369> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
pedal on the right your brake pedal in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.370 
pedal on the right your brake pedal in
the<00:01:50.759> middle<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.720> clutch<00:01:51.930> pedal<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the middle and the clutch pedal on the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.760 
the middle and the clutch pedal on the
left<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.250> used<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
left which is what is used to to get the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.620 
left which is what is used to to get the
car<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:56.520> connects<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.210> engine

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
car going it's what connects the engine

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.670 
car going it's what connects the engine
to<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.930> wheels<00:01:58.110> basically<00:01:58.790> so<00:02:00.439> what<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> want

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
to the wheels basically so what you want

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.959 
to the wheels basically so what you want
to<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.860> before<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.219> start<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:02.610> learning

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to do before you start actually learning

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.080 
to do before you start actually learning
is<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.280> tech<00:02:05.490> almond<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:05.939> here

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
is you have your tech almond right here

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.419 
is you have your tech almond right here
that's<00:02:06.270> basically<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> engine<00:02:07.140> speed<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's basically the engine speed you

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's basically the engine speed you
want<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> practice<00:02:08.819> revving<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.629> about<00:02:10.310> 1,500

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
want to practice revving to about 1,500

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.350 
want to practice revving to about 1,500
to<00:02:11.700> 2,000<00:02:12.180> rpms

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
to 2,000 rpms

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.180 
to 2,000 rpms
and<00:02:13.630> once<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.830> sitting<00:02:15.040> there

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and once you can get it sitting there

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.720 
and once you can get it sitting there
stable<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.150> can<00:02:16.360> let<00:02:16.660> off<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.730> practice

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
stable you can let off it and practice

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.070 
stable you can let off it and practice
it<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.910> few<00:02:19.090> more<00:02:19.210> times<00:02:19.270> just<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.900> get<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
it a few more times just so you get the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.750 
it a few more times just so you get the
feel<00:02:20.290> for<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.710> cars<00:02:20.890> throttle<00:02:21.310> because<00:02:21.430> some

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
feel for the cars throttle because some

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.220 
feel for the cars throttle because some
respond<00:02:22.120> faster<00:02:22.480> than<00:02:22.630> others<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.370> some<00:02:25.230> take

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
respond faster than others and some take

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.200 
respond faster than others and some take
a<00:02:26.260> lot<00:02:26.530> more<00:02:26.740> pressure<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.550> get<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:28.090> that

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
a lot more pressure to get it to that

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.260 
a lot more pressure to get it to that
point<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.770> then<00:02:29.770> once<00:02:30.250> you've<00:02:30.400> done<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.790> you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
point and then once you've done that you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.480 
point and then once you've done that you
can<00:02:31.300> put<00:02:31.570> your<00:02:31.690> foot<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.230> brake<00:02:32.490> you're

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
can put your foot on the brake you're

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.840 
can put your foot on the brake you're
gonna<00:02:33.640> take<00:02:33.910> out<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.630> emergency<00:02:35.080> brake<00:02:35.850> you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
gonna take out the emergency brake you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.360 
gonna take out the emergency brake you
put<00:02:37.060> your<00:02:37.180> clutch<00:02:37.390> in<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.410> then<00:02:39.190> when<00:02:39.280> you're

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
put your clutch in and then when you're

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
put your clutch in and then when you're
doing<00:02:39.490> this<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.760> want<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.940> make<00:02:40.120> sure<00:02:40.150> that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
doing this you want to make sure that

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.850 
doing this you want to make sure that
you're<00:02:40.540> on<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.660> level<00:02:40.960> surface<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.620> won't

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
you're on a level surface so you won't

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.410 
you're on a level surface so you won't
be<00:02:41.980> rolling<00:02:42.370> while<00:02:43.000> you're<00:02:43.120> trying<00:02:43.330> to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
be rolling while you're trying to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.840 
be rolling while you're trying to
practice<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.920> once<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.370> your<00:02:45.430> clutch<00:02:45.670> in

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
practice so once you have your clutch in

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.280 
practice so once you have your clutch in
you<00:02:46.210> move<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> into<00:02:46.630> first<00:02:46.900> gear<00:02:47.020> which<00:02:47.260> is

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
you move it into first gear which is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.920 
you move it into first gear which is
generally<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.770> top<00:02:47.950> left<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.630> then<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.780> let

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
generally the top left and then you let

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.040 
generally the top left and then you let
your<00:02:49.960> foot<00:02:50.230> off<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:51.340> rev<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.850> about<00:02:52.510> 1,500

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
your foot off you rev it to about 1,500

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.620 
your foot off you rev it to about 1,500
mm<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.590> where<00:02:53.800> you<00:02:53.890> were<00:02:53.950> practicing<00:02:54.280> before

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
mm just where you were practicing before

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.900 
mm just where you were practicing before
you<00:02:55.630> slowly<00:02:56.080> slowly<00:02:56.890> let<00:02:57.130> out<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> clutch<00:02:57.490> and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
you slowly slowly let out the clutch and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.600 
you slowly slowly let out the clutch and
apply<00:02:58.870> more<00:02:59.050> pressure<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> gas<00:02:59.650> pedal<00:02:59.980> and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
apply more pressure to the gas pedal and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.550 
apply more pressure to the gas pedal and
once<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.910> clutch<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.240> out<00:03:01.420> then<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.140> take

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
once the clutch is out then you take

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.820 
once the clutch is out then you take
your<00:03:02.590> foot<00:03:02.860> completely<00:03:02.980> off<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:04.830> recording

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
your foot completely off of it recording

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.160 
your foot completely off of it recording
for<00:03:05.860> now<00:03:06.300> all<00:03:07.300> right<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.600> then<00:03:07.690> once<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.990> have

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
for now all right and then once you have

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.380 
for now all right and then once you have
down<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:09.400> getting<00:03:09.490> going<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:09.910> first<00:03:10.150> gear

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
down it's getting going in first gear

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.510 
down it's getting going in first gear
you're<00:03:11.380> gonna<00:03:11.470> basically<00:03:11.920> do<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.070> same<00:03:12.130> thing

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
you're gonna basically do the same thing

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.510 
you're gonna basically do the same thing
you<00:03:12.640> did<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.880> start<00:03:13.270> going<00:03:13.570> in<00:03:14.250> first<00:03:15.250> gear

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
you did to start going in first gear

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.949 
you did to start going in first gear
except<00:03:16.000> you're<00:03:16.180> gonna<00:03:16.270> be<00:03:16.480> shifting<00:03:16.870> in

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
except you're gonna be shifting in

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.479 
except you're gonna be shifting in
second<00:03:17.290> gear<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.680> push<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.100> clutch<00:03:18.250> in

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
second gear so you push the clutch in

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.910 
second gear so you push the clutch in
you<00:03:19.090> let<00:03:19.239> off<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> gas<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:20.380> shift<00:03:20.620> into<00:03:20.769> the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
you let off the gas you shift into the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.009 
you let off the gas you shift into the
next<00:03:21.100> gear<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:22.269> then<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.510> slowly<00:03:22.690> switch

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
next gear and then you slowly switch

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.270 
next gear and then you slowly switch
your<00:03:23.170> feedback<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.650> that's<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.890> important

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
shift a lot faster at the beginning

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.270

you'll be able you'll be kind of

you'll be able you'll be kind of
struggling<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:30.820> get<00:04:30.940> through<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.210> gears<00:04:31.420> you

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
struggling to get through the gears you

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.630 
struggling to get through the gears you
might<00:04:31.840> miss<00:04:32.500> shift<00:04:32.800> going<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.250> wrong<00:04:33.370> gear

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
might miss shift going to the wrong gear

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.460 
might miss shift going to the wrong gear
but<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.720> just<00:04:34.900> takes<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.110> little<00:04:35.200> bit<00:04:35.380> of

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
but it just takes a little bit of

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.810 
but it just takes a little bit of
practice<00:04:35.800> you'll<00:04:36.010> be<00:04:36.040> able<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.310> shift<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.670> lot

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
practice you'll be able to shift a lot

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.960 
practice you'll be able to shift a lot
faster

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970
