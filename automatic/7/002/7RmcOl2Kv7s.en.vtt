00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.780

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.269
 Be sure to join us right now. 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.269
 in that cause a team that he 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.650
 brazil 2 500 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.779
 I had the little one been placed here 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.220
 lacked chaos 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.220
 I put a small software 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:41.950
 a great relief 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.950
 it's time to set up the drogba blogger 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.390
 and this one but that in doubt if she was going to 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.370
 here or if it is that hose leave it 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.790
 dodo valve cap 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:03.370
 Okay, wrote you only have the input you have 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.000
 no more to the hoses the advance in a 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.430
 input 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.790
 the face here this tradition that is phase 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.790
 the country has entered with the boy here 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.020
 this entry tartaric fado 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.230
 uncle teco 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.250
 that the woman gives 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.300
 could give voice 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.500
 I called here then. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.340
 I got the fuel in here. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.720
 friday with 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.550
 is here 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.540
 I called 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.250
 I called the tap return gigas united and 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:53.840
 I think it works 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.840
 here in two ways 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.979
 phelps and that the heater should be the 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.940
 heating of the producer of the decisive piece 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.940
 I got here 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.850
 the store entrance did not like the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.110
 team 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:21.410
 and the other still radiator hose in the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.940
 line below give it to someone 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.940
 my novelty is as follows 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.080
 this one here 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.160
 cover 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.660
 in that phase of the prosecutor I do not know if 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.660
 from here you will get 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.569
 and 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.450
 There is no water cooler here . 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 right and after the normal time the support 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.780
 of the accelerator 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.590
 likely to change the cable from the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:05.000
 accelerator that here was okay here 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:09.380
 Saturday 3 of a throttle pot 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.700
 But cut that out 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.890
 currently that's right 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:21.030
 lewis ok can see the just because it came from 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.990
 letters to me that here 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.960
 one a trading here 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.960
 the rest of this tone is 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.160
 I only know if this together I do not 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.350
 to be able to operate is to 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.260
 run the car engine 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.530
 if I can get the motor 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.090
 side, we'll sort things out and then 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.090
 thanks in advance
