different<00:01:07.020> ships<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.740> only<00:01:07.890> have

different ships will not only have
different<00:01:08.490> node<00:01:08.729> configurations<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.470> they

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
different node configurations but they

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
different node configurations but they
will<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> different<00:01:11.790> amount<00:01:12.060> of

will also have a different amount of
slots<00:01:12.540> per<00:01:13.049> node<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:14.159> may<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.369> guessed

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
slots per node as you may have guessed

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.120 
slots per node as you may have guessed
different<00:01:15.509> pieces<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.080> equipment<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.920> take

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
different pieces of equipment can take

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.789 
different pieces of equipment can take

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
up different amounts of slots so let's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
up different amounts of slots so let's
start<00:01:20.040> equipping<00:01:20.580> our<00:01:20.700> kumho<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> buy<00:01:22.229> a

as a million Plex so it may be a while
before<00:05:18.639> you<00:05:18.850> have<00:05:19.030> these<00:05:19.300> many<00:05:19.660> options

you<00:05:58.150> during<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.660> mission<00:05:58.840> and<00:05:59.139> that<00:05:59.979> pretty

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
you during a mission and that pretty

you during a mission and that pretty
much<00:06:00.340> wraps<00:06:00.700> up<00:06:00.940> our<00:06:01.120> very<00:06:01.630> in-depth<00:06:02.139> look<00:06:02.350> at

much wraps up our very in-depth look at
customizing<00:06:03.160> ships<00:06:03.669> in<00:06:03.850> ring<00:06:04.180> runner<00:06:04.389> as<00:06:04.600> you

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
customizing ships in ring runner as you

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.690 
customizing ships in ring runner as you
can<00:06:05.260> see<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.530> process<00:06:05.919> is<00:06:06.070> fairly<00:06:06.310> involved

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
can see the process is fairly involved

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.370 
can see the process is fairly involved
but<00:06:07.120> when<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.300> consider<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.930> analogues

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
but when you consider the analogues

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.930 
but when you consider the analogues
you'll<00:06:08.919> see<00:06:09.100> that<00:06:09.220> what<00:06:09.370> we've<00:06:09.520> done<00:06:09.729> is

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
you'll see that what we've done is

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.670 
you'll see that what we've done is
consolidated<00:06:10.870> and<00:06:11.020> streamlined<00:06:11.530> the<00:06:11.650> process

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
consolidated and streamlined the process

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.040 
consolidated and streamlined the process
of<00:06:12.190> equipping<00:06:12.520> specking<00:06:13.210> and<00:06:13.360> customizing<00:06:13.960> a
