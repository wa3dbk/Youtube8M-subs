00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.340
 Hello everyone, sapan sir 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.140
 there have passed times when new branches of tanks 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.960
 almost every patch appeared 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.449
 now every new tank is big 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.759
 a rarity and basically we play on such 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.439
 already old famous cars exactly 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.080
 so I decided to make such a small 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.140
 a series of videos on the best tank on each 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.550
 of the levels i'm happy with these tanks 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.730
 set yourself a hangar can recommend 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.300
 I will tell you a little about them 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.780
 top 3 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.390
 and we start from level nine to level three 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.079
 place i will put waffentrager pz 4 or 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.390
 wafer leopard 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.129
 not so long ago developers ponerfili this 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.739
 typewriter but really nerve like me 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.949
 I think it was not very serious and 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.539
 he certainly didn't affect performance 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.390
 this car in randomness it still 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.119
 very good you are just great 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.030
 armored weapon 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.860
 alpha and dpm accuracy to the most ridiculous 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.600
 that even stabilize two fr-shki 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.490
 stabilizing new is definitely not bad 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.590
 good mobility small size 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.229
 respectively, for a very very very 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.840
 good masking well and most importantly 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.020
 for pt the presence of the tower is perfect 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.090
 and unusual qualities for fr-shki but it 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.950
 what really puts her head and shoulders above 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.929
 everyone else because she doesn't 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.209
 experiencing all these problems and very 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.220
 it's hard to twist it okay itself 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.989
 feels even under some kind of 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.060
 melee here of course manifests itself 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:43.330
 very serious minus armor armor 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.920
 practically no but if you don't want 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.270
 somehow actively you act 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.550
 can stand on it for one 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.259
 tune in 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.420
 you can not glow the whole battle and 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.400
 quite calm 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.200
 very effectively 10 while 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.490
 play and more active it of course 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.130
 much harder because 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.979
 there are minuses of the car and you can 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.810
 sometimes sometimes they get scary 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.569
 splashy bombs and you can get and 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.369
 from artisan bombs wonderful but 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.340
 It's clear that all the cars in the game have 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.080
 disadvantages and here if you do not want so 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.600
 act then you can just play from 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.880
 camouflage and no steam at all about anything 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.950
 in general, I think that this car is just 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.610
 great she's very effective if 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.610
 I now need to take a tank level 9 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.950
 if i want something calm 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.620
 leisurely relaxed i take 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.730
 it is wafflestick, he now seems to me 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.730
 very very good 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.079
 second place, I initially think here 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.409
 put some heavy there 9 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.150
 Levels like E75 or St1 but I realized that 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.280
 would in such a situation just sambo yourself 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.090
 cheated because if i need to play 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.939
 at the ninth level 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.359
 I am precisely tyazh Nibiru because 2 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:01.180
 considered weak enough but this one 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:04.060
 medium tank type 61 he actually 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.159
 just great tool in this car 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.579
 as a matter of fact from the tenth level that is 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.919
 it is very little inferior instrument 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.370
 these dozen of these top st 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:17.139
 armor penetration 258 which allows in 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.989
 principle without using premium 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.709
 projectiles pierce tyazhy 10 levels in the forehead 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.599
 it's just awesome it's great and with 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.230
 this this gun still falls on 10 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.689
 degrees down 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.719
 has quite a decent stabilization 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.739
 that is, yes of course damage per minute here 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.510
 significantly less than a tenth 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.849
 levels but for 9 it 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.549
 all very, very good 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.599
 minus tank of course size and pretty 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.489
 weak booking 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.370
 but for an average tank this is basically 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.099
 ok and besides another important point 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 that he is quite mobile and does not go 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.419
 bad shoots wonderful gun 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.669
 lowering stabilization is breaking through 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.560
 there is damage per minute that is 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.019
 Tank really some 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.879
 significant drawbacks are very very and 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.069
 very few once one of my 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.709
 favorite tanks at the ninth level was m46 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.810
 Dad, but now comparing the boy 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.150
 and type 61 I can hardly see 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.340
 American advantage and disadvantages 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 there are significantly more well and 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.729
 the most important thing is this moment 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.919
 armor penetration 258 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.070
 and to be honest, I think that 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.780
 middle tank 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.820
 Taurage should not be so high 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.730
 armor penetration 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.370
 level ten punch in the forehead but what 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.950
 there is that is of course this tank is complicated 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.230
 for beginners so that once again 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.270
 big cardboard yes and you can easily 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.000
 it’s easy to take a lot of damage 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.440
 with any mistake but in the hands of experienced 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.230
 the players it shows just 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.960
 great results and i think that 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:50.530
 it is at the moment well really 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.530
 one of the best cars on the ninth level and 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.410
 first place probably will not be for 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.430
 many a surprise this is soviet middle 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.370
 tank t-54 and the fact is that of course here 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.900
 need to make a reservation and t-54 with this 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.450
 the instrument that was made as 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.390
 alternative gun supposed that 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.530
 its minus serious minus 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.530
 limit the use of 50 fours 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.910
 will be exactly armor penetration and 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.230
 armor penetration of approximately 200 millimeters 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.510
 standard shirts really on 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.930
 level nine it is rather weak but 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.180
 but if at the same time it is armor penetration 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.580
 to make up for crazy gold 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.440
 breaking 330 then this minus is not at all 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.480
 felt that is you see some 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.180
 armored target you charge heads you 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.150
 see some smaller purpose 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.250
 on cardboard and calmly punch it bb 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.750
 In the other parameters, of course, 54 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.910
 just great great speed 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.760
 excellent mobility dynamics 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.460
 maneuverability and of course 50 fours not 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.590
 so long ago a little cut the tower on 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.620
 actually a little bit now if the projectile 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.780
 falls right on the front of the tower 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.670
 a breakthrough may well occur but 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.400
 the fact is that this is a tower this building 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.940
 still these are all tilting and this one 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.680
 the form of armor it is quite optimal and 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.290
 in fact, it often turns ricochets 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.210
 from the edges of the rebound from some bevels 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.110
 there is armor for a medium tank with such 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.140
 mobility 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.090
 I don't care just fine one of 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.790
 serious competitors t-54 now 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.610
 is an object 430 2 at the ninth level 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.320
 but I personally just don’t really like back 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.950
 the location of the tower so this tank 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.720
 here in the ranking there is no as there is no and heavy 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.240
 tanks on the ninth level precisely for the 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.370
 the reason is that there are a lot of 54 who are 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.530
 Grade Nine and Golda calmly 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.630
 punches almost your flop yes 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.520
 cumulative doing 54 so wonderful 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.590
 tank but since they are available 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.720
 absolutely for everyone to buy for silver 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.310
 then this is the gaming reality of which we 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.610
 Now we are with you therefore 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.290
 e50 four, I think the best tank on 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.270
 ninth level here is such a rating 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.630
 so today everything and thanks for 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.630
 Attention
