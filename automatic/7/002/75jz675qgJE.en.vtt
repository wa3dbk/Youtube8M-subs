00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.549
 alive alive alive 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:26.189
 hello I'm liked when print point 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 I did at this moment I want to show you the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.059
 flyer printing procedure 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.750
 in volume with a canon printer of m &amp; g 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.059
 21 10 series were watching an image 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 there is already a flyer and 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.250
 then you do not put the size that is to 4 and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 you put the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.650
 the following that is something particular 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.650
 look 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.450
 when you put flat paper the machine 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.790
 it will automatically print on 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.140
 standard quality if you use it in standard 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.239
 to print this print volume 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.580
 the most likely thing is that you burn 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.729
 cartridges then what I recommend 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.660
 is that I put the photo matte 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.850
 mate that was basically a paper 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.880
 different or you can put gloss and premium 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.360
 pp paper and that way you can have the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.250
 option to be able to print in high quality 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.080
 you always have to put the quality 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.190
 high when you go print flyers or 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:32.700
 things of high quantity or high title if 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:36.780
 we are going to print and in particular this 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.479
 20 sheets and in particular because it jumps 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.090
 a message when sending to print that you 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.670
 ask if you have placed the paper 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.770
 photographic of the correct side 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.100
 and later it gives you access to power 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.610
 to print 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.440
 I'm gustavo from econo print point s here 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.110
 is the message we are going to put the paper and 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.720
 he left 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.720
 we are all good
