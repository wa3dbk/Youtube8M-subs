00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.730
 a greeting to all are julius of juliusdesign.net today we see how 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.990
 move enemy elements 3d color better effects 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:12.909
 then 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:18.009
 we position on showed stan get a video h his now chosen this of 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.900
 Lady Gaga 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.560
 then at this point 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.369
 let's copy our goal 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.369
 we paste twice 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.940
 okay we select the two video copies 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.880
 let us put them in this world as you will see 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
 you will understand why 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.960
 Let's take them 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.580
 and let's say a comment to allow manipulation in 3d so let's go to the 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.190
 panel compositions 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.530
 insert in the box where you see the ones with the cube-shaped graphics 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.450
 for all three levels 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.760
 as you see 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.790
 created the mines 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.980
 nd 3d environment for our element 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.239
 y 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.470
 lost 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.470
 go up and down 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 x you right left 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 and throws to the depth 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.050
 in this case we use 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.410
 the arrow then projects depth and we take ours back 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 first video the central one 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.110
 while we position our own 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.500
 quite 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.060
 above as in this way 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 now if we are always these two I envy 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640
 expert 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.450
 stream 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.510
 fruit with inscription I love the tool 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.810
 rotation 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 that we find in the instrument panel at the top 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.039
 holding down 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.890
 on the seine the film 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.920
 let's see how ours 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.980
 vidios tv element 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.960
 rota 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.960
 in this world we do 'what' s also for the other 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.049
 more or less like this 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.439
 now 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.959
 let's go to the level 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:11.900
 or new 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.610
 camera this is a camera object that allows us to perform 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.069
 indeed it is 3d on all objects 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.630
 in this case we leave the default settings ok 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.960
 the camera obviously g chefs all those levels where they have selected 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.789
 the manipulation xd 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.399
 which we did the first 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.499
 select the camera 1 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.890
 or use the various tools 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.019
 the trace tool 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.669
 the instrument 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.629
 constitution rotation and rags 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.439
 for example the track tool 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.999
 what is it allows us to do precisely priest 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.589
 allows us to move in depth 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.219
 what we will do now 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.139
 while 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.529
 the xx york traces tool allows us to move in space 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.939
 while I hear it spin hijacking 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.369
 i'm still levels 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.639
 now flights we press chin on z traces let us take a little back because of it 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.349
 I want to create two more levels 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.669
 envy we wait for the two 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.369
 paste 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.369
 and bring them 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.529
 forward 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.449
 in this way I always remember 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.819
 terrible 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.819
 the z axis 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.079
 legnano tries to make him go over 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.229
 to the other video to make the effect request 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.369
 g overlay 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.579
 if we want we can 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.799
 make a rotation like we did before 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.180
 let us do a little more offer 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.550
 now section of ours 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.199
 clio camera 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.850
 retirement its characteristics state transformation 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.569
 we come 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.060
 point of interest 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.250
 exposure 3 - these are the boundaries of time 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.789
 it means 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.499
 we give you those features so I can't register in this one 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.229
 moment 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.719
 this is our starting point 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.180
 Going forward 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.900
 for example 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.849
 t a couple of seconds 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.849
 let's go back 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.729
 I love this interesting effect 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.009
 now to make it a little asked now I'm using the same vidio 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.830
 and the effect is not beautiful when you always see the same images 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.580
 we can a little 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.689
 change our alcoholics on DVD and just dragging the video tracks I have 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:25.830
 in the bedroom in ita 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.460
 a little further to the left 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.460
 look what happens 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.539
 you see I'm just changing the world start my video 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.659
 in this way I create 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.729
 different images and it becomes much more appealing 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.809
 see how simple it is with this tool 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:58.669
 camera 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.900
 enter to show 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.610
 the 3d environment entering the objects 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.439
 in this projection 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.609
 always using rotation in no one forbids us to 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.339
 rotary stainless elements 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.339
 Venice 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:21.859
 in this way you can make very engaging animations 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.710
 idem xd 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.379
 at the next startup tutorial hello
