00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.160 
think my my personal favorite new effect
that<00:03:40.209> we<00:03:40.299> added<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.720> game<00:03:40.840> would<00:03:40.989> be<00:03:41.049> the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
that we added to the game would be the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.569 
that we added to the game would be the
earthquake<00:03:41.560> set<00:03:41.799> where<00:03:41.950> every<00:03:42.069> time<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.340> leap

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
earthquake set where every time you leap

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.520 
earthquake set where every time you leap
you<00:03:42.819> have<00:03:42.970> an<00:03:43.090> earthquake<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.989> goes<00:03:44.139> off<00:03:44.290> which

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530

is really incredibly strong and then we

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.780 
is really incredibly strong and then we
also<00:03:47.349> made<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> pair<00:03:47.889> of<00:03:47.950> boots<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.310> sort<00:03:48.730> of

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
multiple times in succession and the end

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.059 
multiple times in succession and the end

example<00:04:07.690> or<00:04:07.900> what<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.620> think<00:04:09.010> it's<00:04:09.160> really<00:04:09.370> good

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
example or what I think it's really good

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.849 
example or what I think it's really good
is<00:04:09.819> that<00:04:10.180> there<00:04:10.630> are<00:04:10.660> items<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.109> focus<00:04:11.650> you

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
is that there are items that focus you

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.330 
is that there are items that focus you
into<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.910> special<00:04:13.630> set<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.840> abilities<00:04:14.139> like<00:04:14.410> a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
into a special set of abilities like a

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.250 
into a special set of abilities like a
plus<00:04:15.819> twenty<00:04:16.150> percent<00:04:16.450> on<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.660> kind<00:04:16.959> damage

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
plus twenty percent on a kind damage

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.699 
plus twenty percent on a kind damage
this<00:04:17.919> alone<00:04:18.250> verifies<00:04:19.150> for<00:04:19.989> just<00:04:20.289> a<00:04:20.410> set<00:04:20.590> of

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
this alone verifies for just a set of

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.589 
this alone verifies for just a set of
Akane<00:04:20.979> abilities<00:04:21.370> which<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.240> really<00:04:22.450> good

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
Akane abilities which is really good

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.360

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
because before you had the feeling of I

because before you had the feeling of I
don't<00:04:24.789> really<00:04:25.060> need<00:04:25.120> multiple<00:04:25.630> characters

because it can every

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.189 
because it can every
character<00:04:27.669> can<00:04:27.789> do<00:04:27.880> everything<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.660> now<00:04:29.139> you

character can do everything and now you
can<00:04:29.740> be<00:04:29.949> more<00:04:30.100> specialized<00:04:30.669> before<00:04:30.970> character

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360

to<00:05:55.930> play<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.289> tanks<00:05:56.860> almost<00:05:57.580> always<00:05:58.180> I<00:05:58.419> play

the<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.650> heavy<00:05:59.800> characters<00:06:00.280> that<00:06:00.669> sort<00:06:01.270> of

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
the the heavy characters that sort of

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.570 
the the heavy characters that sort of
deal<00:06:01.930> with<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.320> aggro<00:06:02.620> or<00:06:02.889> you<00:06:03.159> know<00:06:03.280> keep<00:06:03.490> the

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
deal with the aggro or you know keep the

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.129 
deal with the aggro or you know keep the
mobs<00:06:03.759> tension<00:06:04.150> and<00:06:04.330> do<00:06:04.750> all<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:04.960> heavy

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
mobs tension and do all the heavy

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:06.899 
mobs tension and do all the heavy
lifting<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:06.190> it<00:06:06.280> would<00:06:06.370> either<00:06:06.490> have<00:06:06.580> to<00:06:06.820> be

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
lifting so it would either have to be

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.939 
lifting so it would either have to be
the<00:06:07.000> barbarian<00:06:07.509> or<00:06:07.599> the<00:06:07.750> Crusader<00:06:08.110> and

definitely as a tank role probably the

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.540 
definitely as a tank role probably the
Crusader<00:06:11.680> because<00:06:11.979> I<00:06:12.070> envisioned<00:06:12.460> the

don't know that I would say to influence
it<00:06:46.919> I<00:06:47.010> think<00:06:47.070> as<00:06:47.729> a<00:06:47.790> company<00:06:48.510> we<00:06:48.540> are<00:06:48.810> all<00:06:49.169> very

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
it I think as a company we are all very

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.110 
it I think as a company we are all very
collaborative<00:06:50.130> and<00:06:50.250> we<00:06:50.340> talked<00:06:50.580> to<00:06:50.790> all<00:06:51.090> the

different design teams on a regular

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.760 
different design teams on a regular
basis<00:06:53.010> I<00:06:53.790> think<00:06:54.150> Diablo<00:06:54.479> is<00:06:54.510> very<00:06:54.900> unique<00:06:55.380> game

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
basis I think Diablo is very unique game

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.930 
basis I think Diablo is very unique game
and<00:06:55.979> it's<00:06:56.100> a<00:06:56.160> very<00:06:56.370> different<00:06:56.580> game<00:06:56.790> than

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
and it's a very different game than

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
world of warcraft i think that the

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.590 
world of warcraft i think that the
expansion<00:06:59.370> adds<00:06:59.760> a<00:07:00.030> lot<00:07:00.150> of<00:07:00.210> new<00:07:00.419> features
