think what's there is think Westerners

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
think what's there is think Westerners
if<00:01:06.840> something<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.830> has<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> lot<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.939> luster<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
if something is has a lot of luster and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.000 
if something is has a lot of luster and
maybe<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.260> less<00:01:10.500> circly

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
maybe not so much less circly

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
maybe not so much less circly
yeah<00:01:11.460> sparkly<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.299> good<00:01:12.479> term

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that has a lot of luster reflects a lot

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
that has a lot of luster reflects a lot
of<00:01:16.680> light<00:01:16.799> yeah<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.270> say

and what are some things that are kind
of<00:01:22.619> shiny

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
of shiny

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.359 
of shiny
yeah<00:01:24.030> metals<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:24.689> shiny<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.250> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
yeah metals are shiny right so do you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.210 
yeah metals are shiny right so do you
think<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:27.390> sorry<00:01:27.570> what's<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> yeah<00:01:28.799> crystals

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
think I'm sorry what's it yeah crystals

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.620 
think I'm sorry what's it yeah crystals
can<00:01:29.369> definitely<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.880> shiny<00:01:30.180> too

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
can definitely be shiny too

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
can definitely be shiny too
do<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.530> any<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.979> these<00:01:32.280> minerals<00:01:33.180> here

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
do you think any of these minerals here

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.370 
do you think any of these minerals here
are<00:01:33.630> more<00:01:34.229> shiny<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.100> others<00:01:35.610> yeah<00:01:36.509> yeah<00:01:37.170> why

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
are more shiny than others yeah yeah why

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.630 
are more shiny than others yeah yeah why
don't<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> try<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> pick<00:01:38.009> some<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> those<00:01:38.400> out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
don't you try to pick some of those out

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940 
don't you try to pick some of those out
yeah<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:39.810> definitely<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.439> shiny

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
yeah that one definitely is shiny

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
yeah that one definitely is shiny
yeah<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.610> say<00:01:41.759> let's<00:01:42.180> start<00:01:42.420> maybe<00:01:42.570> we

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
yeah that would say let's start maybe we

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
yeah that would say let's start maybe we
can<00:01:42.899> separate<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.040> ones

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
can separate them a little bit so ones

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
can separate them a little bit so ones
that<00:01:44.430> maybe<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> shiny<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.990> those

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that maybe are kind of shiny put those

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.830 
that maybe are kind of shiny put those
maybe<00:01:46.560> move<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.130> over<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.780> alright

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
maybe move that one over here alright

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.160 
maybe move that one over here alright
that<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.290> goes<00:01:49.530> over<00:01:49.829> there<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> want

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that one goes over there so do you want

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.010 
that one goes over there so do you want
us<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.560> separate<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.100> shiny<00:01:53.340> from

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
us to like separate the shiny from

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.639 
us to like separate the shiny from
um<00:01:54.560> well<00:01:55.310> let's<00:01:55.520> separate<00:01:56.110> what<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:57.229> said<00:01:57.470> that

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
um well let's separate what we said that

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.190 
um well let's separate what we said that
what<00:01:57.799> looks<00:01:57.979> real<00:01:58.399> shiny<00:01:58.810> what<00:01:59.810> looks<00:02:00.020> real

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
what looks real shiny what looks real

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.910 
what looks real shiny what looks real
shiny<00:02:00.470> all<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.399> time<00:02:01.640> crystal<00:02:02.740> metal<00:02:03.740> right

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
shiny all the time crystal metal right

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.889 
shiny all the time crystal metal right
down<00:02:04.520> there<00:02:04.700> once<00:02:04.970> here<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.330> kind<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.600> looked

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
down there once here that kind of looked

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.199 
down there once here that kind of looked
like<00:02:05.990> metal<00:02:06.470> yeah<00:02:06.920> yeah<00:02:07.430> well<00:02:07.640> let's<00:02:07.789> separate

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
like metal yeah yeah well let's separate

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.210 
like metal yeah yeah well let's separate
those<00:02:08.450> up<00:02:08.690> let's<00:02:08.929> try<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.200> move<00:02:09.590> those<00:02:09.860> into<00:02:09.890> a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
those up let's try to move those into a

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.330 
those up let's try to move those into a
pile<00:02:10.519> somewhere<00:02:12.130> yeah<00:02:13.130> all<00:02:13.370> right

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.759 

all<00:02:19.340> right<00:02:19.519> that's<00:02:19.730> good<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:21.080> if<00:02:21.349> I<00:02:21.470> take<00:02:21.709> a

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
all right that's good now if I take a

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.290 
all right that's good now if I take a
look<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.400> one<00:02:22.610> does<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.910> really<00:02:23.180> look

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
look at this one does this really look

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.800 
look at this one does this really look
like<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.750> metal<00:02:24.250> no<00:02:25.250> right<00:02:26.060> it's<00:02:26.209> real<00:02:26.480> shiny

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
like a metal no right it's real shiny

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.530 
like a metal no right it's real shiny
yeah<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.830> put<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.700> reflects<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.269> lot

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
yeah right put it like it reflects a lot

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.509 
yeah right put it like it reflects a lot
a<00:02:29.569> lot<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:30.019> light<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:30.590> not<00:02:30.799> necessarily

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
a lot of light but it's not necessarily

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.509 
a lot of light but it's not necessarily
shiny<00:02:32.150> or<00:02:32.989> necessarily<00:02:33.739> looking<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:34.489> a

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
shiny or necessarily looking like a

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.130 
shiny or necessarily looking like a
metal<00:02:34.880> but<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.120> does<00:02:35.269> reflect<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.810> lot<00:02:35.959> of<00:02:36.019> light

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
metal but it does reflect a lot of light

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.180 
metal but it does reflect a lot of light
and<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.010> compared<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:38.569> mineral

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
and if I compared it to this mineral

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.460 
and if I compared it to this mineral
right<00:02:40.190> as<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.549> turn<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:40.880> like<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.170> see

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
right as I turn it like that can you see

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.140 
right as I turn it like that can you see
that<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.680> dark<00:02:43.100> one<00:02:43.280> reflects<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.790> lot<00:02:43.940> more

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that that dark one reflects a lot more

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.600 
that that dark one reflects a lot more
light<00:02:44.360> than<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.690> yellow<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.049> does<00:02:45.290> yeah<00:02:46.069> so

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
light than this yellow one does yeah so

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.370 
light than this yellow one does yeah so
it<00:02:46.760> may<00:02:46.940> reflect<00:02:47.269> as<00:02:47.540> much<00:02:47.810> light<00:02:48.049> as<00:02:48.200> that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
it may reflect as much light as that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.170 
it may reflect as much light as that
metal<00:02:48.769> but<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.069> doesn't<00:02:49.400> look<00:02:49.640> like<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:49.910> metal

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
metal but it doesn't look like a metal

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.330 
metal but it doesn't look like a metal
right<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.230> I'm<00:02:51.290> gonna<00:02:51.410> kind<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.709> move<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.160> one

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
right so I'm gonna kind of move this one

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.820 
right so I'm gonna kind of move this one
back<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:53.000> those<00:02:53.239> guys<00:02:53.510> over<00:02:53.720> there<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.680> was

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
back but those guys over there if I was

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.190 
back but those guys over there if I was
gonna<00:02:55.040> describe<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.880> terms<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.420> luster<00:02:56.900> I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
gonna describe that in terms of luster I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.470 
gonna describe that in terms of luster I
would<00:02:57.890> call<00:02:58.310> those<00:02:58.959> minerals<00:02:59.959> metallic<00:03:01.480> all

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
would call those minerals metallic all

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.110 
would call those minerals metallic all
right<00:03:02.660> because<00:03:03.470> they<00:03:03.739> look<00:03:03.980> like<00:03:04.130> metal<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.730> I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
right because they look like metal and I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.940 
right because they look like metal and I
can<00:03:05.299> further<00:03:05.540> separate<00:03:06.140> them<00:03:06.260> because<00:03:06.410> do

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
can further separate them because do

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.140 
can further separate them because do
they<00:03:07.100> look<00:03:07.400> like<00:03:07.459> they're<00:03:07.820> all<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.120> same

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
they look like they're all the same

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.479 
they look like they're all the same
metal<00:03:08.630> could<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:09.350> separate<00:03:09.920> them<00:03:10.010> even<00:03:10.280> further

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
metal could I separate them even further

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.819 
metal could I separate them even further
yeah<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.299> right<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:11.690> how<00:03:11.840> many<00:03:11.900> how<00:03:12.620> could<00:03:12.769> I

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
yeah all right so how many how could I

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.740 
yeah all right so how many how could I
separate<00:03:13.250> them<00:03:13.340> Tim<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.060> separating<00:03:14.600> for

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
separate them Tim can you separating for

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:23.740 
separate them Tim can you separating for
me<00:03:21.549> yeah<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:22.609> that<00:03:22.940> one's<00:03:23.090> kind<00:03:23.329> of<00:03:23.359> different

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
me yeah so that one's kind of different

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.180 
me yeah so that one's kind of different
right<00:03:23.870> it's<00:03:24.049> on<00:03:24.200> its<00:03:24.350> own<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.739> one<00:03:24.950> looks

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
right it's on its own this one looks

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.280 
right it's on its own this one looks
like<00:03:25.280> metal<00:03:25.790> like<00:03:26.150> oh<00:03:26.359> I<00:03:26.450> like<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.750> chairs<00:03:27.049> we

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
like metal like oh I like the chairs we

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.990 
like metal like oh I like the chairs we
sit<00:03:27.560> on<00:03:27.650> right<00:03:27.859> like<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.250> frame<00:03:28.549> around<00:03:28.760> them

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
sit on right like the frame around them

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.460 
sit on right like the frame around them
it<00:03:29.120> looks<00:03:29.299> like<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.660> kind<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.049> metal<00:03:30.319> what

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
it looks like that kind of metal what

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.930 
it looks like that kind of metal what
kind<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.709> metal<00:03:30.950> does<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.190> look<00:03:31.370> like

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.580 

yeah<00:03:34.940> well<00:03:35.569> what's<00:03:35.750> one<00:03:36.019> though<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.410> might

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
yeah well what's one though that might

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.569 
yeah well what's one though that might
stand<00:03:36.889> out<00:03:38.410> yeah<00:03:39.410> like<00:03:39.709> gold<00:03:39.980> right<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:40.459> it

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
stand out yeah like gold right so it

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.280 
stand out yeah like gold right so it
kind<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.790> cuz<00:03:40.970> Gold's<00:03:41.329> a<00:03:41.389> metal<00:03:41.660> right<00:03:42.049> and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
kind of cuz Gold's a metal right and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.750 
kind of cuz Gold's a metal right and
this<00:03:42.410> one<00:03:42.590> kind<00:03:42.799> of<00:03:42.829> looks<00:03:42.950> like<00:03:43.190> super<00:03:43.549> cuz

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
this one kind of looks like super cuz

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.720 
this one kind of looks like super cuz
Silver's<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.150> metal<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:45.200> um<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:46.340> one<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.639> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
Silver's a metal so um like one of the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.610 
Silver's a metal so um like one of the
first<00:03:46.940> separations<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.780> can<00:03:47.989> do<00:03:48.109> is<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.440> can

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
first separations I can do is that I can

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.559 
first separations I can do is that I can
separate<00:03:49.100> all<00:03:49.310> three<00:03:49.609> of<00:03:49.730> these<00:03:49.880> guys<00:03:50.239> out

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
separate all three of these guys out

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.620 
separate all three of these guys out
right<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:52.069> I<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.400> these<00:03:52.760> guys<00:03:53.090> over<00:03:53.450> here

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
right and I can these guys over here

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.590 
right and I can these guys over here
right<00:03:54.560> because<00:03:55.160> those<00:03:55.519> are<00:03:55.970> going<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.359> be

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
right because those are going to be

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.960 
right because those are going to be
metallic<00:03:57.079> and<00:03:57.500> these<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:58.489> going<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.760> be

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
metallic and these are going to be

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.699 
metallic and these are going to be
nonmetallic<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.019> I'm<00:04:00.170> talking<00:04:00.410> about

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
nonmetallic so if I'm talking about

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.460 
nonmetallic so if I'm talking about
luster<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.579> have<00:04:02.060> two<00:04:02.419> different<00:04:02.690> like<00:04:03.109> main

luster I have two different like main
categories<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.430> have<00:04:04.820> minerals<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.840> are

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
categories I have minerals that are

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.730 
categories I have minerals that are
going<00:04:06.109> to<00:04:06.199> look<00:04:06.410> like

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
going to look like

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.650 
going to look like
metal<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.520> have<00:04:07.730> minerals<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.300> are<00:04:08.360> not

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
metal and I have minerals that are not

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.850 
metal and I have minerals that are not
going<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:08.990> look<00:04:09.080> like<00:04:09.140> nothing

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
going to look like nothing

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.220

we want to do if we're gonna try to

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.720 
we want to do if we're gonna try to
assess<00:04:14.110> luster<00:04:15.110> alright<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.190> color

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
assess luster alright in color

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.760 
assess luster alright in color
alright<00:04:17.270> so<00:04:17.660> if<00:04:17.930> we're<00:04:18.080> gonna<00:04:18.170> look<00:04:18.440> at<00:04:18.620> these

alright so if we're gonna look at these

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.710 
alright so if we're gonna look at these
tables<00:04:19.280> over<00:04:19.850> here<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.830> if<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:22.040> notice

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
tables over here and if you notice

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.050 
tables over here and if you notice
starting<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.870> page<00:04:24.200> 70<00:04:25.010> if<00:04:25.160> everybody's<00:04:25.730> here

way up on the top right we see these
headings<00:04:33.110> where<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.470> says<00:04:33.710> metallic<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.670> sub

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
headings where it says metallic and sub

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.740 
headings where it says metallic and sub
metallic<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.900> then<00:04:36.020> we've<00:04:36.200> got<00:04:36.610> nonmetallic

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
metallic and then we've got nonmetallic

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.750 
metallic and then we've got nonmetallic
when<00:04:38.750> we're<00:04:38.960> looking<00:04:39.470> at<00:04:39.800> minerals<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.670> we're

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
when we're looking at minerals and we're

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.880 
when we're looking at minerals and we're
trying<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.180> identify<00:04:41.300> them<00:04:41.990> we're<00:04:42.500> gonna<00:04:42.590> look

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
trying to identify them we're gonna look

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.800 
trying to identify them we're gonna look
at<00:04:43.070> some<00:04:43.370> physical<00:04:43.940> properties<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.660> are

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
at some physical properties that are

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.180 
at some physical properties that are
gonna<00:04:44.900> help<00:04:45.140> us<00:04:45.290> identify<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:46.010> these

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
gonna help us identify and in these

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.790 
gonna help us identify and in these
tables<00:04:46.820> are<00:04:47.060> what<00:04:47.750> we<00:04:47.870> use<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.290> even<00:04:48.440> miss

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
tables are what we use and even miss

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.340 
tables are what we use and even miss
Awadh<00:04:49.070> myself<00:04:49.610> mr.<00:04:49.850> bin<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.390> mr.<00:04:50.810> Baldwin<00:04:51.170> use

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
Awadh myself mr. bin and mr. Baldwin use

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.840 
Awadh myself mr. bin and mr. Baldwin use
these<00:04:51.590> all<00:04:52.130> right<00:04:52.220> because<00:04:52.340> we<00:04:52.520> don't<00:04:52.700> have

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
these all right because we don't have

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.910 
these all right because we don't have
all<00:04:53.000> 3000<00:04:53.690> minerals<00:04:54.020> memorized<00:04:54.440> in<00:04:54.650> our<00:04:54.770> head

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
all 3000 minerals memorized in our head

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.040 
all 3000 minerals memorized in our head
so<00:04:55.400> sometimes<00:04:55.850> we<00:04:56.060> have<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.360> use<00:04:56.390> these<00:04:56.750> guys

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
so sometimes we have to use these guys

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.440 
so sometimes we have to use these guys
too<00:04:57.320> so<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.280> first<00:04:58.520> thing<00:04:58.700> I'm<00:04:58.790> gonna<00:04:58.970> do<00:04:59.210> is

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
that I'm gonna look at a mineral and I'm

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.710 
that I'm gonna look at a mineral and I'm
gonna<00:05:01.130> decide<00:05:01.520> whether<00:05:01.790> hey<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.180> metallic

gonna decide whether hey is it metallic

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.860 
gonna decide whether hey is it metallic
or<00:05:03.050> nonmetallic<00:05:03.850> alright<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:05.000> once<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.810> do

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
or nonmetallic alright and once I do

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.030 
or nonmetallic alright and once I do
that<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.140> know<00:05:06.290> exactly<00:05:06.770> what<00:05:07.220> page<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.850> flip<00:05:08.060> to

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
that I know exactly what page to flip to

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.150 
that I know exactly what page to flip to
alright

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160

bunch of other physical properties that

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.710 
bunch of other physical properties that
we're<00:05:31.100> gonna<00:05:31.250> get<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.700> today<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:32.510> I'm<00:05:32.690> just

gonna stop there and we're gonna focus
on<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.760> non<00:05:34.970> metallic<00:05:35.440> alright<00:05:36.440> so<00:05:36.590> let's

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
on the non metallic alright so let's

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.770 
on the non metallic alright so let's
take<00:05:36.950> a<00:05:36.980> look<00:05:37.160> at<00:05:37.340> these<00:05:37.460> non<00:05:37.760> metallic<00:05:38.120> and

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
take a look at these non metallic and

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.780 
take a look at these non metallic and
let's<00:05:39.110> talk<00:05:39.350> about<00:05:39.650> them<00:05:39.770> in<00:05:39.890> terms<00:05:40.190> of<00:05:40.400> luster

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
let's talk about them in terms of luster

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.470 
let's talk about them in terms of luster
now<00:05:40.940> are<00:05:41.090> there<00:05:41.270> some<00:05:41.600> here<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:42.080> are<00:05:42.200> more
