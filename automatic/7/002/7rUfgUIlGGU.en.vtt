you six additional analog outs as well

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.520 
you six additional analog outs as well
as<00:02:49.010> our<00:02:49.280> bus<00:02:49.550> io<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.420> digital<00:02:51.020> ends<00:02:51.350> in<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
as our bus io and digital ends in the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.030 
as our bus io and digital ends in the
form<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.980> optical<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.090> coaxial<00:02:53.780> if<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.860> want

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
form of optical and coaxial if you want

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.400 
form of optical and coaxial if you want
the<00:02:55.130> information<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.030> MVA<00:02:56.300> op1<00:02:56.930> visit<00:02:57.940> WWN

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
the information on the MVA op1 visit WWN

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.840 
the information on the MVA op1 visit WWN
so<00:03:00.410> that's<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.769> of<00:03:00.800> like<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> bird's<00:03:01.610> eye<00:03:01.820> view

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
so that's kind of like a bird's eye view

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.240 
so that's kind of like a bird's eye view
of<00:03:02.180> what<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.750> MV<00:03:03.019> 8000<00:03:03.560> has<00:03:03.650> made<00:03:03.860> up<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.160> of

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
of what the MV 8000 has made up and of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.250 
of what the MV 8000 has made up and of
course<00:03:04.519> we'll<00:03:04.760> go<00:03:04.940> into<00:03:05.090> each<00:03:05.330> detail<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.900> each

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
course we'll go into each detail of each

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.190 
course we'll go into each detail of each
control<00:03:07.220> as<00:03:07.340> we<00:03:07.489> explore<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.030> unit<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:09.140> a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
control as we explore the unit in a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.650 
control as we explore the unit in a
moment<00:03:09.739> but<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.519> also<00:03:10.700> understand<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.269> a<00:03:11.360> lot

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
moment but I also understand that a lot
