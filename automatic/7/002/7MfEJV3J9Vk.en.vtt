00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
you know I think until Devin Harris
drove<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> basket<00:00:22.380> week<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:23.039> got<00:00:23.519> stops

which<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.080> allowed<00:00:25.410> us<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:25.830> back

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
which you know allowed us to go back

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.859 
which you know allowed us to go back
down<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.220> try<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.939> versus<00:00:27.480> they'll<00:00:27.630> keep

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
down and try to get versus they'll keep

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
down and try to get versus they'll keep
getting<00:00:28.289> closer<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.650> putting<00:00:28.800> more<00:00:29.039> pressure

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
