00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.740

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.980
 cod even panga today we are going to do 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.470

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 very simple to do it and the truth is 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.600

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.070
 then the ingredients what 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.070
 we will need and how to do it 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.160
 the main ingredient of course is 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.500
 the fish we already said that here in 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.079
 this case we are going to use panga but 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.390
 could be cod salmon hake 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 etc 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.620
 the special thing we have consent a 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.470
 little oil 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.110
 with basil paprika and a little black 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.930
 and we'll put a little bit of potato and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.140
 onion as a garnish let's see how 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.690
 prepare everything 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.850
 in one of these silicone containers 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.280
 special for ovens and microwave 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.920
 let's put the potato in the background 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.010
 cut into very thin slices and the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.300
 julienne onion this we are going to 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 salt a little 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.400
 we will put a splash of oil 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 very little and we are going to put a little 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.320
 of spicy paprika 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.570
 that the potato always cooked potato 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.580
 always doing very well 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 and this we are going to close and what 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.250
 we will put in the microwave so that it 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 start doing 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.570
 the idea is to leave it to finish 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.149
 bake because then when we put the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.409
 fish will end up doing everything together 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.680
 once the first one is finished 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:16.040
 part of the cooking we will put the tray 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.620
 you have in this type of containers 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.870
 so that liquids and juices fall 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.980
 below we will put the tray here and over 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.980
 let's put the fish 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.530
 and now we dress it 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.960
 with salt 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.960
 a little bit of ground black pepper 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.799
 a little oil splash 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.799
 a little basil 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.190
 a little dill for the fish 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.170
 always tastes great 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.290
 and finally an ingredient that we 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.190
 has forgotten to put before that would be the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.190
 half lemon juice 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.700
 the cousins ​​here 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.180
 and we put it directly on the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.180
 fish 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:27.140
 and this we close again 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.140
 to the microwave to finish making 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.829
 to serve it we will put the ration 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.170
 corresponding on the plate and you 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.640
 we will add a little bit of garnish and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.640
 of the juice that we have taken 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.790
 and with this ready you take advantage
