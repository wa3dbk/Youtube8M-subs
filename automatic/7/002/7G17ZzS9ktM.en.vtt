00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.100 

so<00:00:01.230> here<00:00:01.439> fast<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> mousetrap<00:00:02.840> so<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:03.990> this

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
so here fast is a mousetrap so in this

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.559 
so here fast is a mousetrap so in this
video<00:00:04.400> trigger<00:00:05.400> me<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.580> strap<00:00:05.879> at<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.089> variety<00:00:06.330> of

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
video trigger me I strap at a variety of

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.110 
video trigger me I strap at a variety of
speeds<00:00:08.599> and<00:00:09.599> then<00:00:09.809> I'll<00:00:09.990> calculate<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.429> close

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
speeds and then I'll calculate the close

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.060 
speeds and then I'll calculate the close
to<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.450> based<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> frames<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.679> takes<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
to on based on the frames it takes to

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.779 
to on based on the frames it takes to
close<00:00:14.250> when<00:00:14.610> filmed<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> high-speed<00:00:15.240> camera

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
close when filmed on a high-speed camera

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
close when filmed on a high-speed camera
so<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> real<00:00:18.330> time<00:00:20.420> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.900> tenth

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
so this is real time this is one tenth

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.310 
so this is real time this is one tenth
speed<00:00:24.769> this<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.130> twentieth<00:00:26.609> speed

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.770 

this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.529> 140th<00:00:32.489> speed<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> camera<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.630> now

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this is 140th speed so the camera is now

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.090 
this is 140th speed so the camera is now
recording<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.380> 1200<00:00:38.100> frames<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.489> second<00:00:40.100> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
recording at 1200 frames a second that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.170 
recording at 1200 frames a second that
comes<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.520> cost<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.110> resolution<00:00:44.150> but<00:00:45.150> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
comes at the cost of resolution but it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
comes at the cost of resolution but it
will<00:00:45.330> allow<00:00:45.840> us<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> accurately<00:00:46.559> time<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
will allow us to accurately time the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.619 
will allow us to accurately time the
clothes<00:00:47.430> time<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> let's<00:00:50.220> reset<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.699> trap<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
clothes time so let's reset the trap and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.110 
clothes time so let's reset the trap and
count<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:51.989> frames

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.959 

you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.750 

so<00:01:03.969> that<00:01:04.180> was<00:01:04.330> easy<00:01:04.690> he<00:01:04.869> was<00:01:05.049> 12<00:01:05.950> frames<00:01:06.310> at

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
so that was easy he was 12 frames at

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.870 
so that was easy he was 12 frames at
1,200<00:01:07.420> frames<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.320> second<00:01:08.710> sells<00:01:09.640> 10

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
1,200 frames a second sells 10

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.109 
1,200 frames a second sells 10
milliseconds<00:01:10.180> closed<00:01:10.810> on<00:01:11.220> give<00:01:12.220> or<00:01:12.340> take<00:01:12.550> one

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
milliseconds closed on give or take one

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.260 
milliseconds closed on give or take one
point<00:01:13.420> six<00:01:13.930> six<00:01:14.140> milliseconds<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:16.060> it's

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
point six six milliseconds because it's

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.969 
point six six milliseconds because it's
not<00:01:16.420> starting<00:01:16.690> exactly<00:01:16.960> on<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.380> frame<00:01:17.619> it's<00:01:17.830> not

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
not starting exactly on a frame it's not

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.290 
not starting exactly on a frame it's not
ending<00:01:18.490> exactly<00:01:18.970> on<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.119> frame<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.790> my<00:01:22.000> strap

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
ending exactly on a frame so my strap

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.760 
ending exactly on a frame so my strap
will<00:01:22.450> close<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:23.040> 1/100<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.310> second<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:26.530> in

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
will close in 1/100 of a second or in

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.810 
will close in 1/100 of a second or in
other<00:01:26.920> words<00:01:27.210> faster<00:01:28.210> than<00:01:28.330> my<00:01:28.450> finger
