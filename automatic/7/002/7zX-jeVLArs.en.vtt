it's on the left side near the front

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.540 
it's on the left side near the front
door<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:57.350> don't<00:02:58.350> know<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.220> why<00:02:59.370> they

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
door I don't know that this is why they

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.390 
door I don't know that this is why they
make<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.240> if<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.660> car<00:03:01.040> goes<00:03:02.040> underwater

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
make it so if the car goes underwater

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.080 
make it so if the car goes underwater
then<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.180> won't<00:03:03.870> kill<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.200> engine<00:03:04.820> these<00:03:05.820> kind

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
then it won't kill the engine these kind

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.340 
then it won't kill the engine these kind
of<00:03:06.180> course<00:03:06.420> don't<00:03:06.660> have<00:03:06.870> any<00:03:07.020> kind<00:03:07.200> of

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
of course don't have any kind of

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.380 
of course don't have any kind of
electronics<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.100> would<00:03:08.340> kill<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> engine

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
electronics that would kill the engine

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.440 
electronics that would kill the engine
that's<00:03:09.780> what<00:03:09.990> it's<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.970> don't<00:03:12.150> know<00:03:12.270> why

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
that's what it's for so I don't know why

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.470 
that's what it's for so I don't know why
this<00:03:12.810> game<00:03:13.080> doesn't<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.970> properly<00:03:14.970> bad

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
this game doesn't have it properly bad

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.830 
this game doesn't have it properly bad
work<00:03:15.720> from<00:03:16.050> them<00:03:17.000> from<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.150> creator<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.660> this

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
work from them from the creator of this

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.550 
work from them from the creator of this
vehicle<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:19.620> yeah<00:03:20.690> any<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.960> craters<00:03:22.350> look

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
vehicle so yeah any of you craters look

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.250 
vehicle so yeah any of you craters look
at<00:03:22.710> it<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.040> raise<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.850> danger<00:03:24.540> level<00:03:24.690> up<00:03:25.020> to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
at it and raise the danger level up to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.510 
at it and raise the danger level up to
that<00:03:25.880> intake

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
that intake

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.420 
that intake
this<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.330> not<00:03:29.480> for<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.410> looks<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:31.250> this

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
this is not for the looks see this

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.510 
this is not for the looks see this
exhaust<00:03:31.910> pipe<00:03:32.150> in<00:03:32.360> there<00:03:32.890> see<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.100> one

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
exhaust pipe in there see that one

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.950 
exhaust pipe in there see that one
coming<00:03:34.820> out<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.150> engine<00:03:35.210> going<00:03:35.690> there

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
coming out of the engine going there

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.760 
coming out of the engine going there
that's<00:03:36.380> intake<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.020> engine<00:03:39.290> can<00:03:39.320> get<00:03:39.620> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
that's intake so the engine can get the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.670 
that's intake so the engine can get the
air<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.460> need<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:41.080> that's<00:03:42.080> why<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.320> engine

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
air and need it that's why the engine

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.770 
air and need it that's why the engine
stalls<00:03:43.100> on<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.490> water<00:03:43.730> because<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.510> doesn't

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
stalls on the water because it doesn't

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.960 
stalls on the water because it doesn't
get<00:03:44.900> air<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.440> that's<00:03:46.220> why<00:03:46.460> we<00:03:46.640> have<00:03:46.790> this

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
get air and that's why we have this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.540 
get air and that's why we have this
intake<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.690> there<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.560> not<00:03:48.740> exhaust<00:03:49.220> its

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
intake in there it's not exhaust its

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.920 
intake in there it's not exhaust its
intake

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
intake

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.830 
intake
exhaust<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:53.099> can<00:03:53.310> be<00:03:53.430> anywhere<00:03:53.879> Nexo<00:03:54.390> scan<00:03:54.420> be

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
exhaust it can be anywhere Nexo scan be

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.440 
exhaust it can be anywhere Nexo scan be
one-way<00:03:55.530> exhaust<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.219> it<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.549> exhaust<00:03:57.030> fumes

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
one-way exhaust so it just exhaust fumes

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.500 
one-way exhaust so it just exhaust fumes
and<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.500> goes<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.040> stubbles<00:03:59.510> so

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
and it just goes out the stubbles so

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.319 
and it just goes out the stubbles so
that's<00:04:00.750> not<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.900> big<00:04:01.079> deal<00:04:01.250> that's<00:04:02.250> why<00:04:02.489> thanks

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
that's not a big deal that's why thanks

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.449 
that's not a big deal that's why thanks
can<00:04:03.569> thrive<00:04:03.750> underwater<00:04:04.140> because<00:04:04.890> they<00:04:05.099> to

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
can thrive underwater because they to

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.520 
can thrive underwater because they to
exhaust<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.120> stuff<00:04:06.599> but<00:04:06.870> they<00:04:07.019> have<00:04:07.170> some

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
exhaust the stuff but they have some

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.119 
exhaust the stuff but they have some
small<00:04:08.129> air<00:04:08.459> supply<00:04:08.849> so<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.709> drive<00:04:10.859> under

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
small air supply so they can drive under

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.030 
small air supply so they can drive under
water<00:04:11.370> for<00:04:11.639> limited<00:04:12.060> time<00:04:12.319> but<00:04:13.319> yeah<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.709> cars

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
water for limited time but yeah the cars

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.159 
water for limited time but yeah the cars
a<00:04:14.340> lot<00:04:14.879> of<00:04:15.060> people<00:04:15.209> think<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.599> that's<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
a lot of people think that that's the

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.319 
a lot of people think that that's the
engine<00:04:16.500> exhaust<00:04:16.889> but<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.669> not<00:04:17.910> it's<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
engine exhaust but it's not it's the

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.860 
engine exhaust but it's not it's the
intake<00:04:18.720> guys<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:20.180> know<00:04:21.180> why<00:04:21.329> I<00:04:21.359> make<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.720> like

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
intake guys I know why I make it like
