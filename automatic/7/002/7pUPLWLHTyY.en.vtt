streetlights we were on country road and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.670 
streetlights we were on country road and
I<00:02:51.700> was<00:02:51.940> driving<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.450> van<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.440> looked

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
I was driving this van and I just looked

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.500 
I was driving this van and I just looked
out<00:02:53.799> through<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> window<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.940> right-hand

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
out through the window on the right-hand

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.720 
out through the window on the right-hand
side<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.739> thought<00:02:57.069> oh<00:02:57.220> there's<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
side and I just thought oh there's the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.110 
side and I just thought oh there's the
radio<00:02:57.879> mast<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.310> thought<00:03:00.519> no<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.819> not

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
radio mast and then I thought no I not

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.289 
radio mast and then I thought no I not
have<00:03:01.239> any<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.540> there's<00:03:01.930> no<00:03:02.079> radio<00:03:02.379> master

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
have any of that there's no radio master

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.539 
have any of that there's no radio master
for<00:03:04.299> our<00:03:04.420> brake<00:03:05.370> clutch<00:03:06.930> stop<00:03:07.930> look<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.190> it's

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
for our brake clutch stop look and it's

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.970 
for our brake clutch stop look and it's
an<00:03:09.760> inky<00:03:10.209> blackness<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.959> understand<00:03:11.590> and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
an inky blackness you understand and

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.559 
an inky blackness you understand and
what<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.489> thought<00:03:12.790> was<00:03:12.970> something<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.329> was

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
what I thought was something that was

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.659 
what I thought was something that was
upright<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> blackness<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.430> looked

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
upright in the blackness it just looked

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.110 
upright in the blackness it just looked
like<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:15.940> kind<00:03:16.359> of<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:17.530> string<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.489> lights<00:03:18.940> going

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
like a kind of a string of lights going

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.800 
like a kind of a string of lights going
out<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.810> triangular<00:03:20.349> shape<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:22.480> thought

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
out in a triangular shape I just thought

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.900 
out in a triangular shape I just thought
it<00:03:22.989> was<00:03:23.079> up<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.470> wasn't<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:23.980> was<00:03:24.160> coming<00:03:24.700> that
