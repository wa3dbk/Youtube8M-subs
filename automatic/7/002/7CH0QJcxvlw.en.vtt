00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.949
 do not miss it 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.739
 of the most modern aircraft in the world 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.509
 this is one of the safest way 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.509
 ice club never thought of accident 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.329
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.819
 some tasks to last longer than today 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.470
 welcome the life 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.880
 the hand luggage is limited in the perches found 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.530
 shocking is mandatory 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.530
 may I have decided to be had 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.820
 stuck 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.390
 active sports during the weekend 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.390
 to straighten the backrest 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.120
 henkens add a fixed value 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.370
 the use of electronic equipment it is not allowed to make them 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 is a permanent job 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.780
 additionally do 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.199
 a temperature that the transmitter can receive 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.199
 what they bought as a new cell phone 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 be switched off 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.790
 there was no question 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.210
 the damage to the pvv the celebration 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.610
 if that also due to much smaller then really finished 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.690
 shortly after the draw 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.950
 automatic four oxygen masks work out 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.270
 I sit 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.070
 Patrick van It had deteriorated 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.280
 the lowest start position 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 it is the last draw the number lost 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.500
 hold on later 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.920
 parents with children 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.899
 that says the first itself is a difficult start so that they are in the settings afterwards 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 there is really no party leader 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.120
 after opening in a container 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.210
 it stands out in the capital as all 61 the band i used to be on it 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.380
 light on the front 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 D66 was blown up when leaving the plane 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.849
 that's right says rises 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.329
 I can only do that 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.039
 at the bottom of the life jacket 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.379
 you can keep driving the life jacket with the red cross nailed 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.399
 emi 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.089
 of course first put on your own life jacket 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.239
 and keep the lifejacket for a bit out of the package 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.649
 it extends the baby's attention through the arms 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.619
 what a vote test stuck with standing once 8 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.939
 the concept is to put on the map the share of 2 euros and labels at the bottom 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.319
 with only rest 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.089
 the medication received in a festive manner on an airplane 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.839
 a few things 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.669
 this attitude 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.899
 which makes it sharper to kick and hit 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.569
 it is uncertain for a moment along the line 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.889
 names have been given to the emergency exits 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.229
 the body of jackson 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:05.660
 Dutch household 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.099
 does this sound like an own sound 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.309
 now be the man of my dreams about reclassifying the job 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.639
 who his opponent in the arena 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.639
 these stories 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.179
 the sitting posture 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.179
 with your arms crossed on this slide 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.619
 I think that can be followed 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.609
 pulling down clinton 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.009
 and there face came automatically out and up 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.669
 the step outside 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.669
 and inserts an ax on the wing 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.569
 When developing adds in the major cities booked earlier 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.959
 a red line went that he started the loud above the flight 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.989
 that appears from a report from the green street 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.419
 indicates that he starts at the main exit 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.529
 all this information that you can find on the map with 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.909
 safety instructions that occur in the criminal case before it starts 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:12.819
 we wish you a pleasant flight with these words 7 3 800 victory from transavia
