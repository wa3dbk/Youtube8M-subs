get<00:04:58.540> some<00:04:58.570> form<00:04:59.020> of<00:04:59.080> scanning<00:04:59.320> information

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
get some form of scanning information

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.890 
get some form of scanning information
and<00:05:00.040> i'm<00:05:00.700> looking<00:05:01.030> at<00:05:01.120> Maura's<00:05:01.389> vision<00:05:01.750> and

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
and i'm looking at Maura's vision and

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.600 
and i'm looking at Maura's vision and
the<00:05:01.990> only<00:05:02.169> chance<00:05:02.650> he<00:05:02.860> can<00:05:02.979> scout<00:05:03.310> this<00:05:03.490> is

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
the only chance he can scout this is

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.310 
the only chance he can scout this is
with<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.880> Oval<00:05:04.150> which<00:05:04.389> is<00:05:04.510> already<00:05:04.780> orange

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
with the Oval which is already orange

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.530 
with the Oval which is already orange
health<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.950> two<00:05:06.280> Marines<00:05:06.669> are<00:05:06.880> preventing<00:05:07.419> it

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
health and two Marines are preventing it

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.650 
health and two Marines are preventing it
so<00:05:07.690> right<00:05:07.930> now<00:05:07.990> we<00:05:08.889> do<00:05:09.100> have<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.669> build<00:05:10.000> that<00:05:10.479> is

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
so right now we do have a build that is

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.710 
so right now we do have a build that is
designed<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.380> kill<00:05:11.680> more<00:05:12.430> immediately<00:05:13.210> we

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
designed to kill more immediately we

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.659 
designed to kill more immediately we
know<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.169> is<00:05:14.290> far<00:05:14.500> as<00:05:14.620> strengths<00:05:15.070> but<00:05:15.340> at<00:05:15.550> the

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
know this is far as strengths but at the

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.730 
know this is far as strengths but at the
same<00:05:15.910> time<00:05:16.150> Braddock<00:05:16.930> has<00:05:17.080> denied<00:05:17.530> the

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
same time Braddock has denied the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.320 
same time Braddock has denied the
scanning<00:05:18.010> information<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:18.820> if<00:05:19.090> we<00:05:19.180> think

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
scanning information and if we think

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.300 
scanning information and if we think
about<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.600> way<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:20.229> brought<00:05:20.770> up<00:05:20.889> played<00:05:21.160> the

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.860 
about the way that brought up played the
last<00:05:21.490> game<00:05:21.550> you<00:05:21.669> got<00:05:21.880> a<00:05:21.910> macro<00:05:22.389> hatch<00:05:22.600> when<00:05:22.780> he

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
last game you got a macro hatch when he

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.440 
last game you got a macro hatch when he
was<00:05:22.990> hiding<00:05:23.169> this<00:05:23.830> time<00:05:24.160> stuffs<00:05:24.880> been<00:05:24.970> changed

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
to be aware of four of those Helens but

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.800 
to be aware of four of those Helens but
not<00:05:36.310> six<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.789> didn't<00:05:37.030> see<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.330> top<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:37.720> he

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
not six you didn't see the top and he

not six you didn't see the top and he
didn't<00:05:38.110> see<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.320> marauders<00:05:38.770> that's<00:05:38.950> the

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
didn't see the marauders that's the

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.640 
didn't see the marauders that's the
critical<00:05:39.310> thing<00:05:39.729> so<00:05:40.090> honestly<00:05:40.930> I<00:05:41.139> think<00:05:41.260> that

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
critical thing so honestly I think that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.990 
critical thing so honestly I think that

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
more is prolly feeling really confident
