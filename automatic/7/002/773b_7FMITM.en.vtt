00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.360
 Hi everybody 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.910
 we are here on the stand at 4 like 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.590
 to tell you about the new 3ds then 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.420
 current sector on the capcom stand 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.380
 for the night 3ds yeah well it's I 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.000
 think it's a nice publicity stunt 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380
 capcom I already did not need that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.030
 because it presents serene mount t4 and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.250
 in Japan normally it attracts 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.110
 more crowds they make my fate play 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.230
 with a kart hunter 4 on the 3ds 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.610
 3d ghalamnews is a pretty huge cock 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 we would not necessarily behind it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.030
 had in my opinion at least about 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 three hours of tail to go play at 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 the 3ds but it's okay I was 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.019
 motivated and that I could play that was 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 not bad to do it on my senators 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.400
 because we knew that on the 3 there 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.040
 go the second stick who are paying themselves out 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.059
 the 3ds could play ouch played the 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.620
 game lends itself to it because poultry at the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 camera moves and the ja directly the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.159
 integrated site on the new 3ds this is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.330
 one of the main figures finally so 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.990
 I could see what it was like for 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.150
 definitely it works very well 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 it's not true that it looks like a 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.220
 little bit because we had on pc 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 laptops so that it may be talking about 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 not to the youngest but before that pc 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.240
 portable it was a little small 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 sphere that you move is like that for 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.210
 move the mouse it works 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.620
 close on the same principle 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.550
 and it works pretty honestly 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.080
 works well I've never had this topic 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.460
 move the camera very easily after 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.990
 must know about games like dual 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.759
 stick shooter stuff like that but 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.969
 but on my server it works very very 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.500
 well 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.939
 at these words there is no problem between 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.399
 big big plus point that I have 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.020
 noticed this is the 3d screen is displayed 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.360
 extremely well yeah it seems 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.619
 really it's really amazing 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.420
 I did the angers test moves and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.610
 the console on the side 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.930
 completely there is no vision we see the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.549
 3d as if we were perfectly way 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.509
 we can even imagine that's someone 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.649
 who are watching us play in 3d 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.210
 he can see the same thing as us he 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.280
 there is no problem this is really a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.909
 big fat big value even if 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 it is rather rare to play two balls 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.250
 but it's true that it's good because 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.170
 actually on the 3ds when we play it 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.070
 sometimes eleven we should do some 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.930
 small movements finally is not 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.920
 always extremely static and from 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.270
 we made a small movement on the bridge 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.429
 allows a little bit the thread as much as 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.869
 your eye get used to focus that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.190
 could complicate the actually six 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.020
 stilt chords and this after a beautiful 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.640
 advanced adaptation time anyway 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.720
 when you move a little pot there is no 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.240
 worry yes then I still specify 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.590
 it was the great secular model the one that 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.790
 what game there will be also a model a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.140
 little smaller the cei with them the xm 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.630
 so I can speak only of this one but 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.780
 we could move slightly there was 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.160
 almost not two 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.060
 two changes we will say by cons 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.470
 when I passed squarely on the side 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.760
 there was a little years to shift mans 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.350
 and his friends killed not even a second 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.370
 It's going very, very fast, but you do not have to 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.530
 have fun either to do that when we 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.580
 play yeah we rarely do it anyway 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.170
 we really lose but really a 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.430
 big fat slap month for the screen 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.930
 personally I really appreciated 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.800
 after we talk about the weight it is supposed 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.550
 to be heavier I admit I have not 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.080
 must be careful 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.130
 so after the summer has been plugged in there 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.780
 had a heading that held her behind this 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.970
 is not necessarily ideal to travel 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.720
 account of what that gives at the level of 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.700
 weight but let's go 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.840
 she's supposed to be at the essence to have 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.670
 better autonomy I could not too much 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.650
 no longer realize on m min of 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.560
 Thu 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.269
 athens apologize frankly and c is me 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.269
 what is also worth us is the button 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.440
 there are two triggers behind then by 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.820
 against that it's not super super convenient 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.380
 because they are not like that we can 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.590
 not play it directly with both 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.480
 fingers 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.470
 basically there is one finally they are 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.239
 both on the edge yeah 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.200
 so it's hard to explain where he 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.190
 there was one we had slammed 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.300
 supports on the first phalanx and one 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.880
 must slide your finger to press 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.350
 the second and after on the slice 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.090
 after the first I did not find that 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.290
 super super convenient wake vouchers 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.630
 shots with the triggers it can be 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.670
 actually annoying to touch them and 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.280
 networks then the first very 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.560
 accessible the z is the eiders a little 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.760
 more complicated will have to overcome in addition 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.680
 because good to do two three times 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.730
 it will surely center 4g it's not 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.410
 necessarily the game on which we use 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.640
 the most it was okay when we 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.900
 is obliged to go very often 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.070
 I think it can be a little bit 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.970
 complicated or even more eating 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.500
 little fingers so it's really not 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.970
 Ideally 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.049
 that's going to be what so that's it that's the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.400
 small flat but on the rest 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.840
 frankly I was well packed here 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.060
 especially since you have not had the opportunity to 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.310
 test one of the main features and 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.299
 here it is the new hardware the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.380
 power while it's a game that 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.150
 is planned on 3ds 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.320
 normal that's one thing we'll see 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.970
 probably with cups chronicles 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.829
 especially here I have not necessarily noted 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.180
 super visual improvements game 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.040
 3ds so here it is worn simply 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.780
 there is no improvement directly 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.920
 on the on the lamb 3ds must have 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.299
 especially cars exhibit the you have 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.769
 said there will undoubtedly be games to 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.820
 obviously games that will use 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.080
 better on the right we can see at this 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.280
 moment there if bassi 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.540
 really the leap forward at the level of 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.400
 the power is impressive any case 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.620
 it starts well even though a lot for 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.790
 your presentation my dear paul on 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.190
 still performs for new 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.030
 adventures on the tg be and again 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.080
 things to see 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.080
 it's incredible
