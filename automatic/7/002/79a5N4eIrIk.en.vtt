yeah I think there's there's something
to<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.610> gained<00:01:47.849> and<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.140> not<00:01:49.500> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to be gained and it's it's not it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
to be gained and it's it's not it
doesn't<00:01:50.909> doesn't<00:01:51.630> match<00:01:51.959> with<00:01:52.679> what<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
doesn't doesn't match with what the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.149 
doesn't doesn't match with what the
riders<00:01:53.220> feeling

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
riders feeling

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.889 
riders feeling
I've<00:01:56.159> seen<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.549> other<00:01:56.670> data<00:01:56.939> guys<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:57.599> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I've seen some other data guys and I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.139 
I've seen some other data guys and I
think<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.319> my<00:01:58.590> role<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.159> Matt<00:01:59.520> has<00:01:59.849> been<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
think that my role with Matt has been a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.230 
think that my role with Matt has been a
bit<00:02:00.390> different<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.560> maybe<00:02:01.860> data<00:02:02.670> people

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
bit different then maybe data people

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.469 
bit different then maybe data people
with<00:02:03.360> other<00:02:03.539> riders<00:02:04.049> okay<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.299> see<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> lot

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of other data people you know sort of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.449 
of other data people you know sort of
coaching<00:02:08.880> their<00:02:09.840> riders<00:02:10.079> and<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.280> one

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
coaching their riders and that was one

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.789 
coaching their riders and that was one
thing<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.700> Matt<00:02:12.030> never<00:02:12.329> needed<00:02:12.750> he<00:02:13.590> never

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
thing that Matt never needed he never

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.520 
thing that Matt never needed he never
needed<00:02:14.100> any<00:02:14.280> coaching<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.260> honest

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530

needed any coaching and I to be honest
with<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:16.799> never<00:02:16.920> felt<00:02:17.430> qualified<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.359> to<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
with you I never felt qualified to to to

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.020 
with you I never felt qualified to to to
attempt<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:21.350> even<00:02:22.350> with<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.769> you<00:02:23.160> know<00:02:23.280> with

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
attempt it even with what you know with

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.920 
attempt it even with what you know with
what<00:02:24.329> motorcycle<00:02:25.170> experience<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.709> did<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.930> he

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
what motorcycle experience I did have he

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.599 
what motorcycle experience I did have he
knew<00:02:28.109> how<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.290> ride<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.859> that<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.160> obvious

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
knew how to ride and that was obvious

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.210 
knew how to ride and that was obvious
and<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:32.299> never<00:02:33.299> spent<00:02:33.690> too<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.079> time

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
and so I never spent too much time

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.370 
and so I never spent too much time
critiquing<00:02:35.220> his<00:02:35.609> style<00:02:35.940> I'd<00:02:36.420> simply<00:02:36.780> try<00:02:37.200> and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
critiquing his style I'd simply try and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.500 
critiquing his style I'd simply try and
look<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.769> his<00:02:37.920> style<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.519> try<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.120> understand

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
look at his style and try and understand

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.780 
look at his style and try and understand
what<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.139> what<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:40.980> felt<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.370> or<00:02:41.670> what

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
what that what that felt like or what

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.150

what's the reason he can't be on the gas
or<00:02:49.380> why<00:02:49.709> does<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> throttle<00:02:50.430> go<00:02:50.579> flat<00:02:50.970> there

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
or why does the throttle go flat there

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.470 
or why does the throttle go flat there
he's<00:02:51.750> waiting<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.410> there's<00:02:52.889> some

when when he'd have a comment before you

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.140 
when when he'd have a comment before you
could<00:03:31.379> really<00:03:31.560> even<00:03:31.890> see<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.610> data<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
could really even see it in the data and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.180 
could really even see it in the data and
eventually<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.379> know<00:03:34.470> as<00:03:34.590> if<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.890> problem

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
eventually you know as if the problem

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.839 
eventually you know as if the problem
got<00:03:35.310> worse<00:03:35.540> you'd<00:03:36.540> eventually<00:03:36.750> see<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.379> right

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
got worse you'd eventually see it right

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.470 
got worse you'd eventually see it right
but<00:03:39.230> but<00:03:40.230> yeah<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.709> many<00:03:41.129> a<00:03:41.220> times<00:03:41.549> what<00:03:42.239> his

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
said easy I didn't have to go looking

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.690 
said easy I didn't have to go looking
for<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.140> knew<00:03:52.319> right<00:03:53.010> where<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.250> go<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:53.670> to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
for it I knew right where to go what to

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.819 
for it I knew right where to go what to
look<00:03:53.910> for<00:03:54.269> there's<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> reason<00:03:55.260> why<00:03:55.379> you<00:03:55.440> want

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
look for there's a reason why you want

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.380 
look for there's a reason why you want
to<00:03:55.920> spin<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.250> rear<00:03:56.430> wheel<00:03:56.609> sometimes<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.299> is

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
to spin the rear wheel sometimes that is

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.849 
to spin the rear wheel sometimes that is
to<00:03:57.510> get<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.660> bike<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.019> turn<00:03:58.260> better<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.739> the

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
to get the bike to turn better on the

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.940 
to get the bike to turn better on the
exit<00:04:00.349> sometimes<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.440> don't<00:04:01.530> want<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.799> rear

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
exit sometimes you don't want the rear

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.319 
exit sometimes you don't want the rear
wheel<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.129> spin<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:02.579> sometimes<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.120> need<00:04:03.269> it

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
wheel to spin but sometimes you need it

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.550 
wheel to spin but sometimes you need it
to<00:04:03.540> spend<00:04:03.810> if<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:03.959> can't<00:04:04.200> get<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.410> bike

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
to spend if you can't get the bike

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.930 
to spend if you can't get the bike
turned<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.069> need<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.370> get<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> little<00:04:05.730> bit<00:04:05.819> more

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
turned you need to get a little bit more

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.729 
turned you need to get a little bit more
throttle<00:04:06.329> into<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:06.720> get<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.930> spin<00:04:07.319> so

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
throttle into it and get it to spin so

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.770 
throttle into it and get it to spin so
you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.950> get<00:04:08.069> something<00:04:08.220> turned<00:04:08.549> off<00:04:08.780> or

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
you can get something turned off or

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.890 
you can get something turned off or
turned<00:04:10.409> you<00:04:10.799> know<00:04:10.829> on<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.280> exit<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.659> give

thing to adjust correctly and to have
adjusted<00:04:31.380> correctly<00:04:31.530> for<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.010> whole<00:04:32.190> race

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
adjusted correctly for the whole race

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.260 
adjusted correctly for the whole race
and<00:04:34.190> there's<00:04:35.190> certain<00:04:35.550> race<00:04:35.700> tricks<00:04:35.940> we<00:04:36.090> do

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
and there's certain race tricks we do

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.270 
and there's certain race tricks we do
too<00:04:36.330> now<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:37.110> we<00:04:37.349> essentially<00:04:37.710> turn<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.160> off

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
too now that we essentially turn it off

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.089 
too now that we essentially turn it off
because<00:04:38.639> we're<00:04:38.910> quicker<00:04:39.120> with<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.419> off<00:04:39.539> so<00:04:40.470> not

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
because we're quicker with it off so not

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.800 
because we're quicker with it off so not
that<00:04:41.250> anybody<00:04:41.729> had<00:04:41.880> probably<00:04:42.330> believed<00:04:42.660> that

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
that anybody had probably believed that

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.089 
that anybody had probably believed that
all<00:04:42.990> or<00:04:43.349> or<00:04:44.180> anybody<00:04:45.289> anybody<00:04:46.289> else<00:04:46.650> does<00:04:46.919> that

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
all or or anybody anybody else does that

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.170 
all or or anybody anybody else does that
now<00:04:47.220> because<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.669> hear<00:04:47.849> a<00:04:47.910> lot<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
now because I can hear a lot of the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.310 
now because I can hear a lot of the
bikes<00:04:48.360> out<00:04:48.539> there<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.750> how<00:04:48.810> much<00:04:48.960> tracks<00:04:49.229> you

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
bikes out there and how much tracks you

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.719 
bikes out there and how much tracks you
can<00:04:49.410> probably<00:04:49.620> use<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.039> sometimes<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.550> laugh

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
can probably use and sometimes I laugh

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.060 
can probably use and sometimes I laugh
thinking<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:52.110> guys<00:04:52.229> are<00:04:52.380> slowing<00:04:52.650> yourselves

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
thinking you guys are slowing yourselves

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.270 
thinking you guys are slowing yourselves
down<00:04:53.190> now<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.090> not<00:04:54.810> not<00:04:55.139> easy<00:04:55.410> not<00:04:55.800> easy<00:04:55.830> thing

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
down now so not not easy not easy thing

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.520 
down now so not not easy not easy thing
to<00:04:56.370> turn<00:04:56.580> yeah<00:04:57.150> it's<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.630> tough<00:04:57.810> thing<00:04:58.110> you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
to turn yeah it's a tough thing you

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.219 
to turn yeah it's a tough thing you
might<00:04:58.740> get<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.460> really<00:04:59.699> control<00:05:00.120> right<00:05:00.870> for

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
might get the really control right for

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.290 
might get the really control right for
for<00:05:01.530> one<00:05:01.710> section<00:05:02.039> but<00:05:02.550> then<00:05:02.669> have<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.849> bit<00:05:03.060> too

for one section but then have a bit too

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.879 
for one section but then have a bit too
much<00:05:03.449> in<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.720> other<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.110> when<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.560> get<00:05:04.740> it

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
the gap between closing the throttle and

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:25.089 
the gap between closing the throttle and
getting<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.680> brakes<00:05:21.500> at<00:05:23.360> 190<00:05:24.360> mile<00:05:24.510> an<00:05:24.630> hour
