00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.290 
the galaxy s5 versus the iPhone 5s now
I'm<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.190> doing<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.520> few<00:00:17.730> tests<00:00:18.119> here

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I'm going to be doing a few tests here

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.290 
I'm going to be doing a few tests here
CPU<00:00:19.020> performance<00:00:19.199> tests<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.010> also<00:00:20.189> other<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
CPU performance tests and also other a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.750 
CPU performance tests and also other a
test<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.960> terms<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.470> screen<00:00:22.859> performance<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
test in terms of screen performance and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.189 
test in terms of screen performance and
and<00:00:23.910> things<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:24.900> let's<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.140> ahead

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and things like that so let's go ahead

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.420 
and things like that so let's go ahead
and<00:00:25.320> begin<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.619> got<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> Geekbench

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and begin I got the Geekbench

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.820 
and begin I got the Geekbench
application<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.570> both<00:00:27.990> devices<00:00:28.529> which<00:00:28.680> would

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
application on both devices which would

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.160 
application on both devices which would
measure<00:00:29.010> CPU<00:00:29.670> performance<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.449> way<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:31.019> can

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
measure CPU performance that way you can

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.630 
measure CPU performance that way you can
determine<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:31.800> device<00:00:32.130> will<00:00:32.340> perform

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
determine which device will perform

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
determine which device will perform
faster<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.210> different<00:00:33.510> tasks<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.410> I'm<00:00:34.649> going

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
faster at different tasks so I'm going

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.200 
faster at different tasks so I'm going
to<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.040> ahead<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:35.940> into<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
to go ahead and here and go into the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.760 
to go ahead and here and go into the
multitasker<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.960> make<00:00:37.079> sure<00:00:37.230> nothing<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
multitasker to make sure nothing is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
multitasker to make sure nothing is
running<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> background<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> doesn't

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
running in the background so it doesn't

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.940 
running in the background so it doesn't
affect<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> tests<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
affect on the tests and here on the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
affect on the tests and here on the
iPhone<00:00:41.250> I'm<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> double<00:00:41.820> tap<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
iPhone I'm going to double tap on the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.700 
iPhone I'm going to double tap on the
home<00:00:42.270> button<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.960> confirm<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.350> there's<00:00:43.559> no

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
home button to confirm that there's no

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
home button to confirm that there's no
other<00:00:43.890> pages<00:00:44.160> open<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.719> I'm<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
other pages open as well so I'm going to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
other pages open as well so I'm going to
launch<00:00:46.110> both<00:00:46.379> applications<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> same

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
launch both applications at the same

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
launch both applications at the same
time<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:49.140> by<00:00:49.230> opening<00:00:49.500> applications<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
time and just by opening applications I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.590 
time and just by opening applications I
can<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.520> say<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> iPhone<00:00:51.090> kind<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> did<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
can just say the iPhone kind of did that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
can just say the iPhone kind of did that
a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.199> quicker<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.530> might<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> tapped

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
a little bit quicker I might have tapped

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.340 
a little bit quicker I might have tapped
it<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> iPhone<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.719> let's<00:00:55.230> go

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it first on the iPhone but let's go

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
it first on the iPhone but let's go
ahead<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> run<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> test<00:00:56.160> itself<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:56.820> gonna

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ahead and run the test itself I'm gonna

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
ahead and run the test itself I'm gonna
go<00:00:57.090> ahead<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.239> tap<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.690> both<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> same

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
go ahead and tap on both at the same

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.279 
go ahead and tap on both at the same
time<00:00:58.710> same<00:00:59.039> application<00:00:59.699> Geekbench<00:01:00.210> 3<00:01:00.329> no

and all that good stuff but it looks

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
and all that good stuff but it looks
like<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> iPhone<00:01:26.970> finished<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> process

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
like the iPhone finished the process

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.330 
like the iPhone finished the process
first<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:30.229> then<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.439> comes<00:01:31.619> Samsung<00:01:32.189> in

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
first and then there comes Samsung in

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.810 
first and then there comes Samsung in
with<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> galaxy<00:01:33.240> s5<00:01:33.509> coming<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.220> 963<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
with the galaxy s5 coming at 963 as you

can see on a single core the iPhone

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490 
can see on a single core the iPhone
really<00:01:37.920> outperformed<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.960> multiple

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
really outperformed it but in a multiple

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.560 
really outperformed it but in a multiple
core<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> iPhone<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.270> shy

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
core the iPhone just a little bit shy

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.999 
core the iPhone just a little bit shy
there<00:01:42.899> from<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> galaxy<00:01:43.920> s5<00:01:44.369> coming<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.119> 28

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
there from the galaxy s5 coming in at 28

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.480 
there from the galaxy s5 coming in at 28
73<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> iPhone<00:01:47.820> coming<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.360> 25<00:01:49.250> 63<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
73 and the iPhone coming in at 25 63 and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.760 
73 and the iPhone coming in at 25 63 and
again<00:01:51.090> I'll<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> application<00:01:52.500> link

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
again I'll have the application link

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.710 
again I'll have the application link
down<00:01:53.220> below<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> guys<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.450> ahead<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
down below so you guys can go ahead and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
down below so you guys can go ahead and
run<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:54.990> tests<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> looks<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.159> both

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
run these tests but it looks like both

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.450 
run these tests but it looks like both
devices<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.600> perform<00:01:58.079> good<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> guys<00:01:59.219> get

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
devices do perform good if you guys get

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
devices do perform good if you guys get

over<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.700> some<00:02:02.880> more<00:02:03.030> testing<00:02:03.450> oh<00:02:03.479> yeah<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
over to do some more testing oh yeah so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
over to do some more testing oh yeah so
for<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.020> next<00:02:04.259> test<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> pre-loaded<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:05.280> blog

for this next test I pre-loaded my blog

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.550 
for this next test I pre-loaded my blog
on<00:02:05.670> both<00:02:05.880> browsers<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:07.020> check<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.439> the

you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> Galaxy<00:02:10.619> s5<00:02:10.920> has<00:02:10.950> no

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you can see here the Galaxy s5 has no

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.370 
you can see here the Galaxy s5 has no

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
no hiccups just gross very very smoothly

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.290 
no hiccups just gross very very smoothly
and<00:02:16.140> very<00:02:16.170> rapidly<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> iPhone<00:02:18.030> 5s

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
and very rapidly here on the iPhone 5s

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
and very rapidly here on the iPhone 5s
we<00:02:18.660> also<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> nice<00:02:19.440> smooth<00:02:19.800> scrolling

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
we also have a nice smooth scrolling

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.340 
we also have a nice smooth scrolling
even<00:02:21.000> though<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> does<00:02:21.450> seem<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.170> bit

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
even though it does seem some a bit

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.320 
even though it does seem some a bit
slower<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:23.070> think<00:02:23.550> that's<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.060> way<00:02:24.180> how

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
slower I think that's just the way how

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.480 
slower I think that's just the way how
iOS<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.050> built<00:02:25.350> not<00:02:25.530> necessarily<00:02:26.190> means<00:02:26.400> that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
iOS is built not necessarily means that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.340 
iOS is built not necessarily means that
the<00:02:26.640> iPhone<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.060> doing<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.390> slower<00:02:27.630> but<00:02:28.170> it's

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the iPhone is doing it slower but it's

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.170 
the iPhone is doing it slower but it's
how<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> operating<00:02:28.980> system<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.460> built<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.940> in

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
how the operating system is built so in

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.030 
how the operating system is built so in
terms<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.750> scrolling<00:02:31.050> both<00:02:31.350> devices<00:02:31.620> did<00:02:31.920> it

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
terms of scrolling both devices did it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.160 
terms of scrolling both devices did it
very<00:02:32.220> smoothly<00:02:32.520> no<00:02:33.240> problem<00:02:33.720> now<00:02:33.840> let's<00:02:34.050> do<00:02:34.140> a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
very smoothly no problem now let's do a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.630 
very smoothly no problem now let's do a
little<00:02:34.410> bit<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.650> zoomin<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.340> out<00:02:35.430> motion

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
little bit of a zoomin in and out motion

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.370 
little bit of a zoomin in and out motion
that<00:02:35.970> once<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.300> do<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.660> pictures<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.200> things

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
that once you do for pictures and things

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.350 
that once you do for pictures and things
like<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.250> see<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.550> there's<00:02:38.730> any<00:02:38.910> hiccups

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
like that to see if there's any hiccups

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.880 
like that to see if there's any hiccups
or<00:02:39.510> glitches<00:02:39.780> within<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> operating<00:02:40.620> system

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
or glitches within the operating system

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.580 
or glitches within the operating system
and<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.430> looks<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.850> both<00:02:42.030> devices<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:43.440> do

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and it looks like both devices can do

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.160 
and it looks like both devices can do
that<00:02:43.740> pretty<00:02:44.040> easily<00:02:44.220> without<00:02:45.170> being

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that pretty easily without being

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.620 
that pretty easily without being
interrupted<00:02:46.470> they're<00:02:47.040> really<00:02:47.820> simple<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
interrupted they're really simple and I

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.940 
interrupted they're really simple and I
also<00:02:48.870> wanted<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.230> point<00:02:49.380> out<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> text<00:02:49.860> of

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
also wanted to point out the text of

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.160 
also wanted to point out the text of
course<00:02:50.220> looks<00:02:50.430> larger<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.540> galaxy<00:02:51.930> s5

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
course looks larger on the galaxy s5

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.590 
course looks larger on the galaxy s5
because<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.650> bigger<00:02:52.830> screen<00:02:53.360> here<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
because of the bigger screen here on the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.110 
because of the bigger screen here on the
iPhone<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.200> text<00:02:55.560> looks<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.430> little<00:02:56.880> bit

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
iPhone the text looks a little bit

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.480 
iPhone the text looks a little bit
crisper<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.840> would<00:02:58.140> say<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:58.680> brighter<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.460> the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
crisper I would say but brighter on the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.490 
crisper I would say but brighter on the
galaxy<00:03:00.210> I<00:03:00.360> mean<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.780> guys<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:01.140> be<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> judge

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
galaxy I mean you guys can be the judge

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.020 
galaxy I mean you guys can be the judge
of<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.710> also<00:03:02.130> leave<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> comment<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:02.790> below

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
of that also leave a comment down below

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.420 
of that also leave a comment down below
but<00:03:03.450> what'd<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.110> think<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.770> sharpness<00:03:05.130> of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
but what'd you think of the sharpness of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.910 
but what'd you think of the sharpness of
the<00:03:05.730> display<00:03:06.060> itself<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.500> terms<00:03:07.770> of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
the display itself but in terms of

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.380 
the display itself but in terms of
scrolling<00:03:08.220> pinching<00:03:08.790> zooming<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:09.300> out

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
scrolling pinching zooming in and out

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.330 
scrolling pinching zooming in and out
looks<00:03:09.630> like<00:03:09.750> both<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.960> Isis<00:03:10.320> performed<00:03:10.830> rather
