 gene world channel is not occurring 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.050
 a chemical attack ok this video is a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.849
 word you a little about some 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.549
 equipments for individual safety 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.549
 my respiratory pretension, let's go 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 guys, I'll show you some. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.250
 respiratory protection equipment and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 talk about their love 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 this first ep that we are seeing 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.960
 that the first protective mask 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.710
 Social 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.899
 it is a semifacial mask to be 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 impartial because it does not cover all 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.380
 face is a form only in the nostrils and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.690
 buccal region 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.989
 this mask here personal she has a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 metal tape here to be regulated here 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.570
 in the nose region and this mask here 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.899
 The staff is simple milk to the threshing floor. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 and that dust that this mask protects is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.360
 a dust fairly like the day to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.370
 day you want to use staff to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 dust from any 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.140
 do the cleaning that some equipment 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.150
 that you are paying attention to this mass 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.340
 here staff is not chemical 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.740
 this is not to paint it our here 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 simply protect against that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.729
 party dust but here the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 It 's very simple, she's more 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.259
 you were not there this rabbit mask 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.229
 that she is the first is simpler than 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.720
 we have a second brand that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.270
 shows here she also has a ribbon 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 here to regulate in the region of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 nose 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.329
 only you're picking up this brand this year 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.970
 you can see that her material 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.920
 it is already much thicker filter nelo has 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 another nerd that is made 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.899
 they get more shit already have two 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.560
 Stretchers here ok to be used here in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.020
 region 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 but above the head and one to be used 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 in the lower region and it is always 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.960
 filter it has a filter alone 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 here very simple 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 I know it'll be enough there for 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 Do you know how to breathe with more 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.180
 facility 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.960
 and this mask she plays protect from 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.030
 elements is it will protect you more is 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.069
 on dust and the elements that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.890
 you are working this but 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.290
 here staff for small periods 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.780
 Okay, little periods when you're going 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.150
 use a chemical that can be 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.100
 inhaled and released large amounts 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.170
 This one but for now will help you more. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.459
 although it is not yet the delay mask 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.140
 chemical product 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.570
 but it is also more geared towards 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.220
 big and dust I'm going to work in a silo 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.890
 goes from maintenance somewhere 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.959
 work with large will conclude 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.810
 You will wear this mask here and this 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.390
 mask it can already be prayed almost 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.600
 a daily period olé depends on there too 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.670
 logic of the amount you are going 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.980
 breathing and dust in one of 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.080
 characteristics of these two hands to the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.180
 people is that these brands are 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.430
 disposable arrived at the end of the day 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.220
 finished using these songs you go 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.230
 play in the trash and you can not use the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.299
 because it will speak and contaminate another 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.989
 thing that is individual but with each 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.390
 person uses your plus 39 throws you away 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.040
 wearing masks a person has already worn 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.019
 you can pick up some contamination 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.130
 Why is a person having an influenza A? 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.750
 horrible disease 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.730
 this is not suitable equipment 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.530
 individual protection 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.470
 because these two teams are the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.000
 simple masks and we have a 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.280
 mask that I showed at the beginning of 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.160
 video is a much more complete mask 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.920
 it has two side vents will 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.480
 facilitate your breathing, which in the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.940
 face in a cartridge 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.040
 chemist you have several types of 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.750
 cartridge team then depending on type 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.090
 of the product that you will be 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.940
 working, you will 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.220
 a different chemical cartridge has no 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.760
 to stay inside and this cartridge here 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.400
 he is of the crc class a tone is for gases 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.470
 acids organic plastic factors 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.120
 then it is important that the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.220
 person who will use this type of 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.379
 equipment or structures the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.599
 safety technician or at the time of 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.420
 buy the equipment she seeks 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.530
 information relevant to activities 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.660
 that it will affect 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.470
 so if you're going to work with tincture 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.180
 the whole day 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.950
 Do you have a different filter? 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.700
 work with those who have a movie 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.290
 different 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.900
 so these filters that is important 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.760
 you know about the correct filter 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.190
 for activities you are going to do 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.220
 using this filter also discarded 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.380
 he can last a long time, right? 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.450
 depending on the number of partners and 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.550
 on the line and then after a while they 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.820
 invoice when future movies you take one 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.310
 filter and exchange the filter and mask 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.229
 pasta but the staff is good the sheet 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.410
 then this part of the song can be 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.990
 because you can use it there. 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.130
 and other activities because only changing 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.160
 there the movie 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.860
 this person mask she is individual of the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.660
 meaning that only confessed zé o bes 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.940
 but she has jotted it down 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.580
 Rubber you can wash it 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.710
 Can you do that cleaning? 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.440
 another person can use after it is 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.970
 cleaning is not individual in the 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.190
 sense that it can only be used 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.229
 by one person at a time and in the future 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.660
 clean after you have made the 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.010
 hygiene of this mask, it can be 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.139
 used by someone else 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.660
 then it's a mask that it has a cost 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.030
 higher in compensation it will be 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.970
 used several times always doing 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.520
 hygiene and replacing the filter 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.229
 This is ours, we would still have another 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.180
 mask that I do not have here 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.729
 show you the mask take off 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.410
 He sent that mark that is 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.570
 totally partial it covers 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.180
 completely the face and not part of us 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.970
 carry equipment today by cylinder 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.710
 oxygen for this type of mask is 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.070
 used in 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.350
 where the air is an environment that you are is the 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.930
 gases that are in that environment they 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.060
 can not be breathed topical oxygen 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.040
 will be breathed through the cylinders 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.050
 that will fall on the back of the 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.450
 equipment itself used by the 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.760
 rescue personnel in situations that 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.340
 presence of toxic gases 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.710
 I do not have lethal gases here. 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.870
 here at the moment and show you more 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.080
 is the tip is personal equipment 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.460
 of spiritual protection for breathing 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.770
 so personal if you like this 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.750
 video likes comments and shares to 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.520
 that more people have access to the 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.310
 content of the electric world channel 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.080
 personal protection first 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.340
 safety first 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.290
 Let's not play with our safety. 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.720
 use of protective equipment 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.150
 that for us to help the 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.910
 their activities to normalize situations 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.980
 how would you rate it? 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.490
 Embrace you to go to the next video 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.490
 thanks guys
