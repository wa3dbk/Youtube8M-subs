info<00:03:52.160> I'm<00:03:52.490> wondering<00:03:52.820> about<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.210> because<00:03:53.480> I

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
info I'm wondering about this because I

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.070 
info I'm wondering about this because I
get<00:03:54.890> very<00:03:55.580> little<00:03:56.030> sodium<00:03:56.480> into<00:03:56.750> my<00:03:56.870> diet

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
get very little sodium into my diet

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.720 
get very little sodium into my diet
because<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.470> don't<00:03:57.650> eat<00:03:57.830> any<00:03:57.980> processed<00:03:58.190> foods

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
because I don't eat any processed foods

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.280 
because I don't eat any processed foods
and<00:03:59.090> that's<00:03:59.210> where<00:03:59.360> Americans<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.960> most<00:04:00.170> of

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
and that's where Americans get most of

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.840 
and that's where Americans get most of
the<00:04:00.380> sodium<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.860> processed<00:04:01.280> foods<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.640> salt

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
the sodium is processed foods and salt

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.300 
the sodium is processed foods and salt
well<00:04:02.510> I<00:04:02.540> don't<00:04:02.630> eat<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:02.950> from<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.040> research

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
well I don't eat that from the research

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.590 
well I don't eat that from the research
I've<00:04:04.520> done<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:04.820> lose<00:04:05.000> about<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.240> gram<00:04:05.570> of

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
I've done you lose about a gram of

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.290 
I've done you lose about a gram of
sodium<00:04:05.990> per<00:04:06.200> hour<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.550> in<00:04:07.670> an<00:04:07.760> hour<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.090> half

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
sodium per hour so in an hour and a half

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.480 
sodium per hour so in an hour and a half
event<00:04:08.600> like<00:04:08.780> today<00:04:09.080> I<00:04:09.350> lost<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:10.100> gram<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.459> a

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
event like today I lost a gram and a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.370 
event like today I lost a gram and a
half<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.760> sodium<00:04:11.120> now<00:04:11.690> I'd<00:04:11.840> have<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.140> eat<00:04:12.230> like

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
half of sodium now I'd have to eat like

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.590 
half of sodium now I'd have to eat like
40<00:04:12.800> pounds<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.340> celery<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:14.030> order<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.300> get<00:04:14.450> that

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
40 pounds of celery in order to get that

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.180 
40 pounds of celery in order to get that
gram<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> half<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.410> sodium<00:04:15.709> back<00:04:15.920> into<00:04:16.100> my

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
gram and a half a sodium back into my

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.920 
gram and a half a sodium back into my
system<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.180> there's<00:04:17.390> no<00:04:17.570> way<00:04:17.780> I'm

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
system so there's no way I'm

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.949 
system so there's no way I'm
replenishing<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.620> sodium<00:04:19.209> unless<00:04:20.209> as<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.600> raw

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
replenishing that sodium unless as a raw

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.800 
replenishing that sodium unless as a raw
foodist<00:04:21.380> I'm<00:04:22.010> perspiring<00:04:22.940> differently<00:04:23.600> and

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
foodist I'm perspiring differently and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.450 
foodist I'm perspiring differently and
that's<00:04:24.290> a<00:04:24.440> possibility<00:04:24.860> we'll<00:04:25.130> have<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.340> look

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
that's a possibility we'll have to look

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.460 
that's a possibility we'll have to look
into<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.700> because<00:04:26.210> there's<00:04:26.510> no<00:04:26.780> way<00:04:27.080> that

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
into that because there's no way that

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.870 
into that because there's no way that
I'm<00:04:27.620> getting<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.040> sodium<00:04:28.370> back<00:04:28.580> into<00:04:28.760> my

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
I'm getting that sodium back into my

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.970 
I'm getting that sodium back into my
system<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:30.140> let's<00:04:30.350> assume<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.650> I'm<00:04:30.860> not

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
system so let's assume that I'm not

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.500 
system so let's assume that I'm not
losing<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.430> because<00:04:31.580> if<00:04:31.790> I<00:04:31.880> was<00:04:32.030> losing<00:04:32.240> that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
losing it because if I was losing that

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.330 
losing it because if I was losing that
much<00:04:32.660> sodium<00:04:32.930> I'd<00:04:33.710> go<00:04:33.919> into<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.100> state<00:04:34.280> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
much sodium I'd go into a state of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.420 
much sodium I'd go into a state of
hyponatremia<00:04:34.960> which<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.080> basically<00:04:36.440> sodium

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
hyponatremia which is basically sodium

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.480 
hyponatremia which is basically sodium
dilution<00:04:38.150> too<00:04:38.390> little<00:04:38.720> sodium<00:04:38.990> in<00:04:39.350> your

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
dilution too little sodium in your

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.950 
dilution too little sodium in your
cellular<00:04:40.490> fluids<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.060> can<00:04:41.180> be<00:04:41.210> very<00:04:41.450> very

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
cellular fluids and it can be very very

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.920 
cellular fluids and it can be very very
serious<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.410> lead<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.650> death<00:04:43.510> an<00:04:44.510> enormous

I'll probably got two and a half to

last night and knew that it was a bad
choice<00:04:52.730> but<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.240> wanted<00:04:53.480> to<00:04:53.570> see<00:04:53.720> what<00:04:53.900> happened

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
little more flat running the knee seems

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.469 
little more flat running the knee seems
to<00:06:01.039> be<00:06:01.129> fine<00:06:01.339> by<00:06:01.519> the<00:06:01.580> way<00:06:01.669> so<00:06:01.819> very<00:06:02.179> good<00:06:02.330> news

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
to be fine by the way so very good news

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.320 
to be fine by the way so very good news
but<00:06:03.319> I'm<00:06:03.499> up<00:06:03.619> to<00:06:03.739> about<00:06:03.889> 25<00:06:04.399> miles<00:06:04.669> a<00:06:04.879> week<00:06:04.909> now

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
but I'm up to about 25 miles a week now

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.429 
but I'm up to about 25 miles a week now
and<00:06:05.360> I've<00:06:05.569> done<00:06:05.719> that<00:06:05.839> for<00:06:05.989> about<00:06:06.080> a<00:06:06.169> week<00:06:06.319> and

and I've done that for about a week and

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.559 
and I've done that for about a week and
a<00:06:06.529> half<00:06:06.559> at<00:06:07.099> that<00:06:07.309> mileage<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:08.029> that's<00:06:08.389> still

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
a half at that mileage and that's still

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.269 
a half at that mileage and that's still
minimal<00:06:08.989> mileage<00:06:09.529> when<00:06:09.679> it<00:06:09.769> comes<00:06:09.949> to<00:06:10.069> running

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279 
minimal mileage when it comes to running

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.549 
minimal mileage when it comes to running
you<00:06:11.059> know<00:06:11.179> I'm<00:06:11.509> probably<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.349> only<00:06:12.409> person
