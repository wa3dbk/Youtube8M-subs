 commenting and welcome one more day to 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.029
 your channel and what I bring you today is 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.000
 how to sell champions the book flames 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.009
 it is as you will see in the title and it is good 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.410
 a pretty innovative thing that they have 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.810
 removed or that they took out recently and that 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.510
 Many people do not know that there is a lot 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.039
 people do not know how to make it worth then 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.170
 it's very simple we just have to 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.870
 go to the store we will see this that 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.089
 is the main screen of the store 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.220
 with the new champion new skins 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.899
 etcetera and we have to go to the last 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.820
 tab of all I have it in English 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.379
 but hey you just because you 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.610
 you go to the last tab just change 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.280
 nothing 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.920
 you give him and here you have the champions that 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.120
 you have bought in the past I do not know 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.310
 if it's three months or a month or I think that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.600
 it will be like three months worth the champions 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.740
 that you have bought the last three 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.940
 these are mine 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.880
 kathy yoga work and apart even though you 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.710
 I sold now is to teach how they are in danger 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.900
 newspapers and bouquets these are the champions 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.210
 that I bought myself in the last three 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 months as you see him 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.619
 the last the first one that I bought those 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.229
 three months was the 25 of the 7 of 2012 vale 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.409
 then good but 23 months in this 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.380
 case are two months from seven to nine are 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.330
 two months I do not know exactly the distance 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.280
 but let 's just pulsÃ¡is here I 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 will give the option to sell worth then 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.420
 well this is pretty good because if 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.240
 there is a champion that you bought in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.710
 the last in the last two months and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.500
 that you did not like a lot did not 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.649
 molado well you can sell it worth 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.539
 but there are pegs that is not so wonderful 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.940
 as we could think not only 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.860
 You can sell three champions in life 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.720
 of your account vouchers of life if I now 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.210
 I have sold myself here to the pantheon 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.009
 I could only sell two more and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.009
 at the time that another two comes 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.539
 finished the bargain is good then yes 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.429
 what are you going to do if you are going to sell you have 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.350
 to sell with a head you have to be 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.300
 insurance of your sale be safe 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.360
 that this character is not going to be used 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.190
 The truth is that I'm getting bored and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.489
 I did not sell it because I wanted to buy 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.790
 to the new one and had like three thousand 900 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.620
 was some missing points 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.599
 so nothing sold pantheon and I 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.520
 I bought then it's worth just once 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.690
 that you have entered here you give 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.710
 to action 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.830
 and then we have to hit a riffo 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.630
 good it will be like returning object you will have 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.480
 you in Spanish I do not know how to 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.610
 translates the truth but basically 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.340
 is that you click on the action column and 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.350
 clickair as to confirm it not 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.480
 then once you confirm and 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.880
 will add the points and as I say only 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.280
 you can sell three champions in life 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.020
 of our account is worth so nothing 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.270
 good the truth a pretty tutorial 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.040
 simple but good you asked me some 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.110
 good you asked for it just me what 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.670
 you asked jce so I do not expect anything 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.460
 you have found it useful that if you do not 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.380
 you knew well then you know it so 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.390
 Nothing like and favorites if you have served and 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.390
