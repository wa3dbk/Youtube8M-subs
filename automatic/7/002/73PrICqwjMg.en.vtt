this is the East environment this is one
of<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.049> areas<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.440> was<00:01:41.710> affected<00:01:42.159> by<00:01:42.190> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
of the areas that was affected by the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.600 
of the areas that was affected by the
Asheville<00:01:42.909> so<00:01:43.630> we<00:01:43.780> actually<00:01:44.200> had<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.680> pump<00:01:45.430> the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
Asheville so we actually had to pump the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.660 
Asheville so we actually had to pump the
water<00:01:45.640> out<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.299> area<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:47.340> excavated<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
water out of this area and excavated the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.690 
water out of this area and excavated the
you<00:01:48.880> know<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.060> material<00:01:49.210> out<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.900> now<00:01:50.530> it's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you know the material out and now it's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.370 
you know the material out and now it's
restored<00:01:51.700> back<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.180> clean<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.080> baby<00:01:53.229> I

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
restored back to a clean and baby I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.290 
restored back to a clean and baby I
actually<00:01:54.159> had<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.520> lot<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.700> people<00:01:54.940> say<00:01:55.270> that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
actually had a lot of people say that

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.889 
actually had a lot of people say that
that<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.950> it's<00:01:57.490> better<00:01:57.790> than<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.060> was<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.600> it's

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
that it it's better than it was so it's

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.090 
that it it's better than it was so it's
a<00:01:58.990> good-looking<00:01:59.140> body<00:01:59.470> of<00:01:59.619> water

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.740 

but<00:02:04.100> still<00:02:04.430> there's<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.880> lot<00:02:05.180> of<00:02:05.210> ash<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.660> be

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
but still there's a lot of ash to be

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.930 
but still there's a lot of ash to be
collected<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.740> reconstruction<00:02:07.610> isn't

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
collected the reconstruction isn't

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.140 
collected the reconstruction isn't
expected<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:08.570> finished<00:02:08.720> until<00:02:09.369> 2014<00:02:10.369> so

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
expected to be finished until 2014 so

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.870 
expected to be finished until 2014 so
despite<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.810> 40<00:02:12.230> degree<00:02:12.530> heat<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.190> work<00:02:13.430> goes

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
despite the 40 degree heat the work goes

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.860 
despite the 40 degree heat the work goes
on<00:02:14.120> relentlessly<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:17.180> equipment<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.750> we're

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
on relentlessly the equipment that we're

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.200 
on relentlessly the equipment that we're
using<00:02:18.050> now<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.410> appropriate<00:02:19.100> for<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.430> tasks

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
using now is appropriate for the tasks
