his from the five so I guess it's a fair
trade<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:04.780> course<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.350> accessories<00:04:05.980> such

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
trade and of course the accessories such

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.580 
trade and of course the accessories such
as<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.760> plug

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
as the plug

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.140 
as the plug
and<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:10.730> charging<00:04:11.420> bit<00:04:12.140> for<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.849> which<00:04:13.849> looks

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
and the charging bit for it which looks

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.690 
and the charging bit for it which looks
similar<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.140> five<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.770> don't<00:04:16.250> know<00:04:16.430> if<00:04:16.609> it

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
similar to the five I don't know if it

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.789 
similar to the five I don't know if it
will<00:04:16.820> fit<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.090> five<00:04:17.359> or<00:04:17.540> not<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.590> does

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
will fit the five or not but it does

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.430 
will fit the five or not but it does
look<00:04:18.829> very<00:04:19.040> similar<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.930> say<00:04:21.139> that<00:04:21.169> because

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
look very similar and I say that because

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.590 
look very similar and I say that because
my<00:04:21.859> husband<00:04:22.160> has<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.340> five<00:04:22.610> so<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:23.060> know<00:04:23.180> what<00:04:23.510> it

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
check also I love the fact that is a

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.469 
check also I love the fact that is a
larger<00:05:03.290> screen<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.070> is<00:05:04.190> still<00:05:04.490> small<00:05:05.000> in<00:05:05.240> size

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
larger screen but is still small in size

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.560 
larger screen but is still small in size
so<00:05:05.960> it's<00:05:06.320> still<00:05:07.160> very<00:05:07.310> thin<00:05:07.729> but<00:05:08.690> it's<00:05:09.700> not<00:05:10.700> you

know bulky because my other one in
comparison<00:05:14.479> is<00:05:14.780> pretty<00:05:15.560> bulky<00:05:16.030> it's<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.210> not

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
comparison is pretty bulky it's just not

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.150 
comparison is pretty bulky it's just not
as<00:05:17.510> large<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:18.229> can<00:05:18.289> still<00:05:18.590> fit<00:05:18.740> into<00:05:18.830> my<00:05:18.979> back

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.070 
pocket and that still be cool another
thing<00:05:21.440> I<00:05:21.800> like<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:23.479> fact<00:05:23.510> that<00:05:23.780> it<00:05:23.870> has

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
thing I like is the fact that it has

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.230 
thing I like is the fact that it has
gold<00:05:24.350> on<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.710> bag<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:25.100> just<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.580> wanted<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.120> new

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
gold on the bag I just I wanted a new

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.020 
gold on the bag I just I wanted a new
phone<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:26.479> I<00:05:26.780> needed<00:05:27.080> something<00:05:27.260> new<00:05:27.530> and

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
phone and I needed something new and

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.090 
phone and I needed something new and
Apple<00:05:29.030> was<00:05:29.570> it<00:05:29.870> was<00:05:30.020> just<00:05:30.169> too<00:05:30.380> easy<00:05:30.620> for<00:05:30.800> me<00:05:31.070> to

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
Apple was it was just too easy for me to

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.120 
Apple was it was just too easy for me to
go<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.490> route<00:05:31.669> because<00:05:32.390> all<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.140> my<00:05:33.860> other

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
go that route because all of my other

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.190 
go that route because all of my other
products<00:05:34.610> are<00:05:34.729> Apple<00:05:35.150> products<00:05:35.660> so<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.930> just

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
products are Apple products so it just

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.320 
products are Apple products so it just
made<00:05:36.500> sense<00:05:36.530> to<00:05:37.310> keep<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:37.820> in<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.060> family

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
made sense to keep it in the family

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.409 
made sense to keep it in the family
before<00:05:39.289> had<00:05:39.560> you<00:05:40.070> asked<00:05:40.220> me<00:05:40.490> maybe<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.120> would
