00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and I always thought it was funny when I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.220 
and I always thought it was funny when I
was<00:00:31.679> teaching<00:00:31.830> full<00:00:32.160> time<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.480> club<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
was teaching full time at a club that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.330 
was teaching full time at a club that
had<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.850> dozen<00:00:35.850> teams<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.750> doubles<00:00:37.079> players<00:00:37.340> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
had a dozen teams of doubles players and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100 
had a dozen teams of doubles players and
inevitably<00:00:39.149> everybody<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:40.020> be

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
inevitably everybody would be

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
inevitably everybody would be
complaining<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> lob<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.640> yet<00:00:42.180> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
complaining about the lob and yet I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.000 
complaining about the lob and yet I
never<00:00:42.329> saw<00:00:42.690> anybody<00:00:42.870> practicing<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> lob

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
never saw anybody practicing the lob

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.880 
never saw anybody practicing the lob
which<00:00:44.879> always<00:00:45.180> struck<00:00:45.690> me<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:46.020> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> funny

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
which always struck me as kind of funny

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700 
which always struck me as kind of funny
so<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> shot<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.760> should<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.710> treating

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
possible to hit a great shot that way

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
possible to hit a great shot that way
but<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> comes<00:01:49.680> off<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> topspin

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

lob<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.869> again<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.189> good<00:01:53.579> but

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
lob and that again can be very good but

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
lob and that again can be very good but
it's<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.350> much<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.829> difficult<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it's going to be much more difficult to

the air second most common mistake I see

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.700 
the air second most common mistake I see
is<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.940> players<00:02:31.210> will<00:02:31.390> run<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.750> ball<00:02:32.020> hit

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
is that players will run to the ball hit

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.530 
is that players will run to the ball hit
it<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:32.920> an<00:02:33.040> open<00:02:33.130> face<00:02:33.490> but<00:02:34.240> they<00:02:34.360> have<00:02:34.510> a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
it with an open face but they have a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.490 
it with an open face but they have a
very<00:02:35.050> kind<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.470> short<00:02:35.800> abrupt<00:02:36.280> choppy<00:02:36.700> hit

very kind of short abrupt choppy hit

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.820 
very kind of short abrupt choppy hit
that<00:02:38.500> kind<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.740> looks<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.250> they'll<00:02:39.970> run

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that kind of looks like this they'll run

that kind of looks like this they'll run
get<00:02:41.830> there<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.280> then<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:42.790> kind<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.270> like

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
get there and then just kind of like

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.440 
get there and then just kind of like
jolt<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.280> ball<00:02:45.460> up<00:02:45.670> into<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.970> air<00:02:46.090> and

there's no feel there's no touch a lob

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.200 
there's no feel there's no touch a lob
is<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> touch<00:02:50.620> shot<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.460> want<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> think<00:02:52.060> of

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
is a touch shot I want you to think of

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.660 
is a touch shot I want you to think of
this<00:02:52.330> as<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.720> delicate<00:02:53.500> drop<00:02:53.830> shot<00:02:54.160> where

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
this as like a delicate drop shot where

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.010 
this as like a delicate drop shot where
you're<00:02:54.790> trying<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.240> get<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.990> right

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
you're trying to get just the right

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.290 
you're trying to get just the right
amount<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.560> touch<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.130> feel<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:58.000> hit<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
amount of touch and feel to hit the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.930 
amount of touch and feel to hit the
depth<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.840> want<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.560> lob<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.460> very<00:03:00.700> very

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
depth that you want a lob is very very

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.930 
depth that you want a lob is very very
similar<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:03.160> can<00:03:03.340> be<00:03:03.430> difficult<00:03:03.640> when

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
similar so this can be difficult when

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.270 
similar so this can be difficult when
you're<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.360> run<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:05.170> as<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.920> get<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.190> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
you're on the run but as you get to the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.720 
you're on the run but as you get to the
ball<00:03:06.490> you<00:03:07.300> should<00:03:07.570> be<00:03:07.690> smoothly<00:03:08.610> guiding<00:03:09.610> the
