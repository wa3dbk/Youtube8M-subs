 Hello everyone, today I am going to teach you 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:08.870

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.260

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.730

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.250
 we have to do is enter the link 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.890
 to leave in the description and missing in 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.320
 the advertising that comes out and then you 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.020
 will bring to this what we have to do 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.910
 here is to give you download you give and 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.070
 then I would know advertising raise 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.850
 and here it will come out until we would have to 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.949
 appear the download you expect and when 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.949
 has run or jump to the folder 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.540
 ok puts ps3 we go inside 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.710
 date we enter and this file ps3 that 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:52.020
 point we have to pass it to our 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.590
 pendrive is worth what we copy control c 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.540
 we go to the pendrive this one that has to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.370
 be formatted alpha 32 if you do not know 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.370
 assign right click 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.700
 load this 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.700
 format 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.110
 and now towards initial 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.330
 and it is already 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.820
 that's the only thing we have to do 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.900
 here flash 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.900
 then we paste the file 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.010
 ok is avatar a little bit why 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.150
 more or less heavy is not a 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.240
 update of the play 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.750
 and we hope here what we lack 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.000
 There are also other other custom firmware 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.869
 that maybe they can interest that they are 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.549
 javi for example if you are more interested in that 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.729
 that this one can put if the comments 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.729
 to make a video to download the other 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.280
 or if not by private if you already know how to 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.510
 install then ask me for the link and it's 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.540
 they passed it 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.869
 It will take 10 seconds and we will go 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.869
 wait 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.349
 so this is what we are going to do 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.060
 now it's going to the console we take the 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.060
 pendrive and so far 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.490
 hello again we are already in the next 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.360
 part of how to install the custom 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.530
 firmware 4.46 for the console and 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:48.110
 good now what he touches is the pendrive 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.110
 install it first we put it in the play 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.170
 You have more dust than my fucking mother you're 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:03.490
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.110
 to update the system here and 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.710
 inside we're going to give it to you through a 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.710
 storage support 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.120
 and well once this is done, you will see that 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.790
 we have 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.819
 I'm not going to do the folder because 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.260
 I have the hub and I do not and you'll see that 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.510
 they have rock muscle and it will not be 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.880
 update we give it that way and then it 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.460
 we start to update everything 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.270
 it will take a year for a few minutes and then 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.980
 since everything normally and well I hope 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.330

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.330
