00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.470
 that also players here my organic of 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.550
 game player tv brings you a review of 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.740
 nintendo two 10 this new device that 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.990
 comes to revolutionize a little what they are 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.380
 the portable devices that in 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.000
 First, it is not as portable as 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.220
 we would like because in the end 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.830
 the way they just generated a 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.800
 bit stubborn inside what's coming 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.379
 along with this console is a card 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.080
 lexar good the lexar harvest of 4 gigabytes 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.160
 of memory to be able to store either 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.530
 a game data data of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.400
 photographs music all that information 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.030
 and the truth is so super simple 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.979
 place to place in the apparatus also 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.530
 they include what is a charger on 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.520
 charger is very similar to what is the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 train 10 then yes you already had one 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.830
 you will not have problems taking this 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.990
 as a spare you also come these 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.119
 letters that are letters of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.189
 the augmented reality that are very 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.290
 sympathetic comes an application so that 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.720
 I use them I recommend them they are very 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.730
 the truth is very interesting 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.690
 obviously the manual 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.750
 that all nintendo devices 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.420
 they come with it is not a pretty extensive one 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.190
 and it 's worth taking a look at it for 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.250
 know how to correctly use the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.540
 console this is a general image of 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 we can see the botonerÃ­a is very very the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.260
 design is very nice something that you have to 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.600
 take into account is that they only introduced 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.570
 one single speaker 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.460
 instead of both that decreases a 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.070
 little the audio power that is 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.869
 exporting to the user not but a 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.290
 once you use headphones there would not be 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.840
 no problem for this kind of taste 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.950
 the playability or the ergonomics of the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.260
 device itself is good if you're not 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.460
 used to what it is to use this 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.370
 type of appliance for a long time 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.650
 you're really going to have some discomfort 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.650
 in the right thumb because 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.060
 you have to throw the dolls more towards 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.739
 below as you can see the video I 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.590
 I have a little more up the wrist 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.629
 therefore I make a 90 degree angle 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.930
 in my thumb that in the long run we are 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.030
 talking about a game of lengthen a 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.250
 One or two hours may already start to 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.870
 a little tired but in what 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.459
 general are very well located 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.439
 buttons my hands are this relatively 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.090
 girls between girls and mediums are not 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.579
 very large humans then in the end 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.159
 of accounts are very well suited to the 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.560
 ergonomics there would be no problem the 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.000
 index fingers reach perfectly what 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.450
 which are the bombers on the top 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.940
 and how can you see the game is 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.459
 unfolds totally well in this new 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.549
 screen that are using the games 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.590
 of nintendo 10 between 10 the two are 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.439
 compatible with this console obviously 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.109
 the only function disabled or in the 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.730
 which did clipping is the tri of the 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.920
 console still has its two 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.689
 so much good later cameras would be 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.879
 three subsequent nodes and one to which 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.990
 I was looking towards the face of the 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.230
 user 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.990
 and it works very similar in fact the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.240
 software that brings the device is 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.280
 exactly equal to that of tuti 10 and 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.560
 we have a side shot in which 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360
 we can see the volume control 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.520
 this is the air that the bumpers produce 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.370
 two levers on the bottom 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.080
 we have what is the 3.5 jack also 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.210
 we have in the air the slip for 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.580
 block it and send it to sleep get 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.890
 quick access and we have the slot for 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.070
 cartridges we have the slot for what it is 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.440
 the input of the current connector and 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.710
 the dimensions are very interesting in 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.190
 this one on this console is slightly more 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.410
 boy that a 3 and is totally open 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.120
 obviously it's not as portable as the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.549
 tri 10 because at the end of accounts then 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.880
 this console is like this one is 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.080
 not open but for that nintendo 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.810
 start to show this solution that is 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.140
 the nintendo bag that with that already 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.610
 protect the screen not completely 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.040
 widely recommended and it has to be 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.480
 I have here we can see the 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.460
 dimensions of the screens both 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.710
 superior as inferior what curious fact 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.480
 it's a single complete screen 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.950
 just that in the bottom part the 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.840
 screen below is the only one that has 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:52.840
 this is the tactile resistance system 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.720
 in which we can already see how it 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.400
 they play or how the section is manipulated 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.110
 from below but it's actually the same 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.840
 screen down and fixes only the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.030
 functionality is therefore visible or 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.370
 applicable in the bottom part and we have 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.010
 an additional seizure of the counter 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.710
 construction is a little bit not very 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.180
 robust as the tri 10 must have 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.290
 many positions and this is going to buy 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.210
 to a child that maybe a 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.540
 bit disastrous so to speak 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.910
 because if it is a bit fragile and therefore 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.600
 basically those would be my necessary the 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.850
 review I could could give you an 8 of 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.900
 10 to this device because the truth 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.270
 complies with everything they promised and are 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.310
 minimum the things that could this one of 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.540
 ponder this for those who organize it 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.820
 dismiss I hope you liked it and 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.830
 remember subscribe denle like share 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.830
 and remember, do not stop playing
