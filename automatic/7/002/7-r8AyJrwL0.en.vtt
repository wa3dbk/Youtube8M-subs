00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510

trying to say is if you just trust the
scale<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.990> assume<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.040> play

scale if you assume that you can play
any<00:02:19.670> note<00:02:19.940> because<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.330> scale<00:02:20.570> said<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.930> would

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
any note because the scale said it would

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.670 
any note because the scale said it would
be<00:02:21.110> okay

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
be okay

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.950 
be okay

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
you might find yourself committing an

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.080 
you might find yourself committing an

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
atrocity similar to the one that I just

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.750 
atrocity similar to the one that I just
played<00:02:26.300> for<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.010> all<00:02:28.220> about<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.460> guess

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
the smart thing is to say well I'll keep

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.479 
the smart thing is to say well I'll keep
this<00:03:22.340> bluesy<00:03:23.269> core<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.799> will<00:03:24.980> look<00:03:25.130> at<00:03:25.340> the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
this bluesy core and I will look at the

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.520 
this bluesy core and I will look at the
notes<00:03:25.730> from<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.330> mode<00:03:26.570> which<00:03:26.780> arms<00:03:27.260> already

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
notes from this mode which arms already

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.070 
notes from this mode which arms already
in<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.190> blue<00:03:28.370> scale<00:03:28.670> because<00:03:29.570> those<00:03:29.840> are<00:03:30.019> the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
in the blue scale because those are the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.470 
in the blue scale because those are the
special<00:03:30.350> modal<00:03:30.860> notes<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.940> means<00:03:32.150> you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
special modal notes so that means you

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.090 
special modal notes so that means you
can<00:03:32.660> take<00:03:35.049> your<00:03:36.049> blue<00:03:36.230> stuff<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:36.799> maybe<00:03:36.890> if

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
can take your blue stuff but maybe if

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.770 
can take your blue stuff but maybe if
