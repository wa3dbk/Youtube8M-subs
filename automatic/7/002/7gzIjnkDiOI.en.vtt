00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
blade was long enough that I felt that
I'll<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:05.810> Sherman<00:01:06.810> focus<00:01:07.350> here

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560

thought<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.340> was<00:02:29.519> going<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:32.480> assisted

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
thought it was going to be the assisted

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.199 
thought it was going to be the assisted
opening<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.489> amazing<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.609> can<00:02:35.700> hear<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.000> big

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
opening is amazing you can hear that big

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.149 
opening is amazing you can hear that big
thud<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:38.250> logs<00:02:38.519> up<00:02:38.760> tight<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:40.769> what<00:02:41.010> am<00:02:41.099> i

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
thud the logs up tight so what am i

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.720 
thud the logs up tight so what am i
comparing<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.810> mean<00:02:43.079> it's

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
comparing that to really I mean it's

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.569 
comparing that to really I mean it's
basically<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.030> sog<00:02:45.599> knives<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.400> what<00:02:47.400> am<00:02:47.489> I

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
basically the sog knives is what am I

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.699 
basically the sog knives is what am I
compared<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> some<00:02:48.659> of<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.780> Kershaw<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.590> have

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
compared to some of the Kershaw I have

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.110 
compared to some of the Kershaw I have
suddenly<00:02:49.950> some<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> smaller<00:02:50.670> Kershaw

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
suddenly some of the smaller Kershaw

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.930 
suddenly some of the smaller Kershaw
smaller<00:02:51.510> ones<00:02:51.840> little<00:02:52.200> leak<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.829> example<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
smaller ones little leak for example and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.849 
smaller ones little leak for example and
this<00:02:54.329> thing<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.829> looks<00:02:55.829> out<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.700> fast<00:02:56.939> and

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
this thing just looks out so fast and

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.539 
this thing just looks out so fast and
hard<00:02:59.329> it's<00:03:00.329> not<00:03:00.540> moving<00:03:00.750> at<00:03:00.959> all<00:03:01.109> I<00:03:01.470> guess<00:03:02.370> it's

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
hard it's not moving at all I guess it's

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.280 
hard it's not moving at all I guess it's
a<00:03:02.639> spear<00:03:02.970> point<00:03:03.269> blade<00:03:04.109> here<00:03:06.019> dessel<00:03:07.019> geez<00:03:07.260> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
a spear point blade here dessel geez I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.129 
a spear point blade here dessel geez I
mean<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:07.799> they<00:03:08.099> do<00:03:08.159> flicked<00:03:08.549> out<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
mean just they do flicked out just the

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.649 
mean just they do flicked out just the
relative<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:10.950> just<00:03:11.700> how<00:03:11.819> firm<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.450> locks

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
relative to this just how firm it locks

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.770 
relative to this just how firm it locks
up<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.349> just<00:03:13.950> different<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.879> gotta<00:03:15.060> you

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
up is just just different you gotta you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.759 
up is just just different you gotta you
gotta<00:03:15.989> play<00:03:16.440> with<00:03:16.709> two<00:03:16.829> of<00:03:16.980> them<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.560> that's

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
gotta play with two of them so that's

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.640 
gotta play with two of them so that's
the<00:03:19.949> quick<00:03:20.160> summary<00:03:20.750> putting<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.870> higher<00:03:22.349> my

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the quick summary putting this higher my

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.470 
the quick summary putting this higher my
scale<00:03:22.949> i<00:03:22.980> think<00:03:23.310> i<00:03:23.370> gave<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.760> minibar<00:03:24.359> ajah

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
scale i think i gave the minibar ajah

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.349 
scale i think i gave the minibar ajah
and<00:03:24.989> eight<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:26.099> would<00:03:26.340> probably<00:03:26.519> say<00:03:26.730> yeah<00:03:27.150> this

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
and eight I would probably say yeah this

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.330 
and eight I would probably say yeah this
is<00:03:27.599> probably<00:03:27.810> an<00:03:28.139> eight<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.739> well<00:03:28.919> if<00:03:29.129> not<00:03:29.159> a

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
is probably an eight as well if not a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.300 
is probably an eight as well if not a
nine<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.840> bollocks<00:03:31.230> at<00:03:31.739> least<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.190> this

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
nine the bollocks at least in this

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.460 
nine the bollocks at least in this
version<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.030> I'm<00:03:33.629> really<00:03:33.810> big<00:03:34.019> on<00:03:34.109> using<00:03:34.409> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
version and I'm really big on using the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.849 
version and I'm really big on using the
word<00:03:34.590> perception<00:03:35.419> it<00:03:36.419> I'm<00:03:37.079> perceiving<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.739> to

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
word perception it I'm perceiving it to

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.050 
word perception it I'm perceiving it to
be<00:03:38.010> maybe<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.549> little<00:03:38.609> bit<00:03:38.940> better

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
be maybe a little bit better

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.589 
be maybe a little bit better
manufactured<00:03:39.870> than<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.409> 585<00:03:41.099> it<00:03:41.669> but<00:03:41.970> you

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
manufactured than the 585 it but you

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.030 
manufactured than the 585 it but you
know<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.720> think<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:43.049> just<00:03:43.169> has<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.680> do<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:43.889> it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
know I think it just has to do with it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.349 
know I think it just has to do with it
being<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.340> bigger<00:03:44.549> handle<00:03:45.829> so<00:03:46.849> pretty<00:03:47.849> cool<00:03:48.090> i

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
being a bigger handle so pretty cool i

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.939 
being a bigger handle so pretty cool i
like<00:03:48.659> it<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.139> it's<00:03:49.769> pretty<00:03:50.129> sharp<00:03:50.430> it's<00:03:51.150> not

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
like it it's it's pretty sharp it's not

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.550 
like it it's it's pretty sharp it's not
not<00:03:52.949> razor-sharp<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.970> does<00:03:54.629> its<00:03:54.810> job<00:03:55.079> I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
not razor-sharp it does its job I

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.689 
not razor-sharp it does its job I
certainly<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.699> more<00:03:57.359> sharp<00:03:57.690> knives<00:03:57.900> but

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
certainly have more sharp knives but

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.129 
certainly have more sharp knives but
it's<00:03:59.699> pretty<00:03:59.909> good<00:04:00.120> utility<00:04:00.569> knife<00:04:00.930> I

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
it's pretty good utility knife I

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.930 
it's pretty good utility knife I
wouldn't<00:04:01.379> call<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.739> necessarily<00:04:02.489> an<00:04:02.579> EDC

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
wouldn't call this necessarily an EDC

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.659 
wouldn't call this necessarily an EDC
knife<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:04.739> big<00:04:06.739> it's<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.889> little<00:04:08.099> tactical

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
knife it's big it's a little tactical

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.360 
knife it's big it's a little tactical
looking

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
looking

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.180 
looking
since<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.239> blackness<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:12.190> blades

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
since the blackness the blades

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.659 
since the blackness the blades
relatively<00:04:13.819> aggressive<00:04:14.390> but<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:16.430> know<00:04:16.519> it's

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
relatively aggressive but you know it's

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.810 
relatively aggressive but you know it's
a<00:04:16.760> good<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.239> just<00:04:17.540> weekend<00:04:18.220> warrior<00:04:19.220> around<00:04:19.669> the

stuff<00:04:23.270> if<00:04:24.080> needed<00:04:24.530> but<00:04:25.720> not<00:04:26.720> bad<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.350> guess

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
stuff if needed but not bad and I guess

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.030 
stuff if needed but not bad and I guess
real<00:04:27.710> quickly<00:04:27.949> but<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.460> won't<00:04:28.669> work<00:04:28.940> on<00:04:29.150> that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
real quickly but I won't work on that

real quickly but I won't work on that
focusing<00:04:31.040> here<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:33.110> skeletonizing<00:04:33.680> that

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
focusing here it is skeletonizing that

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.840 
focusing here it is skeletonizing that
you<00:04:33.979> probably<00:04:34.130> can't<00:04:34.370> see<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.669> at<00:04:34.790> all<00:04:35.380> but

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
you probably can't see that at all but

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.629 
you probably can't see that at all but
surprise<00:04:37.900> on<00:04:38.900> this<00:04:39.290> knife<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.740> is<00:04:39.889> pretty

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
surprise on this knife it is pretty

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.070 
surprise on this knife it is pretty
freaking<00:04:41.210> good<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.820> one<00:04:44.120> thing<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.360> do<00:04:44.630> want<00:04:44.810> to

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
freaking good so one thing I do want to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.010 
freaking good so one thing I do want to
go<00:04:45.169> over<00:04:45.380> again<00:04:45.560> on<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:45.830> knife<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.400> that

go over again on this knife is that
since<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.280> opening<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.550> locks<00:04:49.789> up<00:04:49.970> so

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
since the opening that locks up so

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
see i am doing that here but it's just

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.100 
see i am doing that here but it's just
ready<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.400> fly<00:05:22.610> out<00:05:22.729> on<00:05:22.760> my<00:05:22.910> hand<00:05:23.120> it's<00:05:23.330> real

hard to do the pressure you need to put
on<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.539> blade<00:05:26.840> to<00:05:27.260> force<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.680> down<00:05:27.710> is<00:05:28.039> high

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
on the blade to force it down is high

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.180 
on the blade to force it down is high
it's<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.900> little<00:05:30.139> dangerous<00:05:30.289> my<00:05:30.710> fingers<00:05:31.070> are

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
it's a little dangerous my fingers are

it's a little dangerous my fingers are
exposed<00:05:31.660> you<00:05:32.660> know<00:05:32.780> I've<00:05:33.110> dropped<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.530> knife

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
exposed you know I've dropped the knife

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.020 
exposed you know I've dropped the knife
several<00:05:34.099> times<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:36.050> if<00:05:36.530> you're<00:05:37.220> if<00:05:37.610> that's<00:05:37.880> a

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
several times so if you're if that's a

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.180 
several times so if you're if that's a
feature<00:05:38.330> that<00:05:38.539> you<00:05:38.930> value<00:05:39.199> being<00:05:39.919> able<00:05:40.099> to

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
feature that you value being able to

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.010 
feature that you value being able to
close<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.760> fast<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:41.389> quickly<00:05:41.720> with<00:05:42.590> one<00:05:44.020> maybe

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
close it fast and quickly with one maybe

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.490 
close it fast and quickly with one maybe
think<00:05:45.289> twice<00:05:45.320> about<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:46.580> benchmade<00:05:47.500> assisted

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
think twice about the benchmade assisted

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.270 
think twice about the benchmade assisted

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
much for it all really for the abilities

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.950 
much for it all really for the abilities
around<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.940> one-handed<00:06:02.710> closing<00:06:04.090> but<00:06:05.090> man

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
around the one-handed closing but man
