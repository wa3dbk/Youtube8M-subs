00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.480 

we're<00:00:26.240> trying<00:00:26.780> to<00:00:26.870> come<00:00:27.110> up<00:00:27.170> with<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.830> record

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
we're trying to come up with and record

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
we're trying to come up with and record
a<00:00:28.880> song<00:00:29.330> in<00:00:30.050> basically<00:00:30.920> two<00:00:31.160> days<00:00:31.390> against<00:00:32.390> my

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
a song in basically two days against my

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.479 
a song in basically two days against my
better<00:00:32.689> judgment<00:00:33.140> probably<00:00:33.470> because<00:00:33.860> I<00:00:34.130> like

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
better judgment probably because I like

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.210 
better judgment probably because I like
to<00:00:34.700> sit<00:00:35.330> and<00:00:35.510> tweet<00:00:35.840> with<00:00:35.989> things<00:00:36.200> for<00:00:36.590> days<00:00:36.980> on

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
to sit and tweet with things for days on

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.420 
to sit and tweet with things for days on
end<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.060> yet<00:00:38.870> we're<00:00:39.050> trying<00:00:39.080> to<00:00:39.380> capture<00:00:39.710> the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
end and yet we're trying to capture the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.660 
end and yet we're trying to capture the
whole<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:40.640> guess<00:00:40.930> progress<00:00:41.930> of<00:00:42.520> making<00:00:43.520> that

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
whole I guess progress of making that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.910 
whole I guess progress of making that
and<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.210> end<00:00:44.330> result<00:00:44.690> which<00:00:45.170> probably<00:00:45.590> looks

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and the end result which probably looks

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.040 
and the end result which probably looks
pretty<00:00:46.010> embarrassing<00:00:46.760> for<00:00:46.790> me<00:00:52.750> yeah

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050
