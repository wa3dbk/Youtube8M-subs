00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 radiation is part of our life 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.089
 everyday 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.030
 for example sunlight possesses different 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.800
 types of radiation however there are 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 types of radiation that do not produce 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.619
 no harm to our body and others that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.500
 if radiation effects of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.189
 according to the definition is simply 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.949
 emission issue that can be 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.250
 particles or can be waves 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.310
 electromagnetic any food 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.790
 as it is produced mostly 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.310
 through growth and plant the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.640
 plants take from the soil various 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.430
 elements but without the floor and radio 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.980
 they continue we only find the year continue 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.330
 there is only thorium the foods are going to 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.940
 take those elements or those nuclei go 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.320
 to appear in its fruits or for example 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.470
 in the case that it is a plantation of 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.160
 grass to feed cows and cows 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.350
 they're going to take those beliefs already and they 're going 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.770
 to appear both in the flesh and 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.899
 milk 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.950
 the effects on health are already known 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.610
 when 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.189
 these nuclei are ingested in large 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.030
 quantities the effects are unknown 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.399
 for very, very low amounts in 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.170
 costa rica the research center in 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.789
 nuclear atomic sciences and 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.670
 Molecules of the University of Costa 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.530
 rich known as music does not possess a 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.909
 laboratory with the ability to evaluate 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.880
 the radiation levels in the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.439
 food particularly the laboratory 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.539
 of gamma spectrometry is the 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.149
 responsible for this task the audience 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.399
 against riccÃ³ jointly with projects 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.810
 mayors the ministry science and 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.640
 technology 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.680
 and the international energy agency 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.140
 atomic that now this laboratory 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.180
 in such a way that we are able 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.320
 of 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.260
 measure those radiations identify the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.950
 isotope present or the nucleus present and 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.430
 quantify their quantity and determine if 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.950
 will be harmful to health or not the method 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.750
 test is found 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.120
 accredited before the entity against license 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.100
 of accreditation in such a way that 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.860
 Our results are tradable to 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.670
 International level and also remarkable 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.320
 They must be accepted for their abilities 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.390
 the gamma spectrometry laboratory 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.459
 is the entity in charge of the analysis of the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.500
 food that our country imports for 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.330
 the consumption of the population as is the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.280
 case of milk powder and meat 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.230
 foods that can be seen very 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.319
 affected by feeding the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.659
 cows from which they come 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.209
 many of the products entering 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.719
 costa rica when doubts arise 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.360
 prior to their nationalization , the 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:03:00.500
 importer who 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.620
 is done to that raw material in 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.390
 general radiometric analysis for 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.120
 establish that they are free of 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.990
 pollution because it has happened that in 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.750
 many countries imported milk 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.180
 they are contaminated and if they are not made 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.960
 the analyzes they immediately pass to 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.590
 market are consumed and a long time 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.280
 then they realize the problem that 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.770
 could cause this type of products 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.850
 let's call it radiological surveillance of 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:39.140
 food for certain products 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.770
 for example infant food or 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.630
 meats that enter our country that 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.610
 they do not have any kind of this surveillance 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.550
 that these other countries have then 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.680
 Now the Senasa has been interested in 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.480
 these products by the population to the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.540
 that are intended are infants that 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.150
 they have a greater sensitivity there is already a 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.730
 surveillance 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.659
 for those foods we 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.209
 we are constantly measuring all and 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.069
 each of the products that we can 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.829
 find in any of our 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.379
 supermarkets there is food that is in 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:19.109
 this laboratory because they are for effects 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.109
 export meat milk 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.580
 and a series of foods since the 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.389
 exporter companies of our 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.729
 so that we can identify the 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.310
 safety in terms of emissions of 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:37.449
 radiation these many clients have 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.409
 the need to perform analysis 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:44.020
 radiometrics to products that export to 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:47.020
 other countries where they are requested 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.659
 certification that those products 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.800
 foods they are introducing in 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:56.340
 their respective countries do not have 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.680
 radioactive contamination 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.480
 they take a sample of their products we 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.080
 they bring them to us and we do 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.629
 the entire analysis process 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.960
 and we elaborated a certificate of 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:11.080
 analysis that they then present in the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.680
 respective authority 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.659
 where your product is going 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.490
 currently this laboratory is the only 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.349
 of your class in the country and throughout the 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.110
 Central American isthmus with capacity 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.849
 perform these tests is even the 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.159
 official laboratory of the Ministry of 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.689
 agriculture and livestock to monitor the 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.580
 healthiness of the food that is 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:32.530
 we produce in our country 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.650
 we enter into an agreement with a ministry 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.050
 of agriculture to become a 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.289
 official laboratory of them such 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.979
 So now the exporter has 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.740
 with a certificate issued by the 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.250
 Ministry of Agriculture 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.910
 and can export without that 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.389
 certificate it is impossible for the product 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:00.590
 leave costa rica we are installing 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:04.680
 a new detector to study 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:07.620
 radiation from nuclei that 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.259
 emit in very low energies that up 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.919
 today we could not see the team is already 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.750
 installing next year the 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.060
 we hope that the university acquires 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.940
 for us a much larger detector 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.669
 efficiency to decrease the times of 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.220
 counting for our results are 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.130
 accepted because we have 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.110
 participated in the last 10 years in 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.449
 inter comparisons mere straight 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.400
 which is a dependency of the organism 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.270
 international atomic mesh and 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.639
 our results have been very much more than 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.130
 satisfactory we have even 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:50.240
 advantaged to many countries of america 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.240
 Latin countries of Europe and Asia
