00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
the most part the palm is gonna be

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.680 
the most part the palm is gonna be
parallel<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.779> neck<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.480> want<00:00:34.510> a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
parallel to the neck and you want a

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.729 
parallel to the neck and you want a
parallel<00:00:35.110> but<00:00:35.200> you<00:00:35.290> don't<00:00:35.469> want<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.680> be

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
parallel but you don't want to be

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.709 
parallel but you don't want to be
touching<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.460> neck<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:36.910> if<00:00:37.120> you're<00:00:37.270> if<00:00:37.510> you're

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
touching the neck so if you're if you're

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.030 
touching the neck so if you're if you're
touching<00:00:37.930> it<00:00:38.260> then<00:00:38.440> it's<00:00:38.620> gonna<00:00:38.739> be<00:00:38.829> really

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
touching it then it's gonna be really

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.979 
touching it then it's gonna be really
tough<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.460> play<00:00:39.610> on<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.760> first<00:00:40.030> string<00:00:40.300> you

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
tough to play on a first string you

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.990 
tough to play on a first string you
don't<00:00:41.170> want<00:00:41.320> too<00:00:41.530> far<00:00:41.739> away<00:00:41.860> either<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.820> good

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
don't want too far away either the good

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.119 
don't want too far away either the good
test<00:00:43.210> for<00:00:43.450> that<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.840> whether<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.530> can<00:00:44.649> play<00:00:44.890> a

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
test for that is whether you can play a

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.750 
test for that is whether you can play a
bar<00:00:45.399> from<00:00:46.030> wherever<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.600> are<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.860> if<00:00:48.370> I'm<00:00:48.579> too

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
bar from wherever you are so if I'm too

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.990 
bar from wherever you are so if I'm too
far<00:00:49.000> down<00:00:49.750> then<00:00:50.469> I<00:00:50.800> can't<00:00:51.190> really<00:00:51.309> play<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.670> full

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
far down then I can't really play a full

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.549 
far down then I can't really play a full
bar<00:00:52.239> because<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.660> won't<00:00:52.809> be<00:00:52.930> able<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.260> reach<00:00:53.410> the

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
bar because I won't be able to reach the

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.340 
bar because I won't be able to reach the
sixth<00:00:54.309> string<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:55.090> if<00:00:55.239> I'm<00:00:55.390> too<00:00:55.660> close<00:00:55.960> then<00:00:56.260> I

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
sixth string and if I'm too close then I

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.229 
sixth string and if I'm too close then I
can't<00:00:56.559> play<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.829> first<00:00:57.039> string<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:57.610> you<00:00:57.850> have

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
can't play the first string so you have

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:08.530 
can't play the first string so you have
to<00:00:58.360> find<00:00:58.539> that<00:00:58.660> middle<00:00:58.960> place<00:00:59.109> where

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.180 

no<00:01:09.540> matter<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:09.930> string<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.380> play<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.979> can

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
no matter which string I play on I can

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.670 
no matter which string I play on I can
easily<00:01:11.610> move<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:12.000> first<00:01:12.330> finger<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:12.930> an<00:01:13.440> on

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
easily move my first finger from an on

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.190 
easily move my first finger from an on
bar<00:01:16.850> without<00:01:17.850> having<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> make<00:01:18.600> any<00:01:18.900> major

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
bar without having to make any major

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.859 
bar without having to make any major
adjustments<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.940> other<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> look<00:01:21.690> out

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
adjustments the other thing to look out

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.340 
adjustments the other thing to look out
for<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:23.280> thumb<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.960> for<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> lot<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
for is your thumb and for a lot of the

for is your thumb and for a lot of the
acoustic<00:01:26.009> players<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.390> thumb<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.869> be

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
acoustic players the thumb can be

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.149 
acoustic players the thumb can be
actually<00:01:28.320> part<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> your<00:01:28.770> left<00:01:29.009> hand

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
actually part of your left hand

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
actually part of your left hand
fingering<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> classical

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
fingering but because the classical

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.440 
fingering but because the classical
guitar<00:01:31.100> neck<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.520> fretboard<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.270> much

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
guitar neck the fretboard is so much

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
guitar neck the fretboard is so much
wider<00:01:33.690> we<00:01:34.440> can't<00:01:34.649> really<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.100> our<00:01:35.250> thumb<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
wider we can't really use our thumb to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.820 
wider we can't really use our thumb to
play<00:01:36.000> bass<00:01:36.240> notes<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.290> needs<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> remain

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
play bass notes so it needs to remain

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.710 
play bass notes so it needs to remain
behind<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> fretboard<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.270> bar<00:01:39.450> trick

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
behind the fretboard and the bar trick

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.359 
behind the fretboard and the bar trick
would<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.259> help<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:40.890> if

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
would actually help with that because if

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.540 
would actually help with that because if
you're<00:01:41.580> playing<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.179> full<00:01:42.390> bar<00:01:43.190> there's<00:01:44.190> no<00:01:44.399> way

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
showing so you're doing everything right

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.950 
showing so you're doing everything right
your<00:01:49.170> thumb<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.649> gonna<00:01:49.800> even<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.250> able<00:01:50.550> to

equation then all of the healthy heavy

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.789 
equation then all of the healthy heavy
lifting<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:23.940> left<00:02:24.180> for<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.200> thumb<00:02:25.470> here

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
lifting is left for them the thumb here

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.970 
lifting is left for them the thumb here
and<00:02:26.070> that's<00:02:26.459> just<00:02:26.610> gonna<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.150> tough
