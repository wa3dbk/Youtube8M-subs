and<00:01:55.330> then<00:01:55.540> but<00:01:56.380> it's<00:01:56.530> it's<00:01:56.800> yeah<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.190> was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
and then but it's it's yeah it was

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.370 
and then but it's it's yeah it was
something<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.640> we<00:01:57.850> felt<00:01:57.880> like<00:01:58.300> we<00:01:58.810> didn't

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
something that we felt like we didn't

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.990 
something that we felt like we didn't
want<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.590> make<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.710> new<00:01:59.920> too<00:02:00.130> many<00:02:00.310> DJ's<00:02:00.640> album
