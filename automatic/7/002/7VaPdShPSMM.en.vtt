00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.200 
first and so I have a lot of shrinkage
and<00:02:15.850> then<00:02:16.030> I'll<00:02:16.240> relax<00:02:16.990> every<00:02:17.940> three<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:18.970> four

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
and then I'll relax every three to four

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.680 
and then I'll relax every three to four
months<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.300> from<00:02:22.510> this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
months and and then this is from this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.830 
months and and then this is from this
month<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.700> sort<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.970> where<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.240> am<00:02:25.360> now

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
month and this is sort of where I am now

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.610 
month and this is sort of where I am now
and<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.690> length<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.860> have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and this is the length that I have

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.590 
and this is the length that I have
achieved<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.370> my<00:02:33.520> hair<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.850> pretty<00:02:34.000> healthy<00:02:34.390> I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
achieved and my hair is pretty healthy I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.030 
achieved and my hair is pretty healthy I
do<00:02:34.660> need<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:36.960> get<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> perm<00:02:38.410> it's<00:02:38.680> about<00:02:38.830> time

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
do need to get a perm it's about time

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.370 
do need to get a perm it's about time
for<00:02:39.070> another<00:02:39.280> perm<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:40.380> probably

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
for another perm and then probably

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.820 
for another perm and then probably
should<00:02:41.940> trim<00:02:42.940> my<00:02:43.150> ends<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.800> just

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
should trim my ends but this is just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.530 
should trim my ends but this is just
where<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.220> are<00:02:45.400> now<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.209> is<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
where we are now so this is the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.890 
where we are now so this is the
beginning<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.959> our<00:02:47.290> journey<00:02:47.670> together<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> I
