that<00:00:28.260> every<00:00:29.060> record<00:00:30.060> collection<00:00:30.689> should<00:00:30.960> have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that every record collection should have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.490 
that every record collection should have
a<00:00:31.170> copy<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.679> now<00:00:33.500> that<00:00:34.500> may<00:00:34.649> sound<00:00:34.860> strange<00:00:35.160> but

kind<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> idea<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> lot<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
kind of get the idea that in a lot of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.819 
kind of get the idea that in a lot of
cases<00:00:56.969> they'd<00:00:57.300> agree<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> don't

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
cases they'd agree but if you don't

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490 
cases they'd agree but if you don't
agree<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.670> alright<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.780> saying<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.289> my

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
agree it's alright I'm just saying in my

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.830 
agree it's alright I'm just saying in my
opinion<00:01:02.039> these<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.910> record<00:01:03.300> collection

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
opinion these are record collection

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.030 
opinion these are record collection
essentials<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.689> thinking<00:01:07.020> I'd<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
essentials so I'm thinking I'd do a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.640 
essentials so I'm thinking I'd do a
series<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.970> each<00:01:09.869> video<00:01:10.320> just

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
series of this each video just

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.340 
series of this each video just
showcasing<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.880> record

showcasing one record

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.410 
showcasing one record

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it's their best album I haven't heard

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.150 
it's their best album I haven't heard
absolutely<00:02:37.770> everything<00:02:38.460> by<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.700> group<00:02:39.000> but

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
absolutely everything by the group but

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.470 
absolutely everything by the group but
I've<00:02:41.160> heard<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> lot<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.330> is

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
I've heard a lot and I think this is

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.000 
I've heard a lot and I think this is
their<00:02:42.720> best<00:02:42.930> album<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.500> me<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.440> sound<00:02:46.710> of<00:02:46.890> this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
their best album to me the sound of this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.030 
their best album to me the sound of this
record<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:48.020> it's<00:02:49.020> psychedelic<00:02:49.740> but<00:02:49.920> it's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
record it's it's psychedelic but it's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.450 
record it's it's psychedelic but it's
not<00:02:50.630> overly<00:02:51.630> psychedelic<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:52.830> subtle

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
not overly psychedelic just just subtle

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.990 
not overly psychedelic just just subtle
touches

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
touches

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.820 
touches
I<00:02:54.270> think<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:57.230> psychedelic<00:02:58.230> kind<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.530> sound

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
I think of psychedelic kind of sound

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.530 
I think of psychedelic kind of sound
there's<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.790> lot<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.090> different<00:03:00.360> influences

there's a lot of different influences

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.570 
there's a lot of different influences

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
which was actually a lot better than I

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.940 
which was actually a lot better than I
thought<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.920> was<00:04:11.070> gonna<00:04:11.220> be<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:11.580> anyway<00:04:12.950> those

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
thought it was gonna be but anyway those

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.080 
thought it was gonna be but anyway those

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.650 
are just rumors about this album
I've<00:04:18.090> heard<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.690> Neil<00:04:19.350> Young<00:04:19.680> played<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.280> it

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
I've heard that Neil Young played on it

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.160 
I've heard that Neil Young played on it
but<00:04:22.440> he<00:04:22.680> did<00:04:22.920> he<00:04:23.280> wasn't<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.910> he<00:04:23.940> was

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
but he did he wasn't but he was

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.340 
but he did he wasn't but he was
associated<00:04:25.170> with<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.920> album<00:04:27.170> he<00:04:28.170> was

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
associated with this album he was

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.530 
associated with this album he was
originally<00:04:28.770> slated<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.640> be<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.970> producer<00:04:30.510> of

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
originally slated to be the producer of

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.080 
originally slated to be the producer of
this<00:04:30.810> record<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.340> guess<00:04:32.550> at<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.880> last

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
this record but I guess at the last

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.260 
this record but I guess at the last
minute<00:04:33.540> he<00:04:34.110> had<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.380> drop<00:04:34.590> out<00:04:34.860> but<00:04:35.790> he<00:04:35.970> did

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
minute he had to drop out but he did

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.220 
minute he had to drop out but he did
help<00:04:36.510> arrange<00:04:37.490> one<00:04:38.490> track<00:04:38.850> on<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.180> which<00:04:40.050> I

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
help arrange one track on it which I

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.880 
help arrange one track on it which I
think<00:04:40.290> was<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:42.570> Daily<00:04:42.900> Planet<00:04:43.080> Neil<00:04:43.650> Young

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
think was the Daily Planet Neil Young

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.360 
think was the Daily Planet Neil Young
helped<00:04:44.190> arrange<00:04:45.650> but<00:04:46.650> before<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:46.980> even<00:04:47.160> heard

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
helped arrange but before I even heard

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.220 
helped arrange but before I even heard
this<00:04:47.670> record<00:04:48.240> somebody<00:04:48.540> told<00:04:48.810> me<00:04:48.870> well<00:04:48.990> check

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
group this is on a lot of lists for one

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.980 
group this is on a lot of lists for one
of<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.860> best<00:04:59.070> records<00:04:59.580> of<00:04:59.820> all<00:05:00.000> time<00:05:00.030> things

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
of the best records of all time things

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.010 
of the best records of all time things
like<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.880> me<00:05:03.060> when<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.300> listen<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.720> it

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
like that and to me when I listen to it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.360 
like that and to me when I listen to it
it's<00:05:04.170> just<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:05.150> think<00:05:06.150> this<00:05:06.960> is<00:05:07.140> what<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.830> 60s

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
it's just I think this is what the 60s

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.190 
it's just I think this is what the 60s
sounds<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.910> like<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.390> know<00:05:09.450> what<00:05:09.630> I<00:05:09.690> mean<00:05:09.870> it's

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
sounds of like you know what I mean it's

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.650 
sounds of like you know what I mean it's
just<00:05:10.460> if<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.670> listen<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.360> know<00:05:12.510> the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
just if you listen to it you know the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.940 
just if you listen to it you know the
record<00:05:13.020> you're<00:05:13.200> familiar<00:05:13.350> with<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.800> you'll

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
record you're familiar with it you'll

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.630 
record you're familiar with it you'll
probably<00:05:14.130> know<00:05:14.400> what<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.550> mean<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:17.430> just

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
probably know what I mean it's just

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.460 
probably know what I mean it's just
really<00:05:17.910> a<00:05:18.030> great<00:05:18.450> record<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:20.990> this<00:05:21.990> group<00:05:22.230> had

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
really a great record and this group had

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.070 
really a great record and this group had
a<00:05:22.500> lot<00:05:22.740> of<00:05:22.850> troubles<00:05:23.850> that<00:05:24.090> they<00:05:24.660> couldn't<00:05:24.930> get

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
a lot of troubles that they couldn't get

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.620 
a lot of troubles that they couldn't get
along<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.860> guess<00:05:26.010> from<00:05:26.100> this<00:05:26.280> album<00:05:26.630> when

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
along and I guess from this album when

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.940 
along and I guess from this album when
they<00:05:27.720> were<00:05:27.780> gonna<00:05:27.930> go<00:05:28.170> into<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.560> studio<00:05:28.890> and

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
they were gonna go into the studio and

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.940 
they were gonna go into the studio and
record<00:05:29.100> this<00:05:29.550> album<00:05:30.590> there's<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:31.680> lot<00:05:31.860> of

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
record this album there's a lot of

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.370 
record this album there's a lot of
fighting<00:05:32.220> so<00:05:32.760> session<00:05:33.270> musicians<00:05:33.900> were<00:05:34.080> hired

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
fighting so session musicians were hired

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.440 
fighting so session musicians were hired
and<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.370> think<00:05:35.610> they<00:05:35.700> do<00:05:35.760> actually<00:05:36.030> play<00:05:36.390> on

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
and I think they do actually play on

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.840 
and I think they do actually play on
some<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.930> tracks<00:05:37.230> but<00:05:37.650> then<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.700> group

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
some of the tracks but then the group

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.240 
some of the tracks but then the group
realized<00:05:39.330> hey<00:05:39.570> we're<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:39.960> know<00:05:40.250> they're

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
realized hey we're you know they're

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.920 
realized hey we're you know they're
hiring<00:05:41.370> session<00:05:41.910> musicians<00:05:42.390> we<00:05:42.540> go<00:05:42.630> we<00:05:42.780> got<00:05:42.900> to

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
hiring session musicians we go we got to

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.200 
hiring session musicians we go we got to
get<00:05:43.110> along<00:05:43.470> and<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:44.430> know<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:44.790> they<00:05:44.880> got<00:05:45.030> back

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
get along and you know so they got back

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.330 
get along and you know so they got back
together<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:45.750> laid<00:05:46.470> down<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.800> tracks<00:05:47.100> for

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
together and laid down the tracks for

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.100 
together and laid down the tracks for
this<00:05:49.610> but<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.940> guess<00:05:51.390> that's<00:05:51.630> pretty<00:05:51.810> much<00:05:51.990> all

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
