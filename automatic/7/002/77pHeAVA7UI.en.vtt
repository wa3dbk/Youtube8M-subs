00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
can see from the two sets is that the

to<00:00:27.090> set<00:00:27.330> another<00:00:28.320> thing<00:00:28.740> about<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.490> set

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to set another thing about the this set

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
to set another thing about the this set
is<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> has<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> secret<00:00:31.470> rare<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
is that it has a secret rare which is a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.370 
is that it has a secret rare which is a
dark<00:00:32.460> raichu<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.750> reason<00:00:33.960> behind<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
dark raichu the reason behind that is

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.200 
dark raichu the reason behind that is
because<00:00:34.920> dark<00:00:35.250> raichu<00:00:35.610> was<00:00:35.790> originally

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
because dark raichu was originally

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110 
because dark raichu was originally
released<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:38.430> team<00:00:38.640> rocket<00:00:38.910> site<00:00:39.030> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
released for the team rocket site in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
released for the team rocket site in
english<00:00:39.390> version<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.530> many<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.950> guys

english version and as many of you guys
know<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.460> Japanese<00:00:41.610> sets<00:00:42.480> are<00:00:42.629> released<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
know the Japanese sets are released a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.080 
know the Japanese sets are released a
little<00:00:43.230> earlier<00:00:43.559> than<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> English<00:00:43.980> sets<00:00:44.370> so

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
little earlier than the English sets so

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.790 
little earlier than the English sets so
that<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> reason<00:00:45.989> why<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.620> had<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that was the reason why they had to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.420 
that was the reason why they had to
incorporate<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.210> side<00:00:49.190> yeah<00:00:50.190> let's

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
thing I dislike about this set is all

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.319 
thing I dislike about this set is all
the<00:03:44.479> unknowns<00:03:44.750> they<00:03:45.049> have<00:03:45.199> in<00:03:45.409> the<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.030> set

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
the unknowns they have in the in the set

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.360 
the unknowns they have in the in the set
kind<00:03:48.319> of<00:03:48.379> think<00:03:48.560> they're<00:03:48.799> kind<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.099> filler

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
kind of think they're kind of filler

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.430 
kind of think they're kind of filler
cards<00:03:49.729> in<00:03:49.819> some<00:03:50.000> ways<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.419> don't<00:03:50.959> mind<00:03:51.139> unknown

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
cards in some ways I don't mind unknown

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.559 
cards in some ways I don't mind unknown
cards<00:03:51.799> but<00:03:52.010> they<00:03:52.909> all<00:03:53.030> kind<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.329> have<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:53.540> same

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
cards but they all kind of have the same

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.689 
cards but they all kind of have the same
attack<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.260> same<00:03:54.470> HP<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.069> stuff<00:03:55.519> like<00:03:55.639> that

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
attack and same HP and stuff like that

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.490
