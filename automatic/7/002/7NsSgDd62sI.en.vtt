00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
captured the hand which is a little

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.520 
captured the hand which is a little
annoying<00:03:22.969> but<00:03:23.209> we've<00:03:23.329> got<00:03:23.510> two<00:03:23.689> points<00:03:24.019> now<00:03:24.170> so

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
annoying but we've got two points now so

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.220 
annoying but we've got two points now so
not<00:03:25.370> really<00:03:25.639> a<00:03:25.819> massive<00:03:26.180> inning<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:26.930> put<00:03:27.109> my

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
not really a massive inning so put my

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.110 
not really a massive inning so put my
five<00:03:27.560> Warren<00:03:28.189> skill<00:03:28.519> there<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.790> giving<00:03:29.030> me<00:03:29.090> a

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
five Warren skill there is giving me a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.909 
five Warren skill there is giving me a
nice<00:03:29.269> speed<00:03:29.599> boost<00:03:29.840> how<00:03:30.079> we<00:03:30.139> rush<00:03:30.470> up<00:03:30.680> behind

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
nice speed boost how we rush up behind

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.770 
nice speed boost how we rush up behind
the<00:03:31.099> back<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.430> keep<00:03:31.639> I'm<00:03:32.090> assuming

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
the back of the keep I'm assuming

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.210 
the back of the keep I'm assuming
they're<00:03:32.900> probably<00:03:33.109> they're<00:03:33.349> sensing<00:03:33.980> their

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
they're probably they're sensing their

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.710 
they're probably they're sensing their
team<00:03:34.400> towards<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.819> keep<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.329> logical

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
team towards the keep is the logical

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.679 
team towards the keep is the logical
thing<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.930> do<00:03:36.760> once<00:03:37.760> they've<00:03:37.909> captured<00:03:38.120> once

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:38.689 
thing to do once they've captured once

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.839 
thing to do once they've captured once
they<00:03:38.810> get<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.169> henge<00:03:39.349> so<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.129> come<00:03:40.609> on<00:03:40.730> up

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
they get to the henge so I come on up

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.550 
they get to the henge so I come on up
but<00:03:41.000> actually<00:03:41.419> the<00:03:41.480> anyone<00:03:42.019> here<00:03:42.290> which<00:03:42.439> is

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
but actually the anyone here which is

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.670 
but actually the anyone here which is
quite<00:03:42.980> unusual<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.840> must<00:03:45.049> be<00:03:45.109> running<00:03:45.409> slow

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
quite unusual it must be running slow

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
quite unusual it must be running slow
Punta<00:03:46.099> my<00:03:46.669> teams<00:03:46.879> already<00:03:47.000> engage<00:03:47.389> them<00:03:47.659> but

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
Punta my teams already engage them but

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.319 
Punta my teams already engage them but
