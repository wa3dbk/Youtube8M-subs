00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
dirtied up a little bit and I'm trying

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.650 
dirtied up a little bit and I'm trying
to<00:05:07.889> make<00:05:08.039> it<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.460> don't<00:05:08.789> know<00:05:08.850> if<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.300> like<00:05:09.479> this

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
to make it I don't know if I like this

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.080 
to make it I don't know if I like this
yet<00:05:09.930> or<00:05:10.020> not<00:05:10.169> but<00:05:10.229> I<00:05:10.470> took<00:05:11.250> these<00:05:11.400> garage<00:05:11.789> doors

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
yet or not but I took these garage doors

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.060 
yet or not but I took these garage doors
out<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.570> put<00:05:12.810> some<00:05:12.990> Pike<00:05:13.169> stuff<00:05:13.440> roof<00:05:13.680> panels

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.590 
out and put some Pike stuff roof panels
in<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:14.400> it<00:05:14.460> looks<00:05:14.520> like<00:05:14.699> corrugated<00:05:15.060> siding

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
in so it looks like corrugated siding

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.060 
in so it looks like corrugated siding
like<00:05:15.750> they<00:05:15.930> took<00:05:16.199> out<00:05:16.380> some<00:05:16.560> doors<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.010> just

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
like they took out some doors and just

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.730 
like they took out some doors and just
block<00:05:17.370> them<00:05:17.520> up<00:05:17.729> but<00:05:18.690> we'll<00:05:19.289> see<00:05:19.440> how<00:05:19.470> well

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
block them up but we'll see how well

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.140 
block them up but we'll see how well
that<00:05:19.919> turns<00:05:20.760> out<00:05:21.000> here<00:05:21.330> in<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.780> long<00:05:21.990> run<00:05:22.289> but

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
that turns out here in the long run but

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.240 
that turns out here in the long run but
that's<00:05:24.150> about<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.840> for<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.199> layout<00:05:25.530> update<00:05:25.770> as
