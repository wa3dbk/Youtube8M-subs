00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
and I've set this one to two and three

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.039 
and I've set this one to two and three
eighths<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.920> you're<00:02:53.099> not<00:02:53.220> sure<00:02:53.599> put<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.810> and

if it hits the back and it's still

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.910 
if it hits the back and it's still
sticking<00:02:57.329> out<00:02:57.480> let<00:02:57.780> me<00:02:57.870> show<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.049> then<00:02:58.799> you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
sticking out let me show you then you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.199 
sticking out let me show you then you
know<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.189> too<00:02:59.750> long<00:03:01.700> I'm<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.849> leaving<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
know it's too long I'm just leaving and

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.179 
know it's too long I'm just leaving and
zoom<00:03:03.389> in<00:03:03.599> on<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.709> see<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:05.010> back

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
zoom in on that so you can see the back

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.819 
zoom in on that so you can see the back
of<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.519> is<00:03:05.730> touching<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:07.500> part<00:03:07.799> right

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
of this is touching and this part right

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.059 
of this is touching and this part right
here<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.220> still<00:03:08.459> far<00:03:09.450> too<00:03:09.480> far<00:03:10.019> out<00:03:10.319> from<00:03:10.889> the

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
here is still far too far out from the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.750 
here is still far too far out from the
door<00:03:12.620> that's<00:03:13.620> because<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.069> set<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.400> two<00:03:14.489> and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
door that's because I set it to two and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.250 
door that's because I set it to two and
three-quarter<00:03:15.209> now<00:03:15.720> i'm<00:03:15.810> going<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.959> push<00:03:16.019> it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
three-quarter now i'm going to push it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.960 
three-quarter now i'm going to push it
back<00:03:16.379> into<00:03:16.620> two<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.160> three<00:03:17.400> eighths<00:03:17.579> inches

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
back into two and three eighths inches

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.990 
back into two and three eighths inches
because<00:03:18.569> that's<00:03:18.840> what<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.049> particular

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
because that's what this particular

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.819 
because that's what this particular
handle<00:03:21.000> site<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.269> set<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:23.190> i<00:03:23.220> put<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:24.829> i'm

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
handle site is set so i put that in i'm

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.099 
handle site is set so i put that in i'm
gonna<00:03:25.949> take<00:03:26.099> my<00:03:26.280> screws<00:03:26.959> usually<00:03:27.959> they're

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
gonna take my screws usually they're

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.409 
gonna take my screws usually they're
located<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.680> package<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.849> a<00:03:29.909> new<00:03:30.090> handle

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
located in a package and a new handle

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.479 
located in a package and a new handle
set<00:03:30.629> they're<00:03:30.989> all<00:03:31.139> together<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:32.220> strike

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
set they're all together the strike

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.360 
set they're all together the strike
plates<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:32.970> there<00:03:33.470> all<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.739> screws<00:03:35.040> are<00:03:35.250> in

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
plates in there all the screws are in

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.970 
plates in there all the screws are in
there<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:36.169> usually<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.290> directions<00:03:37.799> are<00:03:37.949> in

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
there and usually the directions are in

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
there and usually the directions are in
there<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.430> if<00:03:38.519> you're<00:03:38.579> not<00:03:38.730> sure<00:03:40.819> open<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:41.909> up

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
there so if you're not sure open it up

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.039 
there so if you're not sure open it up
and<00:03:42.030> start<00:03:42.329> going<00:03:42.510> through<00:03:42.599> everything<00:03:42.900> and

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
and start going through everything and

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.099 
and start going through everything and
you'll<00:03:43.260> find<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:44.060> there<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.780> some

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
you'll find it there are some

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.659 
you'll find it there are some
manufacturers<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:47.959> are<00:03:48.959> more<00:03:49.229> complicated

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
manufacturers that are more complicated

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.770 
manufacturers that are more complicated
most<00:03:50.669> of<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.940> stuff<00:03:51.150> you're<00:03:51.299> going<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.479> do<00:03:51.629> is

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
most of the stuff you're going to do is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.559 
most of the stuff you're going to do is
fairly<00:03:52.049> simple<00:03:52.699> so<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.819> first<00:03:53.970> two<00:03:54.239> screws

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
fairly simple so the first two screws

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.170 
fairly simple so the first two screws
are<00:03:54.720> going<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> go<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:56.250> since<00:03:56.879> I've<00:03:57.000> got<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
are going to go in and since I've got a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.119 
are going to go in and since I've got a
previous<00:03:57.569> handle<00:03:57.870> I've<00:03:57.959> got<00:03:58.139> holes

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
previous handle I've got holes

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.400 
previous handle I've got holes
so<00:04:01.129> it's<00:04:01.310> not<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.489> problem<00:04:02.000> however<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.230> may

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
so it's not a problem however you may

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.910 
so it's not a problem however you may
have<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.680> problem<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.510> problem<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:06.110> that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
have a problem and that problem is that

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.119 
have a problem and that problem is that

to be palm to the curb side doesn't have

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:35.409 
to be palm to the curb side doesn't have
to<00:06:33.949> but<00:06:34.369> that's<00:06:34.489> the<00:06:34.669> way<00:06:34.759> the<00:06:34.849> manufacturer

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
to but that's the way the manufacturer

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.389 
to but that's the way the manufacturer
designed<00:06:35.779> it<00:06:35.929> in<00:06:36.079> this<00:06:36.559> case<00:06:36.829> we're<00:06:37.129> going<00:06:37.159> to

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399 
designed it in this case we're going to

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:40.719 
designed it in this case we're going to
be<00:06:37.579> perfect<00:06:39.189> all<00:06:40.189> right<00:06:40.309> so<00:06:40.399> now<00:06:40.519> we're<00:06:40.639> going

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
be perfect all right so now we're going

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:42.279 
be perfect all right so now we're going
to<00:06:40.789> put<00:06:41.029> the<00:06:41.239> handle<00:06:41.509> set<00:06:41.689> together<00:06:41.839> trying<00:06:42.199> to

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
to put the handle set together trying to

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.439 
to put the handle set together trying to
zoom<00:06:42.529> in<00:06:42.679> on<00:06:42.800> this<00:06:42.979> so<00:06:43.159> they<00:06:43.309> can<00:06:43.489> see<00:06:43.819> this

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
zoom in on this so they can see this

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.329 
zoom in on this so they can see this
part<00:06:44.719> of<00:06:44.839> the<00:06:44.899> back<00:06:45.110> set<00:06:45.379> there's<00:06:45.889> a<00:06:45.979> curved
