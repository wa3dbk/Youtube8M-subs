00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 and now all the gamers are talking 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 train and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 how to change without stress of the clock 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.440
 reserval this is a remake that I am 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.560
 doing so there were quite a few doubts 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.920
 In the last video, the first thing that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.570
 I have to say it does not matter if the sims 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 3 is newly installed if we have already 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.179
 played we must install our cracks 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.650
 and we already have games worth that not 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.680
 nothing influences the first thing that we have to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.059
 to do is press the windows + r key 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.420
 OK 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.239
 then we write reid and we give to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.240
 accept here in the account control of 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.790
 user let's go yes 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.670
 and then if our operating system is 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:55.180
 64 bit we do the following we are going to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:59.000
 software vale word 64 32 not from then 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 sims and then we enter the sims 3 vale 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.570
 it's what we change we give it right click 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.330
 modify and this 7 we change it for a 2 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.570
 we verify that you in hexadecimal 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.850
 let's accept and close it's worth 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.010
 32-bit directory for systems 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.330
 32-bit operation is different I know 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.690
 I will leave you in the description of the video 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.670
 ok then we have to open the notebook 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.220
 notes are valid and we have to execute 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.730
 as an administrator it's worth in my case 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.350
 windows 8.1 I do it this way it's worth 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.690
 again control of user accounts 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.640
 I love yes, and now we open file 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.720
 and we go to the next directory 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.230
 we are going to be placed let's go here and we 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.440
 we go to where we have installed in 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.190
 our sims 3 is worth my case is over here 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.940
 we say 3 vouchers inside the folder 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.350
 we go to game bin and here they change the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.659
 text documents by all 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.719
 files is default 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.920
 we open it ok and now we go to the 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:11.280
 last part and as you will see here puts the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.930
 version in which we are worth and now 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.310
 this 15 we eat it was 31 this 0 this 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.489
 1 for a 0 and this 7 point is worth 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.020
 now let's save vale and in this 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.060
 same moment the game detects that 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.050
 we are so to speak in one version 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.090
 official sims 3 is now we open the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.580
 launcher 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.290
 and then open we will appear this 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.090
 available update there is a 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.260
 software update available you 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.580
 like to update your game we give ok and 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.870
 if we have installed origin vale 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.090
 immediately start downloading if not 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.340
 they have it installed because it will appear 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.200
 a process to install origin vale 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.780
 but I already have it installed 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.330
 immediately you start to download 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.610
 the update is worth to pause the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.230
 video while downloading and we're back 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.170
 in a little while 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.150
 well I have resumed the video because in 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.120
 this moment has already completed 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.120
 download bar voucher 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.540
 now we will appear with the control of 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.599
 user accounts we give yes 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.469
 and now it should start us as a 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:27.319
 kind of installation similar to when 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.960
 we installed sims 3 for the first time 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.670
 OK 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.319
 we will see varieties like 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.640
 will ask us for several authorizations 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.040
 ok let's give if anything goes and 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.739
 we wait for it to start so 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.739
 say it the installer is worth 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.180
 ok there is now we wait for all the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.530
 process is automatic, it is not, it is not very 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.910
 complicated as you will see immediately 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.280
 start updating the sims then 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.480
 they realize and says the assistant 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.660
 install shield is updating 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.950
 1.0 point 0.6 15 of the sims 3 to the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.310
 version 1 points 67 points we hope that 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.910
 this bar is finished 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.920
 I'm going to pause the video and see you in a 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.050
 little while 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.750
 ok the progress bar is already 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.480
 finish if they see that you are stopped in 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.860
 certain points will not give you close 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.930
 or nothing because the process is 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.969
 fully automatic and if the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.099
 they close they will have to download again 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.079
 since then update it if 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.919
 they see that it stays stopped simply what 

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:44.899
 ok and it's about to end it's worth as 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.059
 we see it is already so to speak installing 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:48.379
 the last and has already finished it is worth 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.509
 times the update has finished 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:54.019
 installation the wizard updates the sims 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.370
 3 to version 1.67 point 2 we give 

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:59.310
 click on final 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.470
 and as we will see now , the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.470
 sims 3 in the launcher is worth 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.569
 As you can see, it's opening up in this 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.779
 moment and it will open in the tab of 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.139
 game updates and we're going to 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:22.349
 say your game is updated worth 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.589
 as we can see now here puts version 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:29.289
 1.67 point 2 point such is worth good here to 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:31.300
 I get out I do not know because I always get 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.550
 these errors wrote he says no no 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.759
 there is a problem and as you see now we 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.379
 it appears so to speak now we can 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.749
 install what would be the other 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.449
 expansions I will teach you in others 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:46.770
 videos how to install the expansions 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:50.139
 it's worth the game right now 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.199
 would be updated would only be missing 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.339
 what would crack it is worth it I would 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:59.529
 I will teach how to crack it is worth it but what 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:01.409
 I will make a special video for that post 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:04.059
 that some people did not understand me 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.219
 how do I think the game properly 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:08.349
 okay so this is the first part 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:13.529
 of the tutorial and see you in the second 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.529
 good part until the next video goodbye
