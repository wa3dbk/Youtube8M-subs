one<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:12.540> Destructo<00:02:13.440> discs<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.690> best<00:02:15.959> skill<00:02:16.350> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
one now Destructo discs the best skill I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.860 
one now Destructo discs the best skill I
think<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:18.239> fairly<00:02:18.600> slow<00:02:19.079> its<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
think it's fairly slow its I like the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.600 
think it's fairly slow its I like the
look<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.110> destructor<00:02:22.530> dis<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:22.950> always<00:02:23.220> liked<00:02:23.459> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
look of destructor dis I always liked it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.900 
look of destructor dis I always liked it
when<00:02:23.730> quill<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.000> used<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.630> Dragon<00:02:25.320> Ball

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
when quill and used it in Dragon Ball

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.539 
when quill and used it in Dragon Ball
it's<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.030> nice<00:02:27.239> skill<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:28.100> it's<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> bit<00:02:29.310> too

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
it's a nice skill but it's a bit too

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.180 
it's a nice skill but it's a bit too
slow<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:31.110> games<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.440> bit<00:02:31.590> too<00:02:31.860> fast

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
slow in this it games a bit too fast

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.850 
slow in this it games a bit too fast
paced<00:02:32.579> and<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.570> need<00:02:33.720> skills<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.380> you

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
paced and then you need skills that you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.160 
paced and then you need skills that you
can<00:02:35.100> put<00:02:35.430> into<00:02:35.549> combos<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.420> destructor<00:02:36.930> disk

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
can put into combos and destructor disk

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.560 
can put into combos and destructor disk

this you got a defeat Quillin with the
owen<00:03:37.940> combo<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:39.860> nice<00:03:40.160> skill<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.940> use

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
owen combo and it is a nice skill to use

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.819 
owen combo and it is a nice skill to use
but<00:03:41.480> as<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.629> said<00:03:41.810> before<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.440> more<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.739> a

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
but as I said before it's more of a

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.530 
but as I said before it's more of a
finisher<00:03:43.370> than<00:03:43.670> anything<00:03:43.879> so<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.750> try<00:03:45.319> get<00:03:45.590> a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
finisher than anything so I try get a

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.270 
finisher than anything so I try get a
lot<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.629> combo<00:03:48.049> beforehand<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:48.920> then<00:03:49.010> use<00:03:49.250> it

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
lot of combo beforehand and then use it

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.750 
lot of combo beforehand and then use it
towards<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.180> end<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:58.040> there's<00:03:58.220> been<00:03:58.370> away<00:03:58.579> and

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
towards the end so there's been away and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.759 
towards the end so there's been away and
down<00:03:58.970> make<00:03:59.209> sure<00:03:59.239> I've<00:03:59.510> got<00:03:59.540> some<00:03:59.959> key<00:04:00.319> left

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
down make sure I've got some key left

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.349 
down make sure I've got some key left
over<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:02.620> finish<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.519> there's<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:05.030> Olin

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
over to finish and there's the Olin

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.780 
over to finish and there's the Olin
combo<00:04:05.870> there<00:04:06.140> it's<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.190> knock<00:04:07.370> some<00:04:07.519> straight

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
combo there it's it knock some straight

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.339 
combo there it's it knock some straight
to<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.030> floor<00:04:08.120> so<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.540> not<00:04:08.690> necessarily

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
to the floor so it's not necessarily

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:21.420 
to the floor so it's not necessarily
something<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.549> you<00:04:10.639> can<00:04:10.849> follow<00:04:11.120> up<00:04:11.359> with

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.909

fairly<00:04:25.669> good<00:04:25.870> it<00:04:26.870> looks<00:04:27.050> like<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.440> might<00:04:27.620> do

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
fairly good it looks like it might do

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.300 
fairly good it looks like it might do
some<00:04:28.130> damage<00:04:28.160> but<00:04:28.849> to<00:04:28.880> be<00:04:29.090> honest<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.680> key

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
some damage but to be honest the key

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.550

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.740 
so yeah now I'm the maximum reputation
and<00:04:39.320> another<00:04:40.070> quest<00:04:40.340> has<00:04:40.490> appeared<00:04:40.849> again

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
and another quest has appeared again

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.750 
and another quest has appeared again
takes<00:04:42.590> quite<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.830> lot<00:04:42.950> of<00:04:42.979> parallel<00:04:43.400> quest<00:04:43.639> but

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
takes quite a lot of parallel quest but

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.150 
takes quite a lot of parallel quest but
you<00:04:43.849> can<00:04:44.030> keep<00:04:44.210> track<00:04:44.450> of<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.780> by<00:04:45.160> watching

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
you can keep track of it by watching

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.580 
you can keep track of it by watching
that<00:04:46.550> bar<00:04:46.789> each<00:04:47.330> time<00:04:47.660> will<00:04:47.780> complete<00:04:48.139> a<00:04:48.169> quest

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
that bar each time will complete a quest

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.670 
that bar each time will complete a quest
so<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.639> not<00:04:49.820> too<00:04:50.000> bad<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.510> this<00:04:50.930> one<00:04:51.200> we<00:04:51.530> are

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
so it's not too bad and this one we are

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.950 
so it's not too bad and this one we are
finishing<00:04:52.099> off<00:04:52.370> with<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:53.000> district<00:04:53.419> toad<00:04:53.630> disk

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:25.730 

okay<00:05:17.849> let's<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.389> finish<00:05:18.720> him<00:05:19.050> off<00:05:19.199> now
