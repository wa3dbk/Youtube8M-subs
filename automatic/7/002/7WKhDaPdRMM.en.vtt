00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.050
 good here delirium 3 today I'm going to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.880
 make a boxing of the starter bitch px 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.100
 22 since on Youtube I did not find much 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.680
 many to maximums also in Spanish 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.400
 Well look I have decided to make a 1 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.620
 quickie 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.539
 so there we go with them 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.539
 not only be tel aviv they come like this 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.790
 looks very good only the outside 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.570
 and good and let's go quickie we have 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.930
 want to see them 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.910
 we would start opening it 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.950
 I know many would say if I did not have a 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.830
 bigger knife but not this 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.290
 smallest executive that I have at home 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.020
 let's go to the other side 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.380
 and we remove the knife will not be that 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 we stick 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.220
 we jump over here comes the other box 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.979
 a second turtle vix number one box 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.960
 in game audio we go back to catch the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.450
 knife since it brings here another one 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.399
 sticker 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.399
 we take it off and there we go 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.369
 well the first thing we see is this 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.799
 that is not what it is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.530
 and well here that well here 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.520
 good warranty as is a sticker 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.960
 turtle beach 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.950
 Well it's not bad I've seen them better 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.130
 but to be a delegate, nothing is wrong 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.079
 we move around 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.670
 the cables and accessories come here 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:10.819
 in this very modest box here you have 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.329
 the component cables the jack 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.120
 to connect it, I have not told you that 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.180
 these bosses are cross-platform so 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.730
 we are worth for both ps3 xbox pc 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.319
 for how we want to connect and there they come 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.319
 the headphones 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.410
 this is the amplifier let's leave it 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.989
 for the moment here that I want to 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.910
 see them and these would be the turtle bridge 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.830
 px 22 has a pint 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.170
 great 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.849
 as you can see 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.770
 has with the logo inside 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.850
 apiary 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.850
 the microphone 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.480
 has here a very very delicious meal 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.380
 Comfortable looks great 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.890
 are quite 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.130
 mobile so to speak and quite 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.130
 mobility 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.799
 they have here to regulate as everything 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.470
 any the bad set would be that this one does not 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.390
 I had it 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.340
 right now they are in the same price 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.350
 that the newts I decided on this is 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.550
 because then simply for the 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.610
 comments that I was seeing from the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.670
 tritons that no durability was 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.970
 pretty scarce if there were people who 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.280
 most did not reach the year or passed 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.500
 in the scarce year and for that very reason 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.950
 Leo is going so I decide for your tel aviv 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.150
 which is a brand already considered 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.230
 and consolidated 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.520
 and well that's why I decided basically 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.920
 why we are going to leave them here 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.150
 and we're going to open the amplifier on 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.150
 amplifier comes in a bag 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.560
 we'll see 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.450
 we leave this out there if I 'm throwing it 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.590
 everything on the ground but you're not going to 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.100
 pick up you I do not think it matters 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.670
 much 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.980
 and here comes the magnificent amplifier 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.549
 outside 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.729
 as you see has enough cable has 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.150
 very much very much cable and it comes with 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.200
 two extreme one end jack and one usb 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.200
 for power and plug it 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.830
 and this is the amplifier just like 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.830
 we remove this 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.270
 this is the amplifier 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:45.000
 this is for the low ones the clover 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.800
 volume of chat volume of headphones 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.430
 this is to connect here 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.070
 and well, this is a small one 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.970
 boxing what it brings 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.060
 the hits and turtle bay here is the 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.310
 box that I got bored of her 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.900
 very pretty but good here what 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.900
 fundamental are the headphones 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.370
 what I do realize is missing 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.750
 some mobility rotating it to 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.480
 put it on your chest since others then 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.120
 well I do not think it's something fundamental 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.090
 but they do have some more mobility 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.400
 the newts 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.690
 the movable microphone according to 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.419
 specifications to headphones 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.070
 first quality of 50 millimeters with a 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.290
 redesigned line amplifier 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.139
 adjustable bass and treble reinforcement 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.729
 dynamic zac boost controller 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:42.370
 microphone and power through usb 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:46.449
 in the box contains the px headset 22 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.449
 rca splitter the cable 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:55.569
 an auxiliary cable of 3.5 and 4 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.270
 millimeters a quick start guide and 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.800
 the sticker of the beach tour good 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.870
 this has been all the quick unboxing that 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.699
 we made of the turtle beats px 22 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.020
 I hope you liked me 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.819
 I extend a little more because what I 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.879
 matter is the sound quality what 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.870
 I want to test well is the microphone 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.620
 which is what matters most to me 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.040
 improve the quality of the emission of my 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.810
 videos 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.580
 and then in the next videos you can 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.710
 see and test for yourselves the 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.150
 quality the quality they emit from 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:29.220
 microphone I hope you liked it 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.220
 greetings bye bye chau chau
