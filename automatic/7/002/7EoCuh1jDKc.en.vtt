00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.069
 and the season is over tombs of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.849
 us guÃ©zon it is a lawn mower 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.769
 electric 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.090
 we will have to arrange it well 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.769
 maintain to find it 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.769
 in good condition next spring 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.550
 before doing anything it takes 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.060
 already branches and its extension 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.790
 electric what will allow the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.279
 store in a dry shelter 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.200
 wanting to roll and you have it on 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.030
 a cloud so that they are 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.470
 easy to recover in the spring 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.879
 next 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.220
 now that we have secured our 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.320
 mower we will be able to wash wash the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.390
 carter of soum attention is not 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.519
 a thermal mower the enemy number 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.410
 1 of electricity is moisture 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.589
 so for that we will take the most 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.570
 great care to be able to clean it 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.890
 first before cleaning a lawn mower 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.989
 from the moment that you are going to have a 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.559
 contact with your lawnmower blade 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.589
 especially put on gloves and we're going 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.470
 gently clean by passing a whole 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.960
 little I have all around the kart'are 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.880
 eliminate the maximum of grass and soil 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.760
 since there is always soil under 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.890
 shut up you have to finish you off 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.880
 clean the underside you put it back on 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.790
 its four wheels 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.409
 there are other strategic places where 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.659
 you have to really clean it's at 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.189
 turn of the wheels since rust risk 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.619
 to put oneself right on the 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:31.719
 bearings always gently 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.210
 without wetting the engine other place it 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.530
 there is often dirt 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.179
 it's behind the mower for that 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.039
 have to lift the hood and clean 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.539
 gently behind 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.310
 once again you have cleaned your 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.960
 trimmer the cover of your lawnmower 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.289
 without getting wet 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.689
 of course the electric motor there 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.280
 the casing must be wiped down so that 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.829
 they are as dry as possible to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.929
 inside and outside of both 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.969
 sides also take advantage to check 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.889
 the condition of your lawnmowers blade without 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.270
 doubt she was or spoke to 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.639
 last grave well this is the moment of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.299
 dismantle it from the forest and the 

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.509
 put back in place 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.619
 just before putting away your lawn mower 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.119
 so here a little tip for 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.220
 find in very good condition your 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 electric mower is to pass it 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.540
 by releasing it then it will allow 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.270
 to prevent the blade from rusting and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.110
 especially to clean the crankcase in good standing 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.160
 general and for that we go bombay 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.580
 the entire interior trimmer 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.950
 outside 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.360
 and then we'll go through a little bit 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.720
 also on the organs that interests us 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.840
 a lot 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.790
 these are the wheel bearings of the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.980
 trimmer on all the amount on any 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.600
 the surface then the interest of this product 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.490
 it's just going to avoid 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.990
 the moisture to get into your 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.850
 clipper now since we talk 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.190
 of moisture and well will go this 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.480
 lawn mower dry and spring 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.740
 next she will be in good condition for 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.740
 spend your first mowing
