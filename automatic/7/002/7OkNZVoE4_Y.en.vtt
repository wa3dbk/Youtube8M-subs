00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 And here, people are the oil and today in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.710
 Bringing you a great game is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.400
 type a flight or war simulator 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 nobody really pleased me quite the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 The name of the game is Fighter Ship 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.369
 this is his main menu here you 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.140
 can choose is your plane is clear in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.030
 start the first one is released 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.020
 then you can release those others 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 two 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.250
 here you have the option to play the sound 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.860
 in the configuration options and such 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.980
 the cleiton is in the play has the tutorial 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.350
 for you see how the game works if 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.899
 You can and you have the campaign here. 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 reaches several modes for example has a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.829
 so you have to destroy a target 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.030
 there is a way you have to use the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.320
 airplane has several very interesting modes 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 in this game 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.080
 I 'm going here in free flight mode just to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.030
 We see how the physics of the game and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 arrow 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 so it's there, this is the only way for you 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.479
 flying here without doing anything without a 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.869
 objective just to see what the game is like here 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 active to the engine of the airplane here I 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.450
 start flight and unlike other 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.270
 games here is not touch the screen you use 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 the accelerometer of the device I do not short 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.140
 too bad to record are watching too 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.240
 right but in this game ran fine 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.630
 the accelerometer here and he responds in a 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.090
 very quick and that's what called the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.850
 Watch it because it's very cool this game 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.930
 This is the team's physical physics. 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 cool 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.909
 I already played in other games. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.090
 tried to simulate a flight and such but they are 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.790
 very connected does not work right 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.259
 android and this one is working 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.060
 Very well. 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.400
 It's a lot of the same ball show and the graph 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 in itself is not very beautiful 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.530
 even because the map is very large 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.110
 the calculation so spectacular but for being a 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.810
 free game is very cool is very 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.630
 well done mainly modeling 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.430
 I remove airplane from the plane 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.630
 aircraft carrier right 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.270
 Well, that's a great game, well. 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.910
 fun for you to play 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.690
 Okay, I'll always leave the link to 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:46.190
 download in the description I'm staying here 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.190
 A big hug and thanks
