00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.800 
again we've got we have got a bit more
strength<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.850> depth<00:01:33.119> i<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> team<00:01:33.659> has

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
strength in depth i think the team has

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.899 
strength in depth i think the team has
matured<00:01:33.990> over<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> last<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.130> 12<00:01:35.490> months

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
matured over the last you know 12 months

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.810 
matured over the last you know 12 months
and<00:01:36.090> we've<00:01:36.630> come<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> long<00:01:36.900> way<00:01:37.170> mmm<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.310> you've

and we've come a long way mmm and you've

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.890 
and we've come a long way mmm and you've
been<00:01:38.970> doing<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> long<00:01:39.600> time<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
been doing this for a long time and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
been doing this for a long time and
you've<00:01:40.320> been<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> moment<00:01:41.159> away

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you've been up and down a moment away

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.030 
you've been up and down a moment away
for<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> long<00:01:41.729> time<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.530> can<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.740> win<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
for a long time and can we win the
league<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.369> year<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.820> certainly<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.390> we

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
league this year I certainly think we

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.060 
league this year I certainly think we
care<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.930> we've<00:01:46.020> got<00:01:46.110> every<00:01:46.380> chance<00:01:46.409> as

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070

care think we've got every chance as
like<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> say<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> think<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.210> down

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
like I say I think it's really down

like I say I think it's really down
about<00:01:48.509> believe<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.200> should<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.470> strengthen<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
about believe we should we strengthen I
think<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> strengthen<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:51.930> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
think we need to strengthen I think you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
think we need to strengthen I think you
never<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.890> never<00:01:52.920> sit<00:01:53.280> still<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.970> mean
