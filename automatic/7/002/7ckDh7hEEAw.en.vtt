00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 hi i am a keep for myself the study 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.330
 proto cross for several years I decided 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.820
 to shoot this video hoping it could 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.380
 be useful for those who are beginners or 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.870
 for those who have decided to start the study 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.070
 of jazz and blues 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 I state that even if he reads 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.320
 considered one of more generous declines 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 free to play it you will have to study 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 constantly practice for hours on 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.860
 phrasing rhythmic study of this 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.260
 kind to start maybe 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.890
 it is more appropriate to use the scale of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.140
 English soul 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.360
 in my opinion one of the simplest le 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.240
 then blues scales are pentatonic 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 we will use 5 notes for the scale 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.370
 lina scalisi on the site re does naturally 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.580
 with the appropriate and interactions for 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.720
 who does not know the pentatonic scales of 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.120
 blues 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.400
 let's say that initially you can use a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.760
 rather simple method that it is 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.729
 to count example a soul ladder 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.180
 soul is a tone a half tone yes 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.110
 flat I give a tone then I do sharp 32 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:27.920
 half tone half tone makes it natural and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:32.700
 then a soul tone then then another 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.149
 quite simple scale that of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.860
 with the same method we will play re.co.sol 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.860
 sol sharps the hour 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.670
 initially maybe it's better if ed 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.619
 practiced only with the first octave then 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.130
 subsequently also use the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.130
 second to third 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.439
 regarding the rhythm 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.799
 maybe you can make use of it 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.849
 by having you accompanied by agreements 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:19.790
 from a friend of yours I am an example 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:25.739
 keyboard the piano or otherwise from 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.700
 of bass players otherwise on your behalf 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.799
 can exercise initially with the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.099
 scale returning long notes maybe 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.769
 then alternating them with triplets 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.350
 of quentin's quentin and so 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.000
 that you will eventually get a study 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.250
 quite knowledgeable with regards to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.190
 the rhythm of jazz instead the type of jazz 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.370
 since there are several that I will go 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.739
 to study depends more on boy 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.359
 from your influences and the example of 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.750
 more talented in a great flutist 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.680
 jazz was characterized by his 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.209
 traditions 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.060
 being South American he always played 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.540
 a jazz linked to the rhythm of Latin 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.540
 American 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.819
 instead regarding the sound 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.250
 depends on your approach with the 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:23.709
 flute in the example in the sonatas the suites 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.739
 of bolling rampal used a sound 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:31.140
 as pure as in the blues while 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:35.410
 other flutist as eric dolphy 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.440
 herbie mann the same as valentin ian 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 anderson used a more sound 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.400
 scratched the board a little more dirty 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.940
 what I can give you is that of course 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.640
 to practice them dead listen too 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.209
 very very blues so you can 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.000
 enrich your own a little 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.530
 knowledge 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.150
 so when he goes to face these 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.819
 first improvisations maybe you can 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:09.250
 resume melodies and make it a bit 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:11.950
 more your no hope of being 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.430
 quite useful if you have 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.489
 requests, however, questions you can 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.080
 quietly send a message 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.669
 on my email which is in the channel 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.669
 ok clothes all bye
