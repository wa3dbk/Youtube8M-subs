00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 the very popular sport in the states 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.870
 has been gaining ground in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.700
 Brazilian universities is useful in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.700
 the practice of cheerleaders 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.570
 everything you ever knew about the chile 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 the cheerleaders he saw 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.390
 in American films 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.369
 The most I saw was what got us 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.570
 movies rocking girls make up 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.890
 dancing basketball in high school beyond 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.300
 two years 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.520
 I imagined that I would enter 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 college and continue in basketball in 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.260
 abc federal university and lucas 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.840
 joined the team you deal with and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.989
 discovered a new and challenging sport 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.399
 it 's not girl 's way not sport 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.010
 some 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.410
 if you see the staff even had on 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.730
 truth as a modality he was born in the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.559
 united states including a curiosity 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 is that it was created by men 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 the way people practice 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.379
 It's happening in Brazil that's the most 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.110
 that the most publicized is called 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.840
 as today takes the athletic one that is the part 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 of acrobatic elevations which is the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.580
 that really require a physical preparation 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.010
 are athletes are not throwing ina are not 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 models are not contracted dancers 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.710
 by the football team to stay there in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 front 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.259
 the training is pulled in two hours of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.380
 the students have to practice the six 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:31.460
 main skills of losing sport 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.670
 an athlete jumps in sequence 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.900
 lift and throw the athlete 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.900
 the solo acrobatics 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.770
 the dance and the human pyramid 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.720
 before entering the team the students 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.060
 undergo a physical test 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.920
 larissa had already trained in the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.290
 a university of the united states 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.290
 during the exchange it is frightening at first 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.750
 because sometimes you think is is the height 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.510
 of a person is not so high but you 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.550
 rises to the height of that person plus his 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.940
 Height then give a little fear 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.160
 like every new mode one had to deal with 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.790
 there are still few athletes in brazil 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.700
 most train in university teams 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.830
 they are getting stuck for the third 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.450
 edition of the Brazilian championship happens 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.790
 in December 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.430
 but here at school he has a 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.130
 even greater importance than is the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.520
 integrate all students 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.560
 We are here for the purpose.

 team to provide support and support for 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.610
 twisted modes even shake the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.100
 college take everybody three games 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.239
