the Nvidia shield is basically made for
gaming<00:00:20.119> it<00:00:21.080> runs<00:00:21.260> on<00:00:21.349> Android<00:00:21.740> though<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:22.279> it's

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
gaming it runs on Android though so it's

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.019 
gaming it runs on Android though so it's
on<00:00:22.520> it's<00:00:22.759> on<00:00:22.849> 4.4<00:00:23.599> so<00:00:24.020> lollipop<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.130> it<00:00:25.730> is

delicious one of the things I'm doing
right<00:00:29.419> now<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:30.020> I'm<00:00:30.169> actually<00:00:30.290> able<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:30.849> output

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
right now is I'm actually able to output

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.479 
right now is I'm actually able to output
the<00:00:32.119> screen<00:00:32.419> at<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.930> a<00:00:32.960> monitor<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.070> I'm

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
the screen at to a monitor so I'm

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.710 
the screen at to a monitor so I'm
actually<00:00:34.700> looking<00:00:34.910> at<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:35.210> monitor<00:00:35.480> right<00:00:35.600> now

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
actually looking at a monitor right now

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.240 
actually looking at a monitor right now
and<00:00:35.899> then<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.079> see<00:00:36.230> is<00:00:36.350> if<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.500> push<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:36.950> certain

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
and then I see is if I push this certain

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.340 
and then I see is if I push this certain
button<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:37.760> can<00:00:38.480> actually<00:00:38.600> have<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.870> mouse<00:00:39.079> on

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
button I can actually have a mouse on

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.960 
button I can actually have a mouse on
the<00:00:39.530> screen<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.070> what<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:40.280> allows<00:00:40.489> me<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.790> do

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
the screen so what that allows me to do

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.080 
the screen so what that allows me to do
is<00:00:41.300> not<00:00:41.780> have<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:42.079> touch<00:00:42.289> the<00:00:42.980> tablet<00:00:43.730> at<00:00:43.820> all

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
is not have to touch the tablet at all

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.700 
is not have to touch the tablet at all
during<00:00:44.690> gameplay<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.199> if<00:00:45.320> I<00:00:45.350> need<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:45.500> push<00:00:45.620> the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
during gameplay so if I need to push the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.959 
during gameplay so if I need to push the
play<00:00:45.859> button<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:46.160> can<00:00:46.280> just<00:00:46.399> push<00:00:46.579> play<00:00:46.760> right

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
play button I can just push play right

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.540 
play button I can just push play right
there<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.570> I<00:00:47.960> can<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:48.350> go<00:00:48.559> up<00:00:48.679> here<00:00:48.710> do<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.339> new

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
there and I can just go up here do a new

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.490 
there and I can just go up here do a new
world<00:00:49.940> whatever<00:00:50.359> there's<00:00:50.960> also<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.140> trackpad

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
world whatever there's also a trackpad

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.770 
world whatever there's also a trackpad
thing<00:00:52.039> on<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.609> controller<00:00:53.390> but<00:00:53.570> I<00:00:53.629> haven't

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
thing on the controller but I haven't

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.060 
thing on the controller but I haven't
configured<00:00:54.109> it<00:00:54.320> properly<00:00:54.589> you<00:00:54.739> can<00:00:54.859> kind<00:00:55.010> of

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
configured it properly you can kind of

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.889 
configured it properly you can kind of
tell<00:00:55.249> it<00:00:55.339> doesn't<00:00:55.460> go<00:00:55.699> very<00:00:55.730> far<00:00:56.210> not<00:00:56.749> very

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
tell it doesn't go very far not very

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.150 
tell it doesn't go very far not very
responsive<00:00:57.469> but<00:00:57.589> that's<00:00:57.769> probably<00:00:58.010> my

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
responsive but that's probably my

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.610 
responsive but that's probably my
problem<00:00:58.519> I'll<00:00:58.850> look<00:00:58.999> at<00:00:59.120> that<00:00:59.149> later<00:00:59.320> so<00:01:00.320> if<00:01:00.530> I

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
problem I'll look at that later so if I

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.069 
problem I'll look at that later so if I
got<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.800> create<00:01:01.159> world<00:01:01.399> here<00:01:01.699> I'll<00:01:02.690> just<00:01:02.899> build

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
got to create world here I'll just build

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.390 
got to create world here I'll just build
a<00:01:03.230> new<00:01:03.350> world<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:03.800> I<00:01:03.859> can<00:01:03.980> just<00:01:04.100> push<00:01:04.280> that

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
a new world and I can just push that

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.010 
a new world and I can just push that
button<00:01:04.460> again<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:05.000> get<00:01:05.089> rid<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:05.480> cursor

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
button again to get rid of that cursor

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.380 
button again to get rid of that cursor
and<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:06.260> can<00:01:06.860> see<00:01:06.980> him<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.190> world<00:01:07.370> so<00:01:07.820> it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
and you can see him in a world so it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.910 
and you can see him in a world so it
works<00:01:08.690> pretty<00:01:08.900> well<00:01:09.080> I'm<00:01:09.350> actually<00:01:09.500> using<00:01:09.740> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
works pretty well I'm actually using a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.870 
works pretty well I'm actually using a
controller<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.370> don't<00:01:10.520> know<00:01:10.580> if<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.790> was

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
controller I don't know if that was

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.760 
controller I don't know if that was
clear<00:01:11.090> I'm<00:01:11.330> using<00:01:11.480> a<00:01:11.630> physical<00:01:11.780> piece<00:01:12.590> of

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
clear I'm using a physical piece of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.160 
clear I'm using a physical piece of
hardware<00:01:13.130> controller<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:14.210> manipulate<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
hardware controller to manipulate the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.200 
hardware controller to manipulate the
game<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.530> if<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:15.710> push<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:16.310> jumps<00:01:16.700> if<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:16.880> double

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
game so if I push a it jumps if I double

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.289 
game so if I push a it jumps if I double
tap<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:18.140> puts<00:01:18.500> me<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:18.619> fly<00:01:18.890> mode<00:01:19.130> now<00:01:19.759> how

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
tap a it puts me in fly mode now how

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.609 
tap a it puts me in fly mode now how
this<00:01:20.450> works<00:01:20.750> you're<00:01:20.960> probably<00:01:21.110> wondering

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
this works you're probably wondering

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.410 
this works you're probably wondering
because<00:01:21.740> Mojang<00:01:22.250> has<00:01:22.280> not<00:01:22.640> added<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.060> fishel

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
because Mojang has not added a fishel

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.950 
because Mojang has not added a fishel
controller<00:01:23.750> support<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:25.399> if<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:26.090> push<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.689> hold

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
controller support so if I push and hold

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.359 
controller support so if I push and hold
the<00:01:27.200> start<00:01:27.439> button<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.979> controller

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
the start button on the controller

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.209 
the start button on the controller
you'll<00:01:29.060> see<00:01:29.329> this<00:01:29.509> mode<00:01:29.869> here<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.469> this<00:01:30.950> is<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
you'll see this mode here so this is the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.950 
you'll see this mode here so this is the
game<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.460> mapping<00:01:32.060> mode<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:32.570> they<00:01:32.659> give<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.899> a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
game of mapping mode so they give you a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.069 
game of mapping mode so they give you a
way<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.290> map<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.340> screen<00:01:34.729> for<00:01:35.329> all<00:01:35.540> your<00:01:35.840> games

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
way to map the screen for all your games

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.569 
way to map the screen for all your games
that<00:01:36.350> way<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:36.740> there's<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.950> game<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.430> not

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
that way if there's a game that is not

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.840 
that way if there's a game that is not
mapped<00:01:37.939> already<00:01:38.649> Nvidia<00:01:39.649> shield<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.520> company

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
mapped already Nvidia shield the company

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.340 
mapped already Nvidia shield the company
Nvidia<00:01:41.180> doesn't<00:01:41.479> have<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.659> go<00:01:41.750> through<00:01:42.110> and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
Nvidia doesn't have to go through and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.230 
Nvidia doesn't have to go through and
actually<00:01:43.100> map<00:01:43.219> every<00:01:43.460> game<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.820> community

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
actually map every game the community

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.340 
actually map every game the community
can<00:01:44.360> do<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.689> can<00:01:44.719> upload<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.320> download

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
can do it you can upload and download

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.289 
can do it you can upload and download
each<00:01:45.829> other's<00:01:46.070> customizations<00:01:46.880> it's

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
each other's customizations it's

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.330 
each other's customizations it's
actually<00:01:47.630> super<00:01:47.960> cool<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.380> if<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:49.070> look<00:01:49.219> down

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
actually super cool so if you look down

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.230 
actually super cool so if you look down
here<00:01:49.399> for<00:01:49.729> example<00:01:50.149> if<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.259> push<00:01:51.560> up<00:01:52.090> on<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
here for example if I push up on the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.260 
here for example if I push up on the
left<00:01:53.479> stick<00:01:53.930> LS<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:55.100> will<00:01:55.340> activate<00:01:56.090> that

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
left stick LS that will activate that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.819 
left stick LS that will activate that
part<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.689> screen<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.140> basically<00:01:57.530> all

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
part of the screen so basically all

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.099 
part of the screen so basically all
these<00:01:58.280> buttons<00:01:58.579> are<00:01:59.000> just<00:01:59.450> emulating<00:01:59.689> you

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
these buttons are just emulating you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.620 
these buttons are just emulating you
touching<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.799> screen<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.969> right<00:02:02.240> stick

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
touching the screen so this right stick

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.240 
touching the screen so this right stick
if<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:03.109> move<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.469> right<00:02:03.560> stick<00:02:03.799> around<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.070> it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
if I move the right stick around it it

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.709 
if I move the right stick around it it
would<00:02:04.460> be<00:02:04.549> as<00:02:04.700> if<00:02:04.820> I'm<00:02:04.969> moving<00:02:05.270> my<00:02:05.420> thumb

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
would be as if I'm moving my thumb

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.230 
would be as if I'm moving my thumb
around<00:02:05.869> if<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.320> push<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.130> Y<00:02:07.609> button<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.149> will

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
around if I push the Y button it will

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.210 
around if I push the Y button it will
off<00:02:08.360> my<00:02:08.509> inventory<00:02:08.780> as<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.350> tap<00:02:09.619> that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
off my inventory as if I tap that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.470 
off my inventory as if I tap that
inventory<00:02:10.700> button<00:02:10.910> right<00:02:11.120> there<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
inventory button right there on the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480 
inventory button right there on the
screen<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.020> it's<00:02:12.440> really<00:02:12.710> quite<00:02:12.980> cool<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.430> you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
screen so it's really quite cool and you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.070 
screen so it's really quite cool and you
can<00:02:13.610> have<00:02:13.700> multiple<00:02:13.880> pages<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.720> if<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.930> go<00:02:15.050> over

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
can have multiple pages so if I go over

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.930 
can have multiple pages so if I go over
here<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.980> can<00:02:16.130> see<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.610> inventory

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
here you can see this is the inventory

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.330 
here you can see this is the inventory
page<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.960> obviously<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.620> haven't<00:02:18.800> set<00:02:19.040> much<00:02:19.160> up

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
page and obviously I haven't set much up

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.340 
page and obviously I haven't set much up
here<00:02:19.370> except<00:02:19.820> for<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.090> one<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.930> what<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.200> can

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
here except for this one so what you can

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.780 
here except for this one so what you can
do<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.890> if<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.460> push<00:02:22.730> Y<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.420> M

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
do is if I push Y to go to M

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
do is if I push Y to go to M

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
I actually don't even have to hold it to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.809 
I actually don't even have to hold it to
break<00:02:45.780> blocks<00:02:46.079> I<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.650> push<00:02:47.189> it<00:02:47.370> edit

breaks<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.269> just<00:02:48.420> breaks<00:02:48.659> super<00:02:49.049> easy<00:02:49.260> which

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
breaks it just breaks super easy which

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.319 
breaks it just breaks super easy which
is<00:02:49.650> way<00:02:49.829> nice<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.370> then<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.939> place<00:02:51.120> blocks

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
is way nice and then I can place blocks

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.199 
is way nice and then I can place blocks
of<00:02:51.599> course<00:02:51.870> with<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.530> right<00:02:52.769> button<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:53.609> I've

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
of course with the right button so I've

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.429 
of course with the right button so I've
actually<00:02:54.450> preferred<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.049> have<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.409> other

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
actually preferred to have it the other

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.619 
actually preferred to have it the other
way<00:02:55.650> around<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:56.189> prefer<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.609> build<00:02:56.939> with<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
way around I prefer to build with the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.629 
way around I prefer to build with the
left<00:02:57.959> button<00:02:58.439> and<00:02:58.769> break<00:02:59.099> with<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.370> right<00:02:59.489> one

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
left button and break with the right one

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.129 
left button and break with the right one
but<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.790> haven't<00:02:59.970> customized<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.599> enough<00:03:00.780> yet

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
but I haven't customized it enough yet

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.629 
but I haven't customized it enough yet
at<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.379> point<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:02.129> make<00:03:02.250> much<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.459> a

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
at this point to make much of a

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.429 
at this point to make much of a
difference<00:03:02.970> with<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.389> so<00:03:03.659> also<00:03:04.200> you'll

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
difference with that so also you'll

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.539 
difference with that so also you'll
probably<00:03:04.560> notice<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.069> actually<00:03:05.159> quite

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
probably notice it's actually quite

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.979 
probably notice it's actually quite
smooth<00:03:05.849> I'm<00:03:06.030> actually<00:03:06.209> recording<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.840> through

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
smooth I'm actually recording it through

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.349 
smooth I'm actually recording it through
an<00:03:07.079> elgato<00:03:07.470> because<00:03:07.889> I'm<00:03:07.980> able<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.280> output<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
screen through that to my Mac so I'm

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.819 
screen through that to my Mac so I'm
able<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.299> record<00:03:12.659> it's<00:03:12.900> super<00:03:13.319> super<00:03:13.470> nice<00:03:13.769> and

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
able to record it's super super nice and

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.940 
able to record it's super super nice and
smooth<00:03:14.340> buttery<00:03:15.060> smooth<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:16.470> recording<00:03:16.889> a

1080p<00:03:17.099> at<00:03:17.639> 60<00:03:17.909> frames<00:03:18.120> per<00:03:18.209> second<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> usually

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
1080p at 60 frames per second I usually

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.710 
1080p at 60 frames per second I usually
only<00:03:19.260> upload<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.799> 720p<00:03:20.430> though<00:03:20.819> because<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
only upload in 720p though because the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.289 
only upload in 720p though because the
file<00:03:21.930> size<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.230> about<00:03:22.530> half<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.159> so<00:03:23.879> uploads

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
file size is about half and so uploads

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.390 
file size is about half and so uploads
faster<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.959> renders<00:03:25.260> faster<00:03:25.769> I'm<00:03:26.129> just<00:03:26.310> able

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
faster it renders faster I'm just able

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.309 
faster it renders faster I'm just able
to<00:03:26.549> get<00:03:26.669> content<00:03:27.299> out<00:03:27.329> much<00:03:27.659> quicker<00:03:27.900> when<00:03:28.290> I

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
to get content out much quicker when I

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.949 
to get content out much quicker when I
do<00:03:28.409> it<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.859> way<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:30.510> works<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.810> lot<00:03:30.900> better

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
do it that way so it works a lot better

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.750 
do it that way so it works a lot better
that<00:03:31.319> way<00:03:31.409> so<00:03:31.470> yeah<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.459> really<00:03:32.489> nice

probably thinking man you just bought a
nexus<00:03:35.639> 9<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:36.269> know<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.659> was<00:03:37.049> actually<00:03:37.349> having<00:03:37.440> a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
nexus 9 I know I was actually having a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.319 
nexus 9 I know I was actually having a
hard<00:03:37.769> time<00:03:38.010> choosing<00:03:38.340> between<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.879> two<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
hard time choosing between the two and

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.599 
hard time choosing between the two and
what<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.840> found<00:03:40.169> by<00:03:40.379> owning<00:03:40.709> both<00:03:41.159> that<00:03:41.519> I'll

what I found by owning both that I'll

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.640 
what I found by owning both that I'll
probably<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:42.030> sell<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.479> Nexus<00:03:43.109> 9<00:03:43.139> because<00:03:43.620> I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
probably just sell the Nexus 9 because I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.979 
probably just sell the Nexus 9 because I
don't<00:03:43.799> think<00:03:43.949> I<00:03:44.010> need<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.370> now

over 60 I believe on Amazon and the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.649 
over 60 I believe on Amazon and the
Nexus<00:04:31.050> 9<00:04:31.229> alone<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:32.099> already<00:04:32.400> 400<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.450> it's

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
Nexus 9 alone is already 400 so it's

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.750 
Nexus 9 alone is already 400 so it's
already<00:04:33.930> cheaper<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.889> get<00:04:35.039> both<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.430> Nvidia

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
already cheaper to get both the Nvidia

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
shield tablet

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.920 
shield tablet
the<00:04:37.289> controller<00:04:37.680> by<00:04:38.550> about<00:04:38.759> $40<00:04:39.419> it's<00:04:39.569> cheaper

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
the controller by about $40 it's cheaper

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.709 
the controller by about $40 it's cheaper
so<00:04:40.199> that's<00:04:40.650> not<00:04:40.860> including<00:04:41.279> tax<00:04:41.490> but<00:04:41.819> yes<00:04:42.479> so

so that's not including tax but yes so

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.510 
so that's not including tax but yes so
it's<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.199> very<00:04:43.409> very<00:04:43.740> nice<00:04:43.949> tablet<00:04:44.279> like
