00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.969
 hello everyone my name is given 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.610
 and today we will talk with you about my 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.860
 a hobby more precisely about one hobby about 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.470
 one thing I'm very sherburn 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.420
 practiced about when I was 8 years old 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.240
 By the way, so to say as a child, I have a lot 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.370
 what did sport and art do 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.310
 today's attention deserves only 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.310
 one thing I went to art school 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.140
 Probably as many children in childhood eat 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.239
 I wanted to become an artist there 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.100
 designer generally learn class 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.100
 draw but for some reason 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.050
 a year later I go to school quit maybe 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.999
 be in Lithuania teachers were heard and 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.399
 such mediocrity as I myself refused 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:54.339
 I also have options from this venture 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.559
 that i was lazy and that i have a simple 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.350
 talents I just decided everything myself 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.420
 enough and strongly recommend this video 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.729
 nervous not to look because in 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.650

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.600

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.090

 subscriber this girl name is Polina and 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.140

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.440

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.380
 smiles parodied young artists 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.260
 for some reason often drew some dishes 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.150
 I do not know why, God, also dishes in 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.340
 childhood apparently loved snowflakes 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.560
 worshiped simply and thought painted them 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.350
 this size and it is not the only 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.080

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.989
 assumptions in the comments and I'm not yet 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.390

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.120
 before starting the next video all 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.610

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.870
 Toucan is he cute guys like 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.060
 would voice you one important to my 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.650
 sight information especially for those who 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.780
 read my ask.fm 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.940
 By the way, there is always a link to it. 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.860
 the description in general was such a situation 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.320
 I wrote a question when will 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.780
 the next video I wrote that video I 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.790
 already mounted and ready to lay out but 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.920
 I 'm waiting for me to cover well or 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.750
 as some others call a preview for that 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.390
 I was generally told that it is a bit 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.620
 strange that the cover I'm not doing myself 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.230
 someone does me 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.239
 and I can tell you something about it 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.060
 now I'm just learning how to work in photoshop 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.700
 I still have almost zero skills and 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.870
 I can not yet do well quality 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.850
 beautiful cover 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.820
 so my very good one helps me 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.829
 here's an example familiar to you cheek and cover 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.200
 if some novice videobloger 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.720
 who watch me liked me 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.670
 work and they are also allowed to learn 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.769
 Only Photoshop work is not ready for yourself 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.350
 do yourself a cover then you can 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.510
 turn to her for help she is to you 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.690
 It will always have a reference to it in 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.890
 description of her contact come in general 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.350
 write from 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.959
 knight but my video is coming to an end and 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.180
 write in the comments as I am an artist 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.040

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.810
