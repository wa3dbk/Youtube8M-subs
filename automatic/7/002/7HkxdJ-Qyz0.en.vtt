00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.010 

the<00:00:01.620> approach<00:00:01.890> at<00:00:02.100> Dance<00:00:02.340> Connection<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:03.300> that

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
the approach at Dance Connection is that

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.170 
the approach at Dance Connection is that
we're<00:00:04.170> not<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> competition<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:05.130> school<00:00:05.430> we've

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
we're not a competition of school we've

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.369 
we're not a competition of school we've
always<00:00:06.390> said<00:00:06.660> we're<00:00:06.839> not<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.990> competition

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
always said we're not a competition

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.650 
always said we're not a competition
school<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:08.790> try<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.000> find<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.450> balance

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
school so we try to find a balance

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.020 
school so we try to find a balance
between<00:00:10.170> allowing<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.400> children<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
between allowing the children and the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.060 
between allowing the children and the
students<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.630> compete<00:00:13.170> because<00:00:13.500> there<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
students to compete because there is a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.340 
students to compete because there is a
love<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.480> there<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
love of that for them and there is a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.950 
love of that for them and there is a
benefit<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.550> them<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.270> being<00:00:18.630> said

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
benefit to that for them that being said

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
benefit to that for them that being said
we<00:00:19.350> also<00:00:19.529> try<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.010> instill<00:00:20.400> strong

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
we also try to instill strong

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.090 
we also try to instill strong
performance<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.750> artistry<00:00:22.230> skills<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.859> all

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
performance and artistry skills and all

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.370 
performance and artistry skills and all
of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> students<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.510> want<00:00:24.869> them<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.080> walk

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
of the students so we want them to walk

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.679 
of the students so we want them to walk
away<00:00:25.740> feeling<00:00:26.279> good<00:00:27.240> about<00:00:27.359> themselves

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
away feeling good about themselves

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.019 
away feeling good about themselves
because<00:00:28.500> everyone<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.070> different<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.519> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
because everyone is different and so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.980 
because everyone is different and so
they're<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> bring<00:00:30.840> their<00:00:30.960> own

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
they're all going to bring their own

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
they're all going to bring their own
individual<00:00:31.740> artistry<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.820> their<00:00:33.059> performance

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
individual artistry to their performance

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.139 
individual artistry to their performance
and<00:00:33.750> their<00:00:34.320> performance<00:00:34.860> may<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and their performance may be on the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.760 
and their performance may be on the
biggest<00:00:36.510> stage<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> may<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
biggest stage or it may be in the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.250 
biggest stage or it may be in the
classroom<00:00:38.090> we<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.270> some<00:00:39.480> great<00:00:39.600> instructors

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
classroom we have some great instructors

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.190 
classroom we have some great instructors
of<00:00:40.410> Dance<00:00:40.590> Connection<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:42.149> would<00:00:42.570> say<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
of Dance Connection and I would say it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
of Dance Connection and I would say it
would<00:00:43.440> probably<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:44.070> difficult<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> find<00:00:44.910> some

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
would probably be difficult to find some

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.630 
would probably be difficult to find some
stronger<00:00:45.450> resumes<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> area<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:47.399> these

making them good people thinking of new

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.300 
making them good people thinking of new
and<00:02:00.390> creative<00:02:00.569> ways<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.289> you<00:02:01.319> can<00:02:01.619> bring

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and creative ways that you can bring

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.789 
and creative ways that you can bring
dance<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.939> your<00:02:03.060> students<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.350> young<00:02:04.560> ones

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
dance to your students the young ones

dance to your students the young ones
sometimes<00:02:05.069> they<00:02:05.700> can't<00:02:05.939> grasp<00:02:06.209> it<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.630> way

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
sometimes they can't grasp it this way

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
sometimes they can't grasp it this way
so<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.439> think<00:02:07.469> well<00:02:08.099> how<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.580> get

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so you have to think well how can I get

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.789 
so you have to think well how can I get
it<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.940> them<00:02:09.119> how<00:02:09.299> can<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.629> understand<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
it to them how can they understand it so

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:11.900 
it to them how can they understand it so
I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.519> have<00:02:11.549> a<00:02:11.640> love<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
I think you have to have a love of

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.729 
I think you have to have a love of
teaching<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.599> it's<00:02:12.989> not<00:02:13.200> for<00:02:13.319> everyone<00:02:13.590> I

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
making friends learning as much as you

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.809 
making friends learning as much as you
can<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.790> just<00:03:51.910> having<00:03:52.450> fun<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:53.099> think<00:03:54.099> it's<00:03:54.640> a

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
can and just having fun I think it's a

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.819 
can and just having fun I think it's a
good<00:03:55.000> place<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.510> feel<00:03:55.720> embraced<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.410> loved

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
good place to feel embraced and loved

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.030 
good place to feel embraced and loved
for<00:03:57.160> who<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:58.000> are<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.390> what<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.900> bring<00:03:59.040> even

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
for who you are and what you bring even

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.559 
for who you are and what you bring even
though<00:04:00.160> it's<00:04:00.340> different<00:04:00.790> from<00:04:00.880> everyone<00:04:01.239> else

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
though it's different from everyone else

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.300 
though it's different from everyone else
I<00:04:01.840> don't<00:04:02.650> think<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.150> can<00:04:04.180> get<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:05.310> just

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
I don't think that you can get that just

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.379 
I don't think that you can get that just
anywhere<00:04:06.989> being<00:04:07.989> loved<00:04:08.260> for<00:04:08.560> who<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.829> are<00:04:09.040> and

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
anywhere being loved for who you are and

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.470 
anywhere being loved for who you are and
being<00:04:10.389> supported<00:04:11.079> for<00:04:11.769> who<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:12.040> are<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.480> I

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
being supported for who you are and I

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.750 
being supported for who you are and I
think<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:14.049> every<00:04:15.010> kid<00:04:15.239> deserves<00:04:16.239> that
