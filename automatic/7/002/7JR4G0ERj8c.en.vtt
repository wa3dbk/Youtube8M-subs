you can't handle fans move on accept the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.279 
you can't handle fans move on accept the
truth<00:00:16.800> get<00:00:17.460> out<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.730> your<00:00:17.850> denial<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:19.170> guys

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
truth get out of your denial you guys

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.349 
truth get out of your denial you guys
live<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> past<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.369> expect<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
live in the past and expect that the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
live in the past and expect that the
future<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> present<00:00:22.199> isn't<00:00:22.619> supposed<00:00:23.039> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
future and the present isn't supposed to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.620 
future and the present isn't supposed to
be<00:00:23.189> better<00:00:23.490> oh<00:00:23.789> whoa

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
be better oh whoa

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.390 
be better oh whoa
it<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it was like this back then so it

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220 
it was like this back then so it
shouldn't<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.849> better<00:00:27.060> now<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.900> happens

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
shouldn't be better now but what happens

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
shouldn't be better now but what happens

about game programming the CPU is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.950 
about game programming the CPU is
welfare<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.369> CPU<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.909> trash<00:01:24.210> people

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
welfare the CPU is trash people

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.140 
welfare the CPU is trash people
there's<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> reason<00:01:25.710> while<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> GPGPU<00:01:26.759> has<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
there's a reason while the GPGPU has to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.910 
there's a reason while the GPGPU has to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
offload tasks on to it because the CPU

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.810 
offload tasks on to it because the CPU
itself<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:30.119> capable<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.960> handling<00:01:31.829> it

just<00:01:33.060> isn't<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.140> isn't<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.729> want<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
just isn't it just isn't so you want to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.499 
just isn't it just isn't so you want to
compare<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.439> Wii<00:01:37.680> U<00:01:37.890> CPU<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.790> cell<00:01:39.150> saying
