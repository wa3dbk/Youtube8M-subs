00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
here thing that I don't like about it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 
here thing that I don't like about it
though<00:01:08.220> when<00:01:08.820> looking<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.240> new<00:01:09.479> bull<00:01:09.689> jars

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
though when looking at new bull jars

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
though when looking at new bull jars
that<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.290> doesn't<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that it doesn't have like you can

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570 
that it doesn't have like you can
actually<00:01:12.240> take<00:01:12.450> off<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> filter<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:13.409> um<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
actually take off the filter which um I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330 
actually take off the filter which um I
think<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.840> better<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.979> cleanliness

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
think it's better just for cleanliness

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
think it's better just for cleanliness
and<00:01:17.729> whatnot<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.290> usually

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
of the twenty percent moisture in my

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.630 
of the twenty percent moisture in my
hair<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.570> left<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.829> shaping<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.460> hair

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
hair is left for really shaping the hair

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
hair is left for really shaping the hair
straightening<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> hair<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
straightening the hair this is really

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.900 
straightening the hair this is really
just<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.920> curls<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.090> gonna<00:02:09.179> kick<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
just the curls are gonna kick in and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.080 
just the curls are gonna kick in and
that's<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.840> doesn't<00:02:12.900> make<00:02:13.590> my<00:02:13.770> hair

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
that's it so it doesn't make my hair

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.010 
that's it so it doesn't make my hair
straight<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.690> hair<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.870> not

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
straight because my hair is not

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.600 
straight because my hair is not
naturally<00:02:16.440> straight<00:02:16.680> what<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.400> does

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
naturally straight what it really does

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.420 
naturally straight what it really does
just<00:02:17.910> tries<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.660> quicker<00:02:19.260> than<00:02:19.620> air-drying<00:02:19.920> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
just tries it quicker than air-drying it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.360 
just tries it quicker than air-drying it
