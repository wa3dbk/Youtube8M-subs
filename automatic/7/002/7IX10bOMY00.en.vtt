00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.690
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:13.679
 Problem 719 find the area of ​​the square with 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.070
 15 centimeters per page 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.410
 textbook 109 there is a formula area 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 square 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 it is highlighted in blue but in my 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.449
 tutorial blue your can be 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.900
 in a different color and this is how it looks 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.650
 the area of ​​the square is the side of the square in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.260
 square 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:41.030
 in the second degree and so we have 2 squares 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.570
 15 centimeters to find the area 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.050
 use the square formula 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:54.860
 instead of side and substitute 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:59.010
 15 centimeters and square it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:03.570
 what is squared squared in 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.960
 second degree it means multiply by itself 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.600
 on itself that is 15 centimeters in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.490
 square it means you need 15 centimeters 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.330
 multiply by 15 centimeters 15 multiply 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.470
 at 15 it will be two hundred and twenty five 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.030
 centimeters multiplied by centimeter and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 will be centimeters squared if its 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 have already solved the problem 650 second then you 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.180
 already have a table of squares and you can 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 see the square of the desired number 15 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.500
 square 225 if not then you need to consider 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.170
 column 15 must be multiplied by 15 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:51.060
 column 5 by 5 25 5 we write two in mind 5 on 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:56.399
 15 and two more per month 71 for 5 is 5 and 1 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:01.259
 on 1 this is 1 here 57 to 512 2 we write 1 in 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.509
 mind and 1 to 1 in mind is two 225 of this 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.350
 the answer is two hundred twenty five centimeters 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.380
 square 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.130
 this is a square with a side of 15 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.600
 centimeters that's such a problem 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.830
 My name is Andrew Andreevich My site 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.720
 all point dot ru 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.850
 please write in the comments on 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.940
 How much is clear if you decide 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.430
 like my videos on advise friends 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.430
 classmate on this all all bye
