of<00:00:12.059> people<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> wrong<00:00:13.290> leaders<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.130> my

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
of people have the wrong leaders in my

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.519 
of people have the wrong leaders in my
opinion<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.630> official<00:00:16.049> pike

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
opinion on on one official pike

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.130 
opinion on on one official pike
they<00:00:16.710> use<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.310> light<00:00:17.550> tippet<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.810> they<00:00:18.990> don't

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
they use to light tippet so they don't

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.620 
they use to light tippet so they don't
really<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> Flies<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.039> turn<00:00:20.400> over<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.570> I'm

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
really get the Flies to turn over so I'm

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.120 
really get the Flies to turn over so I'm
just<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> show<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.199> very<00:00:22.289> quickly<00:00:22.560> and

just going to show you very quickly and
tell<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.519> how<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.029> how<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> make<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> loops

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
tell you how to how to make the loops

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.700 
tell you how to how to make the loops
and<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.490> rig<00:00:26.880> my<00:00:27.240> rods<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.779> use<00:00:29.179> these<00:00:30.710> salmon

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and how I rig my rods I use these salmon

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.250 
and how I rig my rods I use these salmon
leaders<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.030> 12<00:00:33.540> where<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.020> also

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
leaders these are 12 where you can also

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.520 
leaders these are 12 where you can also
buy<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.860> 15<00:00:35.100> feet<00:00:35.610> long<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
buy them in 15 feet long so this is a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.590 
buy them in 15 feet long so this is a
12-foot<00:00:38.070> leader<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.739> we're<00:00:40.739> gonna<00:00:41.450> put<00:00:42.450> this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
12-foot leader and we're gonna put this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.260 
12-foot leader and we're gonna put this
leader<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> slow-mo<00:00:43.700> this<00:00:44.700> line<00:00:44.910> we've<00:00:45.090> been

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
leader on a slow-mo this line we've been

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
leader on a slow-mo this line we've been
fishing<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.800> what<00:00:46.920> we're<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> do

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
fishing a lot so what we're going to do

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.959 
fishing a lot so what we're going to do
is<00:00:47.579> we're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.030> use<00:00:49.430> both<00:00:50.430> section<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
is we're going to use both section of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.860 
is we're going to use both section of
this<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> floating<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.420> an

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this and for a floating and an

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.220 
this and for a floating and an
intermediate<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.059> a<00:00:57.059> slow-mo<00:00:57.780> line<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
intermediate and a slow-mo line I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.219 
intermediate and a slow-mo line I
usually<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.399> around<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.890> meter<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:03.750> meter<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
usually use around a meter of a meter a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.510 
usually use around a meter of a meter a
meter<00:01:04.500> 10<00:01:05.330> of<00:01:06.439> leader<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.070> lawn<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.340> this

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
meter 10 of leader on my lawn like this

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
meter 10 of leader on my lawn like this
and<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> bot<00:01:09.720> section<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.500> it's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and I use the bot section because it's

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.440 
and I use the bot section because it's
much<00:01:10.860> much<00:01:11.040> stiffer<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.030> turns<00:01:12.299> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
much much stiffer so it really turns to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
much much stiffer so it really turns to
flies<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> make<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
flies so what you do is you make a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.359 
flies so what you do is you make a
perfection<00:01:14.909> loop<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> end<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:16.369> this

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
perfection loop on the end of this this

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.539 
perfection loop on the end of this this
is<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:17.759> easy<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.180> find<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.570> YouTube<00:01:18.900> just

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
is really easy to find on YouTube just

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.929 
is really easy to find on YouTube just
make<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> loop<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.280> pull<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
make a loop like that and you pull that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.850 
make a loop like that and you pull that
up

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.100 

and<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.940> tighten<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.420> can<00:01:28.570> put<00:01:28.690> something<00:01:28.900> in

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
and to tighten you can put something in

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.020 
and to tighten you can put something in
here<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.440> really<00:01:31.290> make<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.440> tight<00:01:33.030> when

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
here and really make it tight when

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.760 
here and really make it tight when
you're<00:01:34.150> made<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.480> knot<00:01:34.750> correctly<00:01:35.440> like<00:01:35.590> this

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
you're made a knot correctly like this

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.970 
you're made a knot correctly like this
it<00:01:36.730> will<00:01:36.910> be<00:01:37.120> a<00:01:37.300> 90<00:01:37.510> degrees<00:01:37.900> angle<00:01:38.140> on<00:01:38.530> the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
it will be a 90 degrees angle on the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.700 
it will be a 90 degrees angle on the
existing<00:01:39.610> tip<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:39.940> like<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:41.530> cut

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
existing tip that like that you can cut

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.890 
existing tip that like that you can cut
it<00:01:41.830> pretty<00:01:42.010> tight<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:43.120> we'll<00:01:43.240> put<00:01:43.480> it<00:01:43.570> into

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
it pretty tight and we'll put it into

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.810 
it pretty tight and we'll put it into
the<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.860> loop<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.310> fly<00:01:45.490> line<00:01:45.670> like

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
the to the loop of the fly line like

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.340 
the to the loop of the fly line like
that<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.360> we'll<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.540> loop<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.230> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
that and we'll just loop it on to the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.630 
that and we'll just loop it on to the
other<00:01:53.500> one<00:01:53.680> here<00:01:58.800> pull<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.830> tight<00:02:00.100> like<00:02:00.130> this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
other one here pull it tight like this

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.500 
other one here pull it tight like this
that's<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.510> meter<00:02:02.050> 10<00:02:02.440> like<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.330> make

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
that's a meter 10 like that so we make

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.430 
that's a meter 10 like that so we make
another<00:02:04.720> perfection<00:02:05.260> loop<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:08.110> then<00:02:08.260> you're

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
another perfection loop so then you're

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.109 
another perfection loop so then you're
good<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.619> go

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
good to go

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.050 
good to go
and<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.980> just<00:02:12.930> loop<00:02:13.930> your

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and what you do is you just loop your

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.910 
and what you do is you just loop your
you're<00:02:16.060> tipping<00:02:16.750> material<00:02:17.140> here<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.709> while

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you're tipping material here your while

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.170 
you're tipping material here your while
here<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.470> pull<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.800> fly<00:02:21.010> through<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
here and you pull the fly through and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.760 
here and you pull the fly through and
also<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> good<00:02:25.720> thing<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.260> when<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.530> pull

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
also a good thing here is when you pull

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.470 
also a good thing here is when you pull
this<00:02:26.920> over<00:02:27.220> don't<00:02:27.730> pull<00:02:27.940> them<00:02:28.090> tight<00:02:28.270> like

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
this over don't pull them tight like

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.530 
this over don't pull them tight like
this<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.840> fold<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.440> wire<00:02:29.740> over<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.310> this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
this and fold this wire over like this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.960 
this and fold this wire over like this
so<00:02:31.540> they<00:02:31.660> loop<00:02:31.840> them<00:02:32.080> like<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.880> then<00:02:33.880> you

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
so they loop them like that then you

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.340 
so they loop them like that then you
will<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.390> wire<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.690> won't<00:02:37.690> fray<00:02:38.019> it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
will have the wire and you won't fray it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.500 
will have the wire and you won't fray it
won't<00:02:38.590> break<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.340> loop<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.790> it'll<00:02:39.970> also<00:02:40.180> want

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
won't break the loop and it'll also want

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.690 
won't break the loop and it'll also want
chink<00:02:41.019> up<00:02:41.200> here<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:42.070> when<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.250> want<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.489> change

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
chink up here so when you want to change

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.750 
chink up here so when you want to change
the<00:02:43.000> flag<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.720> push<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.230> up<00:02:44.410> as

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
the flag and you just push this up as

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.759 
the flag and you just push this up as
easy<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.850> change<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:46.930> don't

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
easy to change it like that so don't

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.920 
easy to change it like that so don't
pull<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.070> tight<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.060> fold<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.780> loop

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
pull it tight like this fold the loop

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.090 
pull it tight like this fold the loop
over<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.820> you're<00:02:51.820> good<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.060> go

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
over and you're good to go

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.570 
over and you're good to go
so<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.280> length<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.880> leader<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.450> now<00:02:55.690> probably

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
so that length of leader is now probably

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.430 
so that length of leader is now probably
a<00:02:57.580> total<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.360> one<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> half<00:02:58.690> meters<00:02:59.170> and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
a total of one and a half meters and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.220 
a total of one and a half meters and
that<00:02:59.950> will<00:03:00.100> really<00:03:00.489> make<00:03:00.790> these<00:03:01.030> flies<00:03:01.330> that

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
that will really make these flies that

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.800 
that will really make these flies that
are<00:03:02.350> 20<00:03:02.739> 25<00:03:03.190> centimeters<00:03:03.760> turn<00:03:04.480> out<00:03:04.630> really

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
are 20 25 centimeters turn out really

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.040 
are 20 25 centimeters turn out really
well<00:03:05.080> are<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:06.070> fishing<00:03:06.280> us<00:03:06.600> like<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> sink

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
well are you fishing us like a sink

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.110 
well are you fishing us like a sink
three-line<00:03:08.440> or<00:03:08.650> sink<00:03:08.980> five<00:03:09.250> or<00:03:09.430> even<00:03:09.459> faster

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
three-line or sink five or even faster

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.540 
three-line or sink five or even faster
sink<00:03:10.690> lines<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.500> need<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.830> use<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> shorter

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
sink lines you need to use a shorter

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.100 
sink lines you need to use a shorter
leader<00:03:12.730> because<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.360> need<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.660> get<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.900> Flies

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
leader because you need to get the Flies

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.199 
leader because you need to get the Flies
down<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:15.070> if<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.250> have<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> long<00:03:15.640> leader<00:03:15.910> you

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
down so if you have a long leader you

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.699 
down so if you have a long leader you
will<00:03:16.300> just<00:03:16.450> have<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.750> fly<00:03:16.959> come<00:03:17.320> up<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
will just have the fly come up to the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.030 
will just have the fly come up to the
surface<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.019> basic<00:03:20.440> length<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:20.980> a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
surface so this is the basic length of a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.520 
surface so this is the basic length of a
leader<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:22.000> go<00:03:22.150> floating<00:03:22.870> intermediate

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
leader if you go floating intermediate

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.710 
leader if you go floating intermediate
or<00:03:23.680> slow<00:03:23.890> mo<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.190> if<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.790> go<00:03:24.940> sink<00:03:25.209> three<00:03:25.420> sink

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
or slow mo and if you go sink three sink

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.199 
or slow mo and if you go sink three sink
five<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.110> faster<00:03:26.470> make<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.130> shorter<00:03:27.489> up<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.880> 30

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
five and faster make it shorter up to 30

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.020 
five and faster make it shorter up to 30
35<00:03:28.450> centimeters<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.350> nylon<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:29.920> as<00:03:30.549> short<00:03:30.850> as

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
35 centimeters of nylon and as short as

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.220 
35 centimeters of nylon and as short as
possible<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.750> want<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.019> get<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
possible because you want to get the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.289 
possible because you want to get the
Flyers<00:03:32.470> down<00:03:32.739> that's<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.400> whole<00:03:33.880> idea<00:03:34.209> of

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
Flyers down that's the whole idea of

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.700 
Flyers down that's the whole idea of
leader<00:03:34.740> so<00:03:35.740> good<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:36.580> go
