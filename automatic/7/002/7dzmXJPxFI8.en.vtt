00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.150

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.540
 lived trefoil ok let's talk about this 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.130
 city in real life so nothing 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.350

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.990

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.180
 the amount of the 500 likes in an hour 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.790

 gt5 online without further commencing many of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.130
 you will remember sanders ok is for 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.530
 this small town because they lived there 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.739
 truly true many will remember it and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.360
 as you will know this city at 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.579
 principle was said to be a mystery 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.760
 that this city really did not exist 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.370
 but in real life if it exists ok yes 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.820
 there is this urss sandwich 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.280
 apparently sanders was inspired by 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.049
 bombay bits that is located 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.850
 forn ya ok right now I'll be watching 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.590
 some images of bombay beach ok 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.320
 california obviously got some 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.990
 images and exactly there is a video 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.670
 where are they in this town this 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.820
 is in a car and passing and is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.170
 recording the houses and such obviously this 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.210
 place they're recording it obviously 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.759
 I will leave the video in the description because 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.619
 the truth is very, very similar to the 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.049
 saint georges del getafe 5 achieve is 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.750
 incredible this city is total could be 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.250
 say that it is obviously obviously and therefore 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.890
 the truth is that it is very beautiful very nice 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.210
 I liked this city a lot 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.750
 bombay beach because it really is 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.110
 totally equal to that of sanders 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.840
 now the town is abandoned 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.399
 that is abandoned and they look at the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.460
 video game also has the same 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.100
 aspect not saint georges also has 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.990
 an aspect that is abandoned and therefore 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.479
 it's very similar even in those similar 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.399
 they are totally identical is serious is 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.179
 incredible the resemblance they have to 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.970
 bombay beach and sanli source the truth the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.350
 like it's amazing I do not want that 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.440
 you also make a comparison 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.510
 obviously with seniors 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.880
 and bombay bitch you will obviously have 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.190
 the link of the bombay vision video make 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.660
 a tour of my beach where 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.480
 they will notice the great similarity that 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.900
 they have and others themselves can already compare 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.040
 with that video then with so many 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.820
 comparisons we could already say that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.710
 sanders was based on bombay bits not the 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.180
