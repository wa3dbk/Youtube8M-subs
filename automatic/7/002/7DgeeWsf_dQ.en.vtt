 [Music] 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.180
 Today I'm going to teach how to make claws. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:26.500
 made of paper 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:29.170
 [Music] 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:36.410
 good for us 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:40.850
 do this double here we 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.620
 we need to have a sheet a4 that solved 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.510
 to print and with a sheet we 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.000
 we need to make a grab and a 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.309
 folding very simple then start boot 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.020
 good to begin you 'll get this 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.110
 tip here and the line to this side here 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.110
 like this 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.380
 [Music] 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 and this triangle will stay chem after 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 go get this tip here it will take until 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 another side here to see if we sings 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.850
 here to not go wrong is also it goes 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.850
 stay there, I'll give you a house here 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.460
 [Applause] 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.680
 good then you'll turn the paper 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:45.030
 and will double that point so far 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:49.850
 way to make them straight 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.850
 here and said the same thing on the other side 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.520
 will stay that format here 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 We'll fold after that, it 's a sock. 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 and this way here and even weave and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:17.910
 aligning with this corner here I will give 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:21.030
 one focused here and it will be 5 that 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.620
 say cut in the field and then with him to 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.739
 inside you will bend like this 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.070
 like the one written better here like this 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.070
 yea 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.330
 [Music] 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 The good thing is that some of us say important 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.480
 if you want to make the grab hand 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.580
 right 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.319
 You will get your right end here if 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.610
 You want to make h to the left goes 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.069
 use this one left 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.870
 This is just so you can differentiate later. 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.940
 So, let's just say what I want to do. 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.890
 Then I'll double here if you 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.150
 left side only take 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.250
 so beauty 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.250
 so look how you going to get this side here 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.520
 and fold it to the line with the bush that 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.370
 you have between now this one that 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.460
 way 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.460
 [Music] 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:23.650
 like this and that way you'll have it 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:28.180
 so it raises that file part of that 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.489
 way and turns back and see it for here 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.970
 cocoa was a person not all 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:39.099
 operators 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.099
 [Music] 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.900
 I used to be a type of silicone that I 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.650
 You'll make us have to put 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.190
 I will never focus on this point here 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.370
 inside this space we have here said 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.920
 this space that is what you are going to do 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.690
 leave it normal as it was before 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.890
 doubles right here in one single owner 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.040
 because that way you better go 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.260
 open then you already have the mark here O 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.860
 and now you fold even to that side 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.540
 here it is now unmarked this way 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.760
 I'll do it at the table that 's best to 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.820
 I 'll stay this way then. 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.930
 like closing it again like this 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.930
 we put it in there 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.450
 and then all the folding said that it is 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.000
 ready the first bottle there you 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:47.730
 will open this triangle will open it 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.100
 will put his finger to a one say 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.540
 the inside of the head to give 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.930
 space and and here it is done now you just 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.490
 need to do the other four do not 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.360
 I finished doing the other four 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.900
 [Music] 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.750
 I recommend you first and be 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.110
 do because you use more to handle than 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.120
 will tell first so goes to this 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.320
 that goes more or less until this 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.760
 another here from the finger 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.490
 So you're going to go this way this way. 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.710
 you vote the second finger 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:34.830
 so the third 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.720
 this way the fourth finger and the big toe 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.250
 It's a bit complicated because it's 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.290
 bigger then it is a little more paper 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.890
 here then you do not worry much that it is 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.260
 good 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.470
 as you can see that it the mass 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.810
 quite the tip of a knot 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.320
 and that's how it is here you can 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.390
 To see very cool, I really liked it. 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.700
 a very simple donor to be made 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:02.740
 well, that's it guys so this is it 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.050
 I hope you guys liked it. 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.820
 If you liked click I liked I'm more 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.260
 are still favorites and share 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.130
