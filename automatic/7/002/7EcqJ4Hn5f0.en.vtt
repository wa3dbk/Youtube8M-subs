from a blue to that generation xss the
visual<00:06:04.110> indication<00:06:04.590> straight<00:06:04.770> up<00:06:04.889> it<00:06:04.979> is<00:06:05.270> so

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
visual indication straight up it is so

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
can see we have cold ocean a is 2 point

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.900 
can see we have cold ocean a is 2 point
0<00:06:12.479> 0<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:13.020> B<00:06:13.320> is<00:06:13.620> 2<00:06:13.889> point<00:06:14.130> 0<00:06:14.250> 0

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
0 0 and B is 2 point 0 0

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.060 
0 0 and B is 2 point 0 0
yeah<00:06:15.120> that's<00:06:15.419> exactly<00:06:15.630> what<00:06:16.050> idea<00:06:16.349> of<00:06:16.860> me

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
yeah that's exactly what idea of me

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.610 
yeah that's exactly what idea of me
cannot<00:06:17.910> the<00:06:18.060> associates<00:06:18.510> excellence<00:06:19.349> came

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
cannot the associates excellence came

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.029 
cannot the associates excellence came
with<00:06:20.370> that<00:06:20.550> up<00:06:20.669> there<00:06:20.849> so<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:21.479> wasn't<00:06:22.110> no

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
with that up there so that wasn't no

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.080 
with that up there so that wasn't no
actually<00:06:23.639> it's<00:06:23.760> a<00:06:24.770> surprisingly

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
actually it's a surprisingly

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.540 
actually it's a surprisingly
straightforward

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
straightforward

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.080 
straightforward
