off first thing that has happened with

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.959 
off first thing that has happened with
the<00:00:31.170> system<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> i<00:00:31.800> decided<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> stop<00:00:32.730> using

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the system is i decided to stop using

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.310 
the system is i decided to stop using
synthetic<00:00:33.980> salt<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:36.120> couple<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.690> months<00:00:36.930> ago<00:00:37.020> or

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
synthetic salt a couple of months ago or

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.770 
synthetic salt a couple of months ago or
so<00:00:37.500> eight<00:00:37.860> weeks<00:00:38.100> ago<00:00:38.370> i<00:00:38.579> decided<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.660> i

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so eight weeks ago i decided that i

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
so eight weeks ago i decided that i
wanted<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> start<00:00:40.440> doing<00:00:40.860> water<00:00:41.219> changes<00:00:41.309> on

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
wanted to start doing water changes on

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.420 
wanted to start doing water changes on
the<00:00:41.969> system<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.190> in<00:00:44.190> doing<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:46.340> wanted<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the system and in doing so I wanted to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
the system and in doing so I wanted to
try<00:00:47.520> something<00:00:47.700> different<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> did

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
try something different and what I did

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.650 
try something different and what I did
was<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.770> stopped<00:00:50.129> using<00:00:50.399> instant<00:00:51.180> ocean<00:00:51.480> reef

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
was I stopped using instant ocean reef

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.310 
was I stopped using instant ocean reef
crystals<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.430> I<00:00:53.430> did<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:53.910> research<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.629> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
crystals and I did some research and I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.310 
crystals and I did some research and I
found<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.680> there's<00:00:55.890> actually<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:57.320> Marine

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
found that there's actually a Marine

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830

also using the kent marine essential

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.389 
also using the kent marine essential
elements<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.890> working<00:01:53.220> well<00:01:53.369> for

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
elements and this was working well for

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.020 
elements and this was working well for
me<00:01:53.780> but<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:56.009> being<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.460> busy<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.909> was

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
me but with with being so busy it was

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
me but with with being so busy it was
just<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.390> hard<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.719> me<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> keep<00:01:58.110> things

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
just really hard for me to keep things

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.609 
just really hard for me to keep things
stable<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.040> by<00:01:59.880> doing<00:02:00.659> my<00:02:00.899> water<00:02:01.140> changes

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
stable and by doing my water changes

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.999 
stable and by doing my water changes
weekly<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.670> filtered<00:02:03.270> saltwater<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.079> haven't

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
weekly with filtered saltwater I haven't

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.770 
weekly with filtered saltwater I haven't
had<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> dose<00:02:05.520> during<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> week<00:02:06.299> my

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
had to dose during the week my

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.960 
had to dose during the week my
parameters<00:02:07.320> stay<00:02:08.179> consistent

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
parameters stay consistent

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.820 
parameters stay consistent
and<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:10.899> makes<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.260> little<00:02:11.380> bit<00:02:11.500> easier

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
and it just makes it a little bit easier

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.880 
and it just makes it a little bit easier
on<00:02:11.860> me<00:02:12.100> throughout<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.030> week<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:14.560> all<00:02:14.710> that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
on me throughout the week with all that

one quarter horse power jbj and the way

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.100 
one quarter horse power jbj and the way
it<00:04:34.169> works<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.620> it'll<00:04:35.610> give<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.330> temperature

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
it works is it'll give you a temperature

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.790 
it works is it'll give you a temperature
that<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:39.360> put<00:04:39.570> into<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.870> plus<00:04:40.290> or<00:04:40.440> minus<00:04:40.710> a

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
that you put into it plus or minus a

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.330 
that you put into it plus or minus a
degree<00:04:41.100> what<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:41.820> mean<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:43.860> for

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
degree what I mean is is that you for

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.280 
degree what I mean is is that you for
instance<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.790> set<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.210> temperature<00:04:45.510> for<00:04:45.870> 77

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
instance I set the temperature for 77

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.840 
instance I set the temperature for 77
degrees<00:04:46.530> because<00:04:46.950> it's<00:04:47.250> kind<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.610> sweet

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
degrees because it's kind of the sweet

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.210 
degrees because it's kind of the sweet
spot<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.330> what<00:04:49.110> will<00:04:49.200> happen<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.620> as<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
spot and what will happen is as the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.840 
spot and what will happen is as the
temperature<00:04:50.639> rises<00:04:50.669> in<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.210> tank<00:04:51.510> 280<00:04:52.850> excuse

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
temperature rises in the tank 280 excuse

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.320 
temperature rises in the tank 280 excuse
me<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.350> 78.1<00:04:55.350> degrees<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.639> chiller<00:04:56.910> will<00:04:57.090> kick

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
me to 78.1 degrees the chiller will kick

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.900 
me to 78.1 degrees the chiller will kick
on<00:04:57.500> it'll<00:04:58.500> instantly<00:04:58.919> drop<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.460> temperature

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
on it'll instantly drop the temperature

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.690 
on it'll instantly drop the temperature
one<00:05:00.570> degree<00:05:00.680> within<00:05:01.680> like<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:01.979> first<00:05:02.100> three

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
one degree within like the first three

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.659 
one degree within like the first three
minutes<00:05:02.850> or<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.680> then<00:05:04.680> within<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.460> next

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
minutes or so and then within the next

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.230 
minutes or so and then within the next
15<00:05:06.240> or<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:06.720> will<00:05:06.810> bring<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.139> down<00:05:07.350> to<00:05:08.240> 76

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
15 or so it will bring it down to 76

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
15 or so it will bring it down to 76
degrees<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.550> when<00:05:11.550> it's<00:05:11.669> hit<00:05:12.000> 76<00:05:12.660> degrees<00:05:13.020> it

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
degrees and when it's hit 76 degrees it

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.100 
degrees and when it's hit 76 degrees it
kicks<00:05:13.590> off<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.099> then<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:15.090> usually<00:05:15.300> returns<00:05:15.840> to

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
kicks off and then it usually returns to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.219 
kicks off and then it usually returns to
77<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.010> hangs<00:05:17.520> out<00:05:17.729> there<00:05:17.910> for<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> while<00:05:18.330> the

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
77 and hangs out there for a while the

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.870 
77 and hangs out there for a while the
reason<00:05:19.530> for<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.740> is<00:05:19.919> so<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.490> your<00:05:20.639> chiller

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
reason for this is so that your chiller

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.700 
reason for this is so that your chiller
isn't<00:05:21.210> kicking<00:05:21.419> on<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:21.930> off<00:05:22.020> on<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.289> off<00:05:22.470> and

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
isn't kicking on and off on and off and

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.400 
isn't kicking on and off on and off and
some<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.639> you<00:05:23.729> might<00:05:23.849> think<00:05:24.090> well<00:05:24.330> two<00:05:25.050> degrees

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
some of you might think well two degrees

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.900 
some of you might think well two degrees
you<00:05:25.650> know<00:05:25.740> that's<00:05:25.979> not<00:05:26.099> very<00:05:26.280> stable<00:05:26.580> for

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
you know that's not very stable for

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.240 
you know that's not very stable for
temperature<00:05:27.300> well<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:28.470> reefs<00:05:28.680> in<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.919> wild

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
temperature well the reefs in the wild

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.820 
temperature well the reefs in the wild
they<00:05:30.090> fluctuate<00:05:30.389> roughly<00:05:31.169> that<00:05:31.320> much<00:05:31.590> between

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
they fluctuate roughly that much between

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.589 
they fluctuate roughly that much between
night<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:32.729> day<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.979> two<00:05:34.979> degrees<00:05:35.599> isn't

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
night and day and two degrees isn't

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:37.820 
night and day and two degrees isn't
going<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:36.780> affect<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.080> corals<00:05:37.410> it's<00:05:37.590> kind<00:05:37.770> of

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
going to affect the corals it's kind of

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.140 
going to affect the corals it's kind of
what<00:05:37.979> they<00:05:38.070> were<00:05:38.130> used<00:05:38.310> to<00:05:38.400> in<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.729> natural

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
what they were used to in the natural

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.600 
what they were used to in the natural
environment<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:40.530> chiller<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:40.860> really<00:05:41.340> quiet

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
environment the chiller is really quiet

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.960 
environment the chiller is really quiet
and<00:05:41.789> it<00:05:42.780> doesn't<00:05:43.440> run<00:05:43.560> for<00:05:43.830> more<00:05:43.979> than<00:05:44.039> 20

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
and it doesn't run for more than 20

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.670 
and it doesn't run for more than 20
minutes<00:05:45.150> or<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.389> when<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:45.750> kicks<00:05:45.960> on<00:05:46.139> every<00:05:46.650> a

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
minutes or so when it kicks on every a

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.290 
minutes or so when it kicks on every a
couple<00:05:47.190> hours<00:05:48.710> so<00:05:49.710> moving<00:05:49.919> up<00:05:50.130> here<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:51.270> can

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
couple hours so moving up here you can

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.779 
couple hours so moving up here you can
take<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.539> quick<00:05:51.780> look<00:05:51.960> at<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.200> tank<00:05:52.410> here<00:05:52.789> what

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
take a quick look at the tank here what

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.200 
take a quick look at the tank here what
you're<00:05:53.940> going<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.180> see<00:05:54.330> is<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:56.250> most

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
you're going to see is that the most

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.930 
you're going to see is that the most
notably<00:05:57.599> is<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:57.840> Rose<00:05:58.020> Bowl<00:05:58.229> tip<00:05:58.500> anemones

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
notably is the Rose Bowl tip anemones

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.460 
notably is the Rose Bowl tip anemones
have<00:05:59.940> turned<00:06:00.300> pink

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
have turned pink

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.740 
have turned pink
you<00:06:01.860> know<00:06:01.950> this<00:06:02.190> isn't<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:03.330> best<00:06:03.510> of<00:06:03.720> things

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
you know this isn't the best of things

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.650 
you know this isn't the best of things
what's<00:06:04.230> happening<00:06:04.620> is<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:05.540> anemones<00:06:06.540> were

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
what's happening is the anemones were

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.110 
what's happening is the anemones were
very<00:06:06.930> stressed<00:06:07.290> out<00:06:07.500> from<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:08.120> high

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
very stressed out from the high

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.120 
very stressed out from the high
temperatures<00:06:09.690> in<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.960> system<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:10.950> is

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
temperatures in the system and this is

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.150 
temperatures in the system and this is
what<00:06:11.280> occurs<00:06:11.580> due<00:06:12.420> philias<00:06:12.810> are<00:06:12.960> also<00:06:13.170> highly

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
what occurs due philias are also highly

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.090 
what occurs due philias are also highly
susceptible<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.940> this<00:06:15.060> as<00:06:15.240> well<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:16.100> they

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
susceptible to this as well and they

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.710 
susceptible to this as well and they
lost<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.670> lot<00:06:17.850> of<00:06:17.880> their<00:06:18.060> color<00:06:18.300> but<00:06:18.570> they're

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
lost a lot of their color but they're

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.400 
lost a lot of their color but they're
still<00:06:18.810> eating<00:06:19.080> and<00:06:19.640> hopefully<00:06:20.640> with<00:06:21.090> the

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
still eating and hopefully with the

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.380 
still eating and hopefully with the
stable<00:06:22.430> temperature<00:06:23.430> within<00:06:23.670> the<00:06:23.940> acceptable

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
stable temperature within the acceptable

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.050 
stable temperature within the acceptable
range<00:06:24.480> will<00:06:25.050> help<00:06:25.290> them<00:06:25.470> recover<00:06:25.850> and<00:06:26.850> as<00:06:26.970> you

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
range will help them recover and as you

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.590 
range will help them recover and as you
can<00:06:27.210> see<00:06:27.240> to<00:06:27.540> the<00:06:28.040> gold<00:06:29.040> torch<00:06:29.340> down<00:06:29.550> there<00:06:29.850> is

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
can see to the gold torch down there is

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.180 
can see to the gold torch down there is
actually<00:06:30.960> getting<00:06:31.140> washed<00:06:31.380> out<00:06:31.680> because<00:06:32.010> it's

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
actually getting washed out because it's

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.510 
actually getting washed out because it's
so<00:06:32.430> wide<00:06:32.670> it<00:06:32.880> has<00:06:33.000> a<00:06:33.030> little<00:06:33.300> bit<00:06:33.510> of<00:06:34.520> orange

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
so wide it has a little bit of orange

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.490 
so wide it has a little bit of orange
left<00:06:35.820> in<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.150> most<00:06:36.570> of<00:06:36.720> the<00:06:36.780> dark<00:06:36.930> or<00:06:37.140> pigments

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500
