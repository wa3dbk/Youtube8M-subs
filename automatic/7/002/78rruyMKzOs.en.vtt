00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.240 
missing a penalty shot back in 2012 so
basically<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.110> getting<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.890> think

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
basically what I'm getting to is I think

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.620 
basically what I'm getting to is I think
that<00:01:50.369> Colombia<00:01:50.790> has<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> real<00:01:51.180> shot<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.450> taking

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that Colombia has a real shot at taking

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510 
that Colombia has a real shot at taking
this<00:01:51.869> match<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.409> leaving<00:01:52.860> Brazil<00:01:52.979> short<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
this match and leaving Brazil short of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
this match and leaving Brazil short of
their<00:01:53.640> goal<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.970> win<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> World<00:01:54.360> Cup<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.380> I'm

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
their goal to win the World Cup but I'm

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.260 
their goal to win the World Cup but I'm
not<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> take<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> risk<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> bet<00:01:57.000> them

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
not going to take a risk and bet them

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.850 
not going to take a risk and bet them
straight<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.630> since<00:01:58.259> there's<00:01:58.439> always<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
straight up since there's always that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
straight up since there's always that
risk<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.399> time<00:01:59.610> after<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> 90<00:02:00.540> minutes<00:02:00.780> of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
regulation time that's why I'm

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.770 
regulation time that's why I'm
recommending<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.850> play<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.090> colombia's<00:02:03.540> plus
