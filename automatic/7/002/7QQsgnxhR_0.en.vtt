00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
anyway let's take a look at what it says

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.819 
anyway let's take a look at what it says
here<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> back<00:02:58.829> at<00:02:59.639> the<00:03:00.120> DD<00:03:00.560> change<00:03:01.560> world

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
here on the back at the DD change world

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.979 
here on the back at the DD change world
we<00:03:02.280> redefine<00:03:02.819> multiplayer<00:03:03.329> not<00:03:03.569> really<00:03:03.870> all

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
we redefine multiplayer not really all

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.819 
we redefine multiplayer not really all
they've<00:03:04.139> really<00:03:04.379> done<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.799> um<00:03:05.810> had<00:03:06.810> maps<00:03:07.440> that

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
they've really done is um had maps that

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.539 
they've really done is um had maps that
are<00:03:08.159> like<00:03:09.260> what<00:03:10.260> he<00:03:10.319> called<00:03:10.470> dynamic<00:03:10.739> maps<00:03:11.250> so

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
are like what he called dynamic maps so

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.670 
are like what he called dynamic maps so
basically<00:03:11.849> things<00:03:12.480> change<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.379> events

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
basically things change like events

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.939 
basically things change like events
unfold<00:03:14.159> so<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.639> rock<00:03:15.090> slider<00:03:15.480> will<00:03:16.019> occur<00:03:16.440> if

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
unfold so a rock slider will occur if

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.589 
unfold so a rock slider will occur if
there's<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.430> guy<00:03:17.579> at<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.819> bottom<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.359> this

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
there's a guy at the bottom of like this

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.270 
there's a guy at the bottom of like this
hill<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.079> can<00:03:19.230> shoot<00:03:19.379> out<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.799> tree<00:03:20.010> logs

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280
