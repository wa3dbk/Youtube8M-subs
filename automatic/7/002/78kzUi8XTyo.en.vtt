00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the last battle was really really close

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.710 
the last battle was really really close
it<00:00:17.640> could<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:17.910> gone<00:00:18.000> either<00:00:18.240> way<00:00:18.359> actually

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
it could have gone either way actually

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.439

so<00:00:19.260> what<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:19.560> decided<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.850> switch

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
so what I've decided to do was switch

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.470 
so what I've decided to do was switch
the<00:00:21.990> mode<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.310> flash<00:00:23.580> metal<00:00:23.970> wheel<00:00:24.119> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the mode on the flash metal wheel to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.689 
the mode on the flash metal wheel to
attack<00:00:24.869> mode<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> results<00:00:26.550> would

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
attack mode and see if the results would
be<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:27.060> different<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.529> rules<00:00:28.710> are<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949

metal wheel and the only reason I put
the<00:02:35.690> metal<00:02:36.019> wheel<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.350> stamina<00:02:36.680> mode<00:02:36.950> from<00:02:37.160> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
the metal wheel in stamina mode from the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.340 
the metal wheel in stamina mode from the
beginning<00:02:37.820> because<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.450> because<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> thought

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
beginning because is because I thought

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.009 
beginning because is because I thought
it<00:02:39.530> would<00:02:39.650> give<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:39.920> more<00:02:40.100> stamina<00:02:40.870> because<00:02:41.870> of

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
it would give it more stamina because of

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.500 
it would give it more stamina because of
the<00:02:42.110> BD<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:42.890> kind<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.489> thought<00:02:43.700> oh<00:02:43.910> it's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
the BD so I kind of just thought oh it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.150 
the BD so I kind of just thought oh it's
a<00:02:44.600> standard<00:02:44.959> combo<00:02:45.290> I'll<00:02:45.560> put<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:45.860> stamina

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
a standard combo I'll put it in stamina

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.229 
a standard combo I'll put it in stamina
mode<00:02:46.400> but<00:02:46.700> surprisingly<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:48.110> does<00:02:48.650> better<00:02:48.950> in

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
mode but surprisingly it does better in
