00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
snapshots as well as updates so he just

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.380 
snapshots as well as updates so he just
so<00:01:43.750> I'm<00:01:44.140> hearing<00:01:44.470> that<00:01:44.619> he's<00:01:44.770> adding

so I'm hearing that he's adding

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.169 
so I'm hearing that he's adding
backpacks<00:01:46.390> or<00:01:46.720> rods<00:01:47.580> something<00:01:48.580> will<00:01:48.970> be

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
backpacks or rods something will be

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.180 
backpacks or rods something will be
useful<00:01:49.569> in<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.720> game<00:01:49.929> as<00:01:50.110> an<00:01:50.289> item<00:01:50.470> towards

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
useful in the game as an item towards

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.889 
useful in the game as an item towards
the<00:01:51.310> player<00:01:51.550> instead<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.539> you<00:01:52.869> know

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
the player instead of you know

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.190 
the player instead of you know
decoration<00:01:53.679> or<00:01:53.890> mechanics<00:01:54.789> so<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.660> think<00:01:56.140> this

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
decoration or mechanics so I think this

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.350 
decoration or mechanics so I think this
is<00:01:56.319> a<00:01:56.380> good<00:01:56.470> idea<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:57.009> because<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.849> know<00:01:57.970> if

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
is a good idea just because you know if

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.270 
is a good idea just because you know if
it's<00:01:58.750> hard<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.380> craft<00:01:59.679> knit<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.039> bit<00:02:00.160> of<00:02:00.220> a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
it's hard to craft knit a bit of a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's hard to craft knit a bit of a
challenge<00:02:00.490> then<00:02:00.819> all<00:02:00.910> means<00:02:01.090> go<00:02:01.270> for<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.509> to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
challenge then all means go for it to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.190 
challenge then all means go for it to
make<00:02:01.929> survival<00:02:02.440> mode<00:02:02.619> more<00:02:03.310> enjoyable<00:02:03.759> so<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
make survival mode more enjoyable so the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.199 
make survival mode more enjoyable so the
house<00:02:05.380> all<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.619> have<00:02:05.740> information<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.759> anyway

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
house all I have information on anyway

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.529 
house all I have information on anyway
but<00:02:07.539> then<00:02:08.319> if<00:02:08.679> staff<00:02:09.130> rods<00:02:09.490> or<00:02:09.670> backpacks<00:02:10.390> are

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
but then if staff rods or backpacks are
