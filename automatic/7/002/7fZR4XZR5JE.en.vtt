long long time the downside was the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.780 
long long time the downside was the
noise<00:01:08.280> level<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> year<00:01:10.620> it<00:01:10.800> was<00:01:10.980> to<00:01:11.310> try

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
noise level so this year it was to try

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.520

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.610 
made it for me in
a<00:02:02.320> design<00:02:02.950> in<00:02:03.370> largest<00:02:03.940> Moldy<00:02:04.330> had<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.500> was

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
a design in largest Moldy had and it was

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
a design in largest Moldy had and it was
too<00:02:05.770> small<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.990> was<00:02:08.140> even<00:02:08.890> more<00:02:09.040> complex<00:02:09.430> I

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
too small and it was even more complex I

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.190 
too small and it was even more complex I
wanted<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.030> be<00:02:10.119> like<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:10.360> ninja<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:10.840> wanted

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
wanted it to be like the ninja I wanted

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.110 
wanted it to be like the ninja I wanted
to<00:02:11.380> have<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.680> backward<00:02:12.100> curve<00:02:12.310> because<00:02:13.000> I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
to have that backward curve because I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.580 
to have that backward curve because I
believe<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> backward<00:02:13.810> curve<00:02:14.020> would<00:02:14.320> make<00:02:14.470> it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
believe the backward curve would make it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.260 
believe the backward curve would make it
so<00:02:14.710> they<00:02:14.830> wouldn't<00:02:15.070> grab<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> wiper<00:02:15.640> wouldn't

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
so they wouldn't grab a wiper wouldn't

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.560 
so they wouldn't grab a wiper wouldn't
grab<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.720> mirror<00:02:17.710> or<00:02:18.130> an<00:02:18.250> antenna<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.240> be<00:02:19.360> very

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
grab a mirror or an antenna and be very

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.450 
grab a mirror or an antenna and be very
very<00:02:19.960> smooth<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.500> he<00:02:20.770> kept<00:02:20.950> saying<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.340> too

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
very smooth and he kept saying it's too

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.740 
very smooth and he kept saying it's too
hard<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.090> too<00:02:22.180> hard<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.390> do<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
hard to do it's too hard to do and I

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.030 
hard to do it's too hard to do and I
said<00:02:22.900> no<00:02:23.020> it's<00:02:23.170> not<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.560> not<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.830> hard<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
said no it's not it's not that hard to

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.910 
said no it's not it's not that hard to
do<00:02:24.160> he's<00:02:24.520> got<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.680> first<00:02:26.860> one

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
do he's got to do it and the first one

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.700 
do he's got to do it and the first one
we<00:02:27.070> built<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:27.370> tested<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.790> with<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.090> short

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
we built we tested it with the short

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.440 
we built we tested it with the short
diameter<00:02:29.710> and<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.820> cleaned<00:02:31.060> real<00:02:31.210> well<00:02:31.420> just

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
diameter and it cleaned real well just

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.690 
diameter and it cleaned real well just
didn't<00:02:31.840> reach<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:31.960> bottom<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.440> cars<00:02:32.700> so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
didn't reach the bottom of the cars so

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.400 
didn't reach the bottom of the cars so
he<00:02:33.730> says<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> don't<00:02:34.840> know<00:02:34.960> if<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.080> can<00:02:35.230> make<00:02:35.380> a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
he says I don't know if I can make a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.490 
he says I don't know if I can make a
mold<00:02:35.620> big<00:02:35.860> enough<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.600> he's<00:02:37.600> relentless<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
mold big enough and he's relentless and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.260 
mold big enough and he's relentless and
he<00:02:38.650> didn't<00:02:38.860> stop<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.310> he<00:02:39.430> went<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.030> worked

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
he didn't stop and he went and worked

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.090 
he didn't stop and he went and worked
with<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.540> foam<00:02:40.720> people<00:02:41.080> they<00:02:41.590> built<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.950> much

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
with the foam people they built a much

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.280 
with the foam people they built a much
bigger<00:02:42.310> mold<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.360> test<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.930> cloth<00:02:44.110> would

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
bigger mold to test that the cloth would

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.500 
bigger mold to test that the cloth would
work<00:02:44.470> first<00:02:44.770> they<00:02:44.920> actually<00:02:45.340> welded<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> foam

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
work first they actually welded the foam

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.390 
work first they actually welded the foam
together<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.170> make<00:02:47.320> me<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.950> diameter<00:02:48.370> I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
together to make me the diameter I

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.370 
together to make me the diameter I
wanted<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.420> brush<00:02:49.720> has<00:02:49.840> been<00:02:49.990> running<00:02:50.260> now

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380
