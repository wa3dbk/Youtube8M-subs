00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
go over and we just do a light

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
plant just kind of like that we don't

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.050 
plant just kind of like that we don't
need<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> put<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.560> lot<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.850> it'll

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

there's<00:01:15.750> enough<00:01:16.050> in<00:01:16.230> here<00:01:16.440> for<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.860> plant<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
there's enough in here for the plant to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
there's enough in here for the plant to
survive<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.600> spread<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.810> around

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
survive and we just spread it around

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.290 
survive and we just spread it around
just<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:19.980> a<00:01:20.010> lot<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> put<00:01:21.090> too

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
just like that not a lot if you put too

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.540 
just like that not a lot if you put too
much<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.660> there<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.080> risk<00:01:22.410> burning<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.370> roots

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
much on there you risk burning the roots

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.200 
much on there you risk burning the roots
with<00:01:23.730> salt<00:01:24.180> burn<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.370> lot<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.760> times<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
with salt burn and or a lot of times it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.580 
with salt burn and or a lot of times it
just<00:01:27.240> leeches<00:01:28.170> away<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.650> ends<00:01:28.830> waste<00:01:29.190> product

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590

they're too much or too low so
fertilizer<00:01:45.120> is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> good<00:01:45.750> start<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.830> water<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
fertilizer is a good start but water is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.070 
fertilizer is a good start but water is
much<00:01:47.550> more<00:01:47.790> important<00:01:48.330> if<00:01:48.660> you<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.870> any
