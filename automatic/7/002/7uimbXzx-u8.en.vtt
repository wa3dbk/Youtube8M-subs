 this game is very popular in the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.870
 community bro ni in 2011 the game was 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.620
 posted as a download in the x tree forum 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.860

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.390
 several users downloaded it 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.480

 the game was very disturbing the game 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.290
 was quickly removed from the forum but 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.420
 the users who had the bad 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.110
 fortunate to download it they could not 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.500
 avoid the outcome 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.900
 from creating screamer virus to causing 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.880
 nightmares moon game had several 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.620
 sequels but they did not become so 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.620
 terrifying as the original 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.140
 created by software output the theater is 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.240
 based on the same location the game is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.220
 curiously incomplete because 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.210
 company went bankrupt during the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.490
 production in 1993 the game was very 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.860
 dark and hard to find and the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.259
 few who had it refused to play it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.509
 for its terrifying nature in the 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.159
 theater the only objective is to select 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.619
 a movie and those that simply 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.590
 They wander around the place they can be 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.229
 surprised by appearances the story 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.240
 complete has a terrible outcome if 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.840
 you want to read it there will be links in the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.840
 description 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.000
 unlike the others the supposed 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.770
 curse starts when you unlock 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.800
 a secret character inside the 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.080
 video game song and warrior is the only 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.050
 Xega video game that contains has fallen 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.810
 and it has been the reason why many do not 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.150
 have decided to try this game is said 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.910
 that if you unlock the character and you arrive 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.850
 to play with him the apparitions will begin 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.520
 in real life beyond the legend 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.250
 it is said that the song can feel the 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.680
 sun will be played backwards 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.100
 this means that this is sweet is 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.100
 near 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.370
 in taboo the sixth sense what you had 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.970
 what to do was put your personal information 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.800
 and the game would tell your future the story 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.840
 says that the people who played it 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.750
 they ended up insane since the game 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.420
 came to predict their deaths or even 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.299
 that of their relatives some are 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.120
 fulfilled and because of this the game was 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.400
 forbidden in the manual 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.769
 he said that nintendo took care of us 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.780
 riches predictions or the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.780
 consequences that this game brings 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.329
 in the 80s there was an arcade called bare 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.150
 set that came to cause a lot 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.129
 apparently two people controversy 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.170
 very young died of a heart attack later 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.170
 to reach the maximum score in the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.120
 game the popularity of this was such that 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.329
 great newspapers came to publish 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.940
 about this is coincidence or reality 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.560
 see that it is the first video game that 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.560
 relates to a death 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.340
 Mario is a creepy is enough about a game 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.140
 hat that was posted in a forum a 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.240
 user who had the opportunity to 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.000
 play it said the game was very 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.040
 limited and in the files is the game 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.240
 itself and a text that apart from the 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.940
 random letters occasionally appears 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.280
 find me the game itself and you could not 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.900
 execute so the player had to 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.630
 make several modifications for 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.080
 achieve it within the game had not 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.690
 enemies the text was edited and contained 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.060
 very dark sentences and sometimes it was 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.110
 reference about a person who was 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.030
 brutally murdered days later another 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.900
 member of the forum decided to convert the 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.990
 file point txt in an image and it 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.820
 it took a big surprise the users 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.950
 they say that the image belongs to the 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.950
 person who is mentioned in mario 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.530
 sonic exe comes in creepy format 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.900
 pasta is based on a boy who receives a 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.870
 disc of his friend who tells him that 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.930
 game must be burned the boy ignores 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.879
 this and start playing it from the start 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.159
 a distorted version of 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:58.099
 sonic noted for gore and 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:00.860
 blood inside the game the boy says 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.409
 who is tormented by sonic never leaves 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.569
 to follow him the creepy pasta ends 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:09.409
 when sonny crosses the fourth barrier and 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.360
 have an encounter with the boy what 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.279
 you are seeing on screen is a version 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.139
 made by the community since the 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:17.139
