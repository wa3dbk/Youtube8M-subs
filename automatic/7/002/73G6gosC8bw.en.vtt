 hello everybody and welcome to another video 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.150
 tutorial that Gustavo speaks 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.580
 for blog google to 6 point with 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
 in this lesson we will see the simple but 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.869
 that is still interesting 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.449
 we will then have text one of the beam of light 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 will light backwards followed 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 of movement 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.330
 this text was created in photoshop and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.640
 saved in PNG format with transparency 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.500
 alpha using document with resolution 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.300
 hd or 1280 by 720 pixels 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.360
 Let's start by creating the new 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.690
 composition coming in menu with poses 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 with position here we will leave resolution 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.559
 1280 by 720 at a frame rate of 25 and the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.840
 duration of ten seconds 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.879
 created with position we will drag the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.460
 our image with the text here 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.590
 here is a simple text with the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.609
 google our website address 6 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.090
 let's change the type here to fade sun 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:31.049
 on the court we put value without 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.119
 Amalthea I'm going to play the value 240 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.079
 so we have this effect now in 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.369
 composition 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.149
 select enter 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.430

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.470
 I'll press the shift and I'll drag 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.280
 here to the left 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.130

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.649
 Braking by clicking on this button here 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.229
 now I'll take the time indicator until 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.680
 the end has ten seconds 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.329

 in this point 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.110
 good then a new one freyre was generated 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.159
 automatically and then we have this 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.129
 It is made 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:25.930

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.260
 So I'm going to take a break right now and 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.879
