00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
joystiq repeatedly yeah it asked me how

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.469 
joystiq repeatedly yeah it asked me how
I'm<00:04:26.990> how<00:04:27.889> I'm<00:04:28.099> supposed<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.580> do<00:04:28.759> that<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.030> have

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
I'm how I'm supposed to do that I have

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.790 
I'm how I'm supposed to do that I have
to<00:04:29.509> use<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.400> arrow<00:04:31.400> keys<00:04:31.610> but<00:04:32.150> Maya<00:04:33.050> my

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
to use the arrow keys but Maya my

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.430 
to use the arrow keys but Maya my
keyboard<00:04:34.370> has<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.610> nice<00:04:34.910> feature<00:04:35.240> named<00:04:35.750> macros

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
keyboard has a nice feature named macros

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.360 
keyboard has a nice feature named macros
so<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.400> can<00:04:37.849> program<00:04:41.199> more<00:04:42.199> than<00:04:42.349> one<00:04:42.590> more<00:04:43.220> than

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
so I can program more than one more than

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.120 
so I can program more than one more than
one<00:04:43.550> key<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.270> made<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> little<00:04:45.110> macro<00:04:45.830> who

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
one key so I made a little macro who

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.990 
one key so I made a little macro who
does<00:04:47.090> oh<00:04:47.419> whoa<00:04:48.139> damn<00:04:49.039> it<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.310> have<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.610> rub<00:04:49.789> it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
does oh whoa damn it I have to rub it

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
forward so I made a little macro who

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.710 
forward so I made a little macro who
does<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.479> whole<00:04:57.229> Choi<00:04:57.620> stick<00:04:57.919> thing<00:04:58.160> for<00:04:58.460> me

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
does this whole Choi stick thing for me

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.499 
does this whole Choi stick thing for me
which<00:04:59.720> is<00:04:59.750> pretty<00:05:00.620> handy<00:05:00.940> it's<00:05:01.940> just<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.419> I

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
which is pretty handy it's just that I

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.659 
which is pretty handy it's just that I
have<00:05:02.750> to<00:05:03.349> adjust<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.889> for<00:05:03.919> some<00:05:04.280> minigames

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
have to adjust it for some minigames

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.990 
have to adjust it for some minigames
that's<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.449> problem<00:05:05.750> because<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:07.039> if<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:07.759> do

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
that's a problem because and if you do

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.770 
that's a problem because and if you do
it<00:05:08.090> too<00:05:08.120> fast<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.900> won't<00:05:09.259> respond<00:05:09.919> anymore

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
it too fast it won't respond anymore

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.469 
it too fast it won't respond anymore
