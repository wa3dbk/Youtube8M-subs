the t2i is the lowest end DSLR and as
you<00:01:12.990> know<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:13.560> belief<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.250> even<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
you know my belief is that even with the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
you know my belief is that even with the
lowest<00:01:15.360> end<00:01:15.689> DSLR<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.439> capable<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.040> some

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
lowest end DSLR you're capable of some

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.060 
lowest end DSLR you're capable of some
great<00:01:17.520> stuff<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:19.229> mind<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> music

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
great stuff so in my mind the music

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
great stuff so in my mind the music
shouldn't<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.520> any<00:01:20.820> difference<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.420> that's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
shouldn't be any difference so that's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.390 
shouldn't be any difference so that's
why<00:01:21.750> we're<00:01:21.960> keeping<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> price<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.830> low<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
why we're keeping the price is low and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
why we're keeping the price is low and
what's<00:01:23.610> great<00:01:23.729> about<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
what's great about this one is that it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
what's great about this one is that it
fits<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.159> trailer<00:01:26.460> tool<00:01:26.670> bag

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
fits right in with the trailer tool bag

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.910

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
so if you combine the trailer tool bag

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.530 
so if you combine the trailer tool bag
with<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> whole<00:01:29.400> album<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.090> sixty

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.480 
going on with a total of about 12 or 13
files<00:04:53.710> so<00:04:54.130> pretty<00:04:54.430> easy<00:04:54.700> not<00:04:55.510> too<00:04:55.750> crazy

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
files so pretty easy not too crazy

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.550 
files so pretty easy not too crazy
pretty<00:04:57.490> clean-looking<00:04:58.060> timeline<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.110> as<00:04:59.380> we

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
pretty clean-looking timeline and as we

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.900 
pretty clean-looking timeline and as we
start<00:05:00.040> going<00:05:00.190> through<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.640> can<00:05:00.760> see

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
start going through this you can see

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.730 
start going through this you can see
that<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.120> fade<00:05:01.690> in<00:05:01.840> one<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:01.990> our<00:05:02.140> atmospheres

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
that I fade in one of our atmospheres

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.100 
that I fade in one of our atmospheres
eventually<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.550> bring<00:05:03.790> in<00:05:03.940> four<00:05:04.360> atmospheres

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
eventually I bring in four atmospheres

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.220 
eventually I bring in four atmospheres
and<00:05:05.230> that's<00:05:05.530> something<00:05:05.980> really<00:05:06.310> cool<00:05:06.550> about

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
and that's something really cool about

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.170 
and that's something really cool about
these<00:05:08.230> atmospheres<00:05:08.950> is<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.970> can

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
these atmospheres is that you can

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.640 
these atmospheres is that you can
combine<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.690> bunch<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.110> them<00:05:11.200> to<00:05:11.350> get<00:05:11.440> different

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
combine a bunch of them to get different

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.280 
combine a bunch of them to get different
sounds<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.460> make<00:05:13.210> all<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.510> levels<00:05:13.750> about

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
sounds and make all the levels about

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.950 
sounds and make all the levels about
equal<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:15.610> that<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:15.850> can't<00:05:16.060> really<00:05:16.150> hear<00:05:16.660> once

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
equal so that you can't really hear once

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.040 
equal so that you can't really hear once
you<00:05:17.230> can<00:05:17.350> use<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:17.710> again<00:05:17.980> and<00:05:18.720> just<00:05:19.720> kind<00:05:19.990> of

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
you can use it again and just kind of

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.020 
you can use it again and just kind of
create<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.350> new<00:05:20.590> one<00:05:20.710> by<00:05:20.890> combining<00:05:21.310> them<00:05:21.670> so

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
create a new one by combining them so

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.050
