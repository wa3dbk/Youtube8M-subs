00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 the devil's kids so they believe 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.839
 that I am happy and happy because I finish 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.570
 to go to the city of Cuernavaca and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.429
 I brought two aquatic plants so 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.950
 I want you to see is the modification that 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.719
 I did the filter as you can see there 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.210
 there is the main filter that is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.130
 coal and filling 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.910
 tezontle 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.699
 goes directly from the pump connects 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.519
 that side comes out here and I just 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.579
 of doing this adequacy that is a 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.890
 bucket where to the bottom there is 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.589
 a lot of water is enough for 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.710
 Hold all the solids after there 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.649
 coal and as you can see later it has 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.839
 the tenacity of a recommendation that part 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.140
 from below that has the leagues was out there 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.420
 where the water originally entered but 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.879
 what they believe turns out to be that when he left 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.790
 the light or they saw me needing to cut 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.220
 the energy all the dump was coming back 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.189
 by the pressure of gravity itself is 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.530
 say the water level was going down and I 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:07.390
 I returned all the dump then I just 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.119
 to connect this you are seeing from 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.670
 this side rises low and even if the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.220
 light has nowhere to return or be 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.869
 that keeps things in place and 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.450
 then it goes down on this side and this is a 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.820
 part that I want to share that this 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.090
 It became a jungle already which 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 love click plane but good 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.490
 I have here more than 8 aquatic plants 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.119
 different how can you see good from this 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.359
 side we have a bit of what we have 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.840
 here the typical hyacinth east that is there 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:43.659
 of tostones I do not even know what they're called 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.270
 we have the plant is so common that it 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.969
 they call the sword of amazons that as 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.009
 giant grass that is already growing and 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.399
 this new one that they just gave me that 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.649
 Cuernavaca costume right now 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.220
 very beautiful look until your plant has and 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.250
 I have two types of lentil this big 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.500
 who are watching there and the typical mini 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.659
 which is on this side then then 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.190
 it is really filtering out of wonder 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.299
 done there I have many very many 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.690
 guppies and I have like 20 gop couples and 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.940
 if they are having babies really to 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.940
 how stupid then they are producing 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.620
 very very father and that's how now 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.780
 I have the modification of the filter 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.120
 swamp this white you are seeing there 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.850
 is to generate algae for that I put it 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.460
 and the groupies bebecitos have food 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.950
 it is difficult to generate the alga 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.260
 when the material is black there it takes 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.300
 but then that's how it was 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.840
 currently as you can see I repeat there 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.150
 is what would be a pre filter let's 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.790
 call it that to capture the solids 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.320
 has a first water fall that is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.570
 what are you seeing the falls 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.610
 of water are extremely important for 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.920
 generate oxygen and believe it or not 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.860
 super important by the filtering of 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.680
 water and I have this second fall that already 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.260
 comes directly to the fat ones that already 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.320
 they are covered and well I hope this 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.810
 mini video serves them what has been 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.330
 already the swamp filter and I can 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.860
 say that this has been excellent where 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.720
 you can get all these plants 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.720
 they create in the market my sugar and morelos 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.300
 there you can get them here in plants 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.940
 to see how 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.270
 as 400 pesos in plants and already 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.580
 They made gacha sale kids video cortito 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.580
 but substantial there is sold
