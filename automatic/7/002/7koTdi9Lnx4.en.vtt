00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:16.180
 Actually, I'll try playing now . 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:21.730
 Slowly, yes . Let 's just say I'm getting tired of it. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:27.840
 Yes, there is a lot of strength in the mood. Like Moses in front of Ohhonghong 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:31.840
 In this way, the code is progressed to the base 2 0 3 4 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 Oh, so you ahtta progress 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 So uh fourth second code may require these dietary pulled forward 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 9 Oh yeah, pull this now and have the code half-beat. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.960
 That 's what happened. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 Reset would now head into the room and one Probably 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.890
 U 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.149
 Many more than would be be fulfilled hanbakja pull As fill in the back part 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:16.180
 It also locks. 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:16.180
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.940
 te te te 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.810
 After planning, shoot 2k 4 5 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 2 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 It 's the pressure . 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:49.070
 Anchorage Anchorage Anchorage Anything that happened 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.070
 I'm going to try it again. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:04.640
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.640
 lie to me 2 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:15.050
 It's because you keep geopbak rhythm after night anchored far 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.670
 If you do not have to practice only about 8-bit or higher, 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.850
 It's very difficult to get over 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:25.340
 This language Tae Hoon cut this to five Muan exercise or For Looking per Turn 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 You have to do a lot of practice exercises. 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.980
 5 I'll try to do so once again, 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.280
 Oh yes 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.010
 Moist 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.410
 5 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.040
 wire 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.970
 This progress is a straight yiraseo em before then now conquered all the time when good progress 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.980
 To 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.980
 Oh, there 's this part 5 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.159
 This is usually the reason why the c code changes. 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:20.920
 In that case, just give me a trap, but it's neat. 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:24.060
 This was just before I get locked ve just slightly negative so our night spooky 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.060
 You can do it neatly 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.909
 5 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:40.350
 oral oh oh oh oh 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.129
 222 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.560
 I can conquer Yes and it's the same again 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.560
 But this one's coming out again soon. 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.370
 Ah 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.519
 I think it's on a per 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.579
 5 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.810
 5 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.810
 Urethral pressure short-term interest free 5 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.460
 This part is the most critical part. 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:40.760
 To climb up to the next without anywhere quickly from the e 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.520
 dy's 242 names virtue 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.660
 It's all two 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:53.180
 Note 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:56.929
 U 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:08.580
 Such information a 

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:12.949
 who in love to the top 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.949
 OMG 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:22.310
 This completes the process. 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:26.350
 In fact, there is a word so be a little careful practice coming from the end of 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.350
 There are strange codes that suddenly popped up. 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:40.250
 This inde part which parts are missing a beat missed the most when it said 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.150
 It will please a lot of exercise, especially for this part because I feel like 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.370
 I think that's good. 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.840
 As a final review, overall faith is fast and 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.960
 It's hard to fit 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:56.360
 That's why you should use a formal pattern. 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:59.590
 And because it should go to strum a quick snap of the wrist well short 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.590
 You can use it. 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:09.200
 4 Curtains can or may not work 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.850
 And if you have your own style, you can do it yourself. 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:17.810
 It's perfectly okay to do it alone. 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:21.840
 You should not do that when you get together with other instruments. 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:29.630
 You can follow along as the instrument does . 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:33.750
 Now do you see progress'm out code 13, code and now the code word bit Example 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:40.340
 If the tone is not exercised, you will not know fast 16 bits 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.340
 You can do a lot of practice in the left hand
