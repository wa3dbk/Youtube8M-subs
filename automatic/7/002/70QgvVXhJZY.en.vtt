00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
circle in the arabic masaf so this

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.520 
circle in the arabic masaf so this

better<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:08.380> we<00:03:08.620> see<00:03:08.830> here<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.650> when<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:12.160> write

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
better if we see here so when you write

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.789 
better if we see here so when you write
a<00:03:12.370> word<00:03:13.030> for<00:03:13.330> example<00:03:13.450> -<00:03:14.200> boo<00:03:14.470> -<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:16.120> here<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
a word for example - boo - so here the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.750 
a word for example - boo - so here the
sound<00:03:18.160> comes<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> sudden<00:03:19.209> stop<00:03:19.390> tube<00:03:19.989> -<00:03:20.760> so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
sound comes to a sudden stop tube - so

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.960 
sound comes to a sudden stop tube - so
we<00:03:21.850> don't<00:03:22.030> have<00:03:22.209> any<00:03:22.420> vowel<00:03:23.230> sign<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.790> just

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
we don't have any vowel sign so it just

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.140 
we don't have any vowel sign so it just
decide<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.630> word<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:27.250> sound<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> word<00:03:27.970> we

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
decide the word the sound of the word we

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.039 
decide the word the sound of the word we
stop<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.660> sound<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.500> tube<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:30.400> dub<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:31.390> tip

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
stop the sound like tube to dub the tip

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.870 
stop the sound like tube to dub the tip
T<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.650> rule<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.010> sukoon<00:03:36.670> when

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
T so this is the rule of sukoon when

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.940 
T so this is the rule of sukoon when
there<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.090> no<00:03:37.269> vowel<00:03:37.540> sign<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.470> means<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
there is no vowel sign that means the

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.449 
there is no vowel sign that means the
word<00:03:39.130> has<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:40.180> cone<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:47.010> we<00:03:48.010> learned

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
word has a so cone so we have we learned

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.990 
word has a so cone so we have we learned
about<00:03:48.609> single<00:03:49.239> vowel<00:03:49.570> signs<00:03:50.609> then<00:03:51.609> we<00:03:51.790> have

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
about single vowel signs then we have

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.759 
about single vowel signs then we have
what<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.329> called<00:03:52.540> as<00:03:52.720> double<00:03:53.320> vowel<00:03:53.530> signs

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.610 
called as a RR and we say a book a pen
or<00:04:35.560> an<00:04:36.010> apple<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.570> it's<00:04:37.720> just<00:04:37.810> indefinite<00:04:38.440> it

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
so for example if you want to say a book

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.070 
so for example if you want to say a book
we<00:04:52.960> say<00:04:53.110> Keith<00:04:53.320> Urban<00:04:54.419> so<00:04:55.419> if<00:04:55.540> I<00:04:55.720> would<00:04:55.810> say<00:04:55.960> a

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
we say Keith Urban so if I would say a

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.280 
we say Keith Urban so if I would say a
book<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.220> still<00:04:57.550> Keith<00:04:57.730> Urban<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.990> when<00:04:59.169> you

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
book it is still Keith Urban so when you

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.870 
book it is still Keith Urban so when you
see<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.830> sign<00:05:00.639> of<00:05:00.820> double<00:05:02.430> double<00:05:03.430> for<00:05:03.460> third

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
see a sign of double double for third

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.440 
see a sign of double double for third
double<00:05:04.240> castra<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.440> sign<00:05:05.800> of

double castra that is a sign of

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.469 
double castra that is a sign of
indefinite<00:05:07.450> it's<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.050> mistake<00:05:08.380> here<00:05:09.360> let's<00:05:10.360> say

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
indefinite it's a mistake here let's say

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.040 
indefinite it's a mistake here let's say
an<00:05:10.540> example<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:11.740> Moodle<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.310> soon<00:05:12.750> C<00:05:13.750> double

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
an example so Moodle is soon C double

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.300 
an example so Moodle is soon C double

double fathe is always written on an
Aleph<00:06:58.810> this<00:06:59.620> is<00:06:59.770> an<00:06:59.919> important<00:07:00.460> writing<00:07:00.669> rule

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.719 
Aleph this is an important writing rule
which<00:07:01.180> you<00:07:01.389> have<00:07:01.509> to<00:07:01.689> remember<00:07:02.409> because<00:07:03.370> if

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
which you have to remember because if

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.320 
which you have to remember because if
you<00:07:03.849> don't<00:07:04.120> recognize<00:07:05.080> this<00:07:05.800> so<00:07:06.789> if<00:07:07.030> you<00:07:07.120> don't

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
you don't recognize this so if you don't

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.959 
you don't recognize this so if you don't
understand<00:07:07.900> this<00:07:08.080> so<00:07:08.770> if<00:07:09.129> you<00:07:09.310> are<00:07:09.400> reading<00:07:09.580> a

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
understand this so if you are reading a

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:12.480 
understand this so if you are reading a
must-have<00:07:10.810> which<00:07:11.050> doesn't<00:07:11.379> have<00:07:11.740> a<00:07:12.009> vowel

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
must-have which doesn't have a vowel

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.450 
must-have which doesn't have a vowel
sign<00:07:12.879> so<00:07:13.750> we<00:07:13.960> will<00:07:14.139> insert<00:07:14.529> a<00:07:14.620> mother<00:07:14.830> reason

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
sign so we will insert a mother reason

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.149 
sign so we will insert a mother reason
we'll<00:07:16.210> be<00:07:16.360> reading<00:07:16.479> a<00:07:16.599> mother<00:07:16.840> I<00:07:16.870> saw<00:07:17.229> which

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
we'll be reading a mother I saw which

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.450 
we'll be reading a mother I saw which
will<00:07:18.340> be<00:07:18.460> wrong<00:07:18.729> so<00:07:19.659> just<00:07:20.050> remember<00:07:20.590> that<00:07:20.770> the

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
will be wrong so just remember that the

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.999 
will be wrong so just remember that the
sine<00:07:21.699> of<00:07:21.729> double<00:07:22.240> fatah<00:07:22.539> is<00:07:23.229> always<00:07:23.770> written

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.009 
sine of double fatah is always written

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:27.240 
sine of double fatah is always written
on<00:07:24.370> an<00:07:24.520> Aleph<00:07:25.259> soumada<00:07:26.259> reason<00:07:26.710> but<00:07:27.069> the

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
on an Aleph soumada reason but the

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.600 
on an Aleph soumada reason but the
reason<00:07:27.699> motor<00:07:28.210> racing<00:07:29.099> so<00:07:30.099> these<00:07:30.279> are<00:07:30.460> the

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
reason motor racing so these are the

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.439 
reason motor racing so these are the
vowel<00:07:31.539> signs<00:07:31.949> for<00:07:32.949> hope<00:07:33.219> you<00:07:34.000> will<00:07:34.150> do<00:07:34.270> plenty

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449 
vowel signs for hope you will do plenty

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.709
