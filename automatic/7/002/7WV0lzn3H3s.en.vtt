00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.410
 Good day with you again I 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.940
 today i redid the lighting in 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:15.639
 the trunk of its 39 to those who are in the subject 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.680
 ass familiar problem following already 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.529
 half all fell off all the wires 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.679
 which was once there for 1 sitting here 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.050
 The problem in the panel is that 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:28.000
 trunk claps and constantly already 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.210
 defend diodes lose brightness something 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.079
 here flashes from the installation has passed a little 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.739
 more than a year here is not a neat movement 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:43.410
 in general, only one was torn off 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 the panel gives entirely on the basis of 3528 diodes 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.780
 here it is not clear what has already come off 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.059
 I will not restore it all I will 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.829
 again 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:01.809
 I will perform it in strips that 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.690
 already described on diodes 7020 I insert 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.360
 I will be three strips in the trunk on the cover 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:13.500
 trunk I will insert a new panel 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.500
 on the same 3528 their only leg 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.260
 direct lighting of the main zone 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.840
 trunk will use three such 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.300
 panels 2 as if on the sides and one behind 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.000
 center well, let's start with tearing off 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.790
 completely all that old lighting all 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.520
 we will tear off after this preparation 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.020
 new will be glued on a gluing 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.070
 my on silicone now its here only 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.240
 find silicone stick on twist 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.750
 I will do everything, nothing hung out 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.750
 let's see what happens 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 so 1 light one tape installed 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.190
 the back of the center principle she already 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.810
 gives a lot of light even if you close 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.610
 the letters here it is she shines well I 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.130
 Comrade such until light quite 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.980
 perverted love when not just light 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.489
 and very, very light, so I will 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.750
 install an additional 2 looking 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.989
 meeting fragment will be already with 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 installed lights 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.230
 look further 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.890
 we see it became noticeably brighter as light as 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.420
 in the afternoon a little bit is not clear just from here 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.230
 lamps and generally fuck removed 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.019
 because there is a carat killed near the ceiling 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.970
 constantly dangles and interferes like this 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.150
 that's the way 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.260
 something like a bird turned set 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.660
 three lights can this house itself 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.180
 try home in the garage on the street where 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.160
 anything backlight attached simple 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.819
 silicone in two or three places and literally 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.489
 bit by bit 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.230
 transplanted not degrease without cleaning 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:20.019
 nothing I think will go well although the time 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.129
 will show you just have to hide the wires 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:27.269
 but I won't show it to you anymore 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.269
 thanks to new meetings
