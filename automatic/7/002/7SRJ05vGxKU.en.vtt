00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
the base was and kind of what kind of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.979 
the base was and kind of what kind of
drawing<00:02:06.829> would<00:02:07.009> sit<00:02:07.219> well<00:02:07.429> in<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.569> mix<00:02:08.840> and

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
drawing would sit well in this mix and

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.749 
drawing would sit well in this mix and
then<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.170> went<00:02:09.590> walking<00:02:09.709> around<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.310> blow<00:02:10.580> into

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
then I went walking around to blow into

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.520 
then I went walking around to blow into
phones<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.420> lots<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.660> sketches<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.319> kind<00:02:12.500> of

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
phones and lots of sketches and kind of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.610 
phones and lots of sketches and kind of
mock-ups<00:02:12.950> drawings<00:02:13.280> at<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.489> space<00:02:14.440> web<00:02:15.440> back

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
mock-ups drawings at the space web back

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.440 
mock-ups drawings at the space web back
to<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.799> studio<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.459> did<00:02:16.700> sketches<00:02:17.000> from<00:02:17.299> that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
to the studio and did sketches from that

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.690 
to the studio and did sketches from that
and<00:02:17.599> then<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.780> pieced<00:02:17.989> together<00:02:18.200> bits<00:02:19.040> and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
and then I pieced together bits and

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.570 
and then I pieced together bits and
pieces<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.299> try<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.569> put<00:02:21.440> together<00:02:22.370> a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
pieces so I try to put together a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.809 
pieces so I try to put together a
composition<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.150> works

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
composition that works

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.569 
composition that works
the<00:02:24.049> shank<00:02:25.049> pop<00:02:25.319> that's<00:02:25.920> basically<00:02:26.340> been

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
the shank pop that's basically been

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.229 
the shank pop that's basically been
stolen

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
stolen

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.949 
stolen
so<00:02:27.599> with<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.930> difference<00:02:28.439> baseline<00:02:28.920> found

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
so with this difference baseline found

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.690 
so with this difference baseline found
these<00:02:30.959> together<00:02:31.170> different<00:02:31.980> street<00:02:32.219> scene<00:02:32.459> so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
these together different street scene so

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.369 
these together different street scene so
they<00:02:32.819> disappear<00:02:33.269> into<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.569> corner<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.140> go<00:02:34.230> with

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
they disappear into a corner to go with

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.890 
they disappear into a corner to go with
the<00:02:34.500> perspective<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.640> give<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.510> actual

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the perspective and to give the actual

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.880 
the perspective and to give the actual
stage<00:02:37.200> area<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.950> more<00:02:38.099> depth

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
stage area and more depth

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.259 
stage area and more depth
yeah<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.099> kind<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.519> tried<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.849> capture
