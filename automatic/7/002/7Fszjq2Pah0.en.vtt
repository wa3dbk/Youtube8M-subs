00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
boosting it'll go through a series of

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.870 
boosting it'll go through a series of
pages<00:01:17.980> then<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.220> gets<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:20.280> prob<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.400> like<00:01:21.610> a

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
pages then it gets to the prob I like a

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.480 
pages then it gets to the prob I like a
little<00:01:22.120> page<00:01:22.630> where<00:01:23.620> it<00:01:23.830> has<00:01:24.010> all<00:01:24.280> these

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
little page where it has all these

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.130 
little page where it has all these
programs<00:01:25.000> soft<00:01:25.660> like<00:01:25.840> Google<00:01:26.350> Desktop<00:01:26.530> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
programs soft like Google Desktop and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.740 
programs soft like Google Desktop and
stuff<00:01:29.140> with<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.970> should<00:01:31.119> connects<00:01:31.479> and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
stuff with that you should connects and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.510 
stuff with that you should connects and
then<00:01:31.840> you<00:01:31.930> go<00:01:32.050> go<00:01:32.320> doesn't<00:01:33.130> really<00:01:33.369> matter

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
then you go go doesn't really matter

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.820 
then you go go doesn't really matter
which<00:01:33.670> one<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.970> choose<00:01:34.150> or<00:01:34.390> suppose<00:01:34.830> it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
which one you choose or suppose it

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.920 
which one you choose or suppose it
doesn't<00:01:36.010> change<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.820> way<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.150> food<00:01:37.360> boosts

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
doesn't change the way the food boosts

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.020
