00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.959 
top mixed the flavors a little bit but
it<00:01:36.270> sure<00:01:36.480> didn't<00:01:36.780> make<00:01:36.900> any<00:01:37.080> difference

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.469

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the four full racks of ribs and I do

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
the four full racks of ribs and I do
them<00:01:55.399> concave<00:01:58.159> just<00:01:59.159> seems<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.729> keeps

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
them concave just seems like it keeps

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.559 
them concave just seems like it keeps
some<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> moisture<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:02.149> they<00:02:03.149> don't<00:02:03.329> get

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
some of the moisture in they don't get

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.309 
some of the moisture in they don't get
as<00:02:03.689> dry<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.090> cook<00:02:06.270> them<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.569> this<00:02:06.840> at

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
as dry and then I cook them like this at

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.609 
as dry and then I cook them like this at
about<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> hundred<00:02:08.399> ninety<00:02:08.670> degrees<00:02:09.379> for<00:02:10.379> one
