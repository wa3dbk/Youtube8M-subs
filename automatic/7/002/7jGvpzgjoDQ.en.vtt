00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it looks like it's a comments program

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.460 
it looks like it's a comments program
used<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.509> diagnose<00:00:15.509> comments<00:00:16.430> engines

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
used to diagnose comments engines

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.900 
used to diagnose comments engines
there's<00:00:19.470> another<00:00:19.740> program<00:00:20.189> called<00:00:20.220> Cal<00:00:20.730> term

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
there's another program called Cal term

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.750 
there's another program called Cal term
that<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.449> more<00:00:21.689> in-depth<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.890> what

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
that is more in-depth and that's what

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.790 
that is more in-depth and that's what
actually<00:00:23.880> drives<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.600> engine<00:00:24.800> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
actually drives the engine and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.210 
actually drives the engine and
communicates<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.720> VC<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.869> should<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.920> say

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
communicates with a VC you should I say

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.859 
communicates with a VC you should I say
so

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
so

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.459 
so
why<00:00:30.869> why<00:00:31.470> get<00:00:31.710> inside<00:00:32.130> well<00:00:33.110> here's<00:00:34.110> number

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
why why get inside well here's number

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.840 
why why get inside well here's number
one<00:00:34.620> reason<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.190> would<00:00:36.030> say<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.079> own

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
ECM diagnostics we just went to that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.100 
ECM diagnostics we just went to that
dynamic<00:03:07.560> monitoring<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.580> logger<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.870> is

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.979 
use whatever ones you want but here I'll
just<00:04:08.430> show<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.239> let's<00:04:09.570> just<00:04:09.660> say<00:04:09.959> I

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
just show you this so let's just say I

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.990 
just show you this so let's just say I
wanted<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.380> look<00:04:10.620> at<00:04:10.709> all<00:04:10.890> these<00:04:11.130> parameters

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
wanted to look at all these parameters

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.710 
wanted to look at all these parameters
right<00:04:12.239> here<00:04:12.450> what<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.760> sampling

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
right here what you do is a sampling

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.349 
right here what you do is a sampling
rate<00:04:15.780> one<00:04:16.350> second<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:17.340> means<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.820> tells<00:04:18.060> you

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
rate one second that means it tells you

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.180 
rate one second that means it tells you
what<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.019> going<00:04:19.169> on<00:04:19.410> in<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.620> engine<00:04:19.769> every

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
what is going on in the engine every

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.960 
what is going on in the engine every
single<00:04:20.489> second<00:04:20.989> just<00:04:21.989> going<00:04:22.200> ok<00:04:23.039> you<00:04:23.669> window

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
single second just going ok you window

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.680 
single second just going ok you window
pop-up

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
pop-up

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.410 
pop-up
voila<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.010> expand<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.490> window

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
voila you can expand this window

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.990 
voila you can expand this window
and<00:04:27.540> just<00:04:28.530> view<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.830> while<00:04:29.070> you're<00:04:29.190> driving<00:04:29.670> so

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and just view it while you're driving so

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.140 
and just view it while you're driving so
for<00:04:30.990> example<00:04:31.470> you're<00:04:32.280> going<00:04:32.460> up<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.730> steep

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
for example you're going up to steep

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.120 
for example you're going up to steep
hill<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.350> can<00:04:34.500> look<00:04:34.590> at<00:04:34.740> your<00:04:34.920> EGR

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
hill and you can look at your EGR

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.370 
hill and you can look at your EGR
temperature<00:04:35.850> how<00:04:36.210> far<00:04:36.480> is<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.660> going<00:04:36.990> what<00:04:37.260> to

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
temperature how far is it going what to

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.920 
temperature how far is it going what to
do<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.800> same<00:04:38.610> thing<00:04:38.790> with<00:04:38.880> your<00:04:38.970> coolant<00:04:39.480> and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
do it same thing with your coolant and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.650 
do it same thing with your coolant and
so<00:04:40.890> on<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:42.300> can<00:04:42.330> actually<00:04:43.100> see<00:04:44.100> any<00:04:44.660> any

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
so on and you can actually see any any

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.830 
so on and you can actually see any any
problems<00:04:46.200> in<00:04:46.320> my<00:04:46.440> rice<00:04:47.600> before<00:04:48.600> he<00:04:48.690> actually

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
problems in my rice before he actually

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.240 
problems in my rice before he actually

truck is 400 well you can make it more

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.700 
truck is 400 well you can make it more
and<00:05:52.890> you<00:05:53.130> can<00:05:53.280> bump<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.670> up<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.870> this<00:05:55.500> is<00:05:55.590> what
