00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.329
 and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.840
 this exhibition inaugurates a cycle that 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.820
 will be dedicated to collectors at 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.510
 amateurs of amateur art of decorative arts 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.890
 and design that have very beautiful 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.660
 d collections with things really 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.760
 are not accessible to the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.470
 public then what interests us if we 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.090
 start this cycle today it's because 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.010
 that on the one hand we find interesting to 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.870
 juxtapose an approach that is the one 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.120
 of a particular collector a 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.890
 free approach with the museum approach 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.750
 institutional collectors and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.700
 then on the other hand we always have such 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.290
 pleasure we discover these beautiful 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.210
 south and amateur collections that we 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.890
 wish is when it's possible 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.320
 open them and share them at 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.880
 public Bordeaux so it's with 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.830
 the exhibition of the mesnil collection 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.840
 as we inaugurate this cycle then this is 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.850
 a very large collection that starts 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.670
 with pieces of rebirth and who 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.680
 goes up to the 19th century and that runs through 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.820
 all of Europe with obviously I say 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.950
 obviously because when it comes to 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.259
 glass this is often the case a very very 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.500
 strong very strong core sets of glasses 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.630
 Venetian to Venetian and Venetian way 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.750
 since venice has really been the driving force 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.130
 in terms of severe patterns we 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.560
 called venice way had told himself that 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.710
 it was prototypes made in europe 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.570
 but very often by deducted 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.610
 artisans who came from venice or who 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.590
 was coming dalta as soon as a city in the east 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.959
 gorilla who had craftsmen who there 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.240
 was circulating and so who won a little 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.040
 the know-how the models in any 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.590
 Europe so we find in England 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.390
 in germany in bohemia in spain en 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.390
 France Greens will be without Venice 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.640
 tons 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.510
 and then we also have some pieces maybe 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.350
 more rustic a set of pieces 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 what is said of grÃ©signe 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.190
 of location this assignment 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.180
 remains to be confirmed by scientists 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.140
 but it's like that for calls 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.210
 today 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.560
 here we have quite different pieces 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.750
 finally we have a drop of pilgrims 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.910
 also that is an important piece that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.410
 we call gourd of pilgrims we know 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.240
 not very good if it's the drop that 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.220
 were wearing pilgrims it could because 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.959
 that there is an old montage and then 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.640
 it is a little flat or if it is the gur 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.290
 in which pilgrims put 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.880
 the water of holy water to bring 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.620
 this holy water in any case they are 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.050
 call today we call this 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.550
 typology group of pilgrims 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.920
 there is also a very beautiful wars 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.690
 blue 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.720
 with a round of beautiful resin patterns 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.040
 very dense which is a very very beautiful 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.170
 room that a small church that has to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.450
 should be great like that which is a 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.560
 piece all the more exceptional in the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.209
 collection that actually she had a 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.170
 accident 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.840
 Monsieur duminil unfortunately had 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.630
 an accident with her the years lens was 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.220
 broken and he had it restored by by 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.380
 of arras which is one of the very big 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.690
 Bordeaux goldsmiths and who therefore 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.640
 attached to us who actually grafted a 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.080
 a new France transforming a 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.410
 little object so it's an object 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.600
 interesting and we only have a new 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.160
 life today our two very beautiful 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.050
 Stationary parts is one and gears is 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.080
 also very monumental which is a piece 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.460
 English 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.930
 which is a rather exceptional piece 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.310
 since as Monsieur du Mesnil has it 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.140
 discovery in an auction 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.580
 we felt it was a beautiful piece 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.650
 by its exceptional proportions 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.260
 sent the engraving but in fact we 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.080
 guessed after the engraving because she 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.400
 was hidden by a veil so here it is 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.720
 how we would have done is 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 what a museum would have taken 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.690
 risk buying a piece like this 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.790
 game have surely not actually sir 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.530
 of the mini made him a kind of paris he 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.889
 bought this piece and he entrusted it 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.320
 to restaurateurs who have imagined 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.260
 techniques to recover the whole 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.970
 beauty and purity the transparency of the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.520
 wine so that we see the whole 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.000
 engraving which is an exceptional and the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.000
 bet was won 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.540
 the collector was keen to do 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.420
 packaging and transport itself 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.210
 did not take an outside team to the museum 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.230
 so as I knew him well we 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.200
 worked together 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.630
 the museum had its boxes 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.480
 arranged with josephine with foam 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.700
 and we packed the greens the most 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.400
 simply possible with bubble wrap 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.900
 possible tissue paper and we have 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.020
 transported in his car 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.350
 all these containers at the museum yesterday we have 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.300
 started today we are bullets 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.910
 on a table made with foam 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.220
 to avoid shocks and replace them 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.310
 in the windows according to the plan that has 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.660
 was determined by Madame ribes unique and 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.390
 curator and jean luc 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.000
 olive green and if it does not attract 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:34.190
 excessively fragile so you have to have 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.200
 gestures of 5 very coordinated do not 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.610
 shake and it's very reassuring in everything 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.560
 case in rising and it is posed on 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.300
 mass wood on glass it's 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.840
 much more delicate since the slightest 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.670
 shock can make a shine or to that to 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.270
 every time we unpack the glass 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.280
 look if there are any 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.100
 degradations it's the greens have 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.600
 well the trip is obviously and we 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.000
 take photographs when we 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.460
 note that there was a small glow in 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.520
 saddle and so on and then we fill a 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.129
 form is called a statement of state 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.110
 leave a trace on whether the 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.110
 will see well or not support the trip 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.340
 d 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:27.010
 so the scenography of the exhibition 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.230
 is based on two main principles 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.120
 one of the principles is by welcoming the 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.200
 philippe du mesnil's collection at 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.580
 museum of decorative arts 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.960
 it's trying to understand this too 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.990
 what is a collection and how 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.290
 it is manufactured and therefore there are several 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.540
 points of view one of the aspects of the work 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.360
 of space and that we built with a 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.300
 point of view of the prince ie a 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.550
 place in the exhibition space where 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.080
 we perceive all the verses at once so 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.000
 I let you discover where is this 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.370
 space in the houet this point pardon 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.430
 in the space of the exhibition and there we 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.380
 understands everything afterwards as you go 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.700
 that we can be born in space we will 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.200
 have little alcoves that go 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.790
 present each of the groups and 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.800
 glass types that are grouped together 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.220
 precisely by shape by color by 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.680
 time 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.870
 and here is so there really are these two 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.300
 time first where we see everything and then 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.880
 after we detail and we specify each 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.010
 each of the second laurel groups 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.410
 part in the exhibition which is the ground 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.780
 where in fact it's a 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.760
 more didactic presentation we will say 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.920
 where we explain more techniques 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.470
 and the manufacturing processes of 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.890
 objects and there it is a presentation 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.060
 so maybe more that evokes in all 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.380
 case maybe so a little 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.970
 contemporary have more free but of 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.590
 Bordeaux cabinets that were 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.030
 presentation cabinets is so there one 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:47.610
 makes the connection with the decorative arts and 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.610
 the and the link with the region 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.930
 he 

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.220
 and 

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.520
 and 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.520
 all
