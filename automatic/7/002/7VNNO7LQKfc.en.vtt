been sprayed with a dull coat to make it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.719 
been sprayed with a dull coat to make it
look<00:01:29.509> less<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.540> plastic<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.579> then<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
look less like plastic and then of

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.569 
look less like plastic and then of
course<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> mouth<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.540> lips<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.340> is<00:01:35.340> have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
course the mouth and lips and is have

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
course the mouth and lips and is have
the<00:01:35.729> gloss<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.299> give<00:01:36.329> them<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the gloss to give them a little bit of a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.160 
the gloss to give them a little bit of a
variation<00:01:38.450> which<00:01:39.450> i<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:39.750> looks<00:01:39.960> really

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
variation which i think looks really

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.510 
variation which i think looks really
