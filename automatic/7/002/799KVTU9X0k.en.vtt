 that 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.240

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.190
 many stations 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.670
 pecorella academic life has recently brought you home 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.540
 avalanche of bureaucratic roles and that 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.590

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.670
 cut out the research time for the studio tonight on TV this is what 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.640
 bureaucracy which dreams what is involved in the university 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.400
 and for the series of circumstances in recent years I love 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.100
 I was the construction site manager 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.470
 nice hello enough a yard inside the heel - the new department of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.570
 history always this to follow the work to be able to guarantee rain 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.829
 was delivered 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.960
 I wish we could move 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.469
 together with our splendid I have to say video library 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.490
 everything in the new location that needed these my practices certainly up 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.390
 exclusively for beyond the study you go to color the curtains and ai 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.490
 Brain Safety Equipment This is all in us surrender 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
 we are adapted but because it always has to do to pass 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.189
 and I had another idea and really wanted the architect 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.399
 let's start 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.000
 well it goes. then the photos are over do the sea site chief 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 significant reduction 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.590
 that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.120
 studying architecture I fell in love 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.330
 madly of history as a weapon that years 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.659
 righteous that is, she was beautiful 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:16.049
 however the first 70 years the first 70 therefore of salotti that falls the contest 63 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.249
 70 years in issime do my experiences architect of venice was 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.279
 hilarious 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.919
 was the contact with today's politics 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.649
 tested realize that there would be no one around there in 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.639
 able to explain to me how it really is designed 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.880
 also this beautiful singing and peter 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.609
 kate 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.969
 at the same time, however, it was the 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:45.159
 the way to understand that there were in the dynamics of history 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.139
 of the answers 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.260
 significant like the window of my money at the forefront 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.979
 over the years it has something to reproach itself in the 70s 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.409
 how well he treated the professors 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.289
 his professors 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:03.900
 bite from a coffee person if I never attacked any hours 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.350
 I was a bit abrupt with the drawing and survey teacher 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.710
 of architecture faculty architecture which is a bit I repeat a little pulping 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.269
 of the 70s 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.219
 pm when presenting my clear project done in a very rough way a 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.730
 that pointed to only once admits it 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.709
 eh she said to me but it sucks a little if he sure sucks but it's his fault 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.899
 because she is never there is okay 30 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:31.579
 I hope that this gender and access to all fi fiest 20sat airways to the bones are 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.609
 in short, she was a bit aggressive in bed 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.589
 for me it was kissed I think I understand why not what you would do in high school 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.899
 how much photo wall 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.989
 alice I repeated 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.669
 to the classic repeated Latin Greek postponed so I did magnificently 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.260
 elementary school 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.739
 half university would prefer 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.549
 1 talk about it arkocapil a hole in the same 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.030
 club asteria there is an institution 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.309
 please draft easily 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:59.930
 matt &amp; heath 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.149
 why? 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:05.099
 and because you are not prepared so I can get away from her to have her 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.479
 studied because it was her fault that there was never any alanine but the bud 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.179
 it is because there is always so much to 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:18.069
 themselves names and surnames of the press only the letters from today finally 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:20.870
 because contemporary history 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.900
 old we say la my subject and i lost it regionalism is part of 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.460
 natural history 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.759
 that ll how to say mortality to use this bad weather and mortality 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.850
 neonatal gaiking the movie I wouldn't have succeeded 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.250
 student mortality is greater, but contemporary history is greater 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.569
 objective problems 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.319
 history of journalism are 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:47.839
 more prepared more motivated if there is a more circumscribed dimension 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.899
 of the cell matter and coordination at the same time 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.919
 very difficult to accommodate because the dog that contains all the 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.449
 the absurdities of the lives of individuals multiplied by 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.740
 the masses and the wrong based companies. 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.919
 giorgio mouth 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.210
 talking about history soon these last words book 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.110
 we are at the end of an Italian story the story of mental essays the one in which 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.229
 for better or worse we put history together as a homeland 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.860
 what do you think 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.940
 from historian to scholar to head of the taposÃ¨ architect 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.229
 these statements so between shannon is that me 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.990
 in short, they convince or more so 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.870
 and rightly in re-evaluating some way of subject the subject was one 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.300
 the things you are 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.300
 trivially crudely trodden in short I do not 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.639
 giving it is a totally so falsifying fucking version that you anyway 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.669
 she works in the media field because she teaches communication sciences 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.130
 in the master's degree in journalism from the University of Padua 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.419
 I'm continuous 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.889
 parallel arc 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.029
 silent, however, we say here we are meda and what we watch television 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.919
 it's almost nothing looks like a crossbow that dies frankly I really do a lot and 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.009
 a lot of effort but disgusting times 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.070
 no time because I don't find anything interesting between us movies 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.430
 I like the footage of sefro with that whistle sees me 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.889
 but I have to say the TV programming of discouraging modesty 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.389
 club in short abba pater naturally accelerated dentist will approach 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.500
 stephanie salvadori the other range 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.650
 here it seems strange in the story of a great love I love you making history 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.960
 of dance
