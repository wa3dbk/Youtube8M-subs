what is up guys this is technique here
today<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:04.950> have<00:00:05.190> an<00:00:05.310> unboxing<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.120> Wi-Fi

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
today I have an unboxing of this Wi-Fi

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.509 
today I have an unboxing of this Wi-Fi
dongle<00:00:06.779> or<00:00:07.140> adapter<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.099> might<00:00:08.250> want<00:00:08.429> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
dongle or adapter is it might want to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.709 
dongle or adapter is it might want to
say<00:00:08.670> it's<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.719> sous<00:00:10.170> USB<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.010> 53<00:00:11.969> now<00:00:12.480> this

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
say it's a sous USB and 53 now this

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.200 
say it's a sous USB and 53 now this
helps<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.380> dual<00:00:13.650> band<00:00:13.950> connections<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.059> it

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
helps with dual band connections and it

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.970 
helps with dual band connections and it
helps<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> connect<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.170> five<00:00:16.710> point

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
helps you to connect to that five point

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.279 
helps you to connect to that five point
no<00:00:17.100> gigahertz<00:00:17.520> frequency<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.779> some<00:00:18.960> routers

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
no gigahertz frequency that some routers

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
no gigahertz frequency that some routers
have<00:00:19.350> nowadays<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:20.730> laptop<00:00:21.119> can't

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.139 
versus other connections this is not a
dongle<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> more<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.159> little<00:01:59.610> dock

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
dongle that one is more of a little dock

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.749 
dongle that one is more of a little dock
which<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.950> convenient<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.640> I'd

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
which is really not convenient and I'd

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.780 
which is really not convenient and I'd
rather<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.180> us<00:02:03.329> beat<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> some<00:02:04.469> other<00:02:04.619> stuff

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
rather have us beat and some other stuff

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.359

so<00:02:05.790> oh<00:02:05.969> yeah<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.390> sides<00:02:06.860> look<00:02:07.860> at<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> sides

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
so oh yeah the sides look at the sides

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.530 
so oh yeah the sides look at the sides
and<00:02:08.729> that's<00:02:09.060> pretty<00:02:09.690> much<00:02:09.979> normal<00:02:11.450> open<00:02:12.450> this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and that's pretty much normal open this

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.150 
and that's pretty much normal open this
up<00:02:12.720> real<00:02:13.110> fast<00:02:13.550> comes<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> shrink<00:02:15.300> wrap

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160
