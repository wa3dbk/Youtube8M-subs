00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
to take with them and it is kind of

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.210 
to take with them and it is kind of
rubbery<00:06:06.720> plastic<00:06:08.000> so<00:06:09.000> it's<00:06:09.420> bendable<00:06:10.220> pretty

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
rubbery plastic so it's bendable pretty

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:26.680 
rubbery plastic so it's bendable pretty
neat<00:06:11.430> I<00:06:17.480> see<00:06:18.480> some<00:06:18.690> extra<00:06:19.910> equipment<00:06:20.910> in<00:06:21.450> here

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.960 

and<00:06:28.040> there's<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.250> other<00:06:29.280> shot<00:06:29.610> of<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:29.790> fire

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
and there's the other shot of the fire

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.180 
and there's the other shot of the fire
station<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.830> it<00:06:31.950> is<00:06:32.100> a<00:06:32.130> really<00:06:32.820> cool<00:06:33.000> set<00:06:33.360> I

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
station so it is a really cool set I

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.170

think<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.340> is<00:06:35.460> actually<00:06:35.760> the<00:06:35.880> first<00:06:36.030> time

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180
