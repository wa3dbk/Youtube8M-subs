of the root canals in the human if we

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
of the root canals in the human if we
look<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.790> two<00:01:20.850> upper<00:01:21.330> premolars<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:22.170> can

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
look at these two upper premolars we can

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
look at these two upper premolars we can
see<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.710> roots<00:01:23.070> form<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.640> teeth<00:01:23.970> from<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
see how roots form on teeth from this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.340 
see how roots form on teeth from this
single<00:01:25.140> canal<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> cervical<00:01:26.909> line<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.540> the

illustrated by this this tooth on the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.640 
illustrated by this this tooth on the
right<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.509> division<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> two

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
right you see the division in the two

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.639 
right you see the division in the two
canals<00:01:41.360> within<00:01:42.360> each<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> these<00:01:42.899> canals<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
canals within each of these canals you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.730 
canals within each of these canals you
can<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.850> formation<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:46.470> than

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
can then have the formation of more than

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.030 
can then have the formation of more than
one<00:01:46.979> canal<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.470> how<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.740> get

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
one canal and so that is how we get

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.600 
one canal and so that is how we get
multiple<00:01:50.549> canals<00:01:50.939> within<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> roots<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:53.040> we

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
multiple canals within the roots if we

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.810 
multiple canals within the roots if we
look<00:01:53.850> at<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.869> illustration<00:01:55.320> again<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.640> two

or<00:02:11.790> top<00:02:12.270> canal<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
or top canal that you see in this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 
or top canal that you see in this
-<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:15.030> see<00:02:15.330> there's<00:02:15.780> going<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.140> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
- you can see there's going to be a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.680 
- you can see there's going to be a
division<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.550> tooth<00:02:17.819> into<00:02:18.090> two<00:02:18.330> canals

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
division of this tooth into two canals

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.740 
division of this tooth into two canals
thus<00:02:19.500> both<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.130> these<00:02:20.280> teeth<00:02:20.550> will<00:02:20.880> wind<00:02:21.569> up

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
thus both of these teeth will wind up

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.170 
thus both of these teeth will wind up
with<00:02:21.930> three<00:02:22.200> canals<00:02:22.530> while<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.550> formation

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
with three canals while the formation

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.630 
with three canals while the formation
was<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.050> same<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.770> two<00:02:25.950> canals<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
was not the same in the two canals and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.309 
was not the same in the two canals and
treatments<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.480> different<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.170> in

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
treatments going to be different here in

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.380 
treatments going to be different here in
these<00:02:28.980> teeth<00:02:29.310> because<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> way<00:02:30.209> these

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
these teeth because of the way these

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the mesial root of a mandibular molar

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.580 
the mesial root of a mandibular molar
now<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.300> only<00:02:57.600> difference<00:02:58.170> between<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
now the only difference between a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.949 
now the only difference between a
permanent<00:02:59.190> tooth<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.880> primary<00:03:00.150> tooth<00:03:00.630> is

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
permanent tooth and a primary tooth is

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.259 
permanent tooth and a primary tooth is
the<00:03:01.590> fact<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.920> once<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> primary<00:03:02.580> tooth<00:03:03.030> has

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
the fact that once the primary tooth has

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.660 
the fact that once the primary tooth has
completed<00:03:03.750> its<00:03:03.959> route<00:03:04.230> length<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.950> starts<00:03:05.519> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
completed its route length it starts to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.060 
completed its route length it starts to
resorb<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.510> if<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.170> notice<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> difference

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
resorb and if you notice the difference

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.940 
resorb and if you notice the difference
in<00:03:08.220> two<00:03:08.370> apical<00:03:08.820> ends<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.360> these<00:03:09.540> three

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
in two apical ends of these three

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.530 
in two apical ends of these three
schematics<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.100> will<00:03:11.220> see<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.670> illustrated

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
schematics you will see that illustrated

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.060 
schematics you will see that illustrated
and<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.590> that's<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.780> difference<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.320> primary

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
and so that's a difference the primary

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.390 
and so that's a difference the primary
tooth<00:03:17.370> never<00:03:18.060> has<00:03:18.390> an<00:03:18.600> apical<00:03:18.900> constriction

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
tooth never has an apical constriction

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.069 
tooth never has an apical constriction
whereas<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> permanent<00:03:20.970> tooth<00:03:21.150> goes<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
whereas a permanent tooth goes on and

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.530 
whereas a permanent tooth goes on and
develops<00:03:22.470> an<00:03:22.650> apical<00:03:23.070> constriction<00:03:23.540> because

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
develops an apical constriction because

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.350 
develops an apical constriction because
you<00:03:24.780> don't<00:03:24.959> have<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> resourcing<00:03:25.860> going<00:03:26.130> on

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
you don't have the resourcing going on

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.509 
you don't have the resourcing going on
but<00:03:27.360> on<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.720> left<00:03:27.989> schematic<00:03:28.620> there's<00:03:29.220> one

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
but on the left schematic there's one

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.960 
but on the left schematic there's one
canal<00:03:29.910> one<00:03:30.570> route<00:03:30.810> one<00:03:31.230> canal<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.640> look<00:03:32.820> in

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
canal one route one canal if you look in

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.819 
canal one route one canal if you look in
the<00:03:33.090> middle<00:03:33.269> schematic<00:03:34.049> what<00:03:34.320> has<00:03:34.440> happened

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
the middle schematic what has happened

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.850 
the middle schematic what has happened
here<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.350> because<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.530> root<00:03:37.709> is

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
here is that because the root is

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.039 
here is that because the root is
narrower<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> center<00:03:39.150> you've<00:03:39.780> had<00:03:40.019> a

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
narrower in the center you've had a

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.500 
narrower in the center you've had a
coming<00:03:40.500> together<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.820> mesial<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.420> distal

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
coming together of the mesial and distal

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.500 
coming together of the mesial and distal
aspect<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.590> root<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.700> fuses<00:03:45.269> and

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
aspect of the root and this fuses and

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.690 
aspect of the root and this fuses and
then<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.989> start<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.410> grow<00:03:46.560> islands<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.310> dentin

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
then you start to grow islands of dentin

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.630 
then you start to grow islands of dentin
this<00:03:48.510> happens<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.140> multiple<00:03:49.380> places<00:03:49.950> up<00:03:50.489> and

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
this happens in multiple places up and

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.420 
this happens in multiple places up and
down<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.970> root<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.600> this<00:03:52.500> eventually<00:03:52.890> in

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
down the root and this eventually in

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.610 
down the root and this eventually in
most<00:03:53.820> teeth<00:03:54.150> will<00:03:54.840> go<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.410> third

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
most teeth will go to the third

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.680 
most teeth will go to the third
schematic<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.549> right<00:03:56.760> where<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.450> have<00:03:57.660> a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
schematic on the right where you have a

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.710 
schematic on the right where you have a
division<00:03:58.049> into<00:03:58.470> two<00:03:58.500> separate<00:03:59.040> canals<00:03:59.540> but<00:04:00.540> in

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
division into two separate canals but in

division into two separate canals but in
some<00:04:00.989> teeth<00:04:01.290> we<00:04:02.010> have<00:04:02.250> these<00:04:02.850> channels

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
some teeth we have these channels

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.420 
some teeth we have these channels
continue<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.200> exist<00:04:04.530> across<00:04:04.920> here<00:04:05.310> and

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
continue to exist across here and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.650 
continue to exist across here and
they're<00:04:05.640> called<00:04:06.000> isthmus

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
they're called isthmus

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.780 
they're called isthmus
the<00:04:07.380> problem<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.190> conventional

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
the problem is that a conventional

the problem is that a conventional
radiograph<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:10.109> can't<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:10.769> those<00:04:10.980> isthmus

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
radiograph we can't see those isthmus

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.670 
radiograph we can't see those isthmus
ease<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.420> other<00:04:12.600> problem<00:04:13.109> is<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.590> our

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
ease the other problem is that our

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.740 
ease the other problem is that our
instruments<00:04:14.340> do<00:04:14.519> not<00:04:14.549> go<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.209> there<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.600> can

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
instruments do not go in there you can

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.360 
instruments do not go in there you can
never<00:04:15.989> get<00:04:16.200> an<00:04:16.320> instrument<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.890> go<00:04:17.010> into<00:04:17.250> those

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
never get an instrument to go into those

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.699 
never get an instrument to go into those
channels<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:18.090> therefore<00:04:19.049> we're<00:04:19.229> dependent

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
channels and therefore we're dependent

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.190 
channels and therefore we're dependent
upon<00:04:19.799> having<00:04:20.250> good<00:04:21.000> irrigation<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.930> try<00:04:22.140> to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
upon having good irrigation to try to

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.160 
upon having good irrigation to try to
wash<00:04:22.500> out<00:04:22.740> debris<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.430> bacteria

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
wash out debris in bacteria

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.310 
wash out debris in bacteria
might<00:04:24.380> be<00:04:24.590> in<00:04:24.740> those<00:04:24.980> channels<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:26.570> there's

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
might be in those channels so there's

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.290 
might be in those channels so there's
one<00:04:27.560> other<00:04:27.770> aspect<00:04:28.040> of<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.730> development<00:04:29.270> that

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
one other aspect of the development that

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.600 
one other aspect of the development that
you<00:04:29.570> need<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.870> be<00:04:30.020> aware<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:31.220> creates

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
you need to be aware of that creates

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.150 
you need to be aware of that creates
problems<00:04:32.060> for<00:04:32.150> us<00:04:32.480> because<00:04:33.410> these<00:04:33.620> routes<00:04:33.950> are

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
problems for us because these routes are

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.420 
problems for us because these routes are
wider<00:04:34.490> at<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.210> exterior<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.740> canals<00:04:37.130> us

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
wider at the exterior and the canals us

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.700 
wider at the exterior and the canals us
are<00:04:37.610> going<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.820> be<00:04:37.910> wider<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:39.350> get<00:04:39.530> this

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
are going to be wider as you get this

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.730 
are going to be wider as you get this

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
division it leaves a projection going

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.950
