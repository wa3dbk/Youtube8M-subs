00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.510
 good morning everyone we are in the studio 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.300
 phytodesign next to me and Julia 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.450
 Mikhina plant specialist pay 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.800
 attention behind our backs now 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.169
 amazing designs like her 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.619
 called and why we need to know right 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.140
 now 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.110
 good morning this construct is called 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.630
 Florarium is a device for 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.090
 growing plant headlights we were 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.950
 invented back in the nineteenth century 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.290
 really everything new is good 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.470
 forgotten old two centuries ago 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.150
 florarium and already existed in the world 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.490
 looked different but did the same 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.650
 feature as modern flyer in 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.239
 allows us to grow a plant in those 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.150
 places where there is no such as sunlight 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.489
 it can also be placed near 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.399
 air conditioners where plants come from 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.280
 the tropics will not grow what could be 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.409
 then a dark hall or corridor office can 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.630
 be no windowsills or very 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.820
 small windows julia also build 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.819
 modern in advance there are lamps for 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.979
 lighting sun substitute is also 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:18.850
 timer for convenience ie it includes 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.210
 and turns off the light at the right time 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.889
 you can fix the cover florarium a 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.289
 easy enough and most importantly 

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:30.829
 to save time there is 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.959
 double pan light them watering in the world 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.850
 there is a huge number of forms 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.310
 florarium of it can be not only 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.499
 wall configurations but also floor 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.749
 florarium can be made in the base in 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.429
 the aquarium is to create 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:45.940
 plants need conditions 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:49.210
 microclimate we will not leave the viewer 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.530
 from yummy amazed to our plants 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.720
 dictionaries she has such plants can be 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.520
 absolutely any but plus probably 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 florarium and the fact that we can plant 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.170
 there are very moisture-loving requiring 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.960
 frequent watering plants can be planted 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.000
 some orchids burma or you make a noise 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.850
 some exotic plants which 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.750
 suffer from dry air there 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.140
 drafts just take a flower to dry 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.140
 we know 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.510
 florarium and enjoys in the city 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.230
 popular where their most often possible 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.450
 meet enjoy at collectors and 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.840
 lovers that I really want 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 take care of office space in showrooms 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.420
 beauty cost florarium of 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.430
 varies from two three thousand rubles to 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.319
 20-30 thousand rubles 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 naturally it all depends on the complexity 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.780
 any person can make designs 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.030
 not necessarily an expert all pretty 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.030
 just exactly like you transplant 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.519
 plant in the ground for from the main thing so that 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.709
 you had a capacious substrate but at the same time 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.959
 should be loose julia trusted me 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.209
 add water to the liquid should be 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.170
 a little bit but if you donâ€™t 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.909
 leave for a month another from the city 15 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.400
 minutes and everything is ready with us 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.760
 that with the whole there is a picture and how it is 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.760
 should look like 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.960
 ground cover plants such as the chiton 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.790
 and with the former will gradually close 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.270
 the soil surface is not visible 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.080
 will be 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.660
 there will be such a full picture and alive 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.370
 plants many keep pets 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.820
 and probably not once faced with the fact that 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.820
 cats eat plants here they are 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.680
 reliably protected allergies are also not 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.850
 sneeze dust does not accumulate 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.520
 placed Alexander link 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.520
