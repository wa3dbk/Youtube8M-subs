00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.030
 This is 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.469
 good choice 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.240
 the silver Renault 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.240
 it is wonderful 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.340
 we also have all the funny question to negotiate with each other for 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.590
 practices listening to music 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.590
 that sounds like music is a kind of snow 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 When we touch it, one folds one's hands 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 or some kind of water where you get your fingers 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.070
 their children are not that easy 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.570
 and I want to do a little experiment with you now 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.770
 that's completely wise 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.360
 there are big ones so one comes to Luhmer and represented 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.640
 so and now you do the following 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 So I'll say the experiment with the Bo first 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.550
 what about Dr 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 Left 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.650
 and fits the wanted 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 ERA 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.590
 I am now I say the word to you 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.220
 Tactics Tel 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.940
 everyday what suits 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 the view 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 and they wanted to 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.080
 fal you did a great job 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.730
 and now many kids seems to be weird so i see you now as 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.380
 first a piece by Beethoven like that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.850
 an aria 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.899
 off the top for the region but I give it no effect 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 Sondelfingen that must also La La La 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.079
 AFP 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.379
 Hero myths percent accepted 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.990
 what was that 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.990
 Mayrhuber or packages 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.149
 characteristic 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.569
 so i have a first part answer to my topic how would music turn on 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.199
 Music has power 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.989
 feel 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.419
 and music generates fervor now 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.399
 Scared joy 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.809
 fod
