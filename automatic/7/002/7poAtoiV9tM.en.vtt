00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.710
 but have other 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 It has a very accommodation 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.500
 comfortable a hotel accommodation with

 we also have on the beach one of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.750
 the best summer schools according to the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.790
 specialized company 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.340
 and talking facilities when a 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.980
 internet lagoon I check that three 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.200
 four quarters of the existing offer of 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.540
 everything that comes out internet does not have 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.030
 facilities subcontracts everything 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.140
 the only good you have with 50 is 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.909
 the page 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.460
 this circumstance in addition to 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.570
 amaze me suggests little gain 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.210
 success and lots of improvisation 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.090
 the facilities are determinant for 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.830
 offer a quality service and if you 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.030
 they have in direct management better than 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.729
 best 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.530
 the accommodation the restoration and the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.690
 activities require a staff 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.690
 specific and a forecast 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.490
 detailed needs 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.070
 It takes us several times 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 prepare the vegan yet taking in 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.979
 mind that we have all the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.979
 facilities at our disposal 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.170
 the second reason that hybrid are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.610
 our human resources 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.770

 we have two work teams 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.490
 it's so it 's a very different 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.460
 big 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.960
 to everything complete because he learns two 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.770
 work teams the monitor ratio 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.390

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.980
 they rest 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.270
 and that means that dealing with the world 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.390
 education sports everything improves 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.160

 let's say from that subject a lot 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.830
 and the third 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.200
