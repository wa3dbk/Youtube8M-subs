00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
position that this arm is very straight

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.869 
position that this arm is very straight
like<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:38.129> want<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> make<00:00:38.489> sure<00:00:38.520> it's

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
like this and you want to make sure it's

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.209

as straight up and down as possible now

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.970 
as straight up and down as possible now
there<00:00:41.399> are<00:00:41.520> variations<00:00:41.879> where<00:00:42.870> sometimes<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
there are variations where sometimes you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
there are variations where sometimes you
know<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.309> might<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.789> there<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:45.600> here

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
know you might be about there or here

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500 
know you might be about there or here
but<00:00:46.649> somewhere<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.239> arm

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but somewhere in here you want that arm

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360 
but somewhere in here you want that arm
pretty<00:00:49.170> straight<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:49.860> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
pretty straight that's kind of the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.819 
pretty straight that's kind of the
wiggle<00:00:50.700> room<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.059> go<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
wiggle room to go from from here all the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
wiggle room to go from from here all the
way<00:00:53.280> over<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> key<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
way over to here but the key is to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.779 
way over to here but the key is to
really<00:00:55.469> feel<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:56.070> extending<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
really feel like you're extending that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.209 
really feel like you're extending that
arm<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.809> many<00:00:57.960> different<00:00:58.230> reasons<00:00:58.440> but

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
arm for for many different reasons but

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.220 
arm for for many different reasons but
it's<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> most<00:00:59.760> efficient<00:01:00.359> way<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> serve<00:01:00.930> too

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
it's the most efficient way to serve too

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.590 
it's the most efficient way to serve too
many<00:01:01.410> players<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> serve<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.550> over<00:01:03.239> here
