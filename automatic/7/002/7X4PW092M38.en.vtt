sharks are amazingly amazing ancient

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.579 
sharks are amazingly amazing ancient
creatures<00:00:02.970> but<00:00:03.240> let's<00:00:03.419> be<00:00:03.600> honest<00:00:03.929> how<00:00:04.440> they

thank you for coming we're here to talk
a<00:00:20.400> little<00:00:20.730> bit<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:21.230> sharks<00:00:22.230> X<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.160> that

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
a little bit about sharks X we know that

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.220 
a little bit about sharks X we know that
sharks<00:00:23.699> there<00:00:23.939> they're<00:00:24.359> ancient<00:00:24.660> they're

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
sharks there they're ancient they're

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320 
sharks there they're ancient they're
fish<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:25.980> scales<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.730> we've<00:00:27.029> learned

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
fish they have scales we we've learned

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
fish they have scales we we've learned
this<00:00:27.510> throughout<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.320> years<00:00:28.560> doing<00:00:28.830> Shark

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this throughout the years doing Shark

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.330 
this throughout the years doing Shark
Week<00:00:29.250> stuff<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:30.480> they<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.410> also<00:00:31.679> both

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
Week stuff but they are also both

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.120 
Week stuff but they are also both
egg-laying<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.989> over<00:00:34.500> pers<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> also

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
egg-laying so over pers and also

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.310 
egg-laying so over pers and also
viviparous<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:35.880> live<00:00:36.270> birth<00:00:36.630> correct

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
viviparous or live birth correct

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619 
viviparous or live birth correct
so<00:00:37.680> there's<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> big<00:00:38.280> diversity<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.210> sharks<00:00:39.510> out

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so there's a big diversity of sharks out

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
so there's a big diversity of sharks out
there<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:40.110> than<00:00:40.200> 400<00:00:40.770> species<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.430> some<00:00:41.579> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
there more than 400 species and some of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
there more than 400 species and some of
them<00:00:41.760> lay<00:00:41.910> eggs<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.870> eggs<00:00:42.899> develop

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
them lay eggs and the eggs develop

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.690 
them lay eggs and the eggs develop
outside<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> shark<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.550> they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
outside of the shark and then they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
outside of the shark and then they
clothed<00:00:45.059> into<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.480> pups<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
clothed into little pups and some of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.799 
clothed into little pups and some of
them<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.010> egg<00:00:47.160> cloade<00:00:47.700> inside<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> shark<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
them the egg cloade inside the shark and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.680 
them the egg cloade inside the shark and
then<00:00:49.200> develops<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.700> they<00:00:51.030> give<00:00:51.210> birth

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
then develops and then they give birth

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
then develops and then they give birth
to<00:00:52.020> live<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.890> pups

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to live little pups

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
to live little pups
so<00:00:53.550> most<00:00:53.789> fish<00:00:54.090> when<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.629> fish<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
so most fish when you think of fish you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.650 
so most fish when you think of fish you
think<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> tuna<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.520> lays<00:00:56.760> millions<00:00:57.539> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
think about a tuna that lays millions of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.360 
think about a tuna that lays millions of
eggs<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> eggs<00:00:59.160> are

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
eggs right and then all the eggs are

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.889 
eggs right and then all the eggs are
clubbed<00:00:59.579> into<00:00:59.789> tiny<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.180> larvae<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
clubbed into tiny little larvae the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.299 
clubbed into tiny little larvae the
Sharks<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> different<00:01:01.859> strategy

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Sharks they use a different strategy

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820 
Sharks they use a different strategy
they<00:01:03.090> invest<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.930> energy<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.619> their

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
they invest a lot of energy in their

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.890 
they invest a lot of energy in their
eggs<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.369> their<00:01:05.909> pups<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.540> sure<00:01:06.720> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
eggs and their pups to make sure that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300 
eggs and their pups to make sure that
when<00:01:07.080> they're<00:01:07.200> born<00:01:07.470> they're<00:01:07.740> born<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> big

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
when they're born they're born in a big

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520 
when they're born they're born in a big
size<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.880> their<00:01:09.360> escape<00:01:09.750> route<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.260> predation

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
size and their escape route of predation

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
size and their escape route of predation
so<00:01:10.920> they're<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.430> vulnerable<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
so they're not as vulnerable to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
so they're not as vulnerable to
predation<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> tiny<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.740> larvae<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
predation as the tiny little larvae of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.249 
predation as the tiny little larvae of
the<00:01:14.400> tuna<00:01:14.700> floating<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> open<00:01:15.930> oceans

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the tuna floating out in the open oceans

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.719 
the tuna floating out in the open oceans
ok<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.619> there's<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.009> an<00:01:17.159> evolutionary

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
ok so there's like an evolutionary

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.460 
ok so there's like an evolutionary
advantage<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> take<00:01:18.810> care<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> their

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
advantage for them to take care of their

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
advantage for them to take care of their
their<00:01:19.890> pups<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.549> right<00:01:20.729> sure<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.210> can

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
their pups and right sure that they can

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
their pups and right sure that they can
survive<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.080> nature<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.310> general<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:23.909> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
survive in nature in general a lot of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.350 
survive in nature in general a lot of
predators<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.710> strategy<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.610> invest

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
predators use that strategy they invest

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
predators use that strategy they invest
more<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.930> their<00:01:28.110> offspring<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.640> have

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
more in their offspring and they have

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
more in their offspring and they have
bigger<00:01:30.030> offspring<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.960> parental<00:01:31.380> care

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
bigger offspring they have parental care

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
bigger offspring they have parental care
sometimes<00:01:31.770> sharks<00:01:32.310> usually<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.329> have

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
sometimes sharks usually don't they have

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
sometimes sharks usually don't they have
fewer<00:01:33.659> offspring<00:01:33.900> also<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:34.920> have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
fewer offspring also because they have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.429 
fewer offspring also because they have
smaller<00:01:35.549> populations<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.299> predators<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
smaller populations of predators you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
smaller populations of predators you
can't<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> lot<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> predators<00:01:38.490> because

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
can't have a lot of predators because

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.280 
can't have a lot of predators because
they're<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> food<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:39.780> them<00:01:40.110> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
they're not a lot of food for them so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
they're not a lot of food for them so
they're<00:01:40.439> limited<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:40.799> their<00:01:41.130> food<00:01:41.340> mmm<00:01:41.939> how<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
they're limited by their food mmm how is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.830 
they're limited by their food mmm how is
it<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.530> sharks<00:01:43.860> kind<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.369> get<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it that you know sharks kind of get you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.630 
it that you know sharks kind of get you
know<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.770> something<00:01:47.340> else

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
know how do they do it something else

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.730 
know how do they do it something else
unusual<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.360> sharks<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.899> most<00:01:49.110> fish<00:01:49.439> they

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
unusual about sharks so most fish they

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.319 
unusual about sharks so most fish they
have<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.250> call<00:01:50.430> external<00:01:50.939> fertilization

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
have what we call external fertilization

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
have what we call external fertilization
so<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.930> lay<00:01:52.140> their<00:01:52.320> eggs<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> water

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so they lay their eggs out in the water

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160 
so they lay their eggs out in the water
the<00:01:53.700> male's<00:01:53.939> come<00:01:54.240> back<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.990> lay

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the male's come back and then they lay

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.340 
the male's come back and then they lay
the<00:01:55.409> sperm<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.460> mix<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> water

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
the sperm out they mix in the water

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.389 
the sperm out they mix in the water
externally<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.560> that's<00:01:58.920> where<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> eggs

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
externally and that's where the eggs

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
externally and that's where the eggs
form<00:01:59.939> sharks<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.899> internal

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
form sharks they have internal

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.870 
form sharks they have internal
fertilization<00:02:02.070> okay

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
fertilization okay

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
fertilization okay
and<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.600> mayor<00:02:03.869> sharks<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.290> two<00:02:04.500> penises

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and in mayor sharks have two penises

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.839 
and in mayor sharks have two penises
okay<00:02:05.640> wow<00:02:06.680> that's<00:02:07.680> that's<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.220> surprise<00:02:08.580> yeah

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
okay wow that's that's a surprise yeah

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.150 
okay wow that's that's a surprise yeah
some<00:02:09.179> species<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.989> bite<00:02:10.500> one<00:02:11.009> under

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
some species that you can bite one under

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.740 
some species that you can bite one under
sort<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.430> males<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:11.790> bite<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.330> sides<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
sort of males they bite the sides of the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.370 
sort of males they bite the sides of the
female

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
female

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.290 
female
and<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.010> internal<00:02:14.340> fertilisation<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and they have internal fertilisation and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.750 
and they have internal fertilisation and
that's<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.840> Alex<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.890> pups<00:02:17.340> develop

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that's the Alex and the pups develop

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.670 
that's the Alex and the pups develop
inside<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.240> females<00:02:18.570> opinion<00:02:19.020> which<00:02:19.380> species

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
inside the females opinion which species

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680 
inside the females opinion which species
it<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.640> shark<00:02:20.880> isn't<00:02:21.210> necessarily

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
it is so the shark isn't necessarily

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.330 
it is so the shark isn't necessarily
even<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> oviparous<00:02:22.620> sharks<00:02:23.190> aren't

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
even the oviparous sharks aren't

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.700 
even the oviparous sharks aren't
necessarily<00:02:23.670> laying<00:02:24.000> eggs<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:25.080> waiting

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
necessarily laying eggs and then waiting

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.890 
necessarily laying eggs and then waiting
for<00:02:25.920> someone<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.700> come<00:02:26.850> along<00:02:27.090> overt<00:02:27.390> Eliza<00:02:27.630> so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
for someone to come along overt Eliza so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.870 
for someone to come along overt Eliza so
what<00:02:28.110> about<00:02:28.200> parthenogenesis<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.520> they<00:02:29.670> be

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
what about parthenogenesis can they be

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.630 
what about parthenogenesis can they be
born<00:02:30.270> pregnant<00:02:30.960> and/or<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.220> virgin

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
born pregnant and/or have like a virgin

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640 
born pregnant and/or have like a virgin
birth<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.210> will<00:02:33.360> right<00:02:33.660> right<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
birth if you will right right the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.470 
birth if you will right right the
females<00:02:35.010> when<00:02:35.340> they<00:02:35.460> spend<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.850> long<00:02:36.030> time

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
females when they spend a long time

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.880 
females when they spend a long time
isolated<00:02:36.900> from<00:02:37.020> males<00:02:37.260> when<00:02:37.500> they<00:02:37.590> don't<00:02:37.680> have

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
isolated from males when they don't have

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.740 
isolated from males when they don't have
any<00:02:38.040> contact<00:02:38.400> with<00:02:38.430> males<00:02:38.730> they<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.240> produce

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
any contact with males they can produce

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.610 
any contact with males they can produce
clones<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.800> themselves<00:02:40.950> basically<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
clones of themselves basically and and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.290 
clones of themselves basically and and
give<00:02:43.800> birth<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.340> other<00:02:44.490> little<00:02:44.760> females<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
give birth to other little females and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.660 
give birth to other little females and
that's<00:02:45.420> part<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:45.960> Oh<00:02:46.050> Genesis<00:02:46.500> hmm<00:02:46.950> that's<00:02:47.430> one

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
that's part in Oh Genesis hmm that's one

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that's part in Oh Genesis hmm that's one
of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.850> things<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.210> allowed<00:02:48.450> them<00:02:48.660> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
of the things that allowed them to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.720 
of the things that allowed them to
survive<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.440> long<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.890> evolutionary

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
survive so long in evolutionary

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.130 
survive so long in evolutionary
evolutionary<00:02:51.270> history<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:52.020> they

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
evolutionary history is because they

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.230 
evolutionary history is because they
have<00:02:52.290> all<00:02:52.500> these<00:02:52.530> different<00:02:53.490> strategies<00:02:53.760> so

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
have all these different strategies so

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.270 
have all these different strategies so
when<00:02:54.360> they<00:02:54.480> can't<00:02:54.690> find<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.990> mate<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:56.040> can

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
when they can't find a mate they can

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.980 
when they can't find a mate they can
give<00:02:56.670> birth<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.000> clones<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.630> keep<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
give birth to clones and just keep the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.410 
give birth to clones and just keep the
species<00:02:58.380> going<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.950> they<00:02:59.520> make<00:02:59.730> once<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.390> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
species going if they make once with a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.510 
species going if they make once with a
male<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:01.320> can<00:03:01.500> store<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.920> sperm<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:02.460> a

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
male they can store that sperm for a

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.580 
male they can store that sperm for a
long<00:03:02.700> time<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.210> then<00:03:03.360> keep<00:03:03.600> using<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.110> right

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
long time and then keep using it right

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.520 
long time and then keep using it right
yeah<00:03:04.950> we<00:03:05.400> were<00:03:05.580> discussing<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.390> Brown<00:03:06.750> banded

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
yeah we were discussing the Brown banded

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.550 
yeah we were discussing the Brown banded
bamboo<00:03:08.250> shark<00:03:08.580> which<00:03:08.970> can<00:03:09.150> store<00:03:09.510> sperm<00:03:10.290> for

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
bamboo shark which can store sperm for

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.410 
bamboo shark which can store sperm for
how<00:03:10.740> long<00:03:10.980> yeah<00:03:11.220> almost<00:03:11.400> five<00:03:11.820> years<00:03:11.850> that's

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
how long yeah almost five years that's

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.160 
how long yeah almost five years that's
crazy

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
crazy

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.020 
crazy
a<00:03:13.380> woman<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:14.010> store<00:03:14.250> sperm<00:03:14.550> in<00:03:14.760> her<00:03:14.790> vagina

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
a woman can store sperm in her vagina

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.930 
a woman can store sperm in her vagina
for<00:03:15.390> like<00:03:15.540> five<00:03:15.810> days<00:03:15.840> right<00:03:16.620> roughly<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.610> five

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
for like five days right roughly so five

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.620 
for like five days right roughly so five
years<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.050> just<00:03:19.530> that's<00:03:20.100> insane<00:03:20.640> yes<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.480> my

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
years is just that's insane yes so my

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.750 
years is just that's insane yes so my
guess<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.840> evolutionarily<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.190> would<00:03:23.400> come

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
guess is evolutionarily this would come

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.820 
guess is evolutionarily this would come
about<00:03:23.880> because<00:03:24.210> they're<00:03:24.630> either<00:03:24.750> isolated<00:03:25.590> or

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
about because they're either isolated or

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.670 
about because they're either isolated or
for<00:03:26.430> mate<00:03:26.610> selection<00:03:26.850> even<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.170> actively

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
for mate selection even it is actively

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.520 
for mate selection even it is actively
being<00:03:28.860> studied<00:03:29.280> too<00:03:29.640> but<00:03:29.940> we're<00:03:30.210> not<00:03:30.450> sure

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
being studied too but we're not sure

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.900 
being studied too but we're not sure
some<00:03:31.530> males<00:03:31.740> they<00:03:31.920> have<00:03:32.040> better<00:03:32.250> sperm<00:03:32.700> than

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
some males they have better sperm than

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.700 
some males they have better sperm than
other<00:03:33.060> males<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.720> even<00:03:34.110> when<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.410> stored

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
other males and even when it's stored

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.110 
other males and even when it's stored
together<00:03:34.890> with<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.280> sperm<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.670> other<00:03:35.850> males

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
together with the sperm of other males

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.000 
together with the sperm of other males
that<00:03:36.510> their<00:03:36.840> sperm<00:03:37.140> from<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.470> better<00:03:37.710> males

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that their sperm from the better males

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.850 
that their sperm from the better males
it<00:03:38.520> lives<00:03:38.970> longer<00:03:39.090> yeah<00:03:39.780> how<00:03:40.320> did<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.530> guys

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
it lives longer yeah how did you guys

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.280 
it lives longer yeah how did you guys
discover<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.910> was<00:03:42.150> going<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.750> right

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
discover that this was going on right

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.320 
discover that this was going on right
right<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.770> that<00:03:43.890> was<00:03:44.040> an<00:03:44.160> interesting<00:03:44.670> story

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
right so that was an interesting story

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.090 
right so that was an interesting story
yes<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.020> think<00:03:46.260> was<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.410> first<00:03:46.530> project

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
yes that I think was the first project

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.710 
yes that I think was the first project
that<00:03:47.340> was<00:03:47.580> given<00:03:47.940> when<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.120> arrived<00:03:48.450> at<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that was given when I arrived at the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.960 
that was given when I arrived at the
Academy<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.950> folks<00:03:50.190> at<00:03:50.310> they<00:03:50.460> Steinhart

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
Academy the folks at they Steinhart

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.000 
Academy the folks at they Steinhart
aquarium<00:03:51.090> they<00:03:52.050> came<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.410> me<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.740> curious

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
aquarium they came to me this curious

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.750 
aquarium they came to me this curious
case<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.490> they<00:03:53.610> had<00:03:53.820> kept<00:03:54.690> those<00:03:55.050> three<00:03:55.350> female

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
case so they had kept those three female

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.460 
case so they had kept those three female
brain<00:03:56.760> browband<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.390> bamboo<00:03:57.750> sharks<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.320> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
brain browband and bamboo sharks in the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.000 
brain browband and bamboo sharks in the
tank<00:03:58.740> for<00:03:59.490> almost<00:04:00.150> five<00:04:00.480> years<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.170> they

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
tank for almost five years and they

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.120 
tank for almost five years and they
always<00:04:02.340> laid<00:04:02.550> eggs<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> eggs<00:04:03.210> were<00:04:03.570> never

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
always laid eggs and the eggs were never

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.680 
always laid eggs and the eggs were never
viable<00:04:05.130> because<00:04:05.910> there<00:04:06.270> were<00:04:06.330> no<00:04:06.450> males

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
viable because there were no males

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.740 
viable because there were no males
around<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.260> then<00:04:07.380> one<00:04:07.920> day<00:04:08.160> one<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.090> eggs

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
around but then one day one of the eggs

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.690 
around but then one day one of the eggs
became<00:04:10.530> viable<00:04:10.770> there<00:04:11.070> was<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.190> little<00:04:11.310> pup<00:04:11.550> in

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
became viable there was a little pup in

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.670 
became viable there was a little pup in
there<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.000> was<00:04:12.090> born<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.260> everything

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
there and it was born and and everything

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.590 
there and it was born and and everything
and<00:04:14.070> they<00:04:14.340> were<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:14.640> what<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.060> happened

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
and they were like what is happened

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.930 
and they were like what is happened
everybody<00:04:15.930> was<00:04:16.350> very<00:04:16.950> surprised<00:04:17.460> about<00:04:17.760> it

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
everybody was very surprised about it

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.849 
everybody was very surprised about it
and<00:04:18.210> I<00:04:18.330> told<00:04:18.510> them<00:04:18.630> he<00:04:18.750> needed<00:04:19.020> you<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.260> give<00:04:19.680> me

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
and I told them he needed you to give me

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.620 
and I told them he needed you to give me
a<00:04:19.920> little<00:04:20.160> tissue<00:04:20.400> sample<00:04:20.880> off<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.210> pup<00:04:21.419> and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
a little tissue sample off the pup and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.510 
a little tissue sample off the pup and
off<00:04:21.930> all<00:04:22.229> three<00:04:22.440> mothers<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.310> could

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
off all three mothers so that I could

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.640 
off all three mothers so that I could
figure<00:04:23.760> out<00:04:23.880> what<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.300> was<00:04:24.479> we<00:04:24.810> did<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.410> series

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
figure out what it was we did the series

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.700 
figure out what it was we did the series
of<00:04:25.919> genetic<00:04:26.310> tests

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
of genetic tests

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.290 
of genetic tests
that<00:04:26.889> were<00:04:27.009> inconclusive<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.880> then<00:04:28.000> we

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
that were inconclusive and then we

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.450 
that were inconclusive and then we
finally<00:04:28.570> did<00:04:28.960> one<00:04:29.199> that<00:04:29.440> looked<00:04:29.860> at<00:04:30.009> hundreds

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
finally did one that looked at hundreds

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.820 
finally did one that looked at hundreds
of<00:04:30.699> genes<00:04:31.030> at<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> same<00:04:31.570> time<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.020> with<00:04:32.620> that

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
of genes at the same time and with that

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.890 
of genes at the same time and with that
test<00:04:33.130> we<00:04:33.490> found<00:04:33.820> what<00:04:34.090> we<00:04:34.180> call<00:04:34.419> private's

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
test we found what we call private's

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.730 
test we found what we call private's
alleles<00:04:35.470> its<00:04:36.180> alleles<00:04:37.180> in<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.570> DNA<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.470> did

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
alleles its alleles in the DNA that did

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.860 
alleles its alleles in the DNA that did
not<00:04:38.949> belong<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.669> mother<00:04:39.880> or<00:04:40.150> any<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.750> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
not belong to the mother or any of the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.540 
not belong to the mother or any of the
other<00:04:40.990> females<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.070> tank<00:04:42.310> for<00:04:42.400> that

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
other females in the tank for that

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.249 
other females in the tank for that
matter<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.090> they<00:04:43.600> could<00:04:43.780> only<00:04:43.990> have<00:04:44.229> come

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
matter and they could only have come

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.710 
matter and they could only have come
from<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.800> male<00:04:45.039> so<00:04:45.669> that's<00:04:45.910> how<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:46.120> know<00:04:46.389> how

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
from a male so that's how you know how

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.870 
from a male so that's how you know how
we<00:04:46.780> knew<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.229> it<00:04:47.380> was<00:04:47.590> sperm<00:04:48.220> storage<00:04:48.610> are

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
we knew that it was sperm storage are

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.850 
we knew that it was sperm storage are
there<00:04:49.030> other<00:04:49.210> kind<00:04:49.539> of<00:04:49.630> unique<00:04:49.930> some<00:04:50.470> sharks

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
there other kind of unique some sharks

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.830 
there other kind of unique some sharks
like<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.669> bull<00:04:51.880> shark<00:04:52.150> they<00:04:52.360> have<00:04:52.509> what<00:04:52.810> we

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
like the bull shark they have what we

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.920 
like the bull shark they have what we
call<00:04:53.110> intrauterine<00:04:53.530> cannibalism<00:04:54.220> oh<00:04:55.030> yeah

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
call intrauterine cannibalism oh yeah

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.510 
call intrauterine cannibalism oh yeah
I've<00:04:56.410> read<00:04:56.650> about<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:57.160> that's<00:04:57.310> an

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
I've read about that that's an

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.790 
I've read about that that's an
interesting<00:04:58.000> one<00:04:58.210> so<00:04:58.600> freaky<00:04:59.199> so<00:04:59.380> that's<00:04:59.560> when

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
interesting one so freaky so that's when

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.100 
interesting one so freaky so that's when
pups<00:05:00.669> of<00:05:01.000> different<00:05:02.039> fathers<00:05:03.039> or<00:05:03.820> pups<00:05:04.449> will

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
pups of different fathers or pups will

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.930 
pups of different fathers or pups will
attack<00:05:05.590> each<00:05:05.800> other<00:05:06.039> kind<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.400> low<00:05:06.520> side<00:05:06.910> of

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
attack each other kind of low side of

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.150 
attack each other kind of low side of
the<00:05:07.180> mother's<00:05:07.570> body<00:05:07.780> it's<00:05:08.530> like<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> horror

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
the mother's body it's like a horror

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.390 
the mother's body it's like a horror
movie<00:05:09.310> yeah<00:05:10.030> yeah<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:10.660> sometimes<00:05:11.229> a<00:05:11.710> female

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
movie yeah yeah so sometimes a female

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.120 
movie yeah yeah so sometimes a female
will<00:05:12.789> get<00:05:13.630> pregnant<00:05:13.870> several<00:05:14.289> times<00:05:14.530> and<00:05:14.860> then

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
will get pregnant several times and then

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.010 
will get pregnant several times and then
all<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.550> eggs<00:05:15.699> they<00:05:16.419> have<00:05:16.570> a<00:05:16.599> different

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
all of the eggs they have a different

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.950 
all of the eggs they have a different
developmental<00:05:17.410> stages<00:05:17.860> in<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.759> uterus<00:05:19.330> and

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
developmental stages in the uterus and

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.659 
developmental stages in the uterus and
then<00:05:20.139> one<00:05:20.410> pup<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:20.740> born<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:21.250> then<00:05:21.340> he<00:05:21.460> sees

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
then one pup is born and then he sees

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.010 
then one pup is born and then he sees
all<00:05:21.880> those<00:05:22.060> eggs<00:05:22.270> laying<00:05:22.570> around<00:05:22.690> then<00:05:22.930> he

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
all those eggs laying around then he

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.930 
all those eggs laying around then he
starts<00:05:23.289> eating<00:05:23.470> them<00:05:23.770> or<00:05:23.949> even<00:05:24.160> smaller<00:05:24.639> pups

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
starts eating them or even smaller pups

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.939 
starts eating them or even smaller pups
kind<00:05:25.570> of<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.810> veering<00:05:26.320> off<00:05:26.470> to<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.740> different

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
kind of a veering off to a different

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.960 
kind of a veering off to a different
path<00:05:27.639> here<00:05:28.090> sharks<00:05:29.020> are<00:05:29.610> 450<00:05:30.610> million<00:05:30.820> years

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
path here sharks are 450 million years

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.500 
path here sharks are 450 million years
old

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
old

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.960 
old
evolutionarily<00:05:32.320> they've<00:05:32.680> survived<00:05:33.070> five

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
evolutionarily they've survived five

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.020 
evolutionarily they've survived five
major<00:05:34.599> extinction<00:05:35.289> events<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:36.190> there's<00:05:36.460> new

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
major extinction events and there's new

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.760 
major extinction events and there's new
studies<00:05:37.300> saying<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:38.199> we're<00:05:38.349> hitting<00:05:38.530> a

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
studies saying that we're hitting a

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.550 
studies saying that we're hitting a
sixth<00:05:39.250> major<00:05:39.909> extinction<00:05:40.479> event<00:05:40.870> yeah<00:05:41.260> do<00:05:41.500> you

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
sixth major extinction event yeah do you

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.540 
sixth major extinction event yeah do you
think<00:05:41.710> sharks<00:05:41.919> are<00:05:42.070> going<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.280> make<00:05:42.430> it

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
think sharks are going to make it

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.830 
think sharks are going to make it
through<00:05:42.760> this<00:05:42.909> one<00:05:43.060> yeah<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.570> get<00:05:43.810> that

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
through this one yeah I get that

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.409 
through this one yeah I get that
question<00:05:44.260> quite<00:05:44.590> a<00:05:44.680> bit<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.190> I'm<00:05:45.490> at<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.240> same

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
question quite a bit and I'm at the same

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.110 
question quite a bit and I'm at the same
time<00:05:46.630> pessimistic<00:05:47.289> and<00:05:47.440> optimistic<00:05:48.120> they

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
time pessimistic and optimistic they

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.550 
time pessimistic and optimistic they
made<00:05:49.330> it<00:05:49.479> through<00:05:49.630> five<00:05:49.840> so<00:05:50.139> I<00:05:50.169> know<00:05:50.289> they're

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
made it through five so I know they're

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.260 
made it through five so I know they're
gonna<00:05:50.650> made<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:50.979> through<00:05:51.099> a<00:05:51.159> six<00:05:51.400> -<00:05:51.669> biggest

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
gonna made it through a six - biggest

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.029 
gonna made it through a six - biggest
single<00:05:52.750> threat<00:05:53.110> that<00:05:53.289> sharks<00:05:53.620> are<00:05:53.680> facing

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
single threat that sharks are facing

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.189 
single threat that sharks are facing
today<00:05:54.130> are<00:05:54.550> Fisheries<00:05:55.539> it's<00:05:55.780> humans

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
today are Fisheries it's humans

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.920 
today are Fisheries it's humans
collecting<00:05:56.800> by<00:05:56.979> humans<00:05:57.639> for<00:05:57.880> mostly<00:05:58.690> shark

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
collecting by humans for mostly shark

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.580 
collecting by humans for mostly shark
fin<00:05:59.139> soup

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
fin soup

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.589 
fin soup
they<00:05:59.860> are<00:05:59.919> also<00:06:00.130> caught<00:06:00.490> by<00:06:00.849> bycatch<00:06:01.360> in

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
they are also caught by bycatch in

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.180 
they are also caught by bycatch in
several<00:06:01.960> different<00:06:02.139> types<00:06:02.470> of<00:06:02.650> fisheries<00:06:03.039> so

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
several different types of fisheries so

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.800 
several different types of fisheries so
right<00:06:03.370> everybody<00:06:03.789> anybody<00:06:04.300> is<00:06:04.419> out<00:06:04.570> there

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
right everybody anybody is out there

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.930 
right everybody anybody is out there
fishing<00:06:05.229> in<00:06:05.320> a<00:06:05.409> long<00:06:05.590> line<00:06:05.800> for<00:06:06.039> tuna<00:06:06.400> they'll

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
fishing in a long line for tuna they'll

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.730 
fishing in a long line for tuna they'll
catch<00:06:07.150> shark<00:06:07.449> because<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.990> hook<00:06:08.440> is<00:06:08.590> out

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
catch shark because the hook is out

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.439 
catch shark because the hook is out
there<00:06:08.919> so<00:06:09.099> it<00:06:09.220> will<00:06:09.370> catch<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.789> shark<00:06:10.000> -<00:06:10.240> and

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
there so it will catch the shark - and

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.810 
there so it will catch the shark - and
that's<00:06:10.840> where<00:06:11.050> their<00:06:11.430> reproduction<00:06:12.430> comes

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
that's where their reproduction comes

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.689 
that's where their reproduction comes
back<00:06:13.060> in<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:13.590> closes<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.770> circle<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:15.580> the

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
back in and closes the circle of the

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.850 
back in and closes the circle of the
story<00:06:16.000> because<00:06:16.870> they<00:06:17.050> don't<00:06:17.259> reproduce<00:06:17.470> like

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
story because they don't reproduce like

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.310 
story because they don't reproduce like
tunas<00:06:18.250> they<00:06:18.460> do<00:06:18.520> one<00:06:18.880> two<00:06:19.120> three<00:06:19.419> five<00:06:19.900> pups<00:06:20.169> at

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
tunas they do one two three five pups at

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.200 
tunas they do one two three five pups at
a<00:06:20.349> time<00:06:20.590> they're<00:06:21.130> much<00:06:21.370> more<00:06:21.550> vulnerable<00:06:22.060> to

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
a time they're much more vulnerable to

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.999 
a time they're much more vulnerable to
fishing<00:06:22.419> than<00:06:22.720> tunas<00:06:23.110> are<00:06:23.259> mm-hmm

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
fishing than tunas are mm-hmm

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.399 
fishing than tunas are mm-hmm
to<00:06:24.310> end<00:06:24.520> on<00:06:24.729> a<00:06:24.759> happier<00:06:25.509> note<00:06:25.599> there<00:06:26.169> are

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
to end on a happier note there are

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.950 
to end on a happier note there are
populations<00:06:26.919> that<00:06:27.520> are<00:06:27.729> rebounding<00:06:28.330> yeah

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
populations that are rebounding yeah

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.510 
populations that are rebounding yeah
their<00:06:29.169> populations<00:06:29.770> are<00:06:29.889> rebounding<00:06:30.400> their

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
their populations are rebounding their

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.550 
their populations are rebounding their
initiatives<00:06:31.180> like<00:06:31.539> in<00:06:31.690> places<00:06:32.050> like<00:06:32.080> Palau

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
initiatives like in places like Palau

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.409 
initiatives like in places like Palau
for<00:06:32.860> example<00:06:33.250> they<00:06:33.340> completely<00:06:33.669> banned<00:06:34.000> shark

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
for example they completely banned shark

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.950 
for example they completely banned shark
fishing<00:06:35.349> in<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.860> whole<00:06:36.039> island<00:06:37.029> and<00:06:37.240> then

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
fishing in the whole island and then

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.840 
fishing in the whole island and then
built<00:06:38.260> a<00:06:38.409> shark<00:06:38.710> sanctuary<00:06:38.889> around

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
built a shark sanctuary around

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.280 
built a shark sanctuary around
the<00:06:39.970> islands<00:06:40.360> there<00:06:40.570> so<00:06:40.900> that<00:06:41.050> we<00:06:41.110> see<00:06:41.260> the

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
the islands there so that we see the

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.200 
the islands there so that we see the
populations<00:06:41.830> rebounding<00:06:42.370> there's<00:06:42.850> large

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
populations rebounding there's large

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.450 
populations rebounding there's large
marine<00:06:43.720> protected<00:06:44.020> areas<00:06:44.380> with<00:06:44.590> big<00:06:44.920> healthy

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
marine protected areas with big healthy

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.370 
marine protected areas with big healthy
shark<00:06:45.790> populations<00:06:46.420> like<00:06:46.690> the<00:06:46.720> Northwest

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
shark populations like the Northwest

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.960
