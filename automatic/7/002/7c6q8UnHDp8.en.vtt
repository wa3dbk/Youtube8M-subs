get top-end speed it's you have to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.420 
get top-end speed it's you have to
purchase<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.049> racing<00:03:37.769> transmission<00:03:38.310> there

what the ratio transmission does is it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.759 
what the ratio transmission does is it
gives<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.580> ability<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.620> mess<00:03:43.620> around

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769

with<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.130> gear<00:03:44.340> ratio<00:03:44.700> now<00:03:45.330> if<00:03:45.450> you're

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
with the gear ratio now if you're

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.640 
with the gear ratio now if you're
messing<00:03:45.810> around<00:03:45.870> with<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.110> gear<00:03:46.320> ratio

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
messing around with the gear ratio

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.180 
messing around with the gear ratio
enough<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.700> where<00:03:48.080> just<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.320> where<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:50.010> could

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
enough to where just to where you could

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.940 
enough to where just to where you could
do<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.580> perfectly<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.209> can<00:03:51.630> top<00:03:52.110> your<00:03:52.350> car<00:03:52.739> out

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.460 
do it perfectly you can top your car out
really<00:03:53.670> really<00:03:53.790> fast<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:54.959> think<00:03:55.110> there's<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
really really fast now I think there's a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.800 
really really fast now I think there's a
video<00:03:55.830> out<00:03:56.010> there<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.549> seen<00:03:57.060> on<00:03:57.120> YouTube<00:03:57.510> where

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
video out there I seen on YouTube where

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.800 
video out there I seen on YouTube where
this<00:03:57.989> guy<00:03:58.140> who<00:03:58.200> tweet<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.739> WRX<00:03:59.580> STI<00:03:59.700> I<00:04:00.269> think

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
this guy who tweet this WRX STI I think

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.170 
this guy who tweet this WRX STI I think
he<00:04:00.930> reached<00:04:01.140> up<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.350> like<00:04:01.580> 300<00:04:02.580> miles<00:04:02.820> per<00:04:03.030> hour

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
he reached up to like 300 miles per hour

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.210 
he reached up to like 300 miles per hour
that's<00:04:03.420> now<00:04:03.660> that's<00:04:03.840> insane<00:04:04.200> now<00:04:04.860> if<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.130> know

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
that's now that's insane now if you know

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.060 
that's now that's insane now if you know
how<00:04:05.310> treat<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:06.030> gear<00:04:06.810> ratio<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.380> could<00:04:07.530> do

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
how treat your gear ratio you could do

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.310 
how treat your gear ratio you could do
some<00:04:08.280> crazy<00:04:08.459> topping<00:04:09.030> speed<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:09.959> these<00:04:10.080> cars

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
some crazy topping speed with these cars

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.440 
some crazy topping speed with these cars
I<00:04:10.590> think<00:04:11.250> my<00:04:11.310> fast<00:04:11.549> call<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.790> had<00:04:11.970> right<00:04:12.120> now<00:04:12.150> is
