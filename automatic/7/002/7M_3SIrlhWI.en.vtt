March<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.820> limitation<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.510> due<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> fact

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
March this limitation is due to the fact

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.509 
March this limitation is due to the fact
that<00:00:28.230> traditionally<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> cows<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.340> brought

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that traditionally the cows are brought

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.400 
that traditionally the cows are brought
down<00:00:29.550> from<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> mountains<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:31.080> spend<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
down from the mountains to spend the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
down from the mountains to spend the
winter<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> stables<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:33.210> naturally

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
winter in the stables and this naturally

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.569 
winter in the stables and this naturally
led<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.200> smaller<00:00:34.440> production<00:00:34.980> volumes<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
led to smaller production volumes and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.880 
led to smaller production volumes and
this<00:00:36.000> tradition<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.870> still<00:00:37.230> maintained<00:00:37.739> today

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this tradition is still maintained today

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.940 
this tradition is still maintained today

of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> cheese<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.290> insert<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
of the cheese so you can insert the

garlic and rosemary sprigs into them I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
garlic and rosemary sprigs into them I'm
going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> insert<00:01:53.040> quite<00:01:53.369> large<00:01:53.640> sprigs<00:01:54.180> of

going to drizzle over some honey which

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.719 
going to drizzle over some honey which
just<00:02:00.420> gives<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.930> extra<00:02:01.110> sweetness

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
just gives it a little extra sweetness

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.039 
just gives it a little extra sweetness
then<00:02:02.729> before<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> oven<00:02:03.719> I'm

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
then before I put it in the oven I'm

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.959 
then before I put it in the oven I'm
just<00:02:04.229> gonna<00:02:04.350> wrap<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:04.920> aluminium<00:02:05.430> foil

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.979 
the oven for 25 minutes and as you can
see<00:03:47.760> I've<00:03:48.060> got<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> nice<00:03:48.450> creamy<00:03:48.870> consistency

and it's warm all the way through as I

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.990 
and it's warm all the way through as I
said<00:03:53.010> earlier<00:03:53.280> I've<00:03:53.430> seen<00:03:53.580> other<00:03:53.700> chefs

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
said earlier I've seen other chefs

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.580 
said earlier I've seen other chefs
recommend<00:03:54.420> as<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:54.780> as<00:03:54.870> 8<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.170> 10<00:03:55.380> minutes

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
recommend as little as 8 to 10 minutes

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.620 
recommend as little as 8 to 10 minutes
but<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.310> first<00:03:56.549> time<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.850> bake<00:03:57.030> one<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.239> these<00:03:57.450> I

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
but the first time I bake one of these I

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.050 
but the first time I bake one of these I
tried<00:03:57.959> 15<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.190> still<00:03:59.459> gluttonous<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
tried 15 and it was still gluttonous it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.820 
tried 15 and it was still gluttonous it
wasn't<00:04:00.330> ready<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:01.080> had<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.230> pop<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.530> back<00:04:01.560> in

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
wasn't ready so I had to pop it back in

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.310 
wasn't ready so I had to pop it back in
the<00:04:01.950> oven<00:04:02.330> so<00:04:03.330> if<00:04:03.390> you've<00:04:03.540> baked<00:04:03.780> one<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.140> these

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.259 
comparisons with camembert cooking times
and<00:04:15.720> temperatures<00:04:16.680> may<00:04:17.100> be<00:04:17.130> interesting<00:04:17.790> but

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
and temperatures may be interesting but

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.630 
and temperatures may be interesting but
bear<00:04:18.479> in<00:04:18.630> mind<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.229> 350<00:04:20.040> gram<00:04:20.280> cheese

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
bear in mind this is a 350 gram cheese

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.450 
bear in mind this is a 350 gram cheese
and<00:04:20.970> weighs<00:04:21.540> 500<00:04:22.260> grams<00:04:22.289> with<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.919> spruce<00:04:23.160> box

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
and weighs 500 grams with the spruce box

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.900 
and weighs 500 grams with the spruce box
so<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.720> 250<00:04:25.440> gram<00:04:25.650> camembert<00:04:26.099> is<00:04:26.610> probably

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
so a 250 gram camembert is probably

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.800 
so a 250 gram camembert is probably
going<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.150> bake
