00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.840
 my life 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.730
 in high school and high school I had as a 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.790
 normal average neither good nor bad 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.550
 let's say mediocre but in high school I entered 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.410
 I discovered the stuff of theater and there they 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.180
 I was very happy indeed I did not want 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.340
 theater I wanted graphic design but 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.440
 when I tried to write down I could not anymore 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.390
 It was full, try computing and now 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.980
 I was full try modeling and now 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.810

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.540
 they had empty places was theater 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.880
 then I went in and I realized that I 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.100
 I loved acting, I loved being 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.780
