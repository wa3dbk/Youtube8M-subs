00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.840 

the<00:00:02.970> solubility<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:04.140> calcium<00:00:04.560> chloride<00:00:05.310> and

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
the solubility of calcium chloride and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.560 
the solubility of calcium chloride and
it's<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.080> solution<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.529> magnesium<00:00:08.309> sulfate

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
it's in a solution of magnesium sulfate

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.690 
it's in a solution of magnesium sulfate
so<00:00:09.570> as<00:00:09.900> soon<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.410> see<00:00:10.590> solubility<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.490> got

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
so as soon as you see solubility you got

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.770 
so as soon as you see solubility you got
I<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.269> KSP<00:00:13.019> stuff<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.190> calcium

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
I think this KSP stuff so calcium

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.900 
I think this KSP stuff so calcium
two-plus<00:00:15.780> aqueous<00:00:17.240> plus<00:00:19.369> well<00:00:20.369> there's<00:00:20.699> two

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
two-plus aqueous plus well there's two

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.939 
two-plus aqueous plus well there's two
foreign<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.869> fluorine<00:00:22.439> -<00:00:23.010> aqueous<00:00:24.949> we're

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
foreign so to fluorine - aqueous we're

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.250 
foreign so to fluorine - aqueous we're
going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.279> our<00:00:26.400> ice<00:00:26.609> table<00:00:26.910> as<00:00:27.269> normal<00:00:28.970> and

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
going to do our ice table as normal and

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.850 
going to do our ice table as normal and
then<00:00:31.260> solids<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.189> ignore<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.620> here's<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.829> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
then solids you ignore and here's what I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.970 
then solids you ignore and here's what I
this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> end<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.829> let's<00:00:37.829> see

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this is going to end up be not let's see

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.520 
this is going to end up be not let's see
custom<00:00:38.489> floor<00:00:38.930> okay<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.960> gives<00:00:43.320> us

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
custom floor okay so it gives us

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.150 
custom floor okay so it gives us
magnesium<00:00:44.520> sulfate<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.410> really<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.010> too

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
magnesium sulfate but really not for too

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.319 
magnesium sulfate but really not for too
much<00:00:47.370> reason<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.440> far<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.620> you're<00:00:50.010> concerned

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
much reason as far as you're concerned

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
much reason as far as you're concerned
so<00:00:51.329> you'll<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> point<00:00:52.559> 0<00:00:52.980> 1<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.399> 5

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so you'll see there's a point 0 1 to 5

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.260 
so you'll see there's a point 0 1 to 5
molar<00:00:54.030> solution<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.140> magnesium<00:00:55.710> sulfate<00:00:56.270> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
molar solution of magnesium sulfate the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.470 
molar solution of magnesium sulfate the
only<00:00:57.570> thing<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> does<00:00:58.370> really

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
only thing that that does really

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
only thing that that does really
conceptually<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.840> adding<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.350> activity

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
conceptually is adding that activity

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.520 
conceptually is adding that activity
coefficient<00:01:02.820> factor<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.379> there's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
coefficient factor because when there's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.460 
coefficient factor because when there's
a<00:01:04.589> lot<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.129> Zin<00:01:05.460> solution<00:01:05.970> usually<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a lot I on Zin solution usually the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.580 
a lot I on Zin solution usually the
activity<00:01:08.130> coefficient<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:09.119> 1<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.840> this

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
activity coefficient is not 1 in this

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
activity coefficient is not 1 in this
whole<00:01:10.770> class<00:01:10.979> we've<00:01:11.250> been<00:01:11.400> assuming<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.909> one

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
whole class we've been assuming is one

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.510 
whole class we've been assuming is one
so<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:14.070> point

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so at this point

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
so at this point
everything's<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.360> normal<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.080> I'll

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
everything's going to be normal and I'll

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.380 
everything's going to be normal and I'll
show<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.650> where<00:01:17.040> things<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.759> funky<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
show you where things a little funky is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
show you where things a little funky is
affected<00:01:19.049> 0<00:01:19.890> +<00:01:20.250> 0<00:01:20.729> +<00:01:21.000> X<00:01:21.960> +<00:01:22.470> +<00:01:23.250> 2<00:01:23.549> X<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.390> 0<00:01:24.630> +<00:01:24.990> X<00:01:25.229> 0

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
affected 0 + 0 + X + + 2 X so 0 + X 0

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.999 
affected 0 + 0 + X + + 2 X so 0 + X 0
plus<00:01:26.460> 2x<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:29.479> then<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> let's<00:01:32.549> write<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.790> out

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
plus 2x and then so let's write this out

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.850 
plus 2x and then so let's write this out
k-s-p<00:01:35.270> let's<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.810> given<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.619> should

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
k-s-p let's see if it's given it should

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.260 
k-s-p let's see if it's given it should
be<00:01:40.549> its

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
be its

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.770 
be its
it's<00:01:43.609> 329<00:01:45.859> 5<00:01:46.859> 10<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> minus<00:01:48.090> 11<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.509> that's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's 329 5 10 to the minus 11 so that's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.529 
it's 329 5 10 to the minus 11 so that's
a<00:01:48.899> given<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.969> set<00:01:50.969> this<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
a given and set this up for this

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.350 
a given and set this up for this
equation<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.409> calcium<00:01:53.100> 2<00:01:53.729> plus<00:01:53.759> make<00:01:54.329> sure

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
equation it's calcium 2 plus make sure

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.630 
equation it's calcium 2 plus make sure
you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.810> write<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.289> sort<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.649> stuff<00:01:55.890> don't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you can write this sort of stuff don't

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.270 
you can write this sort of stuff don't
forget<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.149> square<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:58.109> warding<00:01:58.679> but<00:01:59.039> there's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
forget to square the warding but there's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.190 
forget to square the warding but there's
two<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> them

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
two of them

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.749 
two of them
so<00:02:01.200> plug<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.579> X<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.719> calcium<00:02:04.759> 2x4

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
so plug in that X the calcium 2x4

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.570 
so plug in that X the calcium 2x4
fluoride<00:02:06.240> square<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:09.149> solve<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.690> X

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
fluoride square that and you solve for X

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.449 
fluoride square that and you solve for X
so<00:02:11.580> solve<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.569> X<00:02:12.750> X<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> equal<00:02:16.459> three

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
so solve for X X is going to equal three

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.970 
so solve for X X is going to equal three
point<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:18.000> times<00:02:18.420> 10<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.840> minus<00:02:19.140> four<00:02:19.410> oh

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.190 

I<00:02:25.980> forgot<00:02:26.489> one<00:02:26.790> factor<00:02:27.329> so<00:02:27.690> that's<00:02:27.900> how<00:02:28.110> you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
I forgot one factor so that's how you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.530 
I forgot one factor so that's how you
would<00:02:28.380> do<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> normally<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.970> question

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
would do it normally in this question

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420 
would do it normally in this question
you've<00:02:30.750> got<00:02:31.049> those<00:02:31.290> activity<00:02:31.860> coefficients

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
you've got those activity coefficients

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.900 
you've got those activity coefficients
so<00:02:32.519> here's<00:02:32.730> what<00:02:32.940> changes<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:35.010> looks<00:02:35.280> really

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
so here's what changes it looks really

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.750 
so here's what changes it looks really
similar<00:02:36.500> when<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.620> add<00:02:37.829> in<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.190> activity

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
similar when you add in the activity

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.420 
similar when you add in the activity
coefficients<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.379> only<00:02:40.590> thing<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.370> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
coefficients the only thing that is a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.660 
coefficients the only thing that is a
little<00:02:41.849> gamma<00:02:42.209> here<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.870> calcium<00:02:43.549> which<00:02:44.549> is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
little gamma here for calcium which is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.900 
little gamma here for calcium which is
just<00:02:44.849> going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> constant<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.609> then<00:02:47.609> up

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
just going to be a constant and then up

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.059 
just going to be a constant and then up
in<00:02:48.239> front<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> fluorine<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.260> little<00:02:49.769> gamma

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
in front of the fluorine a little gamma

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.819 
in front of the fluorine a little gamma
as<00:02:50.519> well<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.180> fluorine<00:02:55.010> squared<00:02:56.010> equals<00:02:56.760> I

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
as well for fluorine squared equals I

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.289 
as well for fluorine squared equals I
really<00:02:58.829> this<00:02:59.010> X<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.489> going<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.819> for<00:03:00.180> this

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
really this X is going to be for this

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.550 
really this X is going to be for this
one<00:03:00.510> here<00:03:01.549> so<00:03:02.549> then<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.120> gammas<00:03:03.840> are<00:03:04.049> given

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
one here so then the gammas are given

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.460 
one here so then the gammas are given
I'll<00:03:04.769> write<00:03:05.040> those<00:03:05.250> down<00:03:05.280> below<00:03:06.109> gamma<00:03:07.109> for

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I'll write those down below gamma for

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.370 
I'll write those down below gamma for

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.509 
for fluorine is given and that's 0.8 100
all<00:03:20.549> you're<00:03:20.730> going<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> do<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.389> add<00:03:21.660> those

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
all you're going to do is add those

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.870 
all you're going to do is add those
coefficients<00:03:23.519> there<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.190> call<00:03:26.400> activity

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
coefficients there and I call activity

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.699 
coefficients there and I call activity
coefficients<00:03:27.450> there's<00:03:27.599> really<00:03:27.810> constants

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
coefficients there's really constants

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.220 
coefficients there's really constants
just<00:03:29.310> going<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.549> multiply<00:03:29.669> them<00:03:30.299> into<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
just going to multiply them into the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.520 
just going to multiply them into the
equation<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.269> it's<00:03:33.269> still<00:03:33.569> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.959> equal<00:03:34.290> x

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
equation and it's still going to equal x

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.860 
equation and it's still going to equal x
+<00:03:35.489> 2<00:03:35.790> x<00:03:36.090> squared<00:03:38.030> when<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.090> solve<00:03:39.329> for<00:03:39.389> X<00:03:39.660> you

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
+ 2 x squared when you solve for X you

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.819 
+ 2 x squared when you solve for X you
get<00:03:39.989> this<00:03:40.319> value<00:03:40.620> here<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.639> wrote<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.690> for<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
get this value here I wrote it for the

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.830 
get this value here I wrote it for the
top<00:03:44.040> one<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.370> really<00:03:44.579> for<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.790> bottom<00:03:45.090> one<00:03:45.120> so

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
top one is really for the bottom one so

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.319 
top one is really for the bottom one so
in<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.340> problem<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.669> have<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.819> solve<00:03:48.090> it

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
in this problem you have to solve it

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.530 
in this problem you have to solve it
this<00:03:48.480> way<00:03:48.780> add<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.829> these

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
this way add in these

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.209 
this way add in these
coefficient<00:03:51.079> didn't<00:03:51.620> say<00:03:51.739> anything<00:03:52.069> about

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
coefficient didn't say anything about

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.539 
coefficient didn't say anything about
those<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:53.269> solve<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.719> as<00:03:53.900> normal<00:03:54.469> so<00:03:55.400> the

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
those you just solve it as normal so the

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.860 
those you just solve it as normal so the
top<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.030> normal<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:58.489> then<00:03:59.030> after<00:03:59.719> that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
top is normal I and then after that

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.670 
top is normal I and then after that
let's<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.980> once<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.579> in<00:04:01.730> certain<00:04:02.150> units

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
let's see it once it in certain units

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.800 
let's see it once it in certain units
milligrams<00:04:03.680> per<00:04:04.670> liter<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.269> we<00:04:05.359> got<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.659> do<00:04:05.780> a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
milligrams per liter so we got to do a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.729 
milligrams per liter so we got to do a
little<00:04:06.640> conversion<00:04:07.659> because<00:04:08.659> this<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:09.170> answer

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
little conversion because this is answer

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.360 
little conversion because this is answer
is<00:04:09.799> going<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.069> be<00:04:10.189> a<00:04:10.220> mole<00:04:10.659> per<00:04:11.659> meter<00:04:12.189> so<00:04:13.189> need

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
is going to be a mole per meter so need

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.779 
is going to be a mole per meter so need
to<00:04:13.400> solve<00:04:13.609> for<00:04:13.760> X<00:04:13.970> that's<00:04:14.299> going<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.599> be

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:15.789 
to solve for X that's going to be

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.279 
to solve for X that's going to be
essentially<00:04:16.789> units<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.239> molarity<00:04:17.630> but<00:04:18.049> for

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
essentially units of molarity but for

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.229 
essentially units of molarity but for
solubility<00:04:18.769> we<00:04:19.130> actually<00:04:19.579> write<00:04:19.759> moles<00:04:20.030> per

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
solubility we actually write moles per

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.180 
solubility we actually write moles per
liter<00:04:20.449> so<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.810> take<00:04:20.989> this<00:04:21.139> number<00:04:24.190> three

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
liter so you take this number three

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.439 
liter so you take this number three
point<00:04:25.669> one<00:04:26.050> times<00:04:27.050> ten<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.680> minus<00:04:27.770> four

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
point one times ten to the minus four

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.430 
point one times ten to the minus four
this<00:04:29.449> is<00:04:29.599> moles<00:04:30.940> per<00:04:31.940> liter<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.900> we<00:04:33.139> want<00:04:33.349> it

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
this is moles per liter and we want it

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.310 
this is moles per liter and we want it
in<00:04:33.620> milligrams<00:04:34.270> per<00:04:35.270> liter<00:04:35.539> or<00:04:35.870> into<00:04:36.229> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
in milligrams per liter or into the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.040 
in milligrams per liter or into the
question<00:04:36.740> so<00:04:37.699> I<00:04:37.729> want<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.240> multiply<00:04:38.389> by<00:04:38.780> the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
question so I want to multiply by the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.930 
question so I want to multiply by the
molar<00:04:39.229> mass<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:43.039> molar<00:04:43.250> mass<00:04:43.520> of<00:04:43.550> calcium

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
molar mass and the molar mass of calcium

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.520 
molar mass and the molar mass of calcium
fluoride<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:44.990> seventy<00:04:45.560> point<00:04:45.949> oh<00:04:46.070> seven<00:04:46.280> oh

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530

fluoride is seventy point oh seven oh
eight<00:04:48.729> seventy<00:04:49.729> eight<00:04:49.970> point<00:04:50.300> oh<00:04:50.449> seven<00:04:52.419> so

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
eight seventy eight point oh seven so

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.740 
eight seventy eight point oh seven so
that's<00:04:53.630> in<00:04:53.960> now<00:04:54.530> grams<00:04:55.099> per<00:04:55.550> liter<00:04:55.760> I'm<00:04:56.419> just

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
that's in now grams per liter I'm just

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.710 
that's in now grams per liter I'm just
going<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:56.990> do<00:04:57.139> one<00:04:57.380> more<00:04:57.409> conversion<00:04:58.690> times

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.439 

one<00:05:02.720> gram<00:05:03.110> for<00:05:03.590> every<00:05:04.240> thousand<00:05:05.240> milligrams

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
one gram for every thousand milligrams

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.129 
one gram for every thousand milligrams
and<00:05:09.159> now<00:05:10.159> just<00:05:10.880> doing<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:11.300> conversion<00:05:11.810> you

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
and now just doing that conversion you

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.589 
and now just doing that conversion you
get<00:05:12.349> twenty<00:05:12.800> four<00:05:13.039> point<00:05:13.250> four<00:05:16.599> milligrams

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
get twenty four point four milligrams

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.980 
get twenty four point four milligrams
per<00:05:17.930> liter<00:05:19.539> any<00:05:20.539> questions<00:05:20.900> on<00:05:21.050> that

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
per liter any questions on that

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:29.420 
per liter any questions on that
we<00:05:22.110> got<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.410> last<00:05:22.530> day<00:05:22.940> yeah<00:05:24.210> yes<00:05:27.889> point<00:05:28.889> zero

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
we got the last day yeah yes point zero

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.290 
we got the last day yeah yes point zero
one<00:05:29.669> two<00:05:29.850> five<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.569> do<00:05:30.750> nothing<00:05:31.229> with<00:05:31.440> it<00:05:31.470> but

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
one two five you do nothing with it but

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.180 
one two five you do nothing with it but
that<00:05:33.300> was<00:05:33.449> easy

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
that was easy

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.480 
that was easy
it's<00:05:35.190> here<00:05:35.460> l<00:05:37.250> mathematically<00:05:38.250> it's

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
it's here l mathematically it's

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.839 
it's here l mathematically it's
irrelevant<00:05:38.849> to<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:39.509> it's<00:05:40.380> only<00:05:40.650> relevant<00:05:41.039> if

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
irrelevant to you it's only relevant if

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.089 
irrelevant to you it's only relevant if
we<00:05:42.300> asked<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.960> calculate<00:05:43.139> these<00:05:43.560> gammas

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
we asked you to calculate these gammas

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.080 
we asked you to calculate these gammas
which<00:05:44.310> we<00:05:44.490> wouldn't

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
which we wouldn't

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.559 
which we wouldn't
and<00:05:45.930> so<00:05:46.819> because<00:05:47.819> we're<00:05:48.000> not<00:05:48.090> asking<00:05:48.389> exactly

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
and so because we're not asking exactly

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.290 
and so because we're not asking exactly
those<00:05:48.960> are<00:05:49.110> something<00:05:49.289> irrelevant<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.979> you<00:05:50.300> it

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
those are something irrelevant to you it

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.480 
those are something irrelevant to you it
would<00:05:51.599> be<00:05:51.780> relevant<00:05:52.169> if<00:05:52.500> it<00:05:52.710> was<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:52.860> common<00:05:53.310> ion

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
would be relevant if it was a common ion

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.760 
would be relevant if it was a common ion
but<00:05:53.910> it's<00:05:54.090> not<00:05:54.330> something<00:05:55.110> as<00:05:55.949> far<00:05:56.250> as<00:05:56.340> math

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
but it's not something as far as math

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.370 
but it's not something as far as math
yes<00:05:58.770> is<00:05:59.039> the<00:05:59.880> reason<00:06:00.300> why<00:06:00.509> point<00:06:01.380> or<00:06:02.509> 0.88<00:06:03.509> 1<00:06:04.020> 0

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
yes is the reason why point or 0.88 1 0

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.620 
yes is the reason why point or 0.88 1 0
square<00:06:05.009> is<00:06:05.280> square<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:06.150> X<00:06:06.330> B<00:06:06.479> coefficient

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
square is square the X B coefficient

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.550 
square is square the X B coefficient
forgot<00:06:07.169> is<00:06:07.349> that<00:06:07.680> cuz<00:06:08.240> there's<00:06:09.240> 2<00:06:09.449> X<00:06:09.630> yeah<00:06:10.139> so

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
forgot is that cuz there's 2 X yeah so

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.129 
forgot is that cuz there's 2 X yeah so
it<00:06:10.710> is<00:06:10.889> a<00:06:11.009> C<00:06:11.310> where'd<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:12.150> gammas<00:06:12.690> so<00:06:12.900> there

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
it is a C where'd the gammas so there

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.830 
it is a C where'd the gammas so there
was<00:06:13.320> you<00:06:13.560> see<00:06:13.830> CA<00:06:14.789> then<00:06:15.210> you<00:06:15.599> would<00:06:15.720> also

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
was you see CA then you would also

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.830 
was you see CA then you would also
square<00:06:16.380> our<00:06:16.650> 54<00:06:17.460> you<00:06:17.970> raise<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.360> to<00:06:18.389> that<00:06:18.599> power

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
square our 54 you raise it to that power

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.440 
square our 54 you raise it to that power
you<00:06:19.289> got
