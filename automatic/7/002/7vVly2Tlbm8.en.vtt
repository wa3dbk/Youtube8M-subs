00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.910
 so over the panel 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.430
 vehicle instruments as you see here 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.440
 we have a circle that is the 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.190
 rev counter as you see here put 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 revolutions per thousand 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.750
 in this case they are the returns that the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.770
 engine in a minute because for me it is 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.420
 now in a thousand then they would be my 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.579
 revolutions and it's in two then they would be 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.650
 two thousand so ends up to 4000 science 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.830
 we have the dipped beam lights on as 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 you see 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.720
 if we give him inside the bar 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.379
 the long ones will come out which is blue as you see 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.690
 by removing them back to this the crossing 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.820
 to remove them cross it we have the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
 position but the bread is still on 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.540
 it happens that there is no sneak that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.699
 tell us how we are doing those of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.780
 crossing position following the position 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.489
 then you would not see anything position and cross 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.199
 there we have then we have here the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.129
 handbrake symbol if he removed the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 hand brake goes off and it would be 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.960
 perfect post in the center we have 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.460
 another circle that we have here as you see 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.380
 the fuel tank is a quarter 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.790
 etc the deposit where is in this case 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.470
 on the left side if it were the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 drawing on the other side would be in the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 right those that you remember that can 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.049
 have the deposit in the right or in the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.759
 left engine temperature about 90 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 degrees that does not rise much up 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.369
 It would be dangerous belt right now 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.890
 I'm stopped the detainee and I do not have the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.570
 belt put if I wear it as you see 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.909
 to see a click the little light is removed if 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.280
 would start the march would start pitan and 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.869
 here we have the kilometer speedometer 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.520
 per hour remember that there is a relationship 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.619
 a correlation between 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.679
 rev counter and speed 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.869
 they recommend 1,500 two thousand or two thousand and 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.619
 peak the diesel and two thousand two thousand 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.659
 five hundred gasoline in pipes 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.850
 accelerate would raise the arrow to 50 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.800
 imagined 2000 2500 changing the gear 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.830
 I would go down 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.930
 the engine was turned off as you see the little arrow 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.630
 goes down to zero many times that scale 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.340
 remember that the engine is off 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.460
 he ripped it off all the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 panels as you see battery belts 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.150
 everything you have and agreed that what 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 think you have to wait a few seconds 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.510
 started and is perfect there you have it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.940
 we also have to forget the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.470
 rear fog lamp as you see it turns on 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.490
 here in Chivas and this one does not have this 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.290
 vehicle does not have anti-fog 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.830
 forward is not that it is not mandatory for 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.450
 law and if in the back I remove them and there 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.940
 it would be right here we have the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.950
 odometer this car has 304 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.360
 thousand kilometers and the kilometers that I have 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.510
 done during the week 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 with don car vais to try it approves the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.230
 driving test with snoring 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.230
 point is
