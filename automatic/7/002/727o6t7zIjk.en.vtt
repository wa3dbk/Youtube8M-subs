00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.789
 and greet everyone with his farage and 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.930
 welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.880
 a long time that I had not done and 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.800
 today I offer you a tutorial for 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.509
 show you how we can transfer 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.640
 this data from the xbox 360 or the ps3 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.390
 it works it's the same principle for 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.710
 both consoles 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.899
 except that I'm going to show you with 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.700
 the example of the xbox so how do we 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.899
 can transfer data from these games 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.559
 and especially skyrim to the pc so 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:44.829
 wanted to launch your console you go 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.539
 go to system settings and 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.609
 at the storage device level 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.870
 so that's the same principle for ps3 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.210
 you have at the device level of 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.179
 storage and you go white white and 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 no you 're going to plug a usb stick into 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.829
 your console 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.629
 the console will tell you that the key is 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.800
 especially with the xbox with ps3 I know 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.330
 not if it's the same but in any case 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.010
 she will tell you that the key is not 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.920
 recognized do not use it the good 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.560
 storage format and so he will you 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.440
 ask if you want to format the key 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.850
 and suddenly make it usable for 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.439
 store your game data so you 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.340
 put yes so make sure it's 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.700
 an empty usb stick 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.530
 once you have format the key 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.270
 you will see that the key she is there 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.610
 it is recognized as a map 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.840
 memory 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.369
 then the procedure is simple 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.530
 you will be looking for your game data 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.259
 and wanted to copy simply 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.740
 directly to your card 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.289
 memory 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.020
 so it's the same way that it is 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.689
 for the ps3 or for the xbox 360 you 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.219
 copy your skyrim data or a 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.469
 other game if you want to transfer from 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.090
 transfer on the data of another 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.320
 game on pc but I explain you 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.179
 for skyrim because his rhymes I know 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.250
 that it works so wanted to copy on the 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.979
 memory card and then the next 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.500
 step is on the pc and so I 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.770
 you find immediately on the pc 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.149
 so now you have your usb key 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.490
 deals with your skyrim backups 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.170
 in it you put it on the pc and 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.780
 then there will be so he will you 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.830
 show who has nothing that is normal because 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.940
 that for him he does not recognize this 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.530
 format but when you look at the key 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.120
 usb you see that there are things 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.340
 in it is full so now 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.840
 there are two things you are going to have to 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.430
 do the first thing that's 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.650
 download this software which is 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.969
 moodio software so we can do the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.319
 manipulate with another software that 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.159
 is called horizons but as I 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.400
 do not know me, I'll introduce you 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.400
 my god and the second thing to do that 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.590
 is going to be so to find the file where 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.079
 are your skyrim backups 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.549
 so good it's not very complicated you 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.459
 see actually it's in my documents 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.620
 my game skyrim said and it presents itself 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.639
 in the following form 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.769
 once these two things do you 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:55.659
 go on mauguio and you will go 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.239
 in open save that's here here you see 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.290
 that the usb key is recognized you click 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.760
 on it and presents itself the way 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.609
 next you see that skyrim is 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.639
 recognized and you double double click 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.290
 on it and that's how it looks 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.569
 so he recognizes that there is a game 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.159
 with different different parameters 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.419
 so maybe I'll show you 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.849
 because if you follow different tutorials 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.109
 on the net you will do a demonstration 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.719
 different see right that the 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.700
 files are in es and you 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:23.349
 files that you are going to transfer 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.000
 are the xs files are not 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.709
 recognized by the game and most 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.180
 of studies at 10 to make passion the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.790
 next way go in the feat 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:36.669
 device so open all the folders and 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.560
 here is the backup you have 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.290
 copied who is in them and xs who will not 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.010
 so not recognized in the game and if you 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.389
 convert it and format it s the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.129
 game will tell you that there is a conflict of 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.780
 version you have it this backup 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.949
 is too old 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.629
 compared to the version of the game so that 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:56.349
 not walk so I'll go back up 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.180
 the procedure or do open cl doubleclick 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.720
 and there you go in advance 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.370
 edit package conten and there you you 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.780
 find with a series game took 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.340
 so this is the one who will have to 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.139
 to actually use right click it's yves 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.900
 had to save them for example on 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:15.579
 the office here and there you will change 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.409
 the format so you fame yourself 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.720
 remove the point date in point the ss 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:21.519
 you say yes for the modification of 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.710
 the extension and there you just have to 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.139
 put your save game so do better 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.960
 audio and you put your record in 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.340
 the save file of the skyrim and we get 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 found in the game to check that 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.000
 It works well 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.460
 re everyone so here we are in 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.990
 skyrim and you'll see that the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.479
 backup of the console is now 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.410
 in the game then we will load the 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.150
 part and here it is the 496 game then 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.100
 wait the picture is a bit anything 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.810
 but we would like the game recognizes well 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.040
 that it's my imperial level 39 with 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.270
 my one hundred and ninety eight hours of 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.380
 Thu 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.970
 so we start the backup and you 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.460
 see very well that his charge 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.900
 so it works I find myself with the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.639
 backup two boxing corn on the game 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.930
 just so here you are 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.280
 now you can have fun at 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.100
 do what you want the mode and 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.990
 do anything but know that the 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.820
 manip is exactly the same with the game 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.790
 on ps3 does exactly the same thing 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.440
 here we are, so I hope this little 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.660
 tutorial on how to transfer data 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.130
