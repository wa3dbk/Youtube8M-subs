00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.910
 or the des to the forge to learn to 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.209
 driving today I'll teach you concepts 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.039
 general guidelines on driving if one of the 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.709
 general concepts about driving that 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.539
 we must keep in mind is what is the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.910
 turn or what is the position that should 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.699
 have my car when I want to take a 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.859
 curve I'll show you this case 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.750
 particular is what we are seeing here 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.210
 It's an avenue 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.890
 which in that sense in the cars 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.439
 in this sense the cars come 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.510
 right and here we have a street that the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.219
 crosses a two- way street 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.219
 in that sense the cars would go 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.100
 or in that sense 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.140
 the clear concept that you have to have 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.700
 in mind to take this turn is 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.490
 you should do to the side 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.640
 of the lane to which you are going to turn is 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.850
 say if your intention is to turn towards 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.850
 the left 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.020
 then you should locate here or do 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.470
 the row that is the correct way to 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.720
 take this this turn to do it 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.690
 if the left the idea is that if you 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.600
 do you here 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.210
 on the right side would be for what 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.990
 take to the right or to continue 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.329
 straight 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.939
 that is one of the general concepts is 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.130
 say the general concept and what is the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.460
 general concept itself is that one should 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 medicate towards the side towards which 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 to turn in conclusion the concept 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.909
 general that I am explaining to you today if 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.460
 I turn to the right I position myself to the right 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.799
 of the roadway is 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.810
 we would make the line if I want to go to the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.820
 left would place me to the left 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.310
 of the road 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.630
 in this way you will avoid accidents and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 you would be driving in the shape of a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.510
 correct way an adequate way by 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.970
 please give me a like a comment 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.930
 to this video if you like us see you in the 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.930
 next learn to drive
