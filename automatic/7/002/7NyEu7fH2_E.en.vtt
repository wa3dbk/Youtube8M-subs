looking at it for the first time sort of

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.200 
looking at it for the first time sort of
along<00:00:13.890> with<00:00:14.100> me<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.760> what<00:00:14.970> it<00:00:15.060> looks

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
along with me so this is what it looks

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.419 
along with me so this is what it looks
like<00:00:15.300> it's<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.840> on<00:00:15.930> ATT<00:00:16.529> specs<00:00:17.279> are

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:18.710 
like it's going to be on ATT specs are
kind<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.640> lackluster<00:00:17.849> but<00:00:18.300> again<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.630> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
