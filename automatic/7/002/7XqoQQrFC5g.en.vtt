00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Good day to all, dear 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.060
 viewer channel subscriber with you i and in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 this video I will tell what 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.389
 maximum damage can he cause 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.480
 reads his ultimate 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.840
 you think it might be the millionth 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.630
 damage 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.090
 because if the goal runs through the cards 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.340
 damage will increase wears 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.170
 refuted and so we have an enchantress 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.260
 with aganim I bought 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.990
 fuck ax which 1200 running speed 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.679
 This is pretty fast so we run 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.600
 Ultu potter from our bladiker 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.910
 she flew well and he will be the ax 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.930
 runs from this ultimate to your base 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.739
 Well, that is, the whole map will be overcome now 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 we can contemplate 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.450
 how much maximum will he strike a step 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 one 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.360
 tires certainly not longer than speed 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 will be the ax we can wait 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.180
 on top of the hero here you are 625 yourself 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.340
 the same damage 625 pure damage 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 as it is not just worn clean 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.909
 damage is maximum damage 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.369
 since it is applied over a distance of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.270
 within 2500 units their maximum 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.479
 damage and measured distance to the point in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 which charge the garbage target that is more 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.200
 than 625 damage on her drain be not 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 maybe because damage is inflicted on pc i 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.189
 do not do 1500 units and maximum damage 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 on the first level is 375 and day and 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.729
 damage on the second level 500 damage and on 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.549
 the last level is 625 i think you 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.670
 you can make sure and process 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.939
 it was biyu that more damage than 625 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.159
 can not be because it is the most 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.800
 limit written on dota2 wiki 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.650
 you can read it myself I threw off 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.240
 This article is a link in the video description. 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.350
 can come with you to see everything there 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.540
 it is written well, I think that's all about it 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.820
