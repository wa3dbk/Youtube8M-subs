the<00:00:27.119> language<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.320> music<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.550> scales<00:00:30.480> are

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the language of the music so scales are

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.729 
the language of the music so scales are
a<00:00:30.929> great<00:00:31.769> way<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> sort<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> say<00:00:33.090> okay<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
a great way to sort of say okay here is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.060 
a great way to sort of say okay here is
a<00:00:35.160> pool<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.180> notes<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.440> choose<00:00:37.739> from

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a pool of notes that you can choose from

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.240 
a pool of notes that you can choose from
this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.640> pitch<00:00:39.239> pitch<00:00:39.989> material<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.890> works

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this is pitch pitch material that works

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.090 
this is pitch pitch material that works
over<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> chord<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.719> instance<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.590> play<00:00:43.860> E

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
over a chord so for instance if I play E

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.830 
over a chord so for instance if I play E
minor

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840

pentatonic scale sound against that

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:11.390 
pentatonic scale sound against that
chord<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.510> know<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:01.450> can<00:01:01.630> stop<00:01:02.140> on<00:01:02.530> any<00:01:02.830> pitch

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
you play outside of the scale it will

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.830 
you play outside of the scale it will
you<00:01:24.250> know<00:01:24.280> if<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.640> got<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.450> know<00:01:28.540> those<00:01:28.690> are

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
here the scale is again the pitch

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.950 
here the scale is again the pitch

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:34.870 
what that goes you know that sounds a
lot<00:02:26.210> more<00:02:26.270> like<00:02:26.510> music<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> me<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:34.160> that's<00:02:34.370> what

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
lot more like music to me so that's what

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880 
lot more like music to me so that's what
we<00:02:35.000> call<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.480> language<00:02:35.960> of<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.260> music<00:02:36.710> and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
we call the language of the music and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:53.080 
we call the language of the music and
you<00:02:37.280> discover<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.240> by<00:02:38.870> learning

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.930 

here's<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.270> leg

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.530 

again<00:03:06.980> see<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.010> took<00:03:08.130> one<00:03:08.580> lick<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.030> connected

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
again see I took one lick and connected

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.790 
again see I took one lick and connected
it<00:03:09.690> right<00:03:09.930> up<00:03:10.080> with<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> next

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:37.290 

here's<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.950> price<00:03:24.250> phrase<00:03:29.320> phrase<00:03:30.320> 2<00:03:33.910> again

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.240 

so<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.390> whole<00:03:38.510> idea<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:39.050> I'm<00:03:39.230> playing<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:40.100> can

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
so the whole idea is I'm playing it can

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.300 
so the whole idea is I'm playing it can
even<00:03:40.370> be<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.610> simple<00:03:41.090> melody
