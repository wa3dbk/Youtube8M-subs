and<00:03:27.710> it<00:03:28.310> was<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.490> bit<00:03:28.610> too<00:03:28.760> light<00:03:29.000> for<00:03:29.060> my<00:03:29.390> liking

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
and it was a bit too light for my liking

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.750

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
darkened it up a bit and it just seemed

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.120 
darkened it up a bit and it just seemed
