00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
arrow he has only this one accessory

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.369 
arrow he has only this one accessory
though<00:00:52.729> unless<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.540> bought<00:00:53.750> him<00:00:53.900> loose<00:00:54.080> I<00:00:54.229> don't

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
though unless I bought him loose I don't

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.140 
though unless I bought him loose I don't
remember<00:00:54.589> anymore<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.280> I'm<00:00:55.760> just<00:00:55.970> missing

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
remember anymore and I'm just missing

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.759 
remember anymore and I'm just missing
stuff<00:00:56.479> I<00:00:56.659> think<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.080> is<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.290> only<00:00:57.409> one<00:00:57.589> he

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
stuff I think this is the only one he

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.710 
stuff I think this is the only one he
has<00:00:58.040> no<00:00:58.699> paint<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.089> it<00:00:59.210> at<00:00:59.330> all<00:00:59.449> it's<00:00:59.659> just

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
has no paint on it at all it's just

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.990 
has no paint on it at all it's just
solid<00:01:00.170> green<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:00.619> that's<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.830> little<00:01:01.010> lame<00:01:01.309> but

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
solid green so that's a little lame but

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.820 
solid green so that's a little lame but
it<00:01:02.330> will<00:01:02.510> suffice<00:01:02.720> especially<00:01:03.500> since<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
it will suffice especially since the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.649 
it will suffice especially since the
figure<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.460> it's<00:01:05.239> pretty<00:01:05.360> impressive

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
figure is it's pretty impressive

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:06.310 
figure is it's pretty impressive
actually

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
actually

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.840 
actually
now<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.650> hood<00:01:06.979> does<00:01:07.280> have<00:01:07.460> some<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.700> that

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
now the hood does have some of that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.940 
now the hood does have some of that
mineral<00:01:08.119> issue<00:01:08.600> where<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:09.409> get<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.680> white

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.610 
throw some clear paint on there and that
should<00:01:25.430> prevent<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.780> then<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.500> won't

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
should prevent it and then you won't

should prevent it and then you won't
have<00:01:27.710> any<00:01:27.830> issue<00:01:28.130> at<00:01:28.280> all<00:01:28.400> or<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.120> keep

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
have any issue at all or just keep

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.630 
have any issue at all or just keep
wiping<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.660> off<00:01:29.750> if<00:01:29.900> you're<00:01:30.050> worried<00:01:30.290> about<00:01:30.350> it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
wiping it off if you're worried about it

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.200 
wiping it off if you're worried about it
no<00:01:31.640> big<00:01:31.850> deal

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
no big deal

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.810 
no big deal
so<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.870> hood<00:01:33.050> it's<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.950> separate<00:01:34.250> piece<00:01:34.520> to

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
so the hood it's a separate piece to

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.000 
so the hood it's a separate piece to
allow<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.390> head<00:01:35.540> articulation<00:01:36.260> which<00:01:36.800> I

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
allow for the head articulation which I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.970 
allow for the head articulation which I
do<00:01:37.100> like<00:01:37.550> but<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.780> way<00:01:38.900> it's<00:01:39.080> designed<00:01:39.260> it

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
do like but the way it's designed it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.130 
do like but the way it's designed it
doesn't<00:01:40.370> really<00:01:40.580> look<00:01:40.909> quite<00:01:41.420> right<00:01:41.540> when<00:01:41.990> you

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
doesn't really look quite right when you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.200 
doesn't really look quite right when you
turn<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.620> it<00:01:43.070> doesn't<00:01:43.220> quite<00:01:43.550> look<00:01:43.880> quite

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
turn it it doesn't quite look quite

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.670 
turn it it doesn't quite look quite
right<00:01:44.240> no<00:01:44.690> matter<00:01:44.840> what<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.500> little

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
right no matter what so it's a little

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.350 
right no matter what so it's a little
bit<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:45.980> an<00:01:46.100> issue<00:01:46.250> but<00:01:46.970> it's<00:01:47.090> easily

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
bit of an issue but it's easily

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.180 
bit of an issue but it's easily
overlooked<00:01:47.930> once<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.230> get<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.500> posed<00:01:48.740> because

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
overlooked once you get it posed because

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.649 
overlooked once you get it posed because
he<00:01:49.520> does<00:01:49.700> still<00:01:49.940> have<00:01:50.120> that<00:01:50.240> really<00:01:50.480> cool

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
he does still have that really cool

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.360 
he does still have that really cool
looking<00:01:50.930> hood<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.710> really<00:01:51.920> nice<00:01:52.070> face

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
except for the fact that they did not

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.110 
except for the fact that they did not
paint<00:02:09.590> these<00:02:09.739> laces<00:02:10.159> here<00:02:10.459> that's<00:02:10.759> all<00:02:10.940> just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120

paint these laces here that's all just
one<00:02:11.540> dark<00:02:11.810> green<00:02:12.080> but<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.680> sculpt<00:02:13.040> work<00:02:13.190> is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
one dark green but the sculpt work is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.100 
one dark green but the sculpt work is
really<00:02:13.819> good<00:02:14.000> there's<00:02:14.209> lots<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.540> wrinkles<00:02:14.959> in

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
really good there's lots of wrinkles in

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.990 
really good there's lots of wrinkles in
it<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.470> can<00:02:15.590> see<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.860> stitching<00:02:16.310> around<00:02:16.670> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
it you can see the stitching around the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.119 
it you can see the stitching around the
seams<00:02:17.299> so<00:02:17.959> that's<00:02:18.110> really<00:02:18.290> cool<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.830> then<00:02:19.040> on

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
seams so that's really cool and then on

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.100

a dark green up here they did some

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.230 
a dark green up here they did some
airbrush<00:02:21.500> style<00:02:21.830> shading<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.880> makes<00:02:23.120> it

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
airbrush style shading so that makes it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.460 
airbrush style shading so that makes it
look<00:02:23.390> even<00:02:23.600> better

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470

there<00:03:28.820> just<00:03:29.000> like<00:03:29.090> before<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:29.959> he<00:03:30.170> can<00:03:30.320> hold

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
there just like before so he can hold

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.190 
there just like before so he can hold
his<00:03:30.620> bow<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.250> then<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:31.970> one<00:03:32.180> has<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.720> string

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
his bow and then this one has the string

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.979 
his bow and then this one has the string
hand<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.130> he<00:03:34.250> can<00:03:34.370> pull<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.640> string<00:03:34.700> back<00:03:34.989> so

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
hand so he can pull the string back so

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.900 
hand so he can pull the string back so
that's<00:03:36.110> pretty<00:03:36.320> cool<00:03:36.560> they<00:03:37.190> did<00:03:37.370> not<00:03:37.550> paint

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
that's pretty cool they did not paint

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.900 
that's pretty cool they did not paint
the<00:03:38.720> arms<00:03:39.110> that's<00:03:39.560> molded<00:03:40.070> in<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.370> collar<00:03:40.640> so

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
the arms that's molded in that collar so

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.610 
the arms that's molded in that collar so
the<00:03:41.120> skin<00:03:41.390> doesn't<00:03:41.600> look<00:03:41.840> quite<00:03:41.959> as<00:03:42.200> good<00:03:42.380> as

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the skin doesn't look quite as good as

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.520 
the skin doesn't look quite as good as
on<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.190> other<00:03:43.430> arrow<00:03:43.760> but<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.330> still<00:03:45.140> not<00:03:45.350> bad

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
on the other arrow but I still not bad

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.229 
on the other arrow but I still not bad
and<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:45.830> not<00:03:45.890> molded<00:03:46.520> in<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.700> glossy<00:03:47.060> plastic

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
and it's not molded in a glossy plastic

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.020 
and it's not molded in a glossy plastic
so<00:03:47.630> that's<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:47.989> fine<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:49.370> ab<00:03:49.489> crunch<00:03:49.520> works

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
so that's just fine the ab crunch works

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.510 
so that's just fine the ab crunch works
just<00:03:50.300> fine<00:03:50.480> this<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:51.020> a<00:03:51.050> soft<00:03:51.440> piece<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:52.280> can't

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
just fine this is a soft piece you can't

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.610 
just fine this is a soft piece you can't
take<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.880> quiver<00:03:53.120> off<00:03:53.390> but<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:53.840> can<00:03:54.140> move<00:03:54.380> so

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
take the quiver off but this can move so

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.870 
take the quiver off but this can move so
it<00:03:54.680> doesn't<00:03:54.920> get<00:03:55.010> in<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.160> way<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.550> the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
it doesn't get in the way of the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.180 
it doesn't get in the way of the
articulation<00:03:56.260> waist<00:03:57.260> twist<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.920> fine

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
articulation waist twist is just fine

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.310 
articulation waist twist is just fine
you<00:03:58.700> can<00:03:58.850> also<00:03:59.000> use<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.570> waist<00:03:59.750> twist<00:04:00.050> with

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
you can also use the waist twist with

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.110 
you can also use the waist twist with
the<00:04:00.350> skirt<00:04:00.830> part<00:04:01.040> if<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.370> want<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.760> so<00:04:01.940> that's

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
the skirt part if you want to so that's

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120 
the skirt part if you want to so that's
up<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:03.019> is<00:04:03.200> nice<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.560> soft<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:04.010> you

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
up to you this is nice and soft so you

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.280 
up to you this is nice and soft so you
can<00:04:04.160> still<00:04:04.459> pose<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.880> legs<00:04:05.060> just<00:04:05.330> fine<00:04:05.660> all

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
the way around standard DC you see

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.509 
the way around standard DC you see
articulation<00:04:08.930> nothing<00:04:09.680> really<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.160> point<00:04:10.370> out

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
articulation nothing really to point out

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
jointed ankle but really a nice range of

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.289
