00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.510 
you think and what looping is is just a
way<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.660> layering<00:01:44.260> your<00:01:44.530> performances<00:01:45.340> to

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
way of layering your performances to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.370 
way of layering your performances to
create<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.850> sound<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.180> full<00:01:46.420> band<00:01:46.660> by

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
create the sound of a full band by

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.860 
create the sound of a full band by
yourself<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.940> what<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.180> do<00:01:49.270> is<00:01:49.300> start<00:01:49.660> with<00:01:49.840> a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
yourself so what you do is start with a

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.210 
yourself so what you do is start with a
drumline<00:01:50.380> maybe<00:01:50.830> some<00:01:51.040> beatboxing<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:54.100> that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
drumline maybe some beatboxing get that

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.180 
drumline maybe some beatboxing get that
looping<00:01:54.550> as<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.820> little<00:01:55.090> bass<00:01:55.210> line<00:01:55.450> boom<00:01:56.190> boom

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
looping as a little bass line boom boom

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.380 
looping as a little bass line boom boom
now<00:01:57.820> you're<00:01:57.940> starting<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.180> build<00:01:58.300> up

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
now you're starting to build up

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.700 
now you're starting to build up
something<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.720> sounds<00:01:59.020> pretty<00:01:59.200> cool<00:01:59.440> and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
something that sounds pretty cool and

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.470 
something that sounds pretty cool and
now<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.950> fun<00:02:00.280> part<00:02:00.310> comes<00:02:00.850> when<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.210> add<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
now the fun part comes when you add the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.510 
now the fun part comes when you add the
vocal<00:02:02.050> effects<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.650> layer<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.310> top

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
vocal effects and layer that on top
