00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
Tesla tog right down the middle I think

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.800 
Tesla tog right down the middle I think
there's<00:03:33.340> about<00:03:33.460> 14<00:03:33.940> or<00:03:34.030> 15<00:03:34.210> of<00:03:34.570> them<00:03:34.690> right

there's about 14 or 15 of them right
down<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.080> middle<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.550> also<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.700> goo<00:03:36.970> cons

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
down the middle and also the goo cons

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.800 
down the middle and also the goo cons
hair<00:03:37.750> too<00:03:37.870> slow<00:03:38.220> justice<00:03:39.220> loam<00:03:39.460> deck<00:03:39.810> okay

hair too slow justice loam deck okay

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.110 
hair too slow justice loam deck okay
this<00:03:40.990> is<00:03:41.110> level<00:03:41.290> 99<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.000> whole

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
this is level 99 this is the whole

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.180 
this is level 99 this is the whole
reason<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.660> build<00:03:47.020> up<00:03:47.200> two<00:03:47.410> towers<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.160> the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
reason we build up two towers in the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:04:00.140 
reason we build up two towers in the
middle<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.780> this<00:03:50.590> for<00:03:50.770> these<00:03:50.860> helicopters

do in the endless maze wait take it
close<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.490> around<00:04:56.639> here<00:04:56.760> pause<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.960> game

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
close to around here pause the game

and<00:05:03.710> then<00:05:06.139> place<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:08.310> move<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.639> him<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:09.120> move

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
and then place you move to him you move

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.600 
and then place you move to him you move
this<00:05:09.479> from<00:05:09.720> here<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.139> here<00:05:10.290> basically<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:11.430> now

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
this from here to here basically so now

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.500 
this from here to here basically so now
that<00:05:12.200> will<00:05:13.200> send<00:05:13.500> your<00:05:13.919> enemy<00:05:14.280> back<00:05:15.180> through

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
the maze so that's pretty much how the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.469 
the maze so that's pretty much how the
whole<00:05:18.630> endless<00:05:19.020> maze<00:05:19.229> works<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:24.240> ground

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
whole endless maze works and the ground

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.210 
whole endless maze works and the ground
enemies<00:05:24.810> don't<00:05:24.990> have<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.229> chance<00:05:25.470> using<00:05:26.130> this

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
enemies don't have a chance using this

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:42.460 
enemies don't have a chance using this
method

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.990 

all<00:05:43.470> right<00:05:43.620> you<00:05:43.770> see<00:05:43.950> now<00:05:44.160> he's<00:05:44.340> forced<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.850> go

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
all right you see now he's forced to go

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.650 
all right you see now he's forced to go
back<00:05:45.030> through<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.480> middle<00:05:45.600> and<00:05:47.360> quickly<00:05:48.360> take

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
back through the middle and quickly take

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.590 
back through the middle and quickly take
care<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.110> they<00:05:49.320> are<00:05:49.980> you<00:05:50.190> can<00:05:50.370> try<00:05:51.210> this<00:05:51.270> method

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
care so they are you can try this method

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.870 
care so they are you can try this method
and<00:05:53.270> try<00:05:54.270> for<00:05:54.450> yourself<00:05:54.540> see<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.770> see<00:05:56.730> what

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
and try for yourself see you see what

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.640 
and try for yourself see you see what

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
you think I'm going to move that back to

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.550 
you think I'm going to move that back to
send<00:06:01.920> these<00:06:02.040> guys<00:06:02.450> back<00:06:03.450> through<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:03.780> maze<00:06:03.960> so

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
send these guys back through the maze so

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.840 
send these guys back through the maze so
it's<00:06:04.860> just<00:06:04.950> another<00:06:05.190> fun<00:06:05.430> way<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.580> play
