near the end of the first half damage
straight<00:01:35.290> through<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.530> go<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:35.830> try<00:01:35.920> a

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
straight through and go and try a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.560 
straight through and go and try a
terrible<00:01:36.520> chip<00:01:36.670> if<00:01:36.790> they<00:01:36.880> gone<00:01:37.060> low<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.479> hard

to<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.930> keepers<00:01:38.320> near<00:01:38.500> both<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.920> think<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:39.369> it's

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
to the keepers near both I think so it's

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.520 
to the keepers near both I think so it's
going<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.729> be<00:01:39.790> one<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.350> shakira<00:01:41.350> is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
going to be one that shakira is

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.109 
going to be one that shakira is
incredible<00:01:42.190> he's<00:01:42.310> beating<00:01:42.700> players<00:01:42.940> the

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
incredible he's beating players the

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.940 
incredible he's beating players the
whole<00:01:43.240> time<00:01:43.479> not<00:01:44.170> quite<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.410> gold<00:01:44.649> first<00:01:44.800> I

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
whole time not quite the gold first I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.999 
whole time not quite the gold first I
predicted<00:01:45.399> but<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.759> close<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.830> that's<00:01:47.830> why

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
predicted but it is close and that's why

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.710 
predicted but it is close and that's why
I<00:01:48.039> thought<00:01:48.220> may<00:01:48.369> happens<00:01:48.880> Argentine<00:01:49.479> have<00:01:49.630> to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
I thought may happens Argentine have to

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.240 
I thought may happens Argentine have to
be<00:01:49.810> careful<00:01:50.200> with<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.380> because<00:01:50.530> they're<00:01:51.039> very

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
be careful with it because they're very

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.859 
be careful with it because they're very
long<00:01:51.490> are<00:01:51.640> messy<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:51.940> he's<00:01:52.149> been<00:01:52.360> marked<00:01:52.690> well

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
long are messy and he's been marked well
