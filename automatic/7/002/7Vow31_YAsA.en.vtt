00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.990
 they are recessed both on the motherboard 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.329
 css sprites the outside is on 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.950

 also included a nano a4 fin connector 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.400
 here it is 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.910
 it's a sort of adapter so we can choose if 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.210
 connect the vent directly on the motherboard if we have the 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.440

 all the hot air is immediately expelled as soon as it is emitted by the heat sink 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.139
 that to the processor 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.919
