00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.680
 good sensor won't be enough 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.929
 s9900 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.330
 the camera fits in my jeans pocket 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.960
 despite the monstrous power of approach 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.850

 I donâ€™t want to think how much I weigh 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.550
 lens even for the smallest without 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 16 megapixel mirrors give a good 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.850
 detail on vanity 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.350
 hybrid stabilizer helps 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.030
 handle long exposures 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.060
 and when shooting on a large focal 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.560
 distance let's see how the camera 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.560
 works with the main plots 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.550
 captured can immediately transfer a smartphone 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.290
 the camera itself will raise the wi-fi network 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.210
 which he will see all he needs 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.090
 download special applications which 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.500
 feel and for android or ios 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.870
 built-in satellite receiver 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.210
 gps and glonass has a wider 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.010
 range of possibilities than usual he 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.590
 may not only depend on each frame 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.880
 geolocation or set date time itself 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.040
 and even the time zone 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.130
 but the camera can be used as 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.240
 she will even show this electronic map 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.220
 landmark with 9700 may itself 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.880
 choose the most appropriate story 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.530
 the program 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.040
 either you can do it manually 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.690
 preferring one of the many options 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.520
 the photographer is available overlay on the picture 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.950
 all kinds of filters in real time 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.710
 including tinting effect or 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.170
 change experienced amateur accustomed 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.790
 hands can control everything 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.270
 shutter speeds 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.120
 for example from 8 seconds to 2000 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.790
 sensitivity from 125 to 6400 units 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.670
 iso or use of the sea 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.739
 and of course adjust the aperture for 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.380
 shooting using a three inch screen 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.720
 with a resolution of 921 thousand pixels 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.720
 well considered even in bright sun 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.850
 video recording is possible as usual 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.670
 1080p mode 60 frames in

 a second and with acceleration up to two times 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.990
 because of the bear up to eight times that is 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.130
 you can write quite interesting 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.319
 dynamic plots 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.940
 the sound is written by the built-in microphone with 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.480
 the ability to enable a special filter 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.270
 reducing man 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.700

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.200
 possibility of charging from big 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.300
 the number of sources through usb and 30 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.410
 4x zoom makes you interesting 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.410
