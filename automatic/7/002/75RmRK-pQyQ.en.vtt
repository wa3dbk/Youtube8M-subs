that implicit right here now take your i

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.970 
that implicit right here now take your i
omega<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:16.220> slowly<00:03:16.790> carefully<00:03:17.300> slide<00:03:18.080> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
omega and you slowly carefully slide it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.420 
omega and you slowly carefully slide it
in<00:03:19.160> like<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:20.770> what<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.860> do<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.100> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
in like this and what you do is the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.070 
in like this and what you do is the
eject<00:03:22.700> button<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> bottom<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.480> know<00:03:23.900> to

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
eject button on the bottom you know to

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.510 
eject button on the bottom you know to
slide<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.030> hold<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.240> just<00:03:26.650> hold<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.070> slides

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
slide and hold it just hold it it slides

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.940 
slide and hold it just hold it it slides
a<00:03:28.670> tiny<00:03:28.940> bit<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:29.360> hold<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.900> slide<00:03:30.230> about

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
a tiny bit just hold it slide about

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.410 
a tiny bit just hold it slide about
three<00:03:31.220> seconds<00:03:32.260> let<00:03:33.260> go<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:34.209> see<00:03:35.209> where<00:03:35.330> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
three seconds let go and see where the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.780 
three seconds let go and see where the
button<00:03:35.630> power<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.620> turn<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.580> it's<00:03:37.730> in

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
button power just turn it so it's in

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.760 
button power just turn it so it's in
play<00:03:38.000> mode<00:03:38.209> like<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.600> it'll<00:03:39.290> make<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.560> sound

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
play mode like that it'll make the sound

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.320 
play mode like that it'll make the sound
and<00:03:40.120> then<00:03:41.120> turn<00:03:41.300> it<00:03:41.360> back<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.670> now<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:43.880> code

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
and then turn it back so now the code

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.810 
and then turn it back so now the code
should<00:03:44.750> from<00:03:45.170> your<00:03:45.410> env<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:46.520> was<00:03:46.640> putting

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
should from your env to that was putting

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.430 
should from your env to that was putting
the<00:03:47.000> video<00:03:47.209> camera<00:03:47.630> should<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.230> would<00:03:48.320> be

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
the video camera should that would be

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.949 
the video camera should that would be
inside<00:03:48.800> of<00:03:48.830> your<00:03:48.980> i<00:03:49.040> omega<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:50.390> now<00:03:50.510> pull<00:03:50.780> out

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
inside of your i omega so now pull out

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.190 
inside of your i omega so now pull out
your<00:03:51.650> i<00:03:51.680> omega<00:03:52.070> external<00:03:52.550> hard<00:03:52.670> drive<00:03:56.020> and<00:03:57.020> now

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
your i omega external hard drive and now

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.610 
your i omega external hard drive and now
you<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.770> turn<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.130> off

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.850 

the<00:04:05.620> video<00:04:05.860> camera<00:04:06.100> is<00:04:06.400> no<00:04:06.520> longer<00:04:06.760> required

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
the video camera is no longer required

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.260 
the video camera is no longer required
now<00:04:08.860> just<00:04:09.400> take<00:04:09.580> this<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.030> move<00:04:10.300> it<00:04:10.450> aside

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
now just take this and move it aside

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.240 
now just take this and move it aside
this<00:04:13.270> torque<00:04:13.569> is<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:14.140> little<00:04:14.440> tricky<00:04:14.770> but<00:04:14.980> it's

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
this torque is a little tricky but it's

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.210 
this torque is a little tricky but it's
at<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:15.610> same<00:04:15.760> time<00:04:15.940> it's<00:04:16.209> pretty<00:04:16.450> simple<00:04:16.690> to

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
at the same time it's pretty simple to

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.180 
at the same time it's pretty simple to
you<00:04:18.220> turn<00:04:18.459> on<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:19.350> label<00:04:20.350> maker<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:24.010> what

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
you turn on the label maker and what

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.159 
you turn on the label maker and what
happens<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.700> now<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> codes<00:04:25.510> inside<00:04:25.960> of

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
happens is now that the codes inside of

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.170 
happens is now that the codes inside of
it<00:04:26.260> it's<00:04:26.500> you're<00:04:27.370> not<00:04:27.610> going<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.820> see<00:04:27.910> anything

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
it it's you're not going to see anything

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.260 
it it's you're not going to see anything
on<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.510> screen<00:04:28.950> right<00:04:29.950> so<00:04:30.880> what<00:04:31.060> you're<00:04:31.180> going

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
to do is type in the code I I 090 and

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.100 
to do is type in the code I I 090 and
hit<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.350> enter<00:04:38.380> button<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:40.810> has<00:04:40.840> just
