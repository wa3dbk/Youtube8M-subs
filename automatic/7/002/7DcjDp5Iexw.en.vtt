lesson day on open chord shortcuts so

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.660 
lesson day on open chord shortcuts so
ways<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.170> more<00:00:16.440> easily<00:00:16.650> change<00:00:17.100> from<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.430> open

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
ways to more easily change from one open

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.390 
ways to more easily change from one open
chord<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.150> another<00:00:18.180> open<00:00:18.720> chord<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.400> if

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
chord to another open chord and if

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.710 
chord to another open chord and if
you've<00:00:20.699> been<00:00:20.820> playing<00:00:21.060> while<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.420> probably

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you've been playing while you probably

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.519 
you've been playing while you probably
already<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.470> most<00:00:22.740> these<00:00:23.039> things<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:24.529> pretty

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
already do most these things it's pretty

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.689 
already do most these things it's pretty
simple<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:27.090> idea<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.869> we've<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.560> say<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
simple the idea is if we've got say an a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.910 
simple the idea is if we've got say an a
minor<00:00:29.970> chord<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.779> change<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> C<00:00:31.470> Corp<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
minor chord we can change the C Corp I

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.799 
minor chord we can change the C Corp I
only<00:00:32.099> moving<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.669> finger<00:00:33.149> instead<00:00:33.660> of

lifting them all up and then trying to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
put them down from great distance which

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360 
put them down from great distance which
means<00:00:48.539> you're<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:48.840> likely<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> miss<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
means you're more likely to miss so

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.420 
means you're more likely to miss so

pressing the tips of the fingers will

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.450 
pressing the tips of the fingers will
help<00:00:58.710> greatly<00:00:59.329> ok<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.859> mildly<00:01:01.859> scored

shortcuts I hope to arrange them all in
a<00:01:05.100> big<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> grid<00:01:06.299> nine<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:07.409> over<00:01:07.850> here

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
a big kind of grid nine here over here

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.990 
a big kind of grid nine here over here
which<00:01:09.659> should<00:01:10.549> show<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> different

inshore last night ok so starting see
and<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.540> first<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> most<00:01:31.170> obvious<00:01:31.380> one

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and the first one the most obvious one

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.060 
and the first one the most obvious one
is<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> place<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.950> switching<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
is if you place see you switching to a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.429 
is if you place see you switching to a
minor<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.360> don't<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.840> lift<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.140> first

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439

next<00:01:46.040> one<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:47.920> move<00:01:48.920> from<00:01:49.070> A<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.340> G<00:01:52.780> if<00:01:53.780> we

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
next one is a move from A to G if we

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.400 
next one is a move from A to G if we
look<00:01:54.110> at<00:01:54.170> our<00:01:54.320> ring<00:01:54.650> finger<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:55.660> slides<00:01:56.660> up<00:01:56.930> one

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
look at our ring finger it slides up one

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.770 
look at our ring finger it slides up one
fret<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.250> other<00:01:58.460> fingers<00:01:58.820> slot<00:01:59.600> into
