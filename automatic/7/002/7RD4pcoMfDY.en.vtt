removes like the dairy from the butter
and<00:03:12.640> then<00:03:12.849> it<00:03:12.940> leaves<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.359> with<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.750> thing

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
and then it leaves you with this thing

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.180 
and then it leaves you with this thing
called<00:03:14.170> clarified<00:03:14.620> butter<00:03:14.799> which<00:03:15.040> is

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
supposedly better for you because it

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.750 
supposedly better for you because it
takes<00:03:17.380> out<00:03:17.590> all<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:18.220> stuff<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.519> isn't

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.370 
takes out all of the stuff that isn't
good<00:03:19.030> for<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.329> in<00:03:19.569> butter<00:03:19.840> if<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.170> makes<00:03:20.319> any

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
good for you in butter if that makes any

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.979 
good for you in butter if that makes any
sense<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:21.130> if<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:21.819> are<00:03:22.269> following<00:03:22.660> like<00:03:22.959> a
