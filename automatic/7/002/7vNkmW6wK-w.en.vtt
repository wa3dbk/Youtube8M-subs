here is the result let's see what
happens<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.509> US<00:01:40.110> t-mobile<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
happens there you go US t-mobile and it

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.240 
happens there you go US t-mobile and it
shows<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> IMEI<00:01:42.420> number<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.250> if

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
shows you the IMEI number there so if

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.560 
shows you the IMEI number there so if
you<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> information<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.360> hand

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you don't have that information on hand

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
you don't have that information on hand
and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> number<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.130> can

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and you just have the number you can

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.679 
and you just have the number you can
figure<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.549> our<00:01:47.670> which<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.240> does<00:01:48.420> belong<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
figure out our which it does belong to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.190 
figure out our which it does belong to
this<00:01:48.960> has<00:01:49.200> many<00:01:49.439> applications<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
this has many applications you can be a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
this has many applications you can be a
sore<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.369> carries<00:01:53.759> phone<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> might
