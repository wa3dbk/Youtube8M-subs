00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Attention this is not a toy and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.670
 not to use with lightheartedness 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.899
 he should own such a weapon 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.189
 can handle it and also the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.719
 adequate responsibility for this 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.800
 Any abuse can take over 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.450
 is punishable 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.920
 this weapon does not belong to me and became 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.750
 only under the supervision of an experienced 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.350
 Weapon ownership and Hunter does not use 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 imitate my dear friends like me 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 have my crossbow for you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.260
 terrace packed you see sunshine 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.609
 beautiful weather 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.170
 I thought I'll show you this way 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.410
 a little you can see it is one 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.110
 crossbow with riflescope of barnett 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.200
 At that time I joined the ballet command 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.879
 ebay auctioned yes rifle scope is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.969
 I believe many times magnification behind 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.030
 more beautiful, that's the longing 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 with whatever the matter of it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.329
 No Plan I'm sorry here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.149
 you always see the arrow for a moment 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.070
 That's a 24 inch case with a steel case 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.690
 top on the top of the state can 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.020
 you replace the back you see the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.000
 Error carriage from the arrow 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.820
 yes that is it is just there and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.350
 also here this hunting tip very sharp 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.409
 So you should watch out for that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.900
 four sounds and is just then for hunters 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.210
 to use or 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.939
 available if you order for example to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.820
 hunt wants to go wild boars as well 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.470
 always yes yes I'll show you that again 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 just screwing it fast is easy 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.530
 here on the case not just short 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.720
 the camera on the floor 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 You just write off the top in front 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.540
 because you can namely the community of the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.549
 continue to use this case is pretty 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.439
 practically the part screws on it 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.049
 schraub schraub then the thing is yes 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.840
 ever since it went forward is 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.460
 relatively stable is somehow well 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.479
 I do not want to say it broken quickly 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.439
 but it is definitely broken 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.030
 That's why you should not necessarily 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.490
 shoot somewhere on the stadium or 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.560
 what do I know 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 and yes short camera I put away show 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.750
 Just how you like the crossbow 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.549
 exciting and has the following 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 is a unique crossbow 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.969
 a clique crossbow that means you pull 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.079
 back the shaft back that's 80 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.149
 kilograms therefore quite heavy 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.530
 Now it's looking forward 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.290
 that's only possible with the ballet command 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.390
 short is to secure that's only in the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.370
 ballet command that you follow them 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 behind it can be seen 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.510
 no other crossbow because of that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.629
 I just hit it where the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.590
 The offer was so here you see it 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.480
 is save 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.890
 very important not to run out of hands 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.220
 have in between and then out of what 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.409
 squeeze 89 kg the hand bottle comes 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.379
 not good oh no this is by the way 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.340
 Stahlseil and hurts so short in 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.209
 leveled 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.519
 with the third spring down in 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.230
 this girl in there should I show it 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.870
 you came to the back part with it 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.540
 could the stuck so he would not 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.069
 falls 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.599
 the thing is glasses fits fits has air 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.129
 and then I would say you can 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.290
 right now write the comments 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.970
 what am I doing with the crossbow? 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.230
 to make of shooting at people 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.209
 or some nonsense 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.769
 Here you see briefly that I think knows 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.400
 not if you can see it that way sooner 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.079
 fewer 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.540
 I could for example use the arrow 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.699
 shoot at this footballer 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.319
 just write the comments and 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.269
 Maybe I'll show you in 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.900
 my room course what you can do with it 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.900
 can do anything 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.430
 I always have my room here 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.780
 you should be able to move your seat 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.930
 For example, here's an im here 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.780
 Watch TV and go here to the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.160
 games corner and somehow 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 shit that's shit 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.420
 the two are shit away with it 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.130
 This is also absolutely archaic 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.510
 that too can go away congratulations 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.550
 then there was something inferior 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.660
 I think there is the name does not have 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:58.820
 as system where is it there 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.470
 there it is inferior 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:07.010
 inferior shit cages away away away 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.390
 matches and you could then of course 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.430
 with horny crossbow all 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.560
 in a row on ryan and then with the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.900
 stiff once proud byd is 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.090
 company is pure lego batman and 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.419
 such a brisk and about tom 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.220
 Clancy is here too, of course I can 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.270
 but also the gambling dens a little bit 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.919
 break 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.470
 I still have such a small one 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.940
 sniper implementing public can use is 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.680
 Of course, they do too 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.030
 nice thing and there is also one 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.830
 BarablÃ¶se I wanted you once 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.419
 course show an achievement 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.330
 if you do not know how barry caliber 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.790
 50 cartridge looks like you know that now 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.890
 is from berit straight to 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.419
 compare everywhere so you can 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.280
 you guys could imagine that 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.770
 is really huge that's the way the way 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.300
 mercedes star from our old benz 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.950
 no he is not stealing from parked 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.840
 vehicles ok you can damn you now 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.250
 can you imagine nothing below the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.720
 if you can not beat anything 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.310
 just the same as the players 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.290
 then you can imagine that 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.540
 namely almost as big and there comes 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.940
 The cartridge Rhine-Waal video over a lot 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.350
 fun and writes in the comments purely 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.130
 why much fun no idea 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.130
 just do not write something
