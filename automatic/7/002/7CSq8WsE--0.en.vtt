there are total 47 bins of comics here

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.690 
there are total 47 bins of comics here
each<00:02:04.890> bin<00:02:05.340> holds<00:02:06.020> 2,000<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.979> ninety

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
each bin holds 2,000 so that's ninety

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.930 
each bin holds 2,000 so that's ninety
four<00:02:09.000> thousand<00:02:09.959> common<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.670> take<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
four thousand common and if you take a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.880 
four thousand common and if you take a
look<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> alphabetic<00:02:13.080> letters<00:02:13.260> as<00:02:13.709> we're

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
look at the alphabetic letters as we're

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.039 
look at the alphabetic letters as we're
going<00:02:14.069> along<00:02:14.310> here<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.780> just

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
going along here this is just

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.680 
going along here this is just
unbelievably<00:02:16.860> comprehensive<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:18.269> have<00:02:18.420> tried

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
unbelievably comprehensive we have tried

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.869 
unbelievably comprehensive we have tried
to<00:02:18.840> make<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.379> that<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.680> any<00:02:19.890> fan<00:02:20.220> comes<00:02:20.610> by

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
to make it so that if any fan comes by

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.910 
to make it so that if any fan comes by
our<00:02:21.120> booth<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:21.840> bring<00:02:22.110> their<00:02:22.349> want<00:02:22.590> list

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
our booth and they bring their want list

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.259 
our booth and they bring their want list
they<00:02:23.580> simply<00:02:24.060> cannot<00:02:24.980> walk<00:02:25.980> away<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.120> at

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
they simply cannot walk away but that at

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.589 
they simply cannot walk away but that at
least<00:02:27.510> having<00:02:27.870> filled<00:02:28.290> some<00:02:28.830> folders<00:02:29.670> this

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
least having filled some folders this

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.069 
least having filled some folders this
inventory<00:02:30.900> doesn't<00:02:31.379> go<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> lot<00:02:31.739> prior<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.310> 1983

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
inventory doesn't go a lot prior to 1983

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.150 
inventory doesn't go a lot prior to 1983
but<00:02:34.079> it<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.470> very<00:02:34.829> substantial<00:02:35.190> from<00:02:36.019> 1983

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
but it is very substantial from 1983

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.000 
but it is very substantial from 1983
upwards<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.840> goes<00:02:40.049> all<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.560> way<00:02:40.709> around

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
upwards then it goes all the way around

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.180 
upwards then it goes all the way around
I<00:02:41.519> mean<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.620> letters<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
I mean this is just the letters in the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
all we have to shift everything in order

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.820 
all we have to shift everything in order
to<00:02:54.310> insert<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.150> titles<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.960> can<00:02:56.200> added

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
but also we have to then change all the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.580 
but also we have to then change all the
lettering<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.880> outside<00:03:01.480> because<00:03:02.170> however

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
things have shifted around that's going

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.180 
things have shifted around that's going
to<00:03:05.230> determine<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:06.730> we<00:03:07.000> have<00:03:07.330> as<00:03:08.170> regards<00:03:08.920> the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
to determine what we have as regards the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.560 
to determine what we have as regards the
need<00:03:09.460> for<00:03:09.490> letters<00:03:11.820> what<00:03:12.820> you're<00:03:13.060> seeing<00:03:13.360> here

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
need for letters what you're seeing here

need for letters what you're seeing here
in<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.950> booth<00:03:15.550> is<00:03:15.910> an<00:03:16.870> evolutionary

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
in with this booth is an evolutionary

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.480 
in with this booth is an evolutionary
process<00:03:18.010> two<00:03:18.760> years<00:03:19.090> ago<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:20.530> had<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.250> that

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
process two years ago we had it so that

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.550 
process two years ago we had it so that
when<00:03:21.700> we<00:03:21.850> took<00:03:22.090> these<00:03:22.360> bins<00:03:22.780> out<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.440> the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
when we took these bins out to the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.640 
when we took these bins out to the
convention<00:03:24.250> we<00:03:24.760> actually<00:03:25.150> had<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.540> take<00:03:25.780> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
convention we actually had to take the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.610 
convention we actually had to take the
comics<00:03:27.430> out<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.480> bins<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.050> stack<00:03:29.290> them<00:03:29.470> on

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
comics out of the bins and stack them on

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.860 
comics out of the bins and stack them on
pallets<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.340> then<00:03:30.430> ship<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.880> bin<00:03:31.090> separately

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
pallets and then ship the bin separately

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.500 
pallets and then ship the bin separately
then<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.830> figured<00:03:33.160> out<00:03:33.310> ways<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:34.060> reinforce

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
then we figured out ways to reinforce

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.590 
then we figured out ways to reinforce
the<00:03:35.200> bins<00:03:35.440> with<00:03:35.860> steel<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.090> we<00:03:37.390> could

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
the bins with steel so that we could

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.590 
the bins with steel so that we could
ship<00:03:37.930> them<00:03:37.960> as<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:39.370> trouble<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.150> then<00:03:40.480> they

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
ship them as is trouble is then they

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.410 
ship them as is trouble is then they
became<00:03:40.930> very<00:03:41.290> very<00:03:41.620> heavy<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.790> if<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.210> look

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
became very very heavy so if you look

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.740 
became very very heavy so if you look
down<00:03:43.600> here<00:03:43.660> at<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.140> bottom<00:03:44.940> all<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.330> these<00:03:46.480> are

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
down here at the bottom all of these are

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.470 
down here at the bottom all of these are
now<00:03:46.960> on<00:03:47.290> very<00:03:47.650> expensive<00:03:48.340> casters<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.030> those

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
now on very expensive casters that those

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.290 
now on very expensive casters that those
swivel<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.230> lock

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
swivel and lock

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.780 
swivel and lock
all<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.900> pins<00:03:53.110> for<00:03:53.470> safety<00:03:53.980> purposes<00:03:54.550> have

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
all the pins for safety purposes have

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.480 
all the pins for safety purposes have
now<00:03:54.970> been<00:03:55.330> bolted<00:03:55.720> together<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:57.160> we<00:03:57.310> actually

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
now been bolted together so we actually

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.000 
now been bolted together so we actually
have<00:03:57.850> safety<00:03:58.330> bolts<00:03:58.690> on<00:03:58.870> them<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.620> way<00:03:59.830> if

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
have safety bolts on them that way if

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.730 
have safety bolts on them that way if
people<00:04:00.400> are<00:04:00.520> opening<00:04:00.970> up<00:04:01.120> multiple<00:04:01.480> doors<00:04:02.140> at

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
people are opening up multiple doors at

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.460 
people are opening up multiple doors at
the<00:04:03.160> same<00:04:03.430> time<00:04:03.820> we<00:04:04.510> don't<00:04:04.630> have<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.900> problem

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
the same time we don't have a problem

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.590 
the same time we don't have a problem
with<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.800> bins<00:04:06.040> tipping<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.030> killing<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
with the bins tipping it and killing the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.880 
with the bins tipping it and killing the
people<00:04:07.780> because<00:04:08.020> that's<00:04:08.140> considered<00:04:08.650> poor

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
people because that's considered poor

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.780 
people because that's considered poor
form<00:04:08.920> at<00:04:09.820> any<00:04:09.850> convention<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:12.040> this<00:04:12.610> is

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
form at any convention so this is
