I've been working on this off and on for
about<00:00:38.149> three<00:00:38.570> days<00:00:38.719> now<00:00:39.019> and<00:00:39.379> I<00:00:40.280> just<00:00:40.489> want<00:00:40.760> to

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
about three days now and I just want to

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.219 
about three days now and I just want to

give you an update on what I'm doing

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.660 
give you an update on what I'm doing
with<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.649> I've<00:00:43.429> got<00:00:43.729> the<00:00:45.039> chainstay<00:00:46.039> here<00:00:46.489> I

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
with it I've got the chainstay here I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.340 
with it I've got the chainstay here I
got<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.059> all<00:00:47.179> filled<00:00:47.420> in<00:00:47.510> with<00:00:47.690> bondo<00:00:48.079> and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
got that all filled in with bondo and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.649 
got that all filled in with bondo and
sanded<00:00:48.829> down<00:00:48.859> nicely<00:00:49.329> now<00:00:50.329> I've<00:00:50.510> also

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
sanded down nicely now I've also

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.420 
sanded down nicely now I've also
transitioned<00:00:51.439> from<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.799> bottom<00:00:52.100> bracket

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
transitioned from the bottom bracket

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.759 
transitioned from the bottom bracket
area<00:00:52.670> up<00:00:53.299> into<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.100> seat<00:00:55.100> tube<00:00:55.309> here<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.769> you

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
area up into the seat tube here and you

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.029 
area up into the seat tube here and you
can<00:00:57.920> see<00:00:58.039> this<00:00:58.219> nice<00:00:58.399> fairing<00:00:58.960> here<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.199> might

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
can see this nice fairing here I might

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.419 
can see this nice fairing here I might
just<00:01:01.250> use<00:01:01.369> some<00:01:01.549> bondo<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.189> sanding<00:01:04.189> blocks

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:04.429 
just use some bondo and sanding blocks

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:06.850 
just use some bondo and sanding blocks
and<00:01:04.699> stuff<00:01:04.909> now<00:01:05.689> I<00:01:05.720> do<00:01:06.020> all<00:01:06.259> this<00:01:06.409> stuff<00:01:06.649> by

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
and stuff now I do all this stuff by

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.200 
and stuff now I do all this stuff by
hand<00:01:07.220> that's<00:01:07.490> why<00:01:07.610> it<00:01:07.670> takes<00:01:07.850> me<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:08.179> long

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
hand that's why it takes me so long

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.789 
hand that's why it takes me so long
because<00:01:08.690> when<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:08.990> use<00:01:09.170> power<00:01:09.350> tools

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
because when I use power tools

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.940 
because when I use power tools
I<00:01:09.920> seem<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:12.080> grind<00:01:12.289> too<00:01:12.409> much<00:01:12.560> away<00:01:12.709> usually

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
I seem to to grind too much away usually

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.270 
I seem to to grind too much away usually
so<00:01:13.940> I<00:01:13.970> prefer<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.450> use<00:01:14.509> uh<00:01:14.630> sandy<00:01:15.080> blocks<00:01:15.350> also

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
so I prefer to use uh sandy blocks also

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.279 
so I prefer to use uh sandy blocks also
if<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.850> if<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.330> sand<00:01:17.600> something<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.229> don't

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
if I if I sand something and I don't

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.620 
if I if I sand something and I don't
like<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.679> I'll<00:01:18.799> add<00:01:19.159> more<00:01:19.310> bondo<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.970> sand

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
like it I'll add more bondo to it sand

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.779 
like it I'll add more bondo to it sand
it's<00:01:20.750> more<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.799> more<00:01:22.009> bondo<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.429> its<00:01:22.580> hand

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
it's more and more bondo to its hand

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.370 
it's more and more bondo to its hand
it's<00:01:22.909> more<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.929> can<00:01:24.049> be<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.140> time-consuming

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's more so it can be a time-consuming

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.940 
it's more so it can be a time-consuming
process<00:01:24.890> but<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:27.409> better<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.679> spend<00:01:27.799> the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
process but it's better to spend the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.859 
process but it's better to spend the
time<00:01:28.100> on<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.340> plug<00:01:28.580> now<00:01:28.610> than<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.569> to<00:01:29.720> worry

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
time on the plug now than have to worry

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:30.430 
time on the plug now than have to worry
about<00:01:29.959> it<00:01:30.140> later

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
about it later

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.279 
about it later
so<00:01:30.950> let<00:01:31.549> me<00:01:31.610> show<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:31.819> what<00:01:32.780> I've<00:01:32.899> got<00:01:33.049> here

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
so let me show you what I've got here

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.340 
so let me show you what I've got here
this<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.250> head<00:01:34.399> tube<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:35.990> what

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
this is the the head tube this is what

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.249 
this is the the head tube this is what
I've<00:01:36.439> been<00:01:36.500> spending<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.920> lot<00:01:37.069> of<00:01:37.100> my<00:01:37.250> time<00:01:37.399> on

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
I've been spending a lot of my time on

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.969 
I've been spending a lot of my time on
I've<00:01:39.259> been<00:01:39.500> having<00:01:39.709> a<00:01:39.769> hard<00:01:39.950> time

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
I've been having a hard time

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.790 
I've been having a hard time
transitioning<00:01:40.690> these<00:01:41.690> two<00:01:42.229> inch<00:01:42.379> cups<00:01:42.619> down

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
transitioning these two inch cups down

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.839 
transitioning these two inch cups down
to<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.129> one<00:01:43.459> and<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.670> half<00:01:43.789> inch<00:01:44.110> frame<00:01:45.110> so

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
to the one and a half inch frame so

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.589 
to the one and a half inch frame so
originally<00:01:46.849> I<00:01:46.910> was<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.119> going<00:01:47.239> to<00:01:47.300> have<00:01:47.420> this

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
originally I was just going to have this

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.139 
originally I was just going to have this
come<00:01:47.840> back<00:01:48.050> straight<00:01:48.349> across<00:01:48.700> for<00:01:49.700> for

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
come back straight across for for

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.479 
come back straight across for for
aerodynamics<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.019> don't<00:01:52.009> like<00:01:52.129> the<00:01:52.280> way<00:01:52.369> it

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.489 
aerodynamics but don't like the way it

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.999 
aerodynamics but don't like the way it
looks<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.910> just<00:01:53.119> really<00:01:53.330> looks<00:01:53.450> weird<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.500> I've

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
looks it just really looks weird so I've

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.309 
looks it just really looks weird so I've
got<00:01:55.220> well<00:01:55.369> I've<00:01:55.429> gone<00:01:55.610> ahead<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:55.940> I<00:01:56.569> filled

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
got well I've gone ahead and I filled

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.859 
got well I've gone ahead and I filled
all<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:57.679> in<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.330> I'll<00:01:59.330> probably<00:01:59.509> put<00:01:59.720> some

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
all this in and I'll probably put some

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.660 
all this in and I'll probably put some
more<00:01:59.989> bondo<00:02:00.289> on<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:00.530> filling<00:02:01.399> some<00:02:01.489> of<00:02:01.550> these

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
more bondo on it filling some of these

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.029 
more bondo on it filling some of these
gaps<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.149> then<00:02:02.239> I'll<00:02:02.330> actually<00:02:02.769> shape<00:02:03.769> this

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
gaps and then I'll actually shape this

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.749 
gaps and then I'll actually shape this
so<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.149> makes<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.560> nice<00:02:06.560> power<00:02:06.920> glass<00:02:07.280> figure

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
so it makes a nice power glass figure

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.130 
so it makes a nice power glass figure
here<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:09.519> know<00:02:10.519> what<00:02:10.610> I'm<00:02:10.700> talking<00:02:11.030> about<00:02:11.140> if

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
here you know what I'm talking about if

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.839 
here you know what I'm talking about if
not<00:02:12.200> you'll<00:02:13.129> see<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> little<00:02:13.580> bit<00:02:13.760> because

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
not you'll see it a little bit because

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.979 
not you'll see it a little bit because
I'm<00:02:13.970> going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> work<00:02:14.269> on<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.569> now<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:15.050> and

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
I'm going to work on that now and and

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.699 
I'm going to work on that now and and
they<00:02:17.989> don't<00:02:18.170> fill<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.470> in

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
they don't fill you in

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.619 
they don't fill you in
I<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.730> kind<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.000> give<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.150> an<00:02:20.239> idea<00:02:20.330> these

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
I just kind of give you an idea these

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.040 
I just kind of give you an idea these
are<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> tools<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.170> I'm<00:02:21.230> using<00:02:21.409> just<00:02:21.709> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
are the tools that I'm using just a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.589 
are the tools that I'm using just a
sanding<00:02:24.050> block<00:02:24.080> like<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.879> just<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:26.000> small<00:02:26.239> 3m

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
sanding block like this just a small 3m

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.780 
sanding block like this just a small 3m
one<00:02:26.750> rubber<00:02:27.080> one<00:02:27.489> sometimes<00:02:28.489> I'll<00:02:28.610> put<00:02:28.730> a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
one rubber one sometimes I'll put a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.250 
one rubber one sometimes I'll put a
piece<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.090> sandpaper<00:02:29.239> on<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.659> back<00:02:29.780> side<00:02:30.019> here

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
piece of sandpaper on the back side here

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.979 
piece of sandpaper on the back side here
you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.310> see<00:02:31.519> I've<00:02:31.610> cut<00:02:31.790> these<00:02:31.970> 3m<00:02:32.659> letters

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
you can see I've cut these 3m letters

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.520 
you can see I've cut these 3m letters
off<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.470> it's<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.709> nice<00:02:33.860> rounded<00:02:34.190> area

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
off so it's a nice rounded area

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.150 
off so it's a nice rounded area
and<00:02:36.390> man<00:02:37.390> just<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.690> file<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.770> works<00:02:39.040> really

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and man just a file this works really

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.920 
and man just a file this works really
good<00:02:39.370> forgetting<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.910> big<00:02:40.090> chunks<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.480> bondo

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
good forgetting the big chunks of bondo

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.440 
good forgetting the big chunks of bondo
off<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.190> transition<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.270> one<00:02:43.360> of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
off and then I transition to one of

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.840 
off and then I transition to one of
these<00:02:43.540> other<00:02:43.720> ones<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.950> all<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.220> my<00:02:45.340> sanding

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
these other ones I do all of my sanding

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.770 
these other ones I do all of my sanding
and<00:02:46.210> 60<00:02:47.020> grit<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.330> reason<00:02:49.600> why<00:02:49.720> is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
and 60 grit and the reason why is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.740 
and 60 grit and the reason why is
because<00:02:50.430> when<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.490> use<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.240> duratec

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
because when I use the the duratec

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.920 
because when I use the the duratec
primer<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.780> use<00:02:55.900> a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
primer on this you can you can use a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.380 
primer on this you can you can use a
heavy<00:02:56.170> critic<00:02:56.860> they<00:02:56.980> recommend<00:02:57.370> 80<00:02:57.610> but<00:02:57.880> 5<00:02:58.240> you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
heavy critic they recommend 80 but 5 you

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.210 
heavy critic they recommend 80 but 5 you
60<00:02:58.780> before<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.320> hasn't<00:02:59.830> been<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> problem

60 before and it's hasn't been a problem

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.030 
60 before and it's hasn't been a problem
I'll<00:03:01.060> just<00:03:01.209> put<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.540> real<00:03:01.780> thick<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.200> say

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
I'll just put it on real thick and say

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.699 
I'll just put it on real thick and say
I'm<00:03:03.100> head<00:03:03.250> down<00:03:03.400> smooth<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:03.910> polish<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.709> so

all right so today I'm just filling in
the<00:03:29.100> hollow<00:03:29.340> points<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.330> head<00:03:31.080> tube<00:03:31.430> when

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the hollow points of the head tube when

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.450 
the hollow points of the head tube when
we<00:03:32.520> create<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.850> mold<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.450> can't<00:03:33.630> have<00:03:33.810> any

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
we create the mold we can't have any

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.050 
we create the mold we can't have any
holes<00:03:35.460> like<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:37.730> what<00:03:38.730> I've<00:03:38.850> done<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
holes like this so what I've done is

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.910 
holes like this so what I've done is
I've<00:03:39.300> just<00:03:39.450> taken<00:03:39.570> some<00:03:39.960> some<00:03:40.470> blocks<00:03:40.740> here

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
I've just taken some some blocks here

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.730 
I've just taken some some blocks here
and<00:03:41.220> just<00:03:41.700> put<00:03:42.060> some<00:03:42.330> some<00:03:43.200> clear<00:03:43.410> packaging

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
and just put some some clear packaging

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.260 
and just put some some clear packaging
tape<00:03:44.070> on<00:03:44.250> there<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.520> bondo<00:03:44.790> can't<00:03:45.000> stick<00:03:45.240> to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
tape on there the bondo can't stick to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.630 
tape on there the bondo can't stick to
it<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.980> works<00:03:47.070> out<00:03:47.340> really<00:03:47.520> well<00:03:49.370> but<00:03:50.370> once

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
it so it works out really well but once

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.600 
it so it works out really well but once
I've<00:03:50.820> done<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.710> see<00:03:52.950> here<00:03:53.220> this

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I've done that you can see here this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.310 
I've done that you can see here this
one's<00:03:53.820> done<00:03:54.770> this<00:03:55.770> nice<00:03:56.040> smooth<00:03:56.820> surface<00:03:57.320> how

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
one's done this nice smooth surface how

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.540 
one's done this nice smooth surface how
about<00:03:58.560> we<00:03:58.650> see<00:03:58.800> on<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:58.950> down<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.160> little<00:03:59.370> bit

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
about we see on this down a little bit

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.980 
about we see on this down a little bit
but<00:03:59.930> anyway<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.320> for<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.860> then

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
but anyway that's it for this and then

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.280 
but anyway that's it for this and then
what<00:04:03.990> I'll<00:04:04.080> do<00:04:04.230> next<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.970> fill<00:04:06.270> in<00:04:06.450> little

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
what I'll do next is is fill in little

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
what I'll do next is is fill in little
holes<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.800> dealt<00:04:07.980> with<00:04:08.070> some

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
holes that have dealt with some

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.430 
holes that have dealt with some
professional<00:04:08.940> glazing<00:04:09.510> putty<00:04:09.660> which<00:04:09.960> is<00:04:10.110> kind

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
professional glazing putty which is kind

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.130 
professional glazing putty which is kind
of<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.590> gone<00:04:10.800> up<00:04:10.980> with<00:04:11.100> dinner<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.690> then

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
of like gone up with dinner and then

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.370 
of like gone up with dinner and then
I'll<00:04:13.260> fasten<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.550> plug<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.750> board<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.260> we

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
I'll fasten the plug to to a board so we

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.699 
I'll fasten the plug to to a board so we
can<00:04:16.560> create<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:17.160> female<00:04:18.030> mold<00:04:18.299> off<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:19.020> it<00:04:19.140> so

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
can create a female mold off of it so

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.800 
can create a female mold off of it so
anyway<00:04:20.519> I'll<00:04:21.350> get<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.530> point<00:04:22.920> and<00:04:23.810> update

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810

you on what's going on all right so I

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.800 
you on what's going on all right so I
originally<00:04:26.910> said<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.240> was<00:04:27.390> going<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.600> use

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
originally said that I was going to use

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.810 
originally said that I was going to use
some<00:04:28.080> professional<00:04:28.370> glazing<00:04:29.370> putty<00:04:29.460> which<00:04:29.670> is

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
some professional glazing putty which is

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.120 
some professional glazing putty which is
kind<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.210> like<00:04:30.270> bondo<00:04:30.810> but<00:04:31.020> it's<00:04:31.170> a<00:04:31.350> little

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
kind of like bondo but it's a little

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.930 
kind of like bondo but it's a little
thinner<00:04:32.460> filler<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:34.340> anyway<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.370> decided<00:04:35.610> just

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
thinner filler and anyway I decided just

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.300 
thinner filler and anyway I decided just
to<00:04:36.090> use<00:04:36.150> some<00:04:36.270> regular<00:04:36.710> glazing<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:37.860> spotting

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
to use some regular glazing and spotting

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.200 
to use some regular glazing and spotting
putting<00:04:38.610> on<00:04:38.700> this<00:04:40.580> sometimes<00:04:41.580> it's<00:04:41.910> easier<00:04:42.150> to

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
putting on this sometimes it's easier to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.140 
putting on this sometimes it's easier to
work<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:42.419> sometimes<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:43.080> not<00:04:43.260> but<00:04:44.030> it's<00:04:45.030> a

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
work with sometimes it's not but it's a

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.790 
work with sometimes it's not but it's a
nice<00:04:45.300> sunny<00:04:45.540> day<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.020> figured<00:04:46.320> I'd<00:04:46.410> use<00:04:46.440> it

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
nice sunny day so I figured I'd use it

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.460 
nice sunny day so I figured I'd use it
so<00:04:47.580> basically<00:04:48.030> all<00:04:48.120> I've<00:04:48.270> done<00:04:48.419> is<00:04:48.480> I<00:04:48.630> wiped<00:04:49.380> it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
so basically all I've done is I wiped it

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.520 
so basically all I've done is I wiped it
on<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.710> areas<00:04:50.419> where<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.870> particle<00:04:52.290> border

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
on the areas where the particle border

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.500 
on the areas where the particle border
kind<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.830> chipped<00:04:53.040> away<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:55.010> there's<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.510> and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
kind of chipped away so there's that and

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.010 
kind of chipped away so there's that and
I<00:04:57.630> filled<00:04:57.840> in<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.050> lot<00:04:58.169> of<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.350> hole<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.540> this<00:05:00.540> spot

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
I filled in a lot of a hole so this spot

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.170 
I filled in a lot of a hole so this spot
here<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:01.380> for<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:02.360> front<00:05:03.360> derailer<00:05:05.180> because

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
here is for the front derailer because

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.760 
here is for the front derailer because
if<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:06.570> do<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.750> normal<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.440> chainstay

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
if I just do it normal the chainstay

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.950 
if I just do it normal the chainstay
would<00:05:08.070> would<00:05:08.460> block<00:05:08.730> it<00:05:08.760> from<00:05:09.150> from<00:05:09.570> changing

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
would would block it from from changing

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.930 
would would block it from from changing
it<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.260> smaller<00:05:10.530> room<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.580> had<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.790> make

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
it to the smaller room so I had to make

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.550 
it to the smaller room so I had to make
a<00:05:11.970> little<00:05:12.120> cut<00:05:12.330> out<00:05:12.360> there<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.840> don't<00:05:13.410> know<00:05:13.470> if

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
a little cut out there I don't know if

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.309 
a little cut out there I don't know if
I've<00:05:13.680> ever<00:05:13.770> explained<00:05:14.190> my<00:05:14.310> team

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
I've ever explained my team

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.260 
I've ever explained my team
so<00:05:15.589> anyway<00:05:16.069> here's<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.740> plug<00:05:19.610> before<00:05:19.849> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
so anyway here's the plug before the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.579 
so anyway here's the plug before the
final<00:05:20.839> sand<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:22.509> I'll<00:05:23.509> get<00:05:23.719> it<00:05:23.839> ready<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.259> to

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:24.589 
final sand and I'll get it ready to to

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:29.139 
final sand and I'll get it ready to to
mount<00:05:24.800> on<00:05:25.129> to<00:05:25.749> to<00:05:26.749> some<00:05:26.960> plywood
