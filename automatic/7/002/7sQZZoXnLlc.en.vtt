00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
cameras but in any case we'll go back to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.600 
cameras but in any case we'll go back to
raw<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.500> take<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.340> thing

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
raw here and take a look at this thing

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.650 
raw here and take a look at this thing
I've<00:00:38.760> added<00:00:39.350> it's<00:00:40.350> called<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> channel<00:00:40.860> mixer

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
I've added it's called a channel mixer

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.220 
I've added it's called a channel mixer
and<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> allows<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:45.450> input

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and what it allows you to do is to input

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
and what it allows you to do is to input
the<00:00:47.070> letters<00:00:47.430> R<00:00:47.700> G<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.149> B<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.710> hit<00:00:49.710> run<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the letters R G and B and hit run and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
the letters R G and B and hit run and
this<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.449> generates<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this one you know just generates the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
this one you know just generates the
same<00:00:51.960> image<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.379> seeing<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
same image you're seeing but if you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
same image you're seeing but if you
wanted<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.149> mix<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> can

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
wanted to you can mix them up so you can

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
wanted to you can mix them up so you can
put<00:00:55.920> R<00:00:56.250> B<00:00:56.699> G<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.629> hit<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.969> was<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> I'll

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
put R B G and hit go I was it I'll

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.869 
put R B G and hit go I was it I'll
scroll<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.109> bit<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
scroll down a little bit and what you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.410 
scroll down a little bit and what you
see<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:05.070> actually<00:01:05.280> using<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
see is that it's actually using these to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
see is that it's actually using these to
compose<00:01:06.780> every<00:01:07.470> pixel<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> processing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
compose every pixel and it's processing

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.030 
compose every pixel and it's processing
the<00:01:08.850> entire<00:01:09.119> image<00:01:09.330> each<00:01:09.540> time<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the entire image each time so if you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.399 
the entire image each time so if you
wanted<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> could<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:13.080> amount<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> red

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
wanted you could have the amount of red

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.940 
wanted you could have the amount of red
you<00:01:16.409> could<00:01:16.560> double<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> could<00:01:20.670> actually

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
you could double it you could actually

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.280 
you could double it you could actually
generate<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> strange

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
generate some kind of a strange

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.570 
generate some kind of a strange
composite<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.530> where<00:01:25.799> everything<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.340> blue

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
composite here where everything is blue

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.640 
composite here where everything is blue
but<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.049> red<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.439> green<00:01:28.619> or

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
but then you know red and green or

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.480 
but then you know red and green or
multiplied<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.829> other<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
multiplied the other thing you can do is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.880 
multiplied the other thing you can do is
you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.150> monochromatic<00:01:33.890> form

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you can do it all in monochromatic form

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.350 
you can do it all in monochromatic form
so<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.430> look<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.759> red<00:01:35.970> Channel

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so you can just look at the red Channel

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.980 
so you can just look at the red Channel
you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.619> look<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> green<00:01:38.310> Channel

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
you can just look at the green Channel

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.920 
you can just look at the green Channel
I'm<00:01:39.990> hitting<00:01:40.290> Enter<00:01:40.799> every<00:01:41.040> time<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.430> know

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
I'm hitting Enter every time you know

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.210 
I'm hitting Enter every time you know
you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.320> look<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> blue<00:01:43.799> channel

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you can just look at the blue channel

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.240 
you can just look at the blue channel
I'll<00:01:44.579> do<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> mouse<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:46.250> or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I'll do it with the mouse you can see or

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.010 
I'll do it with the mouse you can see or
you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.640> say<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.119> red<00:01:48.329> divided<00:01:48.930> by<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> green

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
you can say the red divided by the green

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.200 
you can say the red divided by the green
or<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.049> red<00:01:52.950> divided<00:01:53.520> by<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.820> blue<00:01:56.060> these<00:01:57.060> are

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
or the red divided by the blue these are

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.550 
or the red divided by the blue these are
the<00:01:57.270> differences<00:01:57.799> blue<00:01:58.799> divided<00:01:59.250> by<00:01:59.340> Green

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
the differences blue divided by Green

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.130 
the differences blue divided by Green
now<00:02:01.560> here's<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.250> neat<00:02:02.430> one<00:02:02.840> if<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:03.990> familiar

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
now here's a neat one if you're familiar

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020 
now here's a neat one if you're familiar
with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> NDVI<00:02:04.710> equation<00:02:05.399> we'll<00:02:05.640> go<00:02:05.729> back<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
with the NDVI equation we'll go back to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.389 
with the NDVI equation we'll go back to
here<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.039> actually<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
here it what it is is it's actually the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.490 
here it what it is is it's actually the
the<00:02:08.849> infrared<00:02:09.239> light<00:02:09.270> -<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.020> visible<00:02:10.349> light

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the infrared light - the visible light

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.309 
the infrared light - the visible light
divided<00:02:11.190> by<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:12.300> infrared<00:02:12.660> light<00:02:12.720> plus<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
divided by the infrared light plus the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.940 
divided by the infrared light plus the
visible<00:02:13.620> light

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
visible light

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.059 
visible light
so<00:02:14.099> we<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.500> initially<00:02:16.500> red

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
so we can we can do that initially red

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.130 
so we can we can do that initially red
the<00:02:17.310> red<00:02:17.340> channel<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.390> image<00:02:18.690> is

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the red channel of the image is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.350 
the red channel of the image is
representing<00:02:19.709> infra<00:02:19.980> red<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.209> just

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
representing infra red so we can just

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.900 
representing infra red so we can just
say<00:02:21.599> -<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.830> visible<00:02:23.250> which<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.730> blue

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
say - the visible which is in the blue

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.839 
say - the visible which is in the blue
Channel<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.500> that's<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.310> know<00:02:26.340> your<00:02:26.670> basic

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
Channel and that's you know your basic

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.229 
Channel and that's you know your basic
thing<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.930> what<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.349> do<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.910> basic

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
thing but what we can do is the basic

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.240 
thing but what we can do is the basic
difference<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:32.069> have<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
difference but we can do is you have to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.000 
difference but we can do is you have to
use<00:02:32.670> parenthesis<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.930> say<00:02:34.110> R<00:02:34.319> +<00:02:34.650> B

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
use parenthesis but you can say R + B

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.500 
use parenthesis but you can say R + B
here<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.180> should<00:02:36.360> give<00:02:36.690> us<00:02:36.720> NDVI<00:02:38.510> let's

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
here and that should give us NDVI let's

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.259 
here and that should give us NDVI let's
run<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.250> if<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.370> should<00:02:41.580> compare<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
run that if you should compare it to the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.020 
run that if you should compare it to the
NDVI<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:43.140> you'll<00:02:44.069> see<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.400> ours<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.849> bit

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
NDVI here you'll see that ours is a bit

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.699 
NDVI here you'll see that ours is a bit
darker<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:45.989> because<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.349> generates

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
darker and that's because it generates

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.490 
darker and that's because it generates
at<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.370> end<00:02:47.519> value<00:02:48.269> between<00:02:48.630> negative<00:02:48.989> 1<00:02:49.319> and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
at the end value between negative 1 and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.250 
at the end value between negative 1 and
1<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.040> all<00:02:50.280> values<00:02:50.430> less<00:02:51.150> than<00:02:51.180> 0<00:02:51.660> are<00:02:51.959> just

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
1 and all values less than 0 are just

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.380 
1 and all values less than 0 are just
represented<00:02:52.709> as<00:02:52.799> black<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.400> image<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.329> if

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
represented as black in this image so if

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.920 
represented as black in this image so if
we<00:02:54.450> really<00:02:54.660> wanted<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.049> we'd<00:02:55.739> have<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.010> say

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
we really wanted to we'd have to say

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.589 
we really wanted to we'd have to say
plus<00:02:57.930> 1<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:59.579> really<00:02:59.760> shift<00:02:59.970> into<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.360> positive

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
plus 1 to really shift into the positive

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.890 
plus 1 to really shift into the positive
and<00:03:01.140> then<00:03:02.069> divided<00:03:02.610> by<00:03:02.640> 2<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.390> narrow<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and then divided by 2 to narrow the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.120 
and then divided by 2 to narrow the
range<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:04.880> gives<00:03:05.880> us<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.150> exact<00:03:07.130> same

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
range and that gives us the exact same

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.150 
range and that gives us the exact same
equation<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.000> NDVI<00:03:09.209> button<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:10.890> don't<00:03:11.040> yet

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
equation as the NDVI button we don't yet

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.559 
equation as the NDVI button we don't yet
have<00:03:11.220> color<00:03:11.579> mapping<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:12.030> here<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:12.360> I'll<00:03:12.450> show

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
have color mapping on here but I'll show

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.740 
have color mapping on here but I'll show
you<00:03:12.630> one<00:03:12.840> thing<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:13.200> do<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:14.630> well<00:03:15.630> we

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
you one thing that we do have well we

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.099 
you one thing that we do have well we
can<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:18.200> I'm<00:03:19.200> gonna<00:03:19.380> go<00:03:19.620> back<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:21.109> make

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
can do is I'm gonna go back and make

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.080 
can do is I'm gonna go back and make
this<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.680> original<00:03:23.069> image<00:03:23.370> what<00:03:23.850> I've<00:03:23.940> done

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
this the original image what I've done

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.150 
this the original image what I've done
is<00:03:24.239> I've<00:03:24.329> added<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.660> letter<00:03:24.810> s<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.739> letter<00:03:25.950> S

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
is I've added the letter s the letter S

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.059 
is I've added the letter s the letter S
can<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.880> used<00:03:27.150> with<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> slider<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:28.829> we<00:03:28.889> don't

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
can be used with a slider now we don't

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.280 
can be used with a slider now we don't
have<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.790> not<00:03:29.970> really<00:03:30.269> fully<00:03:30.870> built<00:03:31.079> out

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
have this is not really fully built out

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.819 
have this is not really fully built out
at<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.560> point<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.840> idea<00:03:34.109> is<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.350> with

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
at this point but the idea is that with

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.580 
at this point but the idea is that with
the<00:03:34.950> slider<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.650> actively<00:03:39.500> re-balance

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
the slider you can actively re-balance

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.569 
the slider you can actively re-balance
or<00:03:40.950> remix<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.639> amount<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:43.579> different

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
or remix the amount of different

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.210 
or remix the amount of different
channels<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.569> use<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.870> s<00:03:46.109> as<00:03:46.410> sort

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
channels and you can use that s as sort

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.009 
channels and you can use that s as sort
of<00:03:47.250> another<00:03:47.489> variable<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.180> your<00:03:48.329> equation<00:03:48.810> so

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
of another variable in your equation so

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.849 
of another variable in your equation so
if<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.290> wanted<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:50.459> could<00:03:50.670> say<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:52.829> know

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
if you wanted to you could say you know

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.530 
if you wanted to you could say you know
say<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.519> think<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.850> have<00:03:53.970> too<00:03:54.120> much<00:03:54.239> red

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
say that you think you have too much red

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.670 
say that you think you have too much red
so<00:03:55.470> I'm<00:03:55.859> gonna<00:03:56.010> write<00:03:56.910> like<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.349> run<00:03:58.349> it<00:03:58.470> and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
so I'm gonna write like this run it and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.789 
so I'm gonna write like this run it and
you<00:03:59.130> could<00:03:59.310> actually<00:03:59.459> balance<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.620> amount<00:04:01.620> of

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
you could actually balance the amount of

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.309 
you could actually balance the amount of
red<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.310> your<00:04:02.519> image<00:04:02.849> using<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.750> slider<00:04:04.049> now

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
red in your image using the slider now

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.280 
red in your image using the slider now
you<00:04:04.920> can<00:04:05.099> increase<00:04:05.459> or<00:04:05.760> decrease<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:06.389> now<00:04:07.019> it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
you can increase or decrease it now it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.479 
you can increase or decrease it now it
makes<00:04:07.620> sense<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.859> we<00:04:08.040> might<00:04:08.220> eventually

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
makes sense that we might eventually

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.550 
makes sense that we might eventually
have<00:04:08.819> more<00:04:09.030> sliders<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.959> we<00:04:10.079> might<00:04:10.290> organize

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
have more sliders and we might organize

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.870 
have more sliders and we might organize
this<00:04:11.010> page<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.250> little<00:04:11.489> bit<00:04:11.579> better

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
this page a little bit better

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.120 
this page a little bit better
but<00:04:12.630> at<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:12.810> point<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:13.380> think<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:13.829> just<00:04:13.950> neat

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
but at this point I think it's just neat

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.949 
but at this point I think it's just neat
that<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.400> do<00:04:14.639> all<00:04:14.819> this<00:04:15.000> right<00:04:15.690> here<00:04:15.900> in

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
that you can do all this right here in

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.170 
that you can do all this right here in

mathematical<00:04:18.690> expressions<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.530> wanted<00:04:20.489> to

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
mathematical expressions I wanted to

mathematical expressions I wanted to
emphasize<00:04:21.060> again<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.930> whole

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
emphasize again that this whole

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.300 
emphasize again that this whole
