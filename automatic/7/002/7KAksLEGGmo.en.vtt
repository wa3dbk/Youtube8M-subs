as you can see it's not as free d so the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.300 
as you can see it's not as free d so the
freedom<00:03:04.360> mod<00:03:04.750> actually<00:03:05.410> makes<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.010> blocks

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
freedom mod actually makes the blocks

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.660 
freedom mod actually makes the blocks
look<00:03:06.760> much<00:03:07.240> much<00:03:08.170> better<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:08.980> let's<00:03:09.490> actually

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
off the rest which isn't showing because

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.040 
off the rest which isn't showing because
you<00:03:14.560> need<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.830> mod<00:03:15.040> installed<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:16.480> I'll<00:03:16.750> see

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
ladders right now so these ones here I

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.689 
ladders right now so these ones here I
think<00:05:27.229> I<00:05:27.259> see<00:05:27.409> they<00:05:27.560> look<00:05:27.710> like<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.130> but<00:05:28.610> if

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
think I see they look like this but if

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.909

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
you look at the screenshot now it looks

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.480
