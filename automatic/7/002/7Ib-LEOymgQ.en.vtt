any point the little parts I'm working
on<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> side<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
on right now they make up the side of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.750 
on right now they make up the side of
the<00:01:12.119> mace<00:01:12.350> there's<00:01:13.350> men<00:01:14.070> de<00:01:14.159> cemento<00:01:14.430> pieces

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the mace there's men de cemento pieces

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.149 
the mace there's men de cemento pieces
that<00:01:14.909> were<00:01:15.000> involved<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.540> project<00:01:16.159> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that were involved in this project the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
that were involved in this project the
just<00:01:17.700> keeping<00:01:17.970> track<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.600> was

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
just keeping track of all of them was

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:37.080 
just keeping track of all of them was
enough<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> challenge

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.660 

my<00:01:37.689> process<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.320> pretty<00:01:38.439> simple<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.520> you'll

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
my process is pretty simple and you'll

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.330 
my process is pretty simple and you'll
see<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:39.909> here<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.240> last<00:01:40.950> last<00:01:41.950> bit<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.219> the

see it here in the last last bit of the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.190 
see it here in the last last bit of the
video<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.640> lot<00:01:42.969> of<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.329> just<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.750> Assembly

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
video a lot of it is just the Assembly

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.620 
video a lot of it is just the Assembly
of<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.380> mace<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:45.179> documented<00:01:46.179> through<00:01:46.390> still

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
of the mace I documented through still

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.179 
of the mace I documented through still
photos<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:49.380> assembly<00:01:50.380> process<00:01:50.829> can<00:01:51.009> be<00:01:51.130> other

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
photos the assembly process can be other

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.510 
photos the assembly process can be other
pretty<00:01:51.460> quick<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:52.170> had<00:01:53.170> all<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.560> parts<00:01:54.250> ready

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
pretty quick I had all the parts ready

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340 
pretty quick I had all the parts ready
to<00:01:54.729> go<00:01:54.880> for<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.209> assembly<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.200> made

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
to go for the assembly so it made

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.709 
to go for the assembly so it made
everything<00:01:56.590> come<00:01:56.950> together<00:01:57.450> without<00:01:58.450> too

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
everything come together without too

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.660 
everything come together without too
much<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> headache<00:01:59.189> there<00:02:00.189> was<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.369> whole<00:02:00.520> lot

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
much of a headache there was a whole lot

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.209 
much of a headache there was a whole lot
of<00:02:00.759> test<00:02:00.969> fitting<00:02:01.329> and<00:02:01.509> I'm<00:02:02.259> ensure<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.799> each

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
of test fitting and I'm ensure that each

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.469 
of test fitting and I'm ensure that each
part<00:02:03.549> actually<00:02:03.969> was<00:02:04.090> going<00:02:04.209> to<00:02:04.270> go<00:02:04.359> together

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
part actually was going to go together

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.899 
part actually was going to go together
exactly<00:02:04.929> like<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:05.380> expected<00:02:05.859> before<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.729> ever

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
exactly like I expected before I ever

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.630 
exactly like I expected before I ever
attempted<00:02:07.390> anything<00:02:07.600> like<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.379> lot<00:02:09.340> of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
attempted anything like this a lot of

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.280 
attempted anything like this a lot of
parts<00:02:09.880> ended<00:02:10.149> up<00:02:10.239> being<00:02:10.450> remade<00:02:10.660> two<00:02:10.929> or<00:02:11.079> three

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
parts ended up being remade two or three

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:21.670 
parts ended up being remade two or three
times<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.299> fit<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:13.660> right

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.890 

you<00:02:22.219> can<00:02:22.400> see<00:02:22.549> at<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.730> point<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.180> mace<00:02:23.359> is<00:02:23.629> in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you can see at this point the mace is in

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.319 
you can see at this point the mace is in
primer<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.590> doing<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.489> test<00:02:25.760> fit<00:02:25.879> on<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.090> lot<00:02:26.299> of

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
primer and doing a test fit on a lot of

final<00:03:53.900> assembly<00:03:54.909> the<00:03:55.909> system<00:03:56.359> went<00:03:56.959> together

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
final assembly the system went together

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.229 
final assembly the system went together
pretty<00:03:57.379> easy<00:03:57.650> first<00:03:58.099> two<00:03:58.280> parts<00:03:58.459> slid<00:03:58.819> on<00:03:58.970> and

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
pretty easy first two parts slid on and

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.210 
pretty easy first two parts slid on and
then<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.419> bottom<00:03:59.569> went<00:03:59.840> on<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.319> did<00:04:00.949> a<00:04:00.979> lot<00:04:01.189> of

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
then the bottom went on I did a lot of

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.369 
then the bottom went on I did a lot of
weathering<00:04:01.729> I'm<00:04:02.329> pretty<00:04:02.599> simple<00:04:03.019> as<00:04:03.109> far<00:04:03.290> as

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
weathering I'm pretty simple as far as

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
little bit more of an aged look to it

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
handle wraps were pretty simple they

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.610 
handle wraps were pretty simple they
have<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.040> layer<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:23.110> athletic<00:04:24.110> tape<00:04:24.290> underneath

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
have a layer of athletic tape underneath

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.560 
have a layer of athletic tape underneath
them<00:04:24.919> this<00:04:25.610> prevents<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.150> ribbon<00:04:26.419> from

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
them this prevents the ribbon from

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.900 
them this prevents the ribbon from
sliding<00:04:26.930> around<00:04:27.080> on<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.470> hand<00:04:27.680> grips<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.669> also

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
sliding around on the hand grips it also

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.250 
sliding around on the hand grips it also
made<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.150> little<00:04:29.240> bit<00:04:29.389> pusher<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:29.840> nicer<00:04:30.139> to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
made a little bit pusher and nicer to

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.879 
made a little bit pusher and nicer to
hold<00:04:30.500> on<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.830> for<00:04:31.070> several<00:04:31.580> hours<00:04:31.700> at<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.090> time

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
hold on to for several hours at a time

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.500 
hold on to for several hours at a time
and<00:04:33.889> there<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.340> can<00:04:34.400> kind<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:34.820> see<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.030> final

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
and there you can kind of see a final

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.909 
and there you can kind of see a final
product<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.960> I'd<00:04:36.050> all<00:04:36.229> came<00:04:36.410> together<00:04:36.530> quite
