activity 99 chart mental math strategies

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.270 
activity 99 chart mental math strategies
here<00:00:07.140> we<00:00:07.290> have<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> chart<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.890> numbers

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
here we have a chart of numbers

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.169 
here we have a chart of numbers
extending<00:00:09.120> from<00:00:09.389> 0<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.809> 99<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.820> use<00:00:12.000> it

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
extending from 0 to 99 and we can use it

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.879 
extending from 0 to 99 and we can use it
to<00:00:12.210> solve<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.660> variety<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:13.230> addition<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
to solve a variety of addition and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.900 
to solve a variety of addition and
subtraction<00:00:14.490> problems<00:00:15.590> let's<00:00:16.590> try<00:00:16.890> adding<00:00:17.100> 36

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
subtraction problems let's try adding 36

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.769 
subtraction problems let's try adding 36
plus<00:00:18.210> 47<00:00:19.609> to<00:00:20.609> move<00:00:20.789> through<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> chart<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.570> use

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
plus 47 to move through the chart we use

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.500 
plus 47 to move through the chart we use
these<00:00:21.990> four<00:00:22.410> directional<00:00:23.160> arrows<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.970> we

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
these four directional arrows and we

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.980 
these four directional arrows and we
begin<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:24.990> 0<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:26.460> let's<00:00:26.670> start<00:00:26.939> by<00:00:27.420> traveling

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
begin at 0 so let's start by traveling

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.939 
begin at 0 so let's start by traveling
from<00:00:28.230> 0<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:29.429> 36<00:00:30.199> I'll<00:00:31.199> press<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> right<00:00:31.920> arrow

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
from 0 to 36 I'll press the right arrow

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.530 
from 0 to 36 I'll press the right arrow
and<00:00:32.660> each<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.800> adds<00:00:35.130> 1<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> my

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and each time I do that adds 1 to my

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.530 
and each time I do that adds 1 to my
current<00:00:37.020> location<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.980> chart<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> now

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
current location on the chart so now

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.799 
current location on the chart so now
I've<00:00:39.690> traveled<00:00:39.930> from<00:00:40.320> 0<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> 6<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.629> now<00:00:42.629> I'm

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I've traveled from 0 to 6 and now I'm

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.709 
I've traveled from 0 to 6 and now I'm
going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> press<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.710> arrow<00:00:44.629> pressing<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
going to press the up arrow pressing the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.819 
going to press the up arrow pressing the
up<00:00:45.960> arrow<00:00:46.200> adds<00:00:46.649> 10<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.700> my<00:00:47.820> current<00:00:48.239> location

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
up arrow adds 10 to my current location

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
up arrow adds 10 to my current location
so<00:00:49.829> I'll<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.160> several<00:00:50.700> times<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.390> now

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so I'll do that several times and now

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.560 
so I'll do that several times and now
I'm<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.199> 36

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
I'm at 36

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.869 
I'm at 36
before<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> add<00:00:54.870> 47<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> change<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
before I add 47 I'm going to change the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
before I add 47 I'm going to change the
color<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> my<00:00:57.449> squares<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.649> green<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:01.230> red<00:01:01.260> by

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
color of my squares from green to red by

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
color of my squares from green to red by
dragging<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.789> point<00:01:03.680> by<00:01:04.680> changing<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
dragging this point by changing the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.399 
dragging this point by changing the
color<00:01:05.460> I'll<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.970> able<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> differentiate<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
color I'll be able to differentiate this

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.820 
color I'll be able to differentiate this
first<00:01:07.770> path<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.549> took<00:01:08.850> me<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> 36<00:01:09.680> from<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
first path which took me to 36 from the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.870 
first path which took me to 36 from the
second<00:01:11.250> path<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:11.909> I'll<00:01:12.060> add<00:01:12.270> 47<00:01:13.670> now<00:01:14.670> I'm

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
second path when I'll add 47 now I'm

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.620 
second path when I'll add 47 now I'm
ready<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> add<00:01:15.390> 47<00:01:16.170> how<00:01:16.950> should<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
ready to add 47 how should I do that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
ready to add 47 how should I do that
well<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:19.170> idea<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> start<00:01:20.280> by

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
well one idea would be to start by

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.170 
well one idea would be to start by
adding<00:01:20.759> 4<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.689> 36<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.400> I'll<00:01:23.520> press<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> right

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.000 
I'm going to go +10 4 times to land at
40<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.100> then<00:02:21.100> I'm<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.550> subtract<00:02:22.320> 4<00:02:23.320> so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
40 and then I'm going to subtract 4 so

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.750 
40 and then I'm going to subtract 4 so
I'll<00:02:24.130> press<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.580> left<00:02:24.820> arrow<00:02:25.230> 1<00:02:26.230> 2<00:02:27.070> 3<00:02:28.080> 4<00:02:29.080> now

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
I'll press the left arrow 1 2 3 4 now

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.340 
I'll press the left arrow 1 2 3 4 now
I'm<00:02:30.760> at<00:02:30.910> 36<00:02:33.120> before<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.330> anything<00:02:34.750> else<00:02:35.020> I'm

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
I'm at 36 before I do anything else I'm

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.470 
I'm at 36 before I do anything else I'm
going<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> change<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.160> color<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.520> my<00:02:37.090> square

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
going to change the color of my square

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.280 
going to change the color of my square
I'll<00:02:37.720> make<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.110> blue<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.090> add<00:02:40.390> 47

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
I'll make it blue and now to add 47

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.170 
I'll make it blue and now to add 47
let's<00:02:41.920> first<00:02:42.280> add<00:02:42.520> 50<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.480> then<00:02:43.960> subtract<00:02:44.410> 3

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
let's first add 50 and then subtract 3

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.000 
let's first add 50 and then subtract 3
so<00:02:46.180> we'll<00:02:46.330> go<00:02:46.510> 10<00:02:46.930> 20<00:02:47.800> 30<00:02:48.400> 40<00:02:48.700> 50<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:50.830> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
so we'll go 10 20 30 40 50 and then the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.650 
so we'll go 10 20 30 40 50 and then the
left<00:02:51.220> arrow<00:02:51.490> 1<00:02:52.330> 2<00:02:53.170> 3<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.370> once<00:02:55.120> again<00:02:55.300> we<00:02:55.630> see

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
left arrow 1 2 3 and once again we see

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.480 
left arrow 1 2 3 and once again we see
that<00:02:55.870> 36<00:02:56.590> plus<00:02:56.860> 47<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.910> 83<00:02:58.980> there's<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.070> second

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
that 36 plus 47 is 83 there's a second

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.950 
that 36 plus 47 is 83 there's a second
version<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.030> chart<00:03:01.270> that<00:03:01.450> comes<00:03:01.630> with<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
version of the chart that comes with the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.200 
version of the chart that comes with the
activity<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:03.010> works<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.460> same<00:03:03.490> way<00:03:03.910> as<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
activity it works the same way as the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.830 
activity it works the same way as the
first

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
first

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.840 
first
only<00:03:05.530> instead<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:06.010> having<00:03:06.190> directional

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
only instead of having directional

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.270 
only instead of having directional
arrows<00:03:07.240> we<00:03:08.050> have<00:03:08.230> these<00:03:08.380> numbers<00:03:08.650> here<00:03:09.070> that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
arrows we have these numbers here that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.460 
arrows we have these numbers here that
tell<00:03:09.460> us<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.700> result<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.300> pushing<00:03:10.690> them<00:03:10.840> so

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
tell us the result of pushing them so

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.790 
tell us the result of pushing them so
pushing<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.980> plus<00:03:12.220> 10<00:03:12.690> symbol<00:03:13.690> adds<00:03:13.930> 10<00:03:14.500> each

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
pushing the plus 10 symbol adds 10 each

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.640 
pushing the plus 10 symbol adds 10 each
time<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.550> my<00:03:15.700> number<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.270> similarly<00:03:17.260> with

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
time to my number and similarly with

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.940 
time to my number and similarly with
these<00:03:17.830> other<00:03:18.070> numbers<00:03:18.370> here
