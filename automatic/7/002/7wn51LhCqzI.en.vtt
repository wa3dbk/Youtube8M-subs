 of this rifle have come out 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.119
 some factory defects 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.049
 that the same provider the representative 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 of walter is solving one of them 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 is the charger the retainer of the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.860
 charger is something so bad that 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.120
 causes the charger to fall when 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.980
 the weapon is in operation 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:32.820
 and the other is the spring of action 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.900
 It is very short and brings very little very little 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.510
 force those two 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.940
 contact your representative and without 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.300
 No cost is going to send you the pieces 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:55.510

 m 4 22 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:16.450
 at 50 meters it is necessary to consider that the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:18.350
 trigger of m 4 is very hard so 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.190
 well, it's not bad 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.190
 a bunny there would be very dead 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.790
 50 meters
