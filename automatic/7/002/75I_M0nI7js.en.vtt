 O 

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:12.660
 [Music] 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.650
 at the same time it is an old car 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.210
 comfortable was by all means 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.599
 technological 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.860
 it is also the car's performance 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:28.220
 impressive in his category 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:32.029
 the angles of voice could here 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.400
 11 exits to real or honor me worry 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.720
 with that occupy 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.960
 although his team in the middle 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.110
 traditionalist sense in the exchange 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.110
 mechanical 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.280
 in compensation you as ours happened 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.460
 with us on the trail 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.309
 he went up and as people 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.010
 imagined that the course if you 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.600
 he started making the game back to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.089
 worry about the boots of the most 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.149
 needs and we were able to overcome a 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.869
 obstacle because it does not have 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.820
 pressure 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.039
 if you put the most appropriate tire 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.210
 internal examinations or improve 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:21.170
 jorginho to attack the exit how to improve 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:28.830
 and you can see the trail on the trail 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 have reasonably weighed more 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.380
 heavy and little subsidy 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.539
 I wonder about drinking water inside 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.009
 seems a very appropriate thing to 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.860
 pending issues that had 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.149
 the other was very significant affect the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.690
 good trend 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.770
 the vehicles are made what was perceived 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:59.360
 because it's a sports car 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:02.560
 but on the way caught fire 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.560

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:36.540
