00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
started growing his way before I started

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
started growing his way before I started
November<00:01:05.880> first<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.600> uh<00:01:06.630> he<00:01:07.560> cheated<00:01:07.979> he

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
November first but uh he cheated he

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.679 
November first but uh he cheated he
started<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> week<00:01:08.640> before<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.510> looks

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
started like a week before so he looks

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.850 
started like a week before so he looks
better<00:01:09.810> than<00:01:09.930> everyone<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.680> happy

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
better than everyone and I'm not happy

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.440 
better than everyone and I'm not happy
about<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.310> he<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:12.000> stir<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.299> bit

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
about that he did stir a little bit

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.420 
about that he did stir a little bit
early<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.110> regardless<00:01:13.280> Teddy's<00:01:14.280> got

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
early but I think regardless Teddy's got

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.710 
early but I think regardless Teddy's got
one<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> best<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.479> looks<00:01:15.659> like

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
one of the one of the best he looks like

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.969 
one of the one of the best he looks like
he<00:01:15.840> could<00:01:15.869> wear<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> mustache<00:01:16.530> shedding

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
he could wear a mustache shedding

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
he could wear a mustache shedding
permanently<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.700> maybe<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.210> might<00:01:18.299> start

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
permanently so maybe it might start

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.730 
permanently so maybe it might start
trying<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> guys<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.619> kind

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
trying to get some of the guys to kind

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.289 
trying to get some of the guys to kind
of<00:01:19.860> put<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> peer<00:01:20.549> pressure<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.970> him<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> keep

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
of put the peer pressure on him to keep

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.170 
of put the peer pressure on him to keep
it<00:01:21.509> yeah<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.770> he<00:01:23.520> had<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.850> head<00:01:23.970> start

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it yeah I think he had with a head start

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
it yeah I think he had with a head start
and<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.320> Fred<00:01:25.680> clarks<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> best<00:01:26.369> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and I think Fred clarks is the best I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.530 
and I think Fred clarks is the best I
think<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.790> don't<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> let<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
think I don't know if I want to let it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.030 
think I don't know if I want to let it
keep<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.840> longer<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> tighten

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

something little bit different I'm the
worst<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.649> probably<00:01:58.890> stammered<00:01:59.189> but

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
worst it's probably stammered but

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.249
