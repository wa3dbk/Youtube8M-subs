00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.870
 substance 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.790
 here is the word calamatta a friend of mine 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.270
 entrepreneur has built a center 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.760
 commercial employed 30 40 families 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.520
 that blocked him because he built 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.830
 on a cemetery of 300 per hour it is tasted 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.950
 number in amana had patience 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.090
 built on the cemetery of the fourteenth century 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.210
 still means a dead zone 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.760
 be patient though my patients 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.950
 complain of a decrease in consumption but which 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.420
 consumption drop you will not be consumed 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.450
 as that consumes train of god of 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.730
 gasoline and then the empty rooms but which ones 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.010
 with local states is everybody 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.170
 feet the foreign hospitals are the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.720
 stretchers bunk songs and eats knows 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.640
 and then he feels sick but the hospital 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.900
 rightly overcrowded prisons 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.030
 because why people go to steal 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.280
 because there is a lot of money because 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.530
 equitalia overflowing local remote control 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.450
 people who jump on each other and who 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.370
 they have to pay taxes or not taxes 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.080
 I can pay you not because I don't pay 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.760
 I can afford 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.470
 then there are people who 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.080
 practically make them do it 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.610
 employees from 8 to 17 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.740
 then they make him do six hours of 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.350
 extraordinary even havana shop 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.150
 you're breaking the market it's your fault 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.670
 if there is a crisis this is true 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.070
 problem the crisis is an invention 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.570
 the crisis is an invention of the Maya mayans 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.030
 they invented the crisis because they had to 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.210
 selling more calendars is crap has 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.100
 dates take life fun take 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.810

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.280
 give a tear to mergellina because they are 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.260
 even without money request 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.270
 So we've stalled but giving 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.780
 many like the crisis the guide go to 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.890
 feet never come down on buffon there is the dresser 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.950
 the agricultural crisis 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.599
