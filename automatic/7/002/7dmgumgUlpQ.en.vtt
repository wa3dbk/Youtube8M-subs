00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.780
 The materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.559
 paper that you red green diurex scissors and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.559
 some twigs 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.470
 Now what we are going to do is cut 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.900
 our paper that I break you 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.000
 approximately 7 centimeters of year 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.250
 you want to be your carnations more 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.580
 great present I knew will count a little 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.580
 beyond 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.560
 now we have our role and we are going to 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.630
 start to roll around this 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.430
 tool 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.370
 for this we are going to start making some 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.590
 small folds and we will go 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.520
 rolling little by little we're going to do 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 click on roll up 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.160
 once the carnation of the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.160
 size that we want we are going to cut the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.460
 pull and we will accommodate our 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.460
 base 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.480
 and now with a fiber parasite, let's go 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.370
 to paste the workshop of our carnation but 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.900
 making it tight for 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.900
 that does not move well this bouquet 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.430
 let's cut a small strip of paper 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.430
 green crepe that is not too wide 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.409
 now we are going to give you a little bit of diurex 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.290
 at the tip of a satire and we're going to 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.939
 stick to the stem of our carnation 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.939
 this to go lining the branch 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.450
 once we finish covering it we go 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.400
 to support with a bit of tie break or 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.909
 You can also deliver it with a little 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.909
 resistol 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.500
 and so would our carnation be with its 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.500
 size 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.360
 now to do it without stem we do what 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.400
 we stretch our paper and go to 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.170
 start making a few small folds and 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.170
 we are going to roll it little by little 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.970
 since we finish we count again 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.490
 our strip we are going to rest well this 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.840
 flower and then we are going to paste it conjure 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.840
 be at the base of our key 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.970
 and well, that would be our carnations 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.520
 and what we can do with them is 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.190
 use them to decorate some boxes 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.810
 of zeros and so that it is not like that 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.310
 simple then we can cut another 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.310
 discrete cost activity green 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.550
 and we're going to roll it up to our 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.550
 carnation in this way 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.380
 ah 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.680
 now let's cut the base of our 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.680
 planet 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.960
 and to stick them in this box we are going 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.370
 to put WayÃºu silicone which is much better 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.250
 but in this case I'm going to do it with 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.250
 results and let's wait for it to dry 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.449
 and so these corpses would remain 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.970
 I hope you liked the tutorial and not
