00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.640
 now close some beaches of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.350
 the island yesterday afternoon it is at the edge of 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 the water just a meter away that a dog has 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 been snapped up by a shark in the Bay of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.380
 Saint Paul near the Labrador Pond 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.210
 to devour under the eyes of his mistress 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.330
 francis bourgoin and irish supports are 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.189
 returned on site this morning it's 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 the ordinary in this early afternoon of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.300
 sunday rachel uh walks his dog 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 the labrador is well known for its 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 love of water by bathing it's at this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 moment that the drama occurs tell me 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.270
 bathe every day for three 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.460
 four years here to three years and she him 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 throw a stick in the water and the dog 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 was coming back and just at this 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.489
 moment she saw a dark mass 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.550
 go out and the dog got sucked 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 before his eyes what so here after I 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.750
 you pass the details that was all 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.250
 simply reid have necessarily there for 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.050
 she is very very difficult and then 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.699
 incomprehensible since it was an email 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.629
 on board the dog but already they are not all 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.829
 two on the on the saman fraikin 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.809
 some talk about religious ceremony 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.640
 with animal sacrifices to some 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.460
 meters of the scene whose carcasses 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.150
 could attract the sharks had 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.560
 known 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 that they had from the presence of 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.329
 sharks in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.909
 the koala bear believe the abbot as close 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.030
 as close but in fact it's a big 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.150
 so do 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.369
 in addition opaque ol so we do not see this 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.200
 which is below for the fishermen 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.490
 no surprise either the place is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.290
 well known and other scenes 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.799
 identical to it already held a 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.800
 tree anyway he's fishing and the common 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.750
 are you going to come out the edge is not not 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.850
 need a lot is not how 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.899
 especially when the times it flows in the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.659
 sea 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.540
 the milk la la it's dangerous of the same 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.509
 at the sight of the tacc in front of me the dog 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.820
 wandering said the rose in the water without 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.320
 how far was it attacked after 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.119
 surfers and bathers this is at 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.890
 turn of animals to be the victims of 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.350
 sharks an attack that just reminds 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.970
 that we must absolutely respect 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.600
 bathing bans and any 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.600
 Nautic activity
