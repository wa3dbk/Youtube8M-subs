00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.020
 how about very good night good today 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.059
 maximum temperature reached about 82 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.980
 degrees we continue with very hot temperatures 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.840
 above normal everything thanks to 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.910
 this wind which continues mostly 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.980
 from the south for much of the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.930
 region but some changes are approaching 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.960
 I have the details a little more 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.509
 forward in the time segment 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.300
 how about good night and good after 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.059
 a day with downpours and intermittent and 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.980
 very light throughout the region 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:33.079
 we can expect some 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.579
 changes just in time for the end of 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.989
 week also the wind has been 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.780
 mostly from the south which has 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.399
 brought a lot of moisture and also warmth to 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.079
 throughout the entire region we continue 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.629
 with a warm frontal band in which 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.000
 Cloudiness is bringing along 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.530
 the entire coastal portion houston corpus 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.720
 christi and brownsville with downpours 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.300
 intermittent for now we can wait 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.010
 that this frontal band continues to 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.620
 throughout the region and be the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.629
 prelude to the next low system 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.519
 pressure which will go very much towards our 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.469
 north but if you're dragging on the 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.149
 next front band which will be 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.250
 bringing temperatures a bit more 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.840
 fresh in terms of temperatures 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.119
 maxims today they kept skirting the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.399
 medium range of 70 degrees the wind 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.990
 it was mostly from the south bringing 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.750
 all this warmth throughout the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.610
 region we can expect that for this 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.729
 night the minimums are bordering the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.590
 high range of 60 degrees and gentlemen 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.659
 of the high range of 630 degrees so 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.680
 we will continue with these temperatures a 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.080
 little up 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.260
 from normal to at least half 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.150
 this of our state now during the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.430
 next 48 hours downpours 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.740
 intermittent towards the southeast portion 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.600
 of Dallas during the course of this 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.910
 night for tomorrow we continue with that 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.050
 slight risk of downpours also 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.240
 intermittent during the course of 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.580
 late and the front band will go to 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.710
 throughout the region at early hours of 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.150
 the morning on Saturday bringing some 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.119
 changes in terms of temperatures 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.400
 just time for the weekend and it 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.100
 dry atmospheric conditions what 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.820

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.540

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.790
 we will notice that the conditions of Saturday 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.259
 they clear but there will still be a 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.330
 windy little indeed the wind 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.880
