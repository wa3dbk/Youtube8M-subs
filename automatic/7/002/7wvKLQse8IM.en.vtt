00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
well Ivan I'm glad you asked this is

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.780 
well Ivan I'm glad you asked this is
actually<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.830> question<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.340> actually<00:00:08.519> get

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
actually a question that I actually get

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.180 
actually a question that I actually get
quite<00:00:09.059> often<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:10.200> very<00:00:10.559> simple<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
quite often and it's very simple to

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.190 
quite often and it's very simple to
figure<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> answer<00:00:12.030> first<00:00:12.660> we<00:00:12.990> need<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
figure out the answer first we need to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.829 
figure out the answer first we need to
go<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> arena<00:00:13.710> tournament<00:00:14.360> second<00:00:15.360> we

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
go to the arena tournament second we

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.170 
go to the arena tournament second we
need<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> highlight<00:00:16.230> over<00:00:16.590> your<00:00:16.920> score<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.880> do

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
need to highlight over your score you do

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060 
need to highlight over your score you do
need<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.600> be<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.960> least<00:00:19.170> entry<00:00:19.710> level<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
need to be at least entry level I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.820 
need to be at least entry level I
believe<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:21.390> find<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.320> many<00:00:22.380> people<00:00:22.650> are

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
believe to find out how many people are

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.730 
believe to find out how many people are
playing<00:00:23.539> we<00:00:24.539> use<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> daily<00:00:25.080> arena<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.619> this

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
playing we use the daily arena for this

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.169 
playing we use the daily arena for this
example<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.480> dealer<00:00:27.720> Mina<00:00:27.900> has<00:00:28.310> 14,000<00:00:29.310> 91

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
example so the dealer Mina has 14,000 91

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
example so the dealer Mina has 14,000 91
people<00:00:30.480> playing<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.890> let's<00:00:31.949> bring<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
people playing so let's bring up a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.240 
people playing so let's bring up a
calculator<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.969> we'll<00:00:33.600> type<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> number<00:00:34.079> in

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
calculator and we'll type the number in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.580 
calculator and we'll type the number in
14000<00:00:35.250> 91<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.780> we're<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> times<00:00:37.380> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
14000 91 and we're going to times that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
14000 91 and we're going to times that
or<00:00:38.250> multiply<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.030> by<00:00:39.270> point<00:00:40.170> zero<00:00:40.350> five<00:00:41.510> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
or multiply that by point zero five it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
or multiply that by point zero five it
gives<00:00:42.780> us<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> number<00:00:43.200> seven<00:00:43.920> hundred<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
gives us the number seven hundred and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.630 
gives us the number seven hundred and
four<00:00:44.700> point<00:00:45.059> five<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:47.039> sure<00:00:47.280> how<00:00:47.489> they

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
four point five so I'm not sure how they

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.229 
four point five so I'm not sure how they
how<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.090> round<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.770> gonna<00:00:49.890> say<00:00:50.239> 704

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
how they round so I'm just gonna say 704

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.160 
how they round so I'm just gonna say 704
to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.230> safe<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.550> need<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.940> ranked<00:00:54.239> 700

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to be safe but you need to be ranked 700

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
to be safe but you need to be ranked 700
or<00:00:55.699> 704<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:56.910> higher<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.079> guess<00:00:58.770> technically

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
or 704 or higher I guess technically

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.439 
or 704 or higher I guess technically
lower<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.809> lower<00:01:01.079> number<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.489> 703<00:01:02.489> 702<00:01:02.969> 701

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
lower or a lower number so 703 702 701

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.370 
lower or a lower number so 703 702 701
700<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> top<00:01:06.780> 5%<00:01:07.939> however<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:10.170> will

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
700 to be in the top 5% however it will

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.130 
700 to be in the top 5% however it will
change<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:12.210> number<00:01:12.510> will<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.750> always<00:01:13.049> be

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
change this number will not always be

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.420 
change this number will not always be
the<00:01:13.260> same<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.650> depends<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.040> how<00:01:14.159> many<00:01:14.220> people

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the same it depends on how many people

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.539 
the same it depends on how many people
are<00:01:14.610> playing<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:16.080> example<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
are playing so for example there are a

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
are playing so for example there are a
hundred<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.970> eight<00:01:18.060> thousand<00:01:18.630> five<00:01:18.840> hundred

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
hundred and eight thousand five hundred

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
hundred and eight thousand five hundred
and<00:01:19.229> eighty<00:01:19.439> four<00:01:19.740> people<00:01:20.009> playing<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and eighty four people playing at the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.249 
and eighty four people playing at the
battle<00:01:21.270> arena<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.720> let's<00:01:21.869> type<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
battle arena so let's type in that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.990 
battle arena so let's type in that
number<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.950> hundred<00:01:23.070> eight<00:01:23.340> thousand<00:01:23.820> five

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
number one hundred eight thousand five

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.749 
number one hundred eight thousand five
hundred<00:01:24.090> eighty<00:01:24.360> four<00:01:24.890> all<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:25.950> yep

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
hundred eighty four all right yep

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.719 
hundred eighty four all right yep
multiply<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:27.930> point<00:01:28.380> zero<00:01:28.439> five<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
multiply that by point zero five this is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.660 
multiply that by point zero five this is
a<00:01:29.759> percentage<00:01:30.420> by<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> way<00:01:30.930> five<00:01:31.920> percent<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
a percentage by the way five percent is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.410 
a percentage by the way five percent is
equal<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.900> point<00:01:34.320> zero<00:01:34.590> five<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.240> I'm

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
equal to point zero five that's all I'm

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.770 
equal to point zero five that's all I'm
doing

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
doing

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
doing
so<00:01:37.409> multiply<00:01:37.920> by<00:01:38.040> point<00:01:38.280> zero<00:01:38.549> five<00:01:38.820> hit<00:01:39.270> enter

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
so multiply by point zero five hit enter

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.859 
so multiply by point zero five hit enter
or<00:01:39.869> hit<00:01:39.900> equals<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.560> whatever<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.869> long

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
or hit equals or whatever you do as long

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
or hit equals or whatever you do as long
as<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.500> ranked<00:01:43.799> five<00:01:44.280> thousand<00:01:44.970> four

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
as you are ranked five thousand four

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.280 
as you are ranked five thousand four
hundred<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> twenty<00:01:46.170> nine<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.979> lower<00:01:48.290> you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
hundred and twenty nine or lower you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.980 
hundred and twenty nine or lower you
will<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> top<00:01:50.100> five<00:01:50.520> percent<00:01:50.899> for<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
will be in the top five percent for the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.710 
will be in the top five percent for the
battle<00:01:52.350> arena<00:01:52.640> okay<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> since<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.479> already

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
battle arena okay and since we already

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.120 
battle arena okay and since we already
did<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> battle<00:01:55.200> arena<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> deal<00:01:55.799> arena

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
did the battle arena and the deal arena

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.889 
did the battle arena and the deal arena
so<00:01:56.310> let's<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.579> ahead<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.570> Platinum

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
so let's go ahead and do the Platinum

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.469 
so let's go ahead and do the Platinum
arena<00:01:58.110> again<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:59.040> number<00:01:59.340> changes<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.270> have

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
arena again this number changes you have

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
arena again this number changes you have
to<00:02:00.659> make<00:02:00.840> sure<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.170> know<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.159> number<00:02:02.670> before

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to make sure you know the number before

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.609 
to make sure you know the number before
you<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> calculations<00:02:04.799> obviously<00:02:05.490> so

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
you do the calculations obviously so

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.779 
you do the calculations obviously so
this<00:02:07.619> number<00:02:07.979> will<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> same

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this number will not be the same

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.410 
this number will not be the same
tomorrow<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.530> today

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
tomorrow as it is today

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.150 
tomorrow as it is today
it's<00:02:11.569> gonna<00:02:11.660> be<00:02:11.840> very<00:02:12.200> different<00:02:12.440> at<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
it's gonna be very different at the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.620 
it's gonna be very different at the
beginning<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.700> month<00:02:13.880> as<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
beginning of the month as it is to the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.680 
beginning of the month as it is to the
end<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.020> month<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.830> once<00:02:16.640> again<00:02:16.790> let's<00:02:17.569> do

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
end of the month so once again let's do

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
hundred eleven x point zero five hit

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.430 
hundred eleven x point zero five hit
enter<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.150> get<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.630> number<00:02:26.780> eight<00:02:27.050> hundred

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
enter I get that number eight hundred

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.930 
enter I get that number eight hundred
and<00:02:27.530> ten<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:29.020> I'm<00:02:30.020> not<00:02:30.260> very<00:02:30.530> far<00:02:31.250> away<00:02:31.370> here

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940

I'm<00:02:32.720> only<00:02:32.900> sixty<00:02:33.739> three<00:02:33.980> way<00:02:34.160> ranks<00:02:34.640> away<00:02:34.880> from

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
I'm only sixty three way ranks away from
