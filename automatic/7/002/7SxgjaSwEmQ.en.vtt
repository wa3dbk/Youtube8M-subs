across the line stunning than that 20
the<00:00:22.769> breaking<00:00:23.070> point<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.369> very<00:00:23.550> bumpy<00:00:23.730> into

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the breaking point it's very bumpy into

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.759 
the breaking point it's very bumpy into
turn<00:00:24.240> one

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
in there guys the street circuit cross

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.450 
in there guys the street circuit cross
street<00:00:42.180> circuits<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> race<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.250> there's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
street circuits it's a race also there's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.680 
street circuits it's a race also there's
quite<00:00:44.520> difficult<00:00:44.850> cuz<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> stay<00:00:45.660> on

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
quite difficult cuz you have to stay on

quite difficult cuz you have to stay on
European<00:00:46.170> time<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.680> means<00:00:46.860> you're<00:00:46.980> going

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
European time so it means you're going

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.029 
European time so it means you're going
to<00:00:47.250> bed<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.789> 6:00<00:00:48.539> a.m.<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.200> waking<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.680> 2

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to bed at like 6:00 a.m. and waking up 2

turn five really important to keep the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.800 
turn five really important to keep the
minimum<00:00:57.990> speed<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.560> get<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.740> good<00:00:58.950> exit<00:00:59.810> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
as smooth as possible two cars got in

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.020 
as smooth as possible two cars got in
the<00:01:06.150> hallway<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.660> here<00:01:07.100> reg<00:01:08.100> 100-meter<00:01:08.790> sign

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the hallway down here reg 100-meter sign

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.780 
the hallway down here reg 100-meter sign
and<00:01:09.960> lots<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> speed<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> cars<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.520> over<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and lots of speed in cars all over the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.990 
and lots of speed in cars all over the
place<00:01:14.570> nice<00:01:15.570> tap<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.340> at<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.430> point<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.820> ties

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
place nice tap in at this point if ties

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280 
place nice tap in at this point if ties
are<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.330> hot<00:01:18.510> subtractions<00:01:19.110> very

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
are really hot subtractions very

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
are really hot subtractions very
difficult<00:01:19.760> here's<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.940> corner<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.300> being

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
difficult here's the corner about being

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
difficult here's the corner about being
patient<00:01:21.920> being<00:01:22.920> careful<00:01:23.370> it's<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.000> easy

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
patient being careful it's just so easy

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.110 
patient being careful it's just so easy
to<00:01:24.480> have<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:24.960> oversteer<00:01:25.320> moment<00:01:25.940> we've<00:01:26.940> come

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
to have an oversteer moment we've come

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.640 
to have an oversteer moment we've come
down<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.660> tricky<00:01:27.930> part<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.320> circuit

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
down to a really tricky part the circuit

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.020 
down to a really tricky part the circuit
what<00:01:28.830> used<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.100> chicane<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.670> never<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:30.000> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
what used to be chicane has never got a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
what used to be chicane has never got a
quite<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> fast<00:01:30.900> left-hander<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.890> chicane<00:01:32.190> was

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
quite a fast left-hander the chicane was

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.700 
quite a fast left-hander the chicane was
terrible<00:01:32.790> before<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:34.110> chicane<00:01:34.410> it's<00:01:34.530> quite

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
terrible before this chicane it's quite

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.680 
terrible before this chicane it's quite
quick<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.190> we<00:01:35.729> come<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.119> gets<00:01:36.270> quite<00:01:36.479> tight

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
quick and we come it gets quite tight

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.240 
quick and we come it gets quite tight
the<00:01:36.840> road<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.260> I'm<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.800> this<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.100> bridge

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the road here I'm in this little bridge

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.020 
the road here I'm in this little bridge
very<00:01:39.240> easy<00:01:39.420> lock<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> tires<00:01:40.200> need<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.160> step

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
very easy lock up the tires need to step

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.530 
very easy lock up the tires need to step
in<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.860> again<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:44.970> important<00:01:45.450> here

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
in here again it's really important here

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.500 
in here again it's really important here
for<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.840> long<00:01:45.930> straight<00:01:47.060> lots<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.150> grip<00:01:48.330> when

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
for the long straight lots of grip when

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.609 
for the long straight lots of grip when
you're<00:01:48.630> breaking<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.200> next<00:01:49.440> corner

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
you're breaking into the next corner

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.090 
you're breaking into the next corner
something<00:01:50.550> break<00:01:50.729> quite<00:01:50.970> late<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:52.740> petrol

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
something break quite late to petrol
