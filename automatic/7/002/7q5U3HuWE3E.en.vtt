00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.860
 I can not do it well it's 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.040
 well done in person in front of the person 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.040
 in front of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.980
 the limit was only the direct 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.810
 with trÃ¨bes at the opening 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.430
 very good change of ends 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 brice maertens we said the bass 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 definition that is lacking 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 it's the Ivorian defender who is giving 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.360
 in marouane's feet is there from 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
 foot flat and that's the past it's the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.820
 defender I think he's a guardian 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 who had deviated with his defenders 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.290
 so it gives a punch to the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.750
 devils that will kick successful martens on 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.760
 the side 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.530
 right towards 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.660
 Van Buyten was it back in 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.870
 breuil feet of new inspectors 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.960
 mind he is very good at this beginning of 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.960
 match 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.790
 we left the initiative to the coast 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.740
 of ivory during the era and 5 6 first 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.840
 minutes and then there was precisely 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.640
 two three actions that did that well 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.470
 now belgium has taken the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.000
 initiative of the match 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.940
 then the corner kick again 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.160
 mertens with the facts the fight 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.160
 their aim of marouane 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.939
 difficult to manchester 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.070
 and he me 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.190
 with monique have to watch me a 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.390
 little push on his defender 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.770
 look we'll see him here again with his 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.800
 elbow he puts it a little bit side 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.420
 bay-saint-paul physically to finish 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.630
 do not be embarrassed at all 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.840
 little moment but it serves 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.620
 and here it is released now that 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.810
 panicked map on 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.910
 although his little brother still this 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.530
 only in Comoros with good calls from 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.420
 ball is good pass two take 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.650
 slightly stolen what makes us 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.960
 what does he do to you christian 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.010
 benteke what an opportunity 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.860
 what possibilities he smiled v 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.450
 pessac has the excuse to find one is a 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.909
 field anyway we'll see what we 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.299
 will see his small fake leap to the Romands 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.819
 of duty and world did it okay 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.579
 that obviously explains the failure of 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.829
 christian benteke will see him better here 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.079
 we had spoken pre-game of the 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.150
 quality of the land and that's what's embarrassing 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.090
 obviously they are vaunted what is this 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.690
 explains the smile after that comes 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.320
 the missed opportunity strings with 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.320
 so much he wins 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.260
 the Ivorians at the first time we have 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.569
 seen in first half this fault of 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.590
 kyoto 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.800
 some on the left side 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.550
 from bright 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.940
 fun 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.940
 the blood 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.850
 jobs 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.090
 but 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.030
 perhaps 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.340
 the anti goes 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.360
 luck 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.070
 I do not believe 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.810
 but I think he wants to center his 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.150
 left foot obviously it was not the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.150
 better at home and I saw 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.340
 the piaget sand of the lawn even though the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.340
 wii 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.330
 it's here with the look he keeps in 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.150
 Anyway payet will tell us he will tell us 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.730
 way 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.079
 I feel like it's 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.610
 maybe not wanted it's hard to jc 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.290
 by a discussion 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.290
 the paz was whistling 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.980
 center turns and watch out with the goal 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.480
 yeah it was hanging in the sink 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.760
 drogba and that's right as you say 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.130
 george for feeling a little ahead 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.170
 with his 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.150
 fluttering of the everyday round but that's 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.689
 too much to come there the ivory coast we were 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.339
 more precise in the gesture 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.409
 if also in the rest of the forces he 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:35.049
 watch this balloon that goes all the way 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.789
 defense and we are unable to get him out 

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:38.900
 we just missed a three transit 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.930
 years is 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.969
 didier of meal 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.959
 between the legs of 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.959
 of courtly thibaut I take 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:51.540
 impasses in their midst 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.120
 the four players but be careful not to 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.300
 not to cash a goal remained on 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.300
 a victory 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:07.920
 it's pushed back badly and the goal 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.320
 goal of the Ivory Coast max 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.520
 who equalizes in the additional time of 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.520
 everywhere who will greet 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.729
 fans me and supporters 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:22.960
 Ivorians present here at the King Stadium 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.039
 baudouin and yes this second half 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.009
 who did not meet our expectations 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:31.069
 obviously to fans' expectations 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.479
 and we felt from madam we're refilling to a 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.580
 first goal code it's a balloon that 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.129
 trailed we were unable to get him out 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.620
 look here goes against 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.760
 fortunately 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.510
 we have 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:47.220
 we play badly the shot a release of 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.220
 lukaku on angola
