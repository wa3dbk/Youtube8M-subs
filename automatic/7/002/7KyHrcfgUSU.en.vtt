00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:21.050
 it's hard enough to beat auxerre 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.050
 write they 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.100
 so I saw the movie job I 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.830
 sincerely worshiped I found that 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.780
 it was a very pleasant film that gives 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.300
 fishing that makes you want to make 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.860
 things to change it mounts something 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.420
 which was extraordinary at the time and 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.430
 which has become commonplace 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.840
 that today we are the world of start up 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.160
 is part of everyday life we ​​know that it 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.960
 exists we know we can create his box 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.610
 but here we have one of the first start up 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 as we know them today and in 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.460
 saas is a revolution because we have 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.800
 dirty young people who have an idea a 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.300
 project to financier an investor who 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.460
 comes and that helps them grow 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.010
 and in this the film is fantastic because 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.839
 that he tells a complete epic of a 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.250
 start up of the most beautiful pop star 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.659
 start up that has ever existed 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.310
 probably in the world so far 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.400
 and that tells this story and that's 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.400
 fantastic 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 years 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:38.310
 it's simple we're all done a little 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:39.719
 like it is not considered to take a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.490
 risk to create a start up one has a 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.149
 idea we start and we do not have the notion 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.979
 risk 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.810
 we are lucky where I was lucky and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.039
 many others have this chance and steve 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 jobs had its chances to do this the 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.360
 leaving his studies at a time 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.950
 hinge between his student life and his 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.689
 professional life and at a time when in 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.860
 do we do not have much risk 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.860
 because if we crash and ben on 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.599
 will return to work atari 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.739
 I do not know where in the case of steve 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.329
 jobs in my case I would have become 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.890
 engineer I do not know in which in 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.599
 what a great company and so one 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.549
 has no feeling does not feel 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.989
 risk we have the impression of 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.000
 do something that we like and 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.440
 to move in this direction is everything 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.109
 implement for this works 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.269
 thing that we like and in this film 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:22.200
 really shows us this epic his 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.030
 opportunities for a moment without having the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.099
 feeling of taking a risk of creating 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.569
 something from nothing and from 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.239
 create to invent to make something 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.680
 thing that will meet an audience we are going 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.359
 often called steve french jobs 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.430
 it's a huge compliment for me 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.569
 I wish I would like to 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.090
 recognize in hive patients to have 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 as much genius that can have and then 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.849
 we are we may be less 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.549
 individualistic we have a team even though 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.079
 I often represent them 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.489
 apple is a man and then after 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:56.569
 teams at us it's something 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:56.569
 more consensual and there 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.470
 m 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.269
 I find that the movie player 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.599
 really like steve 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.730
 jobs 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.349
 and then enjoys it depicts a 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.030
 perfect way for example in the 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.620
 way he walks and he moves 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.329
 and striking because we really 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.909
 the impression of seeing steve jobs this is a 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.739
 little one's shadow who we love you who gets in 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.379
 still apple and we review its tones of 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.629
 to walk it is alex to its value 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.530
 particular advanced market and that's 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.049
 really great 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.400
 the actor he really plays he plays 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.400
 really steve jobbs he believes john 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.190
 give your cookies 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.450
 I think the call to invent something 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.940
 something that did not exist in the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.230
 new technologies that is to say 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.060
 that the product is good that it is 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.250
 functional but in addition it must be 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.260
 aesthetic and give and envy and 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.850
 that's really what brought steve 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.890
 jobs in his second period at apple 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.420
 it is to say to oneself one can do the most 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.760
 beautiful products but in addition we can 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.950
 make it aesthetically desirable and 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.640
 for us it was a revelation because 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.130
 we thought that until now you 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.090
 are all box in extenso and he 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.220
 needed to appeal to large 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.810
 designers to make a box acceptable 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.580
 desirable she was beautiful and 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.710
 the business and at the end to advance the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.290
 product and its desirability and years to 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.970
 apple and steve jobs will be brought to 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.770
 market something entirely 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.670
 different that it did not exist I think 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.820
 than without steve jobs 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.260
 we would all have unsightly products 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.030
 technology in our homes 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.020
 and then evolution might be 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.690
 naturally after a while but 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.400
 it was really something 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.230
 revolutionary a contribution 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.980
 revolutionary to bring design into 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.980
 is in electronic products 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.980
 just 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.470
 but that's the time for that 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.500
 this hypocrisy natynczyk 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.500
 twice in a row 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:31.860
 he's the one who passionate me and answers 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.860
 by his son jean ping
