really really weak blackberry phones
that<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.600> started<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.170> built

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that was when we started but we built

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.599 
that was when we started but we built
the<00:00:25.439> platform<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.890> could<00:00:26.039> take<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.310> any<00:00:26.430> kind

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the platform that could take in any kind

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.540 
the platform that could take in any kind
of<00:00:26.640> data<00:00:26.789> source<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.130> over<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.519> past

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.350 
of data source and and so over the past
year<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.579> recognized<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.149> the

significant contributors when you think

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.569 
significant contributors when you think
about<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.739> bunch<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.980> different<00:00:50.070> industries

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
about a bunch of different industries

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.540 
about a bunch of different industries
like<00:00:50.760> construction<00:00:51.530> agriculture<00:00:52.530> energy<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
like construction agriculture energy a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
like construction agriculture energy a
lot<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:54.030> markets<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.809> sounds<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.140> you're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
lot of markets it sounds like you're

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
lot of markets it sounds like you're
anticipating<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> drones<00:00:56.670> capturing<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
anticipating a lot of drones capturing a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
anticipating a lot of drones capturing a
lot<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.570> data<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.590> time<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.010> well

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
lot of data a lot of the time so well

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
lot of data a lot of the time so well
like<00:00:59.399> that's<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.780> sounds<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.199> gonna<00:01:01.260> be

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
like that's it sounds like it's gonna be

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
like that's it sounds like it's gonna be
messy<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.520> mean<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.270> part<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
messy I think I mean is this part of the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.750 
messy I think I mean is this part of the
reason<00:01:03.899> why<00:01:03.930> why<00:01:04.530> NASA<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.250> interested<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
reason why why NASA is interested in

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.060 
reason why why NASA is interested in
this<00:01:05.850> BK<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.510> how<00:01:06.960> how<00:01:07.380> messy<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.950> get

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
this BK like how how messy is gonna get

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950 
this BK like how how messy is gonna get
how<00:01:08.610> filled<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> drones<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> skies

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
how filled with drones are the skies

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
how filled with drones are the skies
going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> get<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.530> how<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.740> manage<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
going to get and how do we manage that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.020 
going to get and how do we manage that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.880 
is very different than your typical
drone<00:01:44.820> panel<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> had<00:01:45.630> NASA<00:01:45.960> yeah<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
drone panel right you had NASA yeah and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.319 
drone panel right you had NASA yeah and
not<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> lot<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.369> people<00:01:47.549> knew<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> NASA<00:01:48.180> was

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
not a lot of people knew that NASA was

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.700 
not a lot of people knew that NASA was
involved<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.500> actually

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
involved in just you know actually

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.770 
involved in just you know actually
building<00:01:50.460> an<00:01:50.610> infrastructure<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.600> new

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
building an infrastructure for this new

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.289 
building an infrastructure for this new
industry<00:01:51.990> bogs<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.970> sort<00:01:54.210> of

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
industry bogs you know this is sort of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
industry bogs you know this is sort of
an<00:01:54.450> highlight<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:55.470> we're<00:01:55.799> maturing<00:01:56.159> in

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
an highlight of how we're maturing in

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.280 
an highlight of how we're maturing in
terms<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> drone<00:01:57.030> yeah<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.990> just

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
terms of the drone yeah it's not just

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.130 
terms of the drone yeah it's not just
your<00:01:58.469> average<00:01:58.770> RC<00:01:59.520> yeah<00:02:00.299> we're<00:02:00.659> worrying<00:02:00.930> less

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
your average RC yeah we're worrying less

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
your average RC yeah we're worrying less
about<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.710> drone<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.219> worrying<00:02:02.549> more<00:02:02.700> about

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
about the drone and worrying more about

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
about the drone and worrying more about
the<00:02:03.060> data<00:02:03.299> worry<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:04.110> about<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the data worry more about the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740 
the data worry more about the
infrastructure<00:02:05.280> worrying<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.329> about<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
infrastructure worrying more about the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.330 
infrastructure worrying more about the
how<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.110> actually<00:02:07.469> deliver<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
how we actually deliver this to the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.279 
how we actually deliver this to the
client<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.940> beyond<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.840> use<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> data

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
client now beyond that we use the data

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.030 
client now beyond that we use the data
for<00:02:10.649> creating<00:02:11.640> very<00:02:11.940> high<00:02:12.180> rest<00:02:12.480> map

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
for creating very high rest map

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.380 
for creating very high rest map
although<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.160> build<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> drones<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:15.120> build

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
although we build the drones we build

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.690 
although we build the drones we build
the<00:02:15.570> technology<00:02:15.960> we're<00:02:16.830> not<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.310> focused

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the technology we're not really focused

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.610 
the technology we're not really focused
on<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.000> drone<00:02:18.180> itself<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.750> build<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.080> fully

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
on the drone itself we build a fully

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.700 
on the drone itself we build a fully
autonomous<00:02:19.980> boss<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:21.390> takes<00:02:21.630> off<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.440> comes

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
autonomous boss that takes off and comes

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.890 
autonomous boss that takes off and comes
back<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.280> gathers<00:02:23.730> data<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.540> we

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
back and it just gathers data but we

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.360 
back and it just gathers data but we
basically<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.800> lease<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
basically do is we lease it to the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.300 
basically do is we lease it to the
client<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.840> install<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:28.830> four<00:02:29.130> or

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
client that we install it we put four or

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.520 
client that we install it we put four or
five<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> cluster<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.330> then<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.930> takes<00:02:31.110> off<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
five a cluster and then it takes off and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.080 
five a cluster and then it takes off and
it<00:02:31.590> starts<00:02:31.860> creating<00:02:32.040> maps<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:33.000> all

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it starts creating maps for for all

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.670 
it starts creating maps for for all
these<00:02:33.240> different<00:02:33.390> clients<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.080> challenges

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
these different clients the challenges

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
country where you know drones is now are

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.980 
country where you know drones is now are
now<00:03:14.370> presenting<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:15.000> massive<00:03:15.420> privacy<00:03:15.600> issue

now presenting a massive privacy issue

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.880 
now presenting a massive privacy issue
within<00:03:16.740> their<00:03:16.980> constituent<00:03:18.680> population<00:03:19.680> and

within their constituent population and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.460 
within their constituent population and
and<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:21.120> you're<00:03:21.240> right<00:03:21.390> like<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.660> only<00:03:22.080> see

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
and and you're right like we only see

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.280 
and and you're right like we only see
the<00:03:22.680> more<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.880> think<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.330> more<00:03:24.570> dramatic<00:03:24.840> use

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the more I think the more dramatic use

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.960 
the more I think the more dramatic use
cases<00:03:25.530> right<00:03:25.890> now<00:03:26.040> which<00:03:26.280> don't<00:03:26.550> actually

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
cases right now which don't actually

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.280 
cases right now which don't actually
which<00:03:27.120> aren't<00:03:27.330> necessarily<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.080> high

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
which aren't necessarily the high

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.800 
which aren't necessarily the high
utility<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.970> know<00:03:30.090> scenarios<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.660> that's

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
utility you know scenarios and that's

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.030 
utility you know scenarios and that's
part<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.230> conversation<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.770> needs<00:03:31.920> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
part of the conversation that needs to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.320 
part of the conversation that needs to
start<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.310> happen<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:32.910> are<00:03:33.000> lots<00:03:33.150> of

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
start to happen there are lots of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.480 
start to happen there are lots of
challenges<00:03:33.540> for<00:03:34.530> entrepreneurs<00:03:35.220> there<00:03:35.400> are

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
challenges for entrepreneurs there are

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.790 
challenges for entrepreneurs there are
huge<00:03:35.790> opportunities<00:03:36.080> for<00:03:37.080> innovation<00:03:37.260> here

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
huge opportunities for innovation here

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800 
huge opportunities for innovation here
for<00:03:38.459> example<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.180> think<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.600> what<00:03:39.720> these

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
for example I think that's what these

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.940 
for example I think that's what these
guys<00:03:39.959> wanna<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.350> how<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.650> make<00:03:40.770> money

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
guys wanna know like how do I make money

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.590 
guys wanna know like how do I make money
so<00:03:41.430> for<00:03:42.209> example<00:03:42.240> of<00:03:42.860> sense<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.040> avoid

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
so for example of sense and avoid

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.750 
so for example of sense and avoid
miniaturizing<00:03:45.600> these<00:03:46.070> sensor<00:03:47.070> packs<00:03:47.340> on<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
miniaturizing these sensor packs on the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.540 
miniaturizing these sensor packs on the
way<00:03:48.180> cuz<00:03:48.450> these<00:03:48.660> vehicles<00:03:49.020> vary<00:03:49.950> by<00:03:50.280> weight

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
way cuz these vehicles vary by weight

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.540 
way cuz these vehicles vary by weight
riding<00:03:51.030> or<00:03:51.150> five<00:03:51.840> pounds<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.410> 300-plus<00:03:53.010> pounds

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
riding or five pounds to 300-plus pounds

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.120 
riding or five pounds to 300-plus pounds
and<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.870> heavier<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.709> vehicle<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.100> can

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
and the heavier the vehicle you can

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.390 
and the heavier the vehicle you can
carry<00:03:56.490> a<00:03:56.820> higher<00:03:57.060> levels<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.680> weight<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.920> in

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
carry a higher levels of weight and in

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.070 
carry a higher levels of weight and in
the<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.820> smaller<00:04:00.090> vehicles<00:04:00.570> how<00:04:00.930> do<00:04:00.990> you

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
the the smaller vehicles how do you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.230 
the the smaller vehicles how do you
actually<00:04:01.290> do<00:04:01.620> detect<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.160> avoid<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.820> a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
actually do detect and avoid is a

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.570 
actually do detect and avoid is a
problem<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.020> you<00:04:04.050> need<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> sensor<00:04:05.160> pack<00:04:05.370> that

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
problem so you need a sensor pack that

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.750 
problem so you need a sensor pack that
is<00:04:05.760> small<00:04:06.180> light<00:04:07.050> but<00:04:07.410> yet<00:04:07.709> very<00:04:07.920> elegant<00:04:08.580> and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
is small light but yet very elegant and

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.180 
is small light but yet very elegant and
very<00:04:08.940> accurate<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.770> still<00:04:11.010> think

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
very accurate so it but you still think

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.550 
very accurate so it but you still think
there's<00:04:11.340> room<00:04:11.520> for<00:04:11.580> for<00:04:12.420> start-up<00:04:13.170> companies

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
there's room for for start-up companies

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.110 
there's room for for start-up companies
to<00:04:13.890> come<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.489> and

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
to come in and

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.250 
to come in and
really<00:04:15.269> contribute<00:04:15.659> to<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:15.870> kind<00:04:16.019> of<00:04:16.109> thing

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
really contribute to this kind of thing

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.379 
really contribute to this kind of thing
I<00:04:16.440> do<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.130> believe<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.850> know<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.090> making

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
I do I believe that you know the making

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.960 
I do I believe that you know the making
it<00:04:18.510> cheaper<00:04:19.049> affordable<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.100> lighter<00:04:20.489> all

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
it cheaper affordable and lighter all

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.420 
it cheaper affordable and lighter all
this<00:04:21.359> sounds<00:04:22.079> wonderful<00:04:22.560> but<00:04:22.650> house<00:04:22.800> how<00:04:23.190> soon

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
this sounds wonderful but house how soon

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.240 
this sounds wonderful but house how soon
until<00:04:23.610> it's<00:04:24.199> actually<00:04:25.199> an<00:04:25.620> integral<00:04:26.010> part<00:04:26.040> of

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
until it's actually an integral part of

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.830 
until it's actually an integral part of
our<00:04:26.340> lives<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.760> we<00:04:26.940> interface<00:04:27.389> with<00:04:27.419> every

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
our lives that we interface with every

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.340 
our lives that we interface with every
day<00:04:28.250> it's<00:04:29.250> gonna<00:04:29.430> take<00:04:29.520> time<00:04:29.850> right<00:04:30.150> so<00:04:30.479> you

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
day it's gonna take time right so you

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.379 
day it's gonna take time right so you
know<00:04:31.470> going<00:04:31.650> back<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:32.010> what<00:04:32.100> NASA<00:04:32.340> saying<00:04:32.790> we

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
know going back to what NASA saying we

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.820 
know going back to what NASA saying we
need<00:04:33.540> to<00:04:33.630> build<00:04:33.750> an<00:04:33.900> infrastructure<00:04:34.020> and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
need to build an infrastructure and

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.189 
need to build an infrastructure and
that's<00:04:34.979> why<00:04:35.160> we're<00:04:35.370> sort<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.580> teaming<00:04:35.880> up<00:04:36.000> to

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
that's why we're sort of teaming up to

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.450 
that's why we're sort of teaming up to
with<00:04:37.199> a<00:04:37.229> big<00:04:37.500> group<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.770> people<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.220> sort<00:04:38.400> of
