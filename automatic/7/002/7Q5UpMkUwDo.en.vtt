but<00:00:19.350> we're<00:00:19.560> evolving<00:00:19.890> company<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> lot

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 
but we're evolving company we do a lot

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.210 
but we're evolving company we do a lot
of<00:00:21.150> research<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.990> development<00:00:22.100> well<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
of research and development well you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.310 
of research and development well you
guys<00:00:23.310> really<00:00:23.790> after<00:00:24.360> media<00:00:24.840> blasting

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
guys really after media blasting

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
guys really after media blasting
sandblasting<00:00:26.100> and<00:00:26.190> the<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.450> one<00:00:27.450> of<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
sandblasting and the like one of the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.660 
sandblasting and the like one of the
problems<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:27.960> generated<00:00:28.500> heat<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.430> warp

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
problems was generated heat you get warp

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.070 
problems was generated heat you get warp
panels<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.150> you're<00:00:30.270> doing<00:00:30.360> car<00:00:30.840> restoration

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
panels if you're doing car restoration

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.500 
panels if you're doing car restoration
and<00:00:31.470> things<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.429> the<00:00:32.940> next<00:00:33.120> stage

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and things like that so the next stage

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.910 
and things like that so the next stage
of<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.719> evolution<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.170> soda<00:00:34.379> blasting<00:00:34.769> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
of the evolution was soda blasting you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.259 
of the evolution was soda blasting you
guys<00:00:35.070> kind<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.339> created<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.879> didn't<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
guys kind of created that didn't you

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.639 
guys kind of created that didn't you
that's<00:00:36.480> right<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.929> brought<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.289> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.499> market

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that's right we brought it to the market

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
that's right we brought it to the market
because<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:38.429> a<00:00:38.460> big<00:00:38.699> need<00:00:38.999> with<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
because there was a big need with a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.310 
because there was a big need with a
major<00:00:40.469> paint<00:00:40.920> recall<00:00:41.899> manufacturers<00:00:42.899> were

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
major paint recall manufacturers were

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.340 
major paint recall manufacturers were
inundated<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:44.359> tons<00:00:45.359> and<00:00:45.600> tons<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.899> cars<00:00:46.109> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
inundated with tons and tons of cars to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.430 
inundated with tons and tons of cars to
do<00:00:46.499> and<00:00:46.829> no<00:00:46.980> good<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.870> hand<00:00:48.870> sanding

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
do and no good way to do it hand sanding

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.969 
do and no good way to do it hand sanding
chemical<00:00:50.280> stripping<00:00:50.999> you<00:00:51.179> don't<00:00:51.559> know<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
chemical stripping you don't know so you

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.829 
chemical stripping you don't know so you
guys<00:00:53.100> created<00:00:53.609> soda<00:00:53.850> blasting<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
guys created soda blasting and one of

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.540 
guys created soda blasting and one of
the<00:00:54.929> great<00:00:55.079> things<00:00:55.289> about<00:00:55.379> soda<00:00:56.010> blasting<00:00:56.370> was

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the great things about soda blasting was

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.309 
the great things about soda blasting was
it<00:00:56.729> was<00:00:56.909> it<00:00:57.539> didn't<00:00:57.809> generate<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> heat

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
it was it didn't generate the heat

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.649 
it was it didn't generate the heat
didn't<00:00:59.010> generate<00:00:59.309> heat<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.819> warp<00:01:00.120> metal<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
didn't generate heat or warp metal and

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.119 
didn't generate heat or warp metal and
obviously<00:01:01.199> that's<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.530> everybody<00:01:01.920> was

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
obviously that's what everybody was

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
obviously that's what everybody was
looking<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.729> well<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.749> is<00:01:03.899> great<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
looking for well in it it is great I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.459 
looking for well in it it is great I
mean<00:01:04.469> it's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.189> great<00:01:05.600> method<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.320> there

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
mean it's a great method but but there

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.649 
mean it's a great method but but there
are<00:01:07.560> issues<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.369> too<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:09.479> are

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
are issues with it too there are

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.600 
are issues with it too there are
primarily<00:01:10.259> with<00:01:10.500> paying<00:01:10.740> companies<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.490> know

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
primarily with paying companies you know

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.450 
primarily with paying companies you know
we're<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.390> evolving<00:01:12.930> industry<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.829> paint

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
we're an evolving industry and paint

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.639 
we're an evolving industry and paint
companies<00:01:14.850> had<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.149> evolve<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.840> EPA<00:01:16.350> was

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
companies had to evolve to EPA was

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.740 
companies had to evolve to EPA was
pressuring<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.340> VOCs<00:01:17.969> and<00:01:18.299> other<00:01:18.420> things

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
pressuring with VOCs and other things

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.999 
pressuring with VOCs and other things
but<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.229> paint's<00:01:19.500> became<00:01:19.799> more

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
but the paint's became more

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
but the paint's became more
sophisticated<00:01:20.670> sort<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.719> like<00:01:21.840> cars<00:01:22.079> go

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
sophisticated sort of like cars go

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.800 
sophisticated sort of like cars go
100,000<00:01:22.950> miles<00:01:23.130> paint<00:01:23.610> jobs<00:01:23.850> last<00:01:24.060> 100,000

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
100,000 miles paint jobs last 100,000

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.660 
100,000 miles paint jobs last 100,000
well<00:01:25.020> that's<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> acid<00:01:26.070> primers

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
well that's because of the acid primers

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
well that's because of the acid primers
that's<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.780> give<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.500> tight

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that's right they give you good tight

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.289 
that's right they give you good tight
bonding<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> paint<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
bonding on the paint and this is a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
bonding on the paint and this is a
problem<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.810> soda<00:01:31.020> blast<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> got<00:01:31.649> an

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
problem with soda blast so you got an

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.560 
problem with soda blast so you got an
acid<00:01:32.250> primer<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.820> soda<00:01:33.149> which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.359> a<00:01:33.479> base

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
acid primer you got soda which is a base

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.480 
acid primer you got soda which is a base
you<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.049> an<00:01:34.170> acid-base<00:01:34.590> reaction<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.219> things

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you get an acid-base reaction and things

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
you get an acid-base reaction and things
don't<00:01:35.700> stick<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.479> stick<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.109> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
don't stick they don't stick and as a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.050 
don't stick they don't stick and as a
result<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.920> there's<00:01:38.189> no<00:01:38.549> paint

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
result of that there's no paint

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
result of that there's no paint
manufacturer<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:40.140> warrant<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.649> known

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
manufacturer that will warrant a known

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.249 
manufacturer that will warrant a known
soda<00:01:41.280> blasted<00:01:41.789> car<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.539> you<00:01:42.630> had<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> come<00:01:43.170> up

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
soda blasted car so you had to come up

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.649

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
I'm looking at here yep that's it it's

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.179 
I'm looking at here yep that's it it's
recycled<00:01:48.509> bottle<00:01:49.200> glass<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> I'll<00:01:49.799> bet<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
recycled bottle glass and I'll bet you a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.039 
recycled bottle glass and I'll bet you a
few<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.579> viewers<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.060> contributed<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
few of your viewers have contributed to

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.480 
few of your viewers have contributed to
that<00:01:52.079> problem<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.770> clear<00:01:53.009> bottles<00:01:53.310> wine

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that problem like clear bottles wine

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
that problem like clear bottles wine
vault<00:01:55.219> exactly<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.609> this<00:01:56.789> is<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.359> sand<00:01:57.689> but

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
vault exactly so this is like sand but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.319 
vault exactly so this is like sand but
it's<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.229> softer<00:01:58.679> than<00:01:58.979> sand<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.850> softer

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
it's not as softer than sand it's softer

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's not as softer than sand it's softer
than<00:02:00.450> sand<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.049> our<00:02:01.200> process<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.039> way

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
than sand but in our process the way

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.910 
than sand but in our process the way
that<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.429> put<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.880> together<00:02:03.619> most<00:02:04.619> people

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
that we put this together most people

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.620 
that we put this together most people
when<00:02:05.039> they<00:02:05.130> think<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.490> sandblasting<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
when they think of sandblasting if I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
when they think of sandblasting if I
took<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.409> mean<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.890> don't

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
took what I mean if I don't

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
took what I mean if I don't
yeah<00:02:08.820> yeah<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.570> blew<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.560> would<00:02:10.680> go

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
yeah yeah and I blew on it it would go

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.600 
yeah yeah and I blew on it it would go
everywhere<00:02:11.100> right

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
everywhere right

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
everywhere right
but<00:02:11.970> when<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.540> put<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.960> machine<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.440> put

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
but when we put it in the machine we put

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.640 
but when we put it in the machine we put
it<00:02:13.740> in<00:02:13.920> with<00:02:14.070> water<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:15.120> put<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.660> rust

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
it in with water we put the rust

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.710 
it in with water we put the rust
inhibitor<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.300> course<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
inhibitor in there and of course the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.480 
inhibitor in there and of course the
recycle<00:02:19.200> bottle<00:02:19.470> glass<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> tight

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
recycle bottle glass now we have a tight

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.700 
recycle bottle glass now we have a tight
compacted<00:02:21.300> material<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.960> when<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.230> throw<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
compacted material and when we throw it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.770 
compacted material and when we throw it
that<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.550> hits<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.030> thump<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.660> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
that it hits you with a thump but it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.640 
that it hits you with a thump but it
wouldn't<00:02:25.050> go<00:02:25.110> anywhere

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
wouldn't go anywhere

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.170 
wouldn't go anywhere

up I'm gonna open it up first I'm gonna

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.150 
up I'm gonna open it up first I'm gonna
dump<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.450> water<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.170> said<00:02:52.380> that's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
dump in the water like you said that's

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.190 
dump in the water like you said that's
followed<00:02:53.489> by<00:02:53.520> kind<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.330> magic<00:02:54.630> elixir<00:02:54.840> what

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
followed by kind of a magic elixir what

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.350 
followed by kind of a magic elixir what
is<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.470> well<00:02:55.980> actually<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.730> whole<00:02:57.090> tight

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
is that well actually the whole tight

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.680 
is that well actually the whole tight
1:02<00:02:58.100> eliminates<00:02:59.100> chlorides<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.330> what<00:03:00.540> we're

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
1:02 eliminates chlorides so what we're

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.510 
1:02 eliminates chlorides so what we're
doing<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:01.050> our<00:03:01.110> blasting<00:03:01.620> process<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.340> not

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
doing in our blasting process is not

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.420 
doing in our blasting process is not
only<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.380> blasting<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.770> metal<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.400> a

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
only are we blasting the metal to a

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.130 
only are we blasting the metal to a
white<00:03:05.640> metal<00:03:05.850> finish<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.480> by<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.780> way<00:03:07.020> you're

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
white metal finish and by the way you're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.690 
white metal finish and by the way you're
getting<00:03:07.200> rid<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.560> getting<00:03:07.980> rid<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.520> rust

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
getting rid of getting rid of the rust

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.370 
getting rid of getting rid of the rust
at<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> same<00:03:09.330> time<00:03:09.600> which<00:03:09.780> soda<00:03:09.989> would<00:03:10.140> never

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
at the same time which soda would never

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.250 
at the same time which soda would never
do<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:11.220> we're<00:03:11.370> also<00:03:11.550> cleaning<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.300> metal<00:03:12.630> so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
do but we're also cleaning the metal so

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.199 
do but we're also cleaning the metal so
it's<00:03:13.470> paint<00:03:13.680> ready<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.400> after<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.850> then<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
it's paint ready so after that then I

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's paint ready so after that then I
come<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:15.750> with<00:03:15.959> my<00:03:16.019> recycled<00:03:16.980> glass<00:03:17.670> here<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
come in with my recycled glass here and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.840 
come in with my recycled glass here and
then<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.750> see<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.549> hook<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
then I see you you you you hook that

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.680
