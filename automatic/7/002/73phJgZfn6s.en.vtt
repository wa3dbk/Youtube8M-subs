00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
found that you actually gain a lot of

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.579 
found that you actually gain a lot of
steering<00:00:35.629> by<00:00:35.750> actually<00:00:36.050> running<00:00:36.260> some

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
chassis lower over the weekend I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.850 
chassis lower over the weekend I
personally<00:00:44.600> at<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.379> Reedy<00:00:45.530> race<00:00:45.710> I

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
personally at the Reedy race I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.299 
personally at the Reedy race I
personally<00:00:46.250> ran<00:00:46.460> I<00:00:47.260> we<00:00:48.260> had<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.379> 23<00:00:48.859> millimeter

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
personally ran I we had a 23 millimeter

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.160 
personally ran I we had a 23 millimeter
right<00:00:49.460> height<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.910> back<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:50.719> a<00:00:50.809> 19

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
right height in the back and a 19

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.080 
right height in the back and a 19
millimeter<00:00:51.320> right<00:00:51.800> at<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:52.129> front<00:00:52.399> now<00:00:52.640> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
millimeter right at the front now the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.130 
millimeter right at the front now the
front<00:00:53.300> ride<00:00:53.449> height<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:53.809> could<00:00:53.930> range

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
front ride height you could range

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.470 
front ride height you could range
anywhere<00:00:54.289> probably<00:00:54.980> from<00:00:55.160> 18<00:00:55.550> millimeters<00:00:56.149> to

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
anywhere probably from 18 millimeters to

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.869 
anywhere probably from 18 millimeters to
about<00:00:56.899> 21<00:00:57.320> millimeters<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.039> then<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.699> back

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
about 21 millimeters and then the back

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.990 
about 21 millimeters and then the back
is<00:00:58.910> right<00:00:59.449> around<00:00:59.570> 21<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.350> 24<00:01:00.769> millimeters<00:01:01.340> so

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
is right around 21 to 24 millimeters so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.329 
is right around 21 to 24 millimeters so
whenever<00:01:02.179> you're<00:01:02.449> running<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.199> base<00:01:04.039> of<00:01:04.250> the

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
whenever you're running the base of the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.830 
whenever you're running the base of the
forward<00:01:04.640> brake<00:01:04.820> in<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.059> chassis<00:01:05.269> you're<00:01:05.690> just

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
forward brake in the chassis you're just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.419 
forward brake in the chassis you're just
gonna<00:01:05.929> have<00:01:06.110> more<00:01:06.320> off<00:01:06.530> power<00:01:06.800> steering<00:01:07.220> in

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429 
gonna have more off power steering in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.340 
gonna have more off power steering in
the<00:01:07.520> car<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.030> also<00:01:08.539> a<00:01:08.690> little<00:01:08.929> bit<00:01:09.050> more<00:01:09.200> on

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
the car and also a little bit more on

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.889 
the car and also a little bit more on
power<00:01:09.590> stand<00:01:09.890> as<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.190> exit<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.580> turn<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.600> here

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
power stand as you exit the turn so here

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.510 
power stand as you exit the turn so here
today<00:01:12.140> I'm<00:01:12.259> just<00:01:12.380> going<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.619> show<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:12.830> how<00:01:13.009> how

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
today I'm just going to show you how how

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.190 
today I'm just going to show you how how
we<00:01:13.580> set<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.850> right<00:01:14.060> height<00:01:14.210> on<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.479> 22<00:01:14.899> for

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
we set the right height on the 22 for

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.559 
we set the right height on the 22 for
it's<00:01:16.160> simply<00:01:16.429> done<00:01:16.610> just<00:01:17.030> like<00:01:17.119> your<00:01:17.240> two<00:01:17.390> will

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
it's simply done just like your two will

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.960 
it's simply done just like your two will
I'm<00:01:18.170> thinking<00:01:18.470> about<00:01:18.649> you<00:01:18.860> know<00:01:18.979> six<00:01:19.759> inches

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
I'm thinking about you know six inches

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.690 
I'm thinking about you know six inches
off<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.149> ground<00:01:20.240> drop<00:01:20.959> it<00:01:21.170> again<00:01:22.130> that'll<00:01:22.580> run

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
off the ground drop it again that'll run

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.279 
off the ground drop it again that'll run
in<00:01:22.819> that<00:01:22.940> downward<00:01:23.149> front<00:01:23.630> rake<00:01:23.840> chassis

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
in that downward front rake chassis

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.740 
in that downward front rake chassis
chassis<00:01:25.069> rake<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.729> allowing<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.270> car<00:01:26.420> just<00:01:26.630> to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
chassis rake is allowing the car just to

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.440 
chassis rake is allowing the car just to
gain<00:01:26.899> more<00:01:27.080> steering<00:01:27.380> on<00:01:27.709> and<00:01:27.950> off<00:01:28.009> power<00:01:28.450> so

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
gain more steering on and off power so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.729 
gain more steering on and off power so
here<00:01:29.599> we're<00:01:29.690> gonna<00:01:29.780> show<00:01:30.050> you<00:01:30.080> where<00:01:30.590> we

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:30.739 
here we're gonna show you where we

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.339 
here we're gonna show you where we
actually<00:01:30.890> measure<00:01:31.429> it<00:01:31.550> from<00:01:31.849> which<00:01:32.690> is<00:01:32.899> right

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:33.349 
actually measure it from which is right

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.469 
actually measure it from which is right
there<00:01:33.380> basically<00:01:34.220> right<00:01:34.849> under<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.239> slipper

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
there basically right under the slipper

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.949 
there basically right under the slipper
shaft<00:01:36.729> so<00:01:37.729> we're<00:01:37.819> at<00:01:37.910> 19<00:01:38.239> millimeters<00:01:38.720> there

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
shaft so we're at 19 millimeters there

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.620 
shaft so we're at 19 millimeters there
now<00:01:39.649> go<00:01:39.830> into<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.160> back<00:01:40.369> again<00:01:41.000> forward<00:01:41.390> rake

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
now go into the back again forward rake

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.820 
now go into the back again forward rake
in<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.929> chassis<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:45.229> we're<00:01:45.349> gonna<00:01:45.440> drop<00:01:45.649> it

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
in the chassis so we're gonna drop it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.740 
in the chassis so we're gonna drop it
from

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.580 

a<00:01:48.980> few<00:01:49.980> inches<00:01:50.690> adjust<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.870> to<00:01:52.400> 23<00:01:54.560> we're<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
a few inches adjust this to 23 we're a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
a few inches adjust this to 23 we're a
little<00:01:55.920> low<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.280> obviously<00:01:56.820> get<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
little low so obviously get this a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.440 
little low so obviously get this a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
