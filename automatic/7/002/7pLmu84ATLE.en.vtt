00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.270 
released DMV or 35,000 degrees kd7 this
is<00:00:18.910> probably<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.780> cleanest<00:00:20.320> colorway<00:00:20.740> in<00:00:21.010> my

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
is probably the cleanest colorway in my

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.070 
is probably the cleanest colorway in my
opinion<00:00:21.670> this<00:00:22.330> is<00:00:22.390> definitely<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.930> one<00:00:23.020> that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
opinion this is definitely the one that

opinion this is definitely the one that
I<00:00:23.200> wanted<00:00:23.530> and<00:00:23.710> when<00:00:23.950> I<00:00:23.980> first<00:00:24.310> initially<00:00:24.580> saw

I wanted and when I first initially saw
the<00:00:25.390> colorways<00:00:25.780> and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:27.250> haven't<00:00:28.000> seen<00:00:28.120> another

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
like the Kobe nines or whatever so just

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.120 
like the Kobe nines or whatever so just
right<00:01:38.049> off<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.229> bat<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.649> little<00:01:38.920> bit<00:01:39.039> of

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
right off the bat a little bit of

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.620 
right off the bat a little bit of
performance<00:01:39.369> information<00:01:40.060> before<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.450> full

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
performance information before the full

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.529 
performance information before the full
review<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.049> up<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.460> basically<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:43.119> traction

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
review is up but basically the traction

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.359 
review is up but basically the traction
on<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.840> Kobe<00:01:44.109> nines<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.649> definitely<00:01:45.219> better

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
on the Kobe nines is definitely better

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.349 
on the Kobe nines is definitely better
than<00:01:45.789> these<00:01:46.000> guys<00:01:46.060> here<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:48.039> 28th<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.759> 29th

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
than these guys here the 28th and 29th

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.440 
than these guys here the 28th and 29th
or<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.259> 29<00:01:50.619> so<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.829> 28th<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.759> Kobe<00:01:52.270> nines

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
or not the 29 so the 28th and Kobe nines

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.959 
or not the 29 so the 28th and Kobe nines
are<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.750> two<00:01:52.960> that<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.590> hold<00:01:53.859> like<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.310> like<00:01:54.700> if

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
are the two that I hold like as like if

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.090 
are the two that I hold like as like if
I<00:01:55.119> could<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:55.359> above<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.750> 10<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.530> those<00:01:56.950> would

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
I could go above a 10 that those would

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.859 
I could go above a 10 that those would

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.690 
still available online I had a hard time
getting<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:35.890> store<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.280> was<00:03:36.430> literally

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
getting this in store this was literally

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.539 
getting this in store this was literally
like<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.030> last<00:03:37.239> pair<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.510> my<00:03:37.690> size<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:39.310> I

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
like the last pair in my size so and I

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.710 
like the last pair in my size so and I
think<00:03:39.760> there<00:03:39.880> was<00:03:39.970> like<00:03:40.120> one<00:03:40.269> other<00:03:40.420> size

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
think there was like one other size

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.720 
think there was like one other size
after<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.230> size<00:03:41.470> 10<00:03:41.799> but<00:03:42.070> other<00:03:42.519> than<00:03:42.640> that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
after that size 10 but other than that

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.319 
after that size 10 but other than that
they<00:03:42.940> were<00:03:42.970> all<00:03:43.209> gone<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:45.430> yeah<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.180> these

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
they were all gone so but yeah so these

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.500 
they were all gone so but yeah so these
are<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:47.560> my<00:03:47.620> opinion<00:03:47.769> just<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.370> best<00:03:48.549> KD<00:03:49.180> so

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
are in my opinion just the best KD so

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.160 
are in my opinion just the best KD so
far<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:50.290> more<00:03:50.470> quick<00:03:51.180> look<00:03:52.180> here<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.870> can<00:03:53.019> see

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
far one more quick look here you can see

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.979 
far one more quick look here you can see
the<00:03:53.350> Olympic<00:03:54.010> ones<00:03:54.190> back<00:03:54.400> there<00:03:54.670> I'm<00:03:55.420> tired<00:03:55.810> of
