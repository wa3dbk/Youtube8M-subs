the<00:01:06.460> strumming<00:01:07.180> pattern<00:01:07.210> because<00:01:07.630> it's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
the strumming pattern because it's

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.090 
the strumming pattern because it's
actually<00:01:08.080> pretty<00:01:08.229> much<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.560> same<00:01:08.740> for<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
actually pretty much the same for the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:23.990 
actually pretty much the same for the
whole<00:01:09.250> song<00:01:19.259> I'll<00:01:20.259> go<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.440> little<00:01:20.500> slower<00:01:20.890> maybe

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
them like that because I can't cram all

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.780 
them like that because I can't cram all
my<00:02:05.409> fingers<00:02:05.620> into<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.070> fret<00:02:06.400> for<00:02:06.670> some

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.539 
reason and then my other finger doesn't
Bend<00:02:08.500> anyways

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
Bend anyways

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.520 
Bend anyways
I<00:02:09.580> end<00:02:10.179> up<00:02:10.299> doing<00:02:10.390> my<00:02:10.600> my<00:02:10.899> chords<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.350> that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
I end up doing my my chords like that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.500 
I end up doing my my chords like that
but<00:02:12.100> they<00:02:12.190> both<00:02:12.340> sent<00:02:12.580> both<00:02:12.730> ways<00:02:12.940> sound<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
but they both sent both ways sound the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.430 
but they both sent both ways sound the
same<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.720> you're<00:02:14.019> fine

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
same so you're fine

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.800 
same so you're fine
and<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:15.640> have<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.850> choice<00:02:16.030> here<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.390> playing

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
and you have the choice here of playing

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.259 
and you have the choice here of playing
the<00:02:16.930> low<00:02:17.049> E<00:02:17.190> or<00:02:18.190> not<00:02:18.489> because<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.030> an<00:02:19.120> E<00:02:19.239> chord

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
the low E or not because it's an E chord

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.460 
the low E or not because it's an E chord
it<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.989> adds<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> bit<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.410> bass

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it just adds a bit of bass

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.600 
it just adds a bit of bass

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
to play that first pattern just once and

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.780 
to play that first pattern just once and
then<00:05:10.930> from<00:05:11.770> there<00:05:11.920> on<00:05:11.950> we'll<00:05:12.250> play<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.520> song

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
then from there on we'll play the song

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.240 
then from there on we'll play the song
through<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.420> way<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:13.600> actually<00:05:13.990> sounds<00:05:14.380> and

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
through the way it actually sounds and

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.800 
through the way it actually sounds and
we'll<00:05:15.760> do<00:05:15.850> it<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.030> little<00:05:16.510> bit<00:05:16.660> slower

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
we'll do it a little bit slower

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.890 
we'll do it a little bit slower
hopefully<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.380> can<00:05:17.530> keep<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:18.010> decent<00:05:18.600> pace<00:05:19.600> here
