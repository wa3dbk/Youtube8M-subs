00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
nice kickflip where it sucks right up
into<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.219> back<00:02:05.520> foot<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.030> feels<00:02:06.360> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
into your back foot just feels so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.680 
into your back foot just feels so
amazing<00:02:07.640> cool<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.149> double<00:02:09.479> flip

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
amazing cool so on your double flip

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
amazing cool so on your double flip
check<00:02:10.470> out<00:02:10.619> my<00:02:10.800> foot<00:02:11.039> position<00:02:11.489> there<00:02:11.670> it's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
check out my foot position there it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520 
check out my foot position there it's
not

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
not

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.380 
not
my<00:02:13.620> front<00:02:13.830> foot<00:02:13.920> doesn't<00:02:14.280> come<00:02:14.640> further<00:02:14.970> back

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
my front foot doesn't come further back

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.900 
my front foot doesn't come further back
but<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.200> comes<00:02:16.410> further<00:02:16.830> off<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> side

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
but it comes further off of the side

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.949 
but it comes further off of the side
closer<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.010> side<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.030> concave<00:02:21.600> right

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
closer to the side of the concave right

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.160 
closer to the side of the concave right
there<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:24.120> what<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> want<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.900> switch

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
there so that's what I want to switch

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.199 
there so that's what I want to switch
you<00:02:25.350> into<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:26.160> put<00:02:26.459> your<00:02:26.550> front<00:02:26.819> foot<00:02:26.880> so

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you into don't put your front foot so

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.530 
you into don't put your front foot so
far<00:02:27.240> back<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:28.790> well<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:30.030> couple<00:02:30.209> reasons

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
far back because well a couple reasons

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.229 
far back because well a couple reasons
first<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.200> all<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.650> kind<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.060> lessons<00:02:33.060> your

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
first of all it kind of lessons your

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.270 
first of all it kind of lessons your
ability<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.840> control<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.500> board<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:35.010> you

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
ability to control the board because you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
ability to control the board because you
want<00:02:35.520> your<00:02:35.610> front<00:02:35.940> foot<00:02:36.000> flicking<00:02:36.600> more<00:02:36.959> off

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
want your front foot flicking more off

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.229 
want your front foot flicking more off
the<00:02:37.230> nose<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.040> saw<00:02:38.280> me<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:38.940> and

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
the nose like you saw me do there and

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.780 
the nose like you saw me do there and
then<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.260> doesn't<00:02:40.590> necessarily<00:02:41.430> make<00:02:41.580> your

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
then it doesn't necessarily make your

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.540 
then it doesn't necessarily make your
board<00:02:42.030> spin<00:02:42.450> faster<00:02:43.230> what<00:02:44.010> actually<00:02:44.400> makes

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
board spin faster what actually makes

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.759 
board spin faster what actually makes
your<00:02:44.790> board<00:02:45.000> spin<00:02:45.300> faster<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.989> moving<00:02:46.410> your

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
your board spin faster is moving your

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.670 
your board spin faster is moving your
foot<00:02:47.040> more<00:02:47.550> off<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> side<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:49.019> like<00:02:49.230> how

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
foot more off to the side just like how

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.890 
foot more off to the side just like how
I'm<00:02:49.860> pointing<00:02:50.130> right<00:02:50.519> there<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.420> my<00:02:51.570> regular

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I'm pointing right there so my regular

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.930 
I'm pointing right there so my regular
kickflip<00:02:52.350> my<00:02:52.500> front<00:02:52.769> foot<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.100> there<00:02:53.340> double

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
kickflip my front foot is there double

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.440 
kickflip my front foot is there double
flip<00:02:54.150> my<00:02:54.330> foot<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.690> there<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.320> then<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.070> just

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
flip my foot is there and then I just

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.900 
flip my foot is there and then I just
pop<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.690> flick<00:02:58.200> exactly<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.190> same<00:02:59.430> way<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.880> I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
pop it flick exactly the same way that I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.050 
pop it flick exactly the same way that I
would<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.480> my<00:03:00.690> regular<00:03:01.350> flip<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.010> then<00:03:02.610> wait

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
would with my regular flip and then wait

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.150 
would with my regular flip and then wait
for<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.390> spin<00:03:03.690> twice<00:03:04.019> that's<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.860> trick<00:03:05.069> of

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
for it to spin twice that's the trick of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.460 
for it to spin twice that's the trick of
the<00:03:05.220> double<00:03:05.550> flip<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:06.150> getting<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.230> full

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the double flip just getting that full

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.170 
the double flip just getting that full
rotation<00:03:08.069> but<00:03:08.250> actually<00:03:08.610> having<00:03:08.880> your<00:03:09.000> back

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
rotation but actually having your back

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.860 
rotation but actually having your back
foot<00:03:09.480> there<00:03:09.780> ready<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.230> catch<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.010> when<00:03:11.310> you

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
foot there ready to catch it when you

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.470 
foot there ready to catch it when you
when<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.989> see<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.530> fully<00:03:14.040> rotated<00:03:14.580> so

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
when you see that it is fully rotated so

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.880 
when you see that it is fully rotated so
you<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.870> difference<00:03:15.989> there<00:03:16.410> my<00:03:16.620> front

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
you see the difference there my front

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.949 
you see the difference there my front
foot<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.220> more<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> edge<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.720> right

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
foot is more off to the edge just right

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.430 
foot is more off to the edge just right
on<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.170> edge<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.560> then<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:20.010> give<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.970> all

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
on the edge and then I just give it all

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.280 
on the edge and then I just give it all
the<00:03:22.440> gusto<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.640> flick<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.110> make

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the gusto on that flick just to make

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.970 
the gusto on that flick just to make
sure<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.590> pops<00:03:25.890> around<00:03:26.430> fully<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.980> flip

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
sure it pops around fully on the flip

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.490 
sure it pops around fully on the flip
one<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.790> then<00:03:29.940> two<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.110> back<00:03:31.290> foot

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
one and then two and then the back foot

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.440 
one and then two and then the back foot
is<00:03:31.650> right<00:03:31.860> there<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.459> catch<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.000> stop<00:03:33.269> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
is right there to catch it stop the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.120 
is right there to catch it stop the
rotation<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.200> put<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.829> down<00:03:36.890> cool<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.100> I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
rotation and put it down cool so I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.100 
rotation and put it down cool so I
really<00:03:38.519> like<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.239> sent<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.750> video

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
really like that you sent in this video

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.840 
really like that you sent in this video
because<00:03:40.410> I've<00:03:40.680> never<00:03:40.709> done<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.340> double<00:03:41.489> flip

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
because I've never done the double flip

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.449 
because I've never done the double flip
skate<00:03:42.150> support<00:03:42.630> haven't<00:03:43.500> even<00:03:43.560> done<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:44.190> double

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
skate support haven't even done a double

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.110 
skate support haven't even done a double
flip<00:03:44.760> how-to<00:03:45.150> video<00:03:45.840> for<00:03:46.200> youtube<00:03:46.440> yet<00:03:47.280> there

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
flip how-to video for youtube yet there

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.390 
flip how-to video for youtube yet there
is<00:03:48.269> one<00:03:48.480> coming<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.140> definitely<00:03:49.859> look<00:03:50.010> out<00:03:50.190> for

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
is one coming so definitely look out for

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.509 
is one coming so definitely look out for
that<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.750> i<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.739> tips<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.370> i

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
that but i think that the tips that i

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.449 
that but i think that the tips that i
gave<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:53.850> here<00:03:54.180> or<00:03:54.329> are<00:03:54.660> definitely<00:03:55.620> good<00:03:55.859> so

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
gave you here or are definitely good so

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.080 
gave you here or are definitely good so
again<00:03:57.799> that's<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.920> good<00:03:59.100> angle<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.730> flick

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
again that's a good angle of the flick

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.509 
again that's a good angle of the flick
