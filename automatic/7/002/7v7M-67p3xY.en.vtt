really easy trick to getting it to be a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.189 
really easy trick to getting it to be a
square<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.219> take<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> corners

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199

and<00:01:04.199> bring<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.680> along<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> long<00:01:05.610> edge

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and bring it down along the long edge

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.929 
and bring it down along the long edge
like<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.830> even<00:01:07.920> fold<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
like this you can even fold it down and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.990 
like this you can even fold it down and
if<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> cut<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.560> part<00:01:10.890> off<00:01:11.159> you'll<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
if you cut this part off you'll get a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.820 
if you cut this part off you'll get a
square<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.229> already<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.680> go

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
square and I have one already to go

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
square and I have one already to go
looks<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.600> piece<00:01:15.900> will<00:01:16.080> be

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
looks like this so this piece will be

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050 
looks like this so this piece will be
like<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:17.850> kind

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like that so what actually that's kind

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:29.590 
like that so what actually that's kind
of<00:01:18.150> cool<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.750> gonna<00:01:18.869> show<00:01:18.990> everybody<00:01:19.049> how<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.730 

will<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> easiest<00:01:31.110> square<00:01:31.470> you've<00:01:31.619> ever

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
will be the easiest square you've ever

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.510 
will be the easiest square you've ever
made<00:01:33.200> was<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> trick<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> make<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> circle<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
made was a trick to make a circle so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.850 
made was a trick to make a circle so
there<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.210> square<00:01:36.900> piece<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> take

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
there you go a square piece so you take

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560 
there you go a square piece so you take
your<00:01:38.040> square<00:01:38.310> piece<00:01:38.549> save<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.270> scraps

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
your square piece save the scraps

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.640 
your square piece save the scraps
because<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> might<00:01:40.110> need<00:01:40.259> them<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> make

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
because you might need them to make

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.319 
because you might need them to make
something<00:01:40.920> inside<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.579> try<00:01:41.759> Rama<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
something inside of your try Rama and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.899 
something inside of your try Rama and
you're<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.159> corners<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you're going to take the corners and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
you're going to take the corners and
fold<00:01:45.210> opposite<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> opposite<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.470> we've

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
fold opposite to opposite now we've

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.990 
fold opposite to opposite now we've
already<00:01:46.710> folded<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.340> before<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.850> it's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
already folded that one before so it's

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.730 
already folded that one before so it's

sure you write the name of the person on
the<00:03:12.020> back<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.739> it's<00:03:12.890> good<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.220> do<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.520> before

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
the back and it's good to do that before

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.340 
the back and it's good to do that before
you<00:03:14.150> put<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.420> whole<00:03:14.570> thing<00:03:14.780> together<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.200> you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
you put the whole thing together so you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.410 
you put the whole thing together so you
would<00:03:15.470> write<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.800> name<00:03:16.010> back<00:03:16.220> here<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.760> then

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
together at the very end so that it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.000 
together at the very end so that it
doesn't<00:03:20.239> fall<00:03:20.360> down<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.320> how<00:03:21.560> do<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:21.680> do<00:03:21.860> it

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
doesn't fall down so how do we do it

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.150
