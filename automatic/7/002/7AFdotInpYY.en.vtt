00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello how about what I want to show you this is another talk I did 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.330
 what the ice like 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.299
 the previous scarf that had frustrated them 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.409
 communist 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:22.129
 is done the inah carries the stitch of cottages the with the division of three 

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:25.129
 strings between high point and high point 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.880
 I already made a video now I want to show you how to do it 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.840
 dodged the landmark 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.069
 that this talk that I showed you 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:36.760
 that we started 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 with the front side as wide 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.860
 i percent we started knitting like this 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.830
 the way this depends on this scarf 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.320
 that hinders along 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.400
 A) Yes 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.760
 all the whole 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.430
 as well as you in this 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.780
 be saline 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.400
 It does not matter 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.120
 the only thing that you here is the sale in a different way because I 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 what I did was pass a cord 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.040
 the part d to arrive in the first round of the houses that I made 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.820
 he remembered to make percent 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.220
 good was with pure chains 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.310
 i percent and I put it here to give it the shape of a capable guy 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.760
 and when thinking about it before the one who has stepped on the part above 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.850
 if you are fixing do not grab any point I simply put 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.430
 what is the taca 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.770
 the activity they say took 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.070
 as a cord 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.550
 I put it here 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.860
 and this made me grab a pleat on the top and then the beards 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.250
 they are hanging in a different way 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.310
 these larvae are the same as we said no other 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.270
 salinas 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.740
 percent are that the opposite unita 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.049
 Well then, who I want to show you another good option, let's put it 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.900
 this way 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.359
 for you to see 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.549
 what the scarf is made in a similar way without saying that it is a 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.299
 sun increase 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.730
 do you weave your chain to the width that you want your vests and 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.269
 saline weaving your chain then to assemble the point that you want 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.639
 in this case I used the house stitch but to whom the height is point 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.899
 high and the width that has here of chains are four chains 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:41.929
 as you can see in this talk line what the pus was common and 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.469
 what this one of another kind 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.879
 which we use in this output 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.879
 this talk was made with the crystal 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.139
 It is done online and I made it with a thread that is the silver I do not remember 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.819
 the name but the texture is a little bit harder it is more it seems that we are 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.299
 weaving here silver percent that's why it shines so much 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.349
 per hundred flights as soon as this one clears scarlet because nothing more what 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.579
 you want to consider me in this case as it is aimed at me I like 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.040
 always put him in what are those that the principle two high points 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.380
 so that I took a finished and that I do not have to make a return 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.760
 around to give him a finished the same 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.739
 how at the beginning of the pointer and at the end two high points 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.920
 i percent we continue with the point 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.200
 it is told is very practical 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.429
 and it was that which is taught 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:40.959
 see how much is left in texture 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.559
 as an outsider 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:48.619
 in the tone when it is a tone lizÃ³n and well clear that this thread can give much 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:53.809
 the lifting what is our otegi gone because it is a fine thread 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:56.819
 it's bananas 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.059
 well then percent here I the beards I made them a little shorter in 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:06.030
 the other in the other made linear otegi 120 chains 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.069
 here, then nothing else, 60 then this is the length that it gives me and how 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.670
 I commented on the previous bid is also targeted 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.720
 it's just chain ia the time of equity weaving alone goes grabbing 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.719
 these covers 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:22.639
 good 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.669
 as far as the cord kell otegi are simply strings is a strip of 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.600
 chains until the truth is that it was to fall for 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.070
 to justify no idea because he had little left and did not know what to do 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.830
 this cord that otegi a chain the acquisition here after 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.039
 the double creating or 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.590
 four strips 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.010
 then double twice I had four strips left and what I did was make a 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.840
 knot 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.699
 and then spend another piece making another knot and so 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.789
 good min this was an idea and I'm cord that he's close 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.909
 I do not use as belt this 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.270
 min love so she does not remove the cord that I liked so that here 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.389
 because I liked the texture that gave it edge talk 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:16.339
 that as I tell you already of being a scarf the long ball is a type scarf 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.990
 able 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.130
 This here is in the front and that gives us another visit 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.570
 well this is another capita that poot salina or villas with you want 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.139
 to call 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.849
 who can take the idea 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.740
 for people who are starting the crochet 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.199
 today the same for the advanced truth 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.860
 good to be very good 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.960
 And until next time
