half<00:00:26.349> sank<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:26.860> Hulk<00:00:27.009> in<00:00:27.189> the<00:00:27.399> human<00:00:28.180> River

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
half sank and Hulk in the human River

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.060 
half sank and Hulk in the human River
and<00:00:29.649> now<00:00:29.770> it's<00:00:29.980> beautifully<00:00:30.610> restored<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
and now it's beautifully restored and

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.740 
and now it's beautifully restored and
we've<00:00:33.250> converted<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:33.790> to<00:00:33.820> electric<00:00:34.239> so<00:00:34.630> it

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
we've converted it to electric so it

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.130 
we've converted it to electric so it
runs<00:00:34.899> very<00:00:35.230> quietly<00:00:35.770> with<00:00:36.040> no<00:00:36.160> vibration<00:00:37.140> the

one<00:01:58.870> kilowatt<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.990> reality<00:02:02.350> of<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.650> with

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
one kilowatt the reality of it is with

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.190 
one kilowatt the reality of it is with
this<00:02:02.950> kind<00:02:03.190> of<00:02:03.370> displacement<00:02:04.060> hole<00:02:04.450> if<00:02:04.990> you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
this kind of displacement hole if you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.230 
this kind of displacement hole if you
run<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.710> house<00:02:05.890> little<00:02:06.220> lower<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.730> get<00:02:06.910> very

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
run that house little lower you get very

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.770 
run that house little lower you get very
nice<00:02:07.390> range<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.619> if<00:02:08.680> you<00:02:08.770> run<00:02:08.890> at<00:02:09.010> speed<00:02:09.310> five

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
nice range so if you run at speed five

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.140 
nice range so if you run at speed five
five<00:02:10.780> knots<00:02:11.080> for<00:02:11.260> six<00:02:11.530> hours<00:02:11.710> or<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.850> can<00:02:13.030> wrap

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
five knots for six hours or you can wrap

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.000 
five knots for six hours or you can wrap
you<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.330> go<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.630> six<00:02:13.960> knots<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:14.650> hour<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you can go to six knots for one hour and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.660 
you can go to six knots for one hour and
ten<00:02:15.310> minutes

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
ten minutes

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.790 
ten minutes
so<00:02:15.970> take<00:02:16.270> your<00:02:16.390> pick<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:17.470> you're<00:02:17.590> looking<00:02:17.740> at

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
so take your pick what you're looking at

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.040 
so take your pick what you're looking at
there<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.720> battery<00:02:19.720> management

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
there is the battery management

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.410 
there is the battery management
electronics<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.820> can<00:02:21.970> see<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.240> each

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
electronics so you can see that each

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.130 
electronics so you can see that each
cell<00:02:22.900> has<00:02:23.200> its<00:02:23.800> own<00:02:24.600> battery<00:02:25.600> management

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
cell has its own battery management

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.050 
cell has its own battery management
metrics<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.800> detect<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.370> against<00:02:27.730> high<00:02:27.850> and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
metrics to detect it against high and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.690 
metrics to detect it against high and
low<00:02:28.150> voltages<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:28.870> then<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.040> gray<00:02:30.280> cable

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
low voltages and then that gray cable

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.370 
low voltages and then that gray cable
that<00:02:30.790> goes<00:02:30.820> across<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.630> cell<00:02:31.870> boards

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
that goes across all the cell boards

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.890 
that goes across all the cell boards
that's<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.860> communications<00:02:33.550> cable<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.660> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
that's the communications cable so the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.840 
that's the communications cable so the
way<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.230> system<00:02:35.410> works<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:36.040> every<00:02:36.550> six

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
way this system works is every six

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.510 
way this system works is every six
seconds<00:02:37.180> or<00:02:37.360> however<00:02:37.840> much<00:02:38.080> time<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:39.310> want

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
seconds or however much time you want

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.970 
seconds or however much time you want

got your master key emergency cutoff so

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.780 
got your master key emergency cutoff so
if<00:03:25.499> there's<00:03:26.069> something<00:03:26.370> wrong<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
if there's something wrong with the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.339 
if there's something wrong with the
system<00:03:26.939> you<00:03:27.209> just<00:03:27.359> punch<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:27.810> bun<00:03:28.019> then<00:03:28.230> it's

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
system you just punch that bun then it's

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.979 
system you just punch that bun then it's
all<00:03:28.499> cut<00:03:28.709> off<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.579> then<00:03:29.819> reset<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.599> like<00:03:30.749> so

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
all cut off and then reset it like so

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.349 
all cut off and then reset it like so
and<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.099> here<00:03:32.549> is<00:03:32.579> forward<00:03:33.540> stop<00:03:34.319> reverse

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
and this here is forward stop reverse

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.729 
and this here is forward stop reverse
and<00:03:36.359> what<00:03:36.629> stopped<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.290> central<00:03:37.620> position

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and what stopped the central position

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.789 
and what stopped the central position
stop<00:03:38.280> actually<00:03:38.489> actually<00:03:39.290> shorts<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.469> motor

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
stop actually actually shorts the motor

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.789 
stop actually actually shorts the motor
windings<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.659> pulse<00:03:42.659> motor<00:03:42.930> up<00:03:43.139> dead<00:03:43.379> stops

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
windings and pulse motor up dead stops

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.569 
windings and pulse motor up dead stops
it<00:03:43.950> freewheeling

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
it freewheeling

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.490 
it freewheeling
not<00:03:45.060> that's<00:03:45.269> an<00:03:45.419> issue<00:03:45.569> but<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.959> boat<00:03:46.200> so

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
not that's an issue but this boat so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.690 
not that's an issue but this boat so
it's<00:03:46.680> nice<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:46.980> simple<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:49.079> go<00:03:49.230> forwards<00:03:49.769> on

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
it's nice and simple to go forwards on

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.509 
it's nice and simple to go forwards on
in<00:03:51.329> pride<00:03:51.599> erection<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.109> then<00:03:52.340> adjust<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
in pride erection and then adjust the

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.439 
in pride erection and then adjust the
speed<00:03:53.790> dial<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.480> see<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:57.000> go<00:03:57.150> into<00:03:57.329> reverse

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
speed dial to see and to go into reverse

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.629 
speed dial to see and to go into reverse
you<00:03:57.989> have<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.199> go<00:03:58.349> to<00:03:58.409> zero<00:03:58.799> back<00:03:59.219> to<00:03:59.370> zero

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
you have to go to zero back to zero

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.530 
you have to go to zero back to zero
speed<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.299> then<00:04:00.919> through<00:04:01.919> off<00:04:02.519> position<00:04:02.969> and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
speed and then through off position and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:50.460 
speed and then through off position and
into<00:04:04.230> reverse<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.980> then<00:04:05.430> line<00:04:05.819> up<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:06.030> norm

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470
