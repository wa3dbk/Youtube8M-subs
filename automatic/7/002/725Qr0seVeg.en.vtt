00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.700
 3 4 Yes I will fight 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.290
 Oh, there s this time tell you about the word Half Management 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.009
 let's begin 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:34.579
 Uh, we have a half-volley or serve-and-volley and then 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:39.769
 When I came to watch a short while to be one where the mat when doesyeoseo 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:43.219
 The party've posted to the feet of some sharp shots 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:47.179
 As soon as it bounces, it is a word management. 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:52.159
 So, especially in the dual economy, 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:57.049
 The logic of the feet is that it uses a lot of legalization when it responds naturally. 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:01:01.129
 So this time, subordinate is actually one of the most difficult technologies 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:05.840
 This is one of the things that general amateurs are not so easy to handle 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:11.929
 Yes, so I can tell you how to manage Harper more easily 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.270
 You will understand and learn so that you will be able to make actual doubles 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.010
 For you to use in the game 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 I'll explain. 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.270
 Eowoo when we do the Cobb Bali 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.790
 Once I have failed, I 'll explain it to you guys once. 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:34.770
 In fact, under that, I saw our server when you leave the game brand youthful and flies to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:40.110
 But then the more I look away I've usually as fast Bee 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.700
 In the event that we have created a wall with a certain market effect , 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.640
 Gotta do this, do not go there is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.450
 When the ball is low and the hemisphere is sharp 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.830
 Also it needs to substantially perform, so we presented four times faster 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.850
 If you fail 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.030
 I think the market is like Chester like this. 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.030
 That's it. 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.860
 This is the case. 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.920
 Yes. 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.920
 Example of a clip drama 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:16.980
 So what is a successful and well-known faces to wash one's racket 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.410
 Go down down down uh Can I go down below the waist 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.640
 As you can see, 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.420
 It wil perform in front of the body holding doendapnida this place at this time 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.709
 When you manage to get a good idea which gives out the construction management 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.460
 When he set up the content, Back Anderson said, 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.000
 When 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.750
 It is to catch the construction and is advantageous for the next management 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.170
 So when you cherry a ball that falls to your feet now 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:49.230
 Because racquet faces can be vertical to the ground each time 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.230
 It is important if you take the content rice when you manage to manage the pap 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.349
 List the market or let it go 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:03.099
 This gave rise into the lower position and attach the body to the myelin beating a star 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.840
 What happens is that you do a good job. 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.890
 This color is important. 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:14.540
 Market is done below waist 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.390
 The body moves forward, so it's done . 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.959
 The pin should make sure the swing is a lot 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.519
 From that weak 0 to somebody 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.519
 You can do it right. 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:34.269
 Save more than'm about've tried to suck Yet'm a little'm 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.269
 5 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:46.560
 You need to adjust the bounce well when you come in. 02 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.850
 Bawoode design even earned a machangajigo chideut time is definitely the swing stroke 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.490
 I gotta do it a lot 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:56.460
 Deeply into the opponent 's court 02 Go away and then in the posture 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.610
 You can score as fast as you can 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.380
 Canvas management is not defensive, but active 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.860
 Actively replacing it with an authentic idea 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.840
 The oil on the other side has some 4,000 shots 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.870
 I reverse 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.169
 So you can get an opportunity to attack. 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.769
 Do not be afraid to see off the feet checking out your progress with confidence 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.750
 I hope 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.990
 This key will tell you how he opposed from the first stage of Paphos 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.370
 It's a practice to live alone . 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:33.900
 One is important to align the bounce against Paul posted to party this is 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 I'm not bouncing after I fell, but I keep the falling ball on its own 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.090
 The baum counts that are won by the competition are right there because of the ball 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.860
 If you do the action and you practice right away with the ball falling 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.860
 We will show you, I'll circle 10 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.940
 Castle House Bar itdeorago how this will 

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.549
 U 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.030
 U 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.300
 Ah 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:15.880
 In the canvas 14 is the other side of the mat to pop 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:19.810
 Since it is important to match the mound, I have to practice hard after 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:24.220
 Beyond the knitted fabric give the other party the court that you practice and doegoyo 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.270
 Practice to get back when you put me in return after sub and bali 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.060
 When 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.060
 Uh, you can do it more confidently with your Harper management. 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.060
 U 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.710
 U 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.710
 5 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.449
 Ah 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.540
 U 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.370

 Describe what you like deuryeotneundeyo show trial 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:10.400
 It's not too late to think so. 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:15.680
 Half volley is a need to perform well to touch zero accent Market 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:20.060
 As a story maker, just because the ball falls under the feet , and the preparation of the case 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.080
 It begins with a point lower to run reliably perform as Hatshepsut Mouse 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.580
 To give 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.409
 We will also ensure that you get a lot of sure colors when you are in front of the center 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.639
 That you were successful 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:36.560
 I'd like to tell you guys, 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:40.340
 It is a way to overcome the bar, but most of the 0 itself is sharp 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.689
 A clear life is important because I come apart. 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:50.029
 Now Naju is a pity for avoiding it now 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:55.150
 But in the morning and evening, now it saw the best season for sports like tennis is one 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:58.960
 It's a really good exercise . 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:02.890
 When you have fun, the crowd consumes the whole body calories. 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.820
 Also recommended are feeling now is a successful one as soon as possible outside the clean gluttony 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.960
 Also, learning new things is quite a good thing 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.740
