00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
were attempting to figure out what would

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.790 
were attempting to figure out what would
be<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.640> best<00:02:46.880> way<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.300> get<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.080> animators<00:02:48.620> to

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
be the best way to get the animators to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.770 
be the best way to get the animators to
understand<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.640> basic<00:02:50.150> movements<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
understand the basic movements of the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.900 
understand the basic movements of the
style<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.440> we<00:02:51.620> decided<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.550> best<00:02:52.580> way<00:02:52.819> of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
style so we decided that the best way of

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.490 
style so we decided that the best way of
course<00:02:53.150> would<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.600> get<00:02:53.989> these<00:02:54.140> people<00:02:54.470> to

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
course would be to get these people to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.910 
course would be to get these people to
