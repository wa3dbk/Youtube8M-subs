00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
little bit of space so we don't have to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
little bit of space so we don't have to
work<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.020> hard<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> infect<00:00:59.730> people

touch it and here they get a little bit
of<00:01:50.909> touching<00:01:51.540> space<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.130> cool

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

because you're right I mean to think
about<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.500> space<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.250> something

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
about going to space it's not something

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
about going to space it's not something
that<00:01:56.689> everybody<00:01:57.689> gets<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.439> know

the rocket scientists could actually go
up<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.690> rocket<00:02:20.110> that's<00:02:20.500> right<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.280> stay

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
up in a rocket that's right you can stay

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.160 
up in a rocket that's right you can stay
tuned<00:02:21.850> because<00:02:21.880> we're<00:02:22.270> going<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> blast<00:02:22.870> off

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
something from space and you create

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.790 
something from space and you create
something<00:03:36.510> new<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:37.290> something<00:03:37.590> totally

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
something new so it's something totally

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.530 
something new so it's something totally
different<00:03:38.130> we<00:03:38.460> it<00:03:38.730> doesn't<00:03:39.060> have<00:03:39.210> to<00:03:39.360> be<00:03:39.390> about

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
different we it doesn't have to be about

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.810 
different we it doesn't have to be about
rockets<00:03:40.110> rockets<00:03:40.740> are<00:03:41.100> how<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.280> get<00:03:41.610> there

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
rockets rockets are how you get there

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.270 
rockets rockets are how you get there
but<00:03:42.360> space<00:03:42.690> should<00:03:42.870> inspire<00:03:43.290> us<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.650> do<00:03:44.070> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
but space should inspire us to do so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.100 
but space should inspire us to do so
many<00:03:44.400> other<00:03:44.610> things<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.210> I<00:03:45.240> just<00:03:45.630> think<00:03:45.900> let

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
many other things so I just think let

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.560 
many other things so I just think let
yourself<00:03:46.500> be<00:03:46.590> free<00:03:46.770> open<00:03:47.580> your<00:03:47.670> mind<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:47.970> do

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
yourself be free open your mind and do

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.300 
yourself be free open your mind and do
something<00:03:48.870> different<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.470> then<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:50.010> makes

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
something different and then that makes

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.030 
something different and then that makes
us<00:03:50.580> take<00:03:51.150> notice<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.840> that's<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.740> really

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
us take notice of it that's a really

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.220 
us take notice of it that's a really
good<00:03:53.280> thought<00:03:53.940> because<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> lot<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.780> times<00:03:55.050> we

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
good thought because a lot of times we

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.840 
good thought because a lot of times we
think<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.710> destination<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.730> we're

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
think it's the destination that we're

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.310 
think it's the destination that we're
looking<00:03:56.970> for<00:03:57.180> we're<00:03:57.480> really<00:03:57.510> looking<00:03:57.900> for<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
looking for we're really looking for the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.320 
looking for we're really looking for the
journey<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.070> what<00:03:59.370> NASA<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.090> whole

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
journey and so what NASA and the whole

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.270 
journey and so what NASA and the whole
space<00:04:00.630> program<00:04:01.080> really<00:04:01.260> does<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.650> give<00:04:02.160> us

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
space program really does is give us

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.040 
space program really does is give us
that<00:04:02.400> opportunity<00:04:02.460> for<00:04:03.300> an<00:04:03.390> amazing<00:04:03.840> journey

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
that opportunity for an amazing journey

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.140 
that opportunity for an amazing journey
well<00:04:04.890> it's<00:04:05.130> about<00:04:05.280> going<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> next

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
well it's about going to the next

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.910 
well it's about going to the next
frontier<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.900> there's<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.380> friend<00:04:07.650> here<00:04:07.710> in

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
frontier and there's a friend here in

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.130 
frontier and there's a friend here in
knowledge<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:09.210> it's<00:04:09.360> about<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.990> that

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
knowledge so it's about going to that

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.260 
knowledge so it's about going to that
next<00:04:10.440> frontier<00:04:10.950> whatever<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.910> we<00:04:12.060> just

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
next frontier whatever it is and we just

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.120 
next frontier whatever it is and we just
happen<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.630> do<00:04:12.840> space<00:04:13.200> but<00:04:13.740> there's<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.040> many

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
happen to do space but there's so many

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.460 
happen to do space but there's so many
other<00:04:14.310> frontiers<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.930> hopefully<00:04:16.320> we

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
other frontiers and so hopefully we

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.030 
other frontiers and so hopefully we
inspire<00:04:16.799> others<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.190> go<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.670> next<00:04:17.700> step
