00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
apparently virtually the exact same I

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.289 
apparently virtually the exact same I
believe<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.580> residue<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:00.940> has<00:03:01.090> been

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
believe the residue that has been

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.910 
believe the residue that has been
popular<00:03:01.630> for<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:01.840> long<00:03:01.989> with<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.380> many<00:03:02.560> people

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
popular for so long with so many people

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920 
popular for so long with so many people
that<00:03:02.950> they<00:03:03.640> tried<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.090> keep<00:03:04.299> it<00:03:04.480> pretty<00:03:04.720> much

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
that they tried to keep it pretty much

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.750 
that they tried to keep it pretty much
the<00:03:05.170> same<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.709> think<00:03:05.739> much<00:03:06.069> has<00:03:06.250> changed<00:03:06.280> or

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
the same and I think much has changed or

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.789 
the same and I think much has changed or
I<00:03:06.819> think<00:03:07.000> they<00:03:07.060> like<00:03:07.239> added<00:03:07.930> an<00:03:08.019> extra<00:03:08.260> grip

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
I think they like added an extra grip

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.220 
I think they like added an extra grip
here<00:03:09.069> or<00:03:09.250> something<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:10.870> has<00:03:11.019> fancy

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
here or something and this one has fancy

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.680 
here or something and this one has fancy
color<00:03:11.590> options<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.970> otherwise<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.450> believe

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
color options but otherwise I believe

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.300 
color options but otherwise I believe
it's<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> same<00:03:14.019> thing<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.680> hope<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.069> lead

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
it's the same thing and I hope it lead

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.780 
it's the same thing and I hope it lead

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
shoes of that but I think I think it

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.200 
shoes of that but I think I think it
should<00:04:53.050> do<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.410> job<00:04:53.650> so<00:04:54.580> I<00:04:54.610> suppose<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:55.090> should

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
should do the job so I suppose I should

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.090 
should do the job so I suppose I should
talk<00:04:55.330> about<00:04:55.600> besides<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.710> fact<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:56.949> it

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
talk about besides the fact that it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.400 
talk about besides the fact that it
lasted<00:04:57.430> six<00:04:57.639> years<00:04:57.789> through<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:58.419> much<00:04:58.600> abuse<00:04:58.960> I

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
lasted six years through so much abuse I

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.350 
lasted six years through so much abuse I
should<00:05:00.130> talk<00:05:00.190> about<00:05:00.400> why<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.610> like<00:05:00.880> then<00:05:01.150> why<00:05:01.330> I

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
should talk about why I like then why I

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.580 
should talk about why I like then why I
chose<00:05:01.660> that<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.930> thought<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.110> earn<00:05:02.259> what<00:05:02.560> I

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
chose that I thought I earn what I

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.050 
chose that I thought I earn what I
thought<00:05:02.770> about<00:05:02.889> after<00:05:03.160> all<00:05:03.310> it's<00:05:03.759> kind<00:05:03.940> of

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
thought about after all it's kind of

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.640 
thought about after all it's kind of
like<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.270> pseudo<00:05:04.630> review<00:05:05.139> of<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.380> death<00:05:05.530> on
