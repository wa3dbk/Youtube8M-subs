00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.410 
alright guys this is a little update on
my<00:00:08.550> nether<00:00:08.910> base<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:10.730> basically<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:12.300> I'm

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
my nether base and basically what I'm

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.120 
my nether base and basically what I'm
doing<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:14.240> having<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.080> factions<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.010> I'm

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
doing is having this is factions and I'm

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.519 
doing is having this is factions and I'm
making<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.730> straight<00:00:18.119> line<00:00:18.330> base<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
making a straight line base and the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.349 
making a straight line base and the
reason<00:00:19.890> why<00:00:20.010> I'm<00:00:20.130> doing<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.910> because

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
reason why I'm doing this is because

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.220 
reason why I'm doing this is because
there's<00:00:21.900> two<00:00:22.289> spotters<00:00:22.970> at<00:00:23.970> each<00:00:24.330> side<00:00:24.689> yeah

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
there's two spotters at each side yeah

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
there's two spotters at each side yeah
blaze<00:00:25.830> spawner<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:27.949> I've<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.010> never<00:00:29.670> seen

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
blaze spawner so I've really never seen

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.880 
blaze spawner so I've really never seen
them<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> straight<00:00:30.869> line<00:00:30.900> before<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.769> I'm

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
them in a straight line before so I'm

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.770 
them in a straight line before so I'm
definitely<00:00:32.070> taking<00:00:32.489> advantage<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
definitely taking advantage of that and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.250 
definitely taking advantage of that and
what<00:00:34.680> I'm<00:00:34.800> doing<00:00:35.190> now<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.850> carving<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
what I'm doing now is a carving out a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.229 
what I'm doing now is a carving out a
big<00:00:37.980> line<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.590> basically<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:41.239> kind

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
big line so I'm just basically just kind

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
big line so I'm just basically just kind
of<00:00:42.360> blast<00:00:42.840> mining<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.590> way<00:00:43.770> through<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.579> i

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
of blast mining my way through this so i

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.779 
of blast mining my way through this so i

step<00:02:53.790> up<00:02:54.769> sorry<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.099> lag<00:02:56.280> has<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.269> step<00:02:57.870> up

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
step up sorry for the lag has a step up

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.069 
step up sorry for the lag has a step up
so<00:02:59.010> if<00:02:59.220> anyone<00:02:59.609> tries<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.910> glitch<00:03:00.389> in<00:03:00.630> they'll

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
so if anyone tries to glitch in they'll

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.860 
so if anyone tries to glitch in they'll
go<00:03:01.650> into<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:02.190> room<00:03:02.579> there's<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.810> course

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
go into this room there's of course

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.440 
go into this room there's of course
nothing<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.769> be<00:03:04.859> down<00:03:05.069> here<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
nothing going to be down here so you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.420 
nothing going to be down here so you
know<00:03:06.569> if<00:03:06.720> they<00:03:06.900> throw<00:03:07.200> inter<00:03:07.590> pearl<00:03:07.829> or<00:03:08.099> boat

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
know if they throw inter pearl or boat

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.569 
know if they throw inter pearl or boat
or<00:03:08.730> something<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:10.319> land<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:11.010> room<00:03:11.310> and

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
or something the land in this room and

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.940 
or something the land in this room and
not<00:03:11.910> our<00:03:12.329> chess<00:03:12.599> term<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.230> that's<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.620> idea

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
not our chess term so that's the idea

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.910 
not our chess term so that's the idea
behind<00:03:13.980> that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
behind that

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.309 
behind that
and<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:16.240> our<00:03:16.959> walls<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:18.099> course<00:03:18.400> have<00:03:19.319> lava

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
and then our walls of course have lava

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.570 
and then our walls of course have lava
in<00:03:20.770> between<00:03:21.280> them<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:24.010> i'll<00:03:24.130> show<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.370> that

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
in between them so i'll show you that

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.030 
in between them so i'll show you that
and<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:25.480> outer<00:03:25.989> layer<00:03:26.470> Xabi<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.250> course<00:03:28.020> and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and the outer layer Xabi of course and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.670 
and the outer layer Xabi of course and
then<00:03:30.330> there's<00:03:31.330> lava<00:03:31.569> on<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.959> ceiling<00:03:32.440> and

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
then there's lava on the ceiling and

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.650 
then there's lava on the ceiling and
then<00:03:32.920> lava<00:03:34.380> above<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.770> mean<00:03:36.730> ah<00:03:36.970> be<00:03:37.180> above<00:03:37.630> the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
then lava above I mean ah be above the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.580 
then lava above I mean ah be above the
lava<00:03:38.050> sorry<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.819> then<00:03:40.330> here's<00:03:40.930> our<00:03:41.170> blaze

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
lava sorry and then here's our blaze

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.580 
lava sorry and then here's our blaze
spawner<00:03:41.830> um<00:03:42.730> i<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:43.420> kind<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:44.019> started<00:03:44.440> this

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
spawner um i just kind of started this

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.000 
spawner um i just kind of started this
so<00:03:44.950> it's<00:03:45.370> nothing's<00:03:46.080> really<00:03:47.080> perfect<00:03:47.739> yet

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
so it's nothing's really perfect yet

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.699 
so it's nothing's really perfect yet
just<00:03:48.400> just<00:03:48.610> kind<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.030> pot<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.170> fire<00:03:50.350> just

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
just just kind of pot of fire just

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.130 
just just kind of pot of fire just
potions<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.580> would<00:03:51.700> definitely<00:03:52.330> kill<00:03:52.750> someone

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
potions I would definitely kill someone

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.580 
potions I would definitely kill someone
right<00:03:53.170> now<00:03:53.350> but<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.280> can<00:03:54.459> get<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:55.180> level<00:03:55.390> 30<00:03:56.200> in

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
right now but I can get to level 30 in

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.620 
right now but I can get to level 30 in
about<00:03:56.860> 10<00:03:57.130> minutes<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.610> that's<00:03:57.910> extremely

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
about 10 minutes so that's extremely

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.800 
about 10 minutes so that's extremely
good<00:03:58.989> i<00:03:59.230> had<00:03:59.980> this<00:04:00.190> had<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.910> base<00:04:01.209> in<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.600> nether

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
good i had this had a base in the nether

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.250 
good i had this had a base in the nether
on<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:03.100> faction<00:04:03.700> server<00:04:03.970> before<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:04.989> took

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
on a faction server before and it took

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.910 
on a faction server before and it took
between<00:04:06.190> 50<00:04:06.850> minutes<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.540> an<00:04:08.260> hour<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:10.920> that

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
between 50 minutes and an hour and that

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.520 
between 50 minutes and an hour and that
was<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:12.670> know<00:04:12.700> before<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.530> enchanting

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
was you know before the enchanting

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.849 
was you know before the enchanting
system<00:04:14.980> changed<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:17.290> really<00:04:17.320> good

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
system changed so that is really good

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.370 
system changed so that is really good
you<00:04:17.919> can<00:04:18.160> get<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.880> level<00:04:19.090> 30<00:04:19.419> in<00:04:19.870> 10<00:04:20.109> minutes

you can get to level 30 in 10 minutes
with<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.890> blaze<00:04:21.070> water<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.789> of<00:04:22.240> course<00:04:22.510> i

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
with the blaze water and of course i

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.350 
with the blaze water and of course i
have<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.280> blaze<00:04:24.820> spawners<00:04:25.150> i'll<00:04:26.050> show<00:04:26.350> you<00:04:26.410> how

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
have to blaze spawners i'll show you how

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.880 
have to blaze spawners i'll show you how
I've<00:04:28.360> designed<00:04:28.810> my<00:04:28.990> base<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.470> would<00:04:29.680> never

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
I've designed my base I would never

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.210 
I've designed my base I would never
normally<00:04:30.460> do<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.360> straight<00:04:31.660> lines

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
normally do this the straight lines

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.250 
normally do this the straight lines
probably<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.250> bad<00:04:33.460> idea<00:04:33.539> just<00:04:34.539> because<00:04:34.900> you

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
probably a bad idea just because you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.180 
probably a bad idea just because you
know<00:04:35.380> they<00:04:35.560> can<00:04:35.910> try<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:36.970> glitch<00:04:37.270> in<00:04:37.539> on<00:04:38.190> any

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
know they can try to glitch in on any

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.940 
know they can try to glitch in on any
side<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:41.470> know<00:04:41.590> left<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.990> really<00:04:44.680> a

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
side of you know left just a really a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.240 
side of you know left just a really a
lot<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.700> area<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.479> protect<00:04:47.110> its<00:04:47.800> ask<00:04:48.039> where

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
lot of area to protect its ask where

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.430 
lot of area to protect its ask where
there's<00:04:49.000> less<00:04:49.180> area<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.050> course<00:04:50.229> you

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
there's less area and of course you

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.860 
there's less area and of course you
build<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.130> middle<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.880> square<00:04:52.060> both

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
build in the middle of the square both

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.740 
build in the middle of the square both
the<00:04:53.050> rectangle<00:04:53.940> it's<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:55.030> lot<00:04:55.240> harder<00:04:55.390> to

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
the rectangle it's a lot harder to

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.440 
the rectangle it's a lot harder to
defend<00:04:56.140> but<00:04:57.039> if<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.400> make<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.729> in<00:04:57.820> glitch<00:04:58.150> able

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
defend but if you make it in glitch able

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.080 
defend but if you make it in glitch able
I<00:04:58.690> know<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.380> takes<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.710> lot<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.039> time

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
I know it takes a lot of time

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.610 
I know it takes a lot of time
it<00:05:01.889> it<00:05:02.889> is<00:05:03.100> worth<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:05.580> that's<00:05:06.580> about<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:06.940> um

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
it it is worth it so that's about it um

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.400 
it it is worth it so that's about it um
yeah<00:05:08.620> I'm<00:05:08.889> gonna<00:05:09.750> probably<00:05:10.750> this<00:05:11.110> is<00:05:11.169> probably

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
yeah I'm gonna probably this is probably

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.590 
yeah I'm gonna probably this is probably
going<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.889> be<00:05:11.949> the<00:05:12.000> recreation<00:05:13.000> room<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.510> a

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
going to be the recreation room and a

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.909 
going to be the recreation room and a
temporary<00:05:14.139> chest<00:05:14.560> storage<00:05:15.010> room<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:17.650> main

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
temporary chest storage room the main

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.890 
temporary chest storage room the main
one<00:05:17.949> will<00:05:18.610> be<00:05:18.880> probably<00:05:19.830> closer<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:22.660> other
