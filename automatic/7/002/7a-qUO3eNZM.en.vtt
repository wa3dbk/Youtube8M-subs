that stops every time you come to a
curve<00:01:02.980> when<00:01:03.980> you<00:01:04.070> come<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> curve<00:01:04.940> you

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
curve when you come to a curve you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.150 
curve when you come to a curve you
continue<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.870> double<00:01:06.200> line<00:01:06.380> on<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.830> other

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
continue the double line on the other

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:21.890 
continue the double line on the other
side<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.420> swirled<00:01:09.200> line<00:01:09.560> we<00:01:09.770> made

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the ribbon swirl down like that and I

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.319 
the ribbon swirl down like that and I
will<00:02:58.140> make<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.500> loop<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.040> ribbon<00:02:59.549> each

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
will make the loop of the ribbon each

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.740 
will make the loop of the ribbon each
time<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> come<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.319> curve<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:02.540> stop<00:03:03.739> okay

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
time you come to a curve you stop okay

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:15.949 
time you come to a curve you stop okay
now<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:07.079> is<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.439> same
