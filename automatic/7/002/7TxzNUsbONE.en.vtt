because he comes in every single set but

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.020 
because he comes in every single set but
this<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.099> only<00:02:56.129> set<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.640> he's<00:02:56.819> actually

different in not necessarily torso
printing<00:03:00.599> wise<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:01.049> head<00:03:01.200> printing<00:03:01.500> wise<00:03:01.650> just

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
printing wise or head printing wise just

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.099 
printing wise or head printing wise just
that<00:03:02.459> he<00:03:02.549> doesn't<00:03:02.579> come<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.150> cape<00:03:03.450> or<00:03:03.720> that

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
that he doesn't come with cape or that

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.690 
that he doesn't come with cape or that
cool<00:03:04.349> armor<00:03:04.769> which<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.129> little<00:03:05.400> bit<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.579> a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
cool armor which is a little bit of a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.849 
cool armor which is a little bit of a
letdown<00:03:05.940> because<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:07.079> is<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> cheapest<00:03:07.739> way

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
letdown because this is the cheapest way

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.190 
letdown because this is the cheapest way
to<00:03:07.890> get<00:03:08.099> him<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.519> not<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.090> complete<00:03:09.660> way<00:03:10.140> to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
to get him but not the complete way to

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.949 
to get him but not the complete way to
get<00:03:10.440> him<00:03:10.620> he<00:03:11.310> obviously<00:03:11.459> nothing<00:03:12.390> has<00:03:12.510> changed

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
get him he obviously nothing has changed

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.920 
get him he obviously nothing has changed
it<00:03:13.140> still<00:03:13.410> has<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.359> really<00:03:15.359> nice<00:03:15.480> torso

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
it still has the really nice torso

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.319 
it still has the really nice torso
design<00:03:16.440> with<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.920> symbol<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.609> there<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:18.060> him

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
design with the symbol in there for him

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.110 
design with the symbol in there for him
and<00:03:19.099> obviously<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.400> looks<00:03:20.459> similar<00:03:20.940> to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
and obviously it looks similar to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.849 
and obviously it looks similar to
Superman<00:03:21.540> since<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:21.930> are<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.169> same<00:03:22.349> descent

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
Superman since they are the same descent

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.190 
Superman since they are the same descent
I<00:03:23.069> believe<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.730> that's<00:03:24.419> really<00:03:24.750> cool<00:03:24.930> goes

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
I believe and that's really cool goes

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.099 
I believe and that's really cool goes
down<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.709> pants<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.569> overall<00:03:27.569> very<00:03:27.780> cool

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
down to the pants and overall very cool

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.720 
down to the pants and overall very cool
as<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.560> tell<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.859> can<00:03:29.010> still<00:03:29.220> see<00:03:29.459> where

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
as you can tell you can still see where

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.430 
as you can tell you can still see where

scene<00:05:48.919> in<00:05:49.310> Metropolis<00:05:49.969> that<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:50.300> get<00:05:50.569> now

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
scene in Metropolis that you get now

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.999 
scene in Metropolis that you get now
obviously<00:05:52.219> this<00:05:52.490> isn't<00:05:52.699> that<00:05:53.479> cool<00:05:53.960> but<00:05:54.800> I

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
obviously this isn't that cool but I

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.279 
obviously this isn't that cool but I

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
a little I guess catapult if Superman is

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.779 
a little I guess catapult if Superman is
dumb<00:06:08.449> and<00:06:08.719> sits<00:06:09.020> on<00:06:09.139> it<00:06:09.319> and<00:06:09.500> you<00:06:10.039> can<00:06:10.190> fling

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
dumb and sits on it and you can fling

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.610 
dumb and sits on it and you can fling
him<00:06:11.029> and<00:06:11.300> yeah<00:06:11.840> that<00:06:12.169> doesn't<00:06:12.349> really<00:06:12.500> work

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
him and yeah that doesn't really work

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.379 
him and yeah that doesn't really work
that<00:06:12.919> well<00:06:13.069> because<00:06:13.279> I<00:06:13.550> can't<00:06:13.940> really<00:06:14.120> connect

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
that well because I can't really connect

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.589 
that well because I can't really connect
it<00:06:14.539> with<00:06:15.169> that<00:06:15.319> it<00:06:15.440> flying<00:06:15.650> off<00:06:15.889> so<00:06:16.300> yeah<00:06:17.300> so

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
it with that it flying off so yeah so

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.129 
it with that it flying off so yeah so
that's<00:06:18.440> what<00:06:18.650> that<00:06:18.830> is<00:06:19.310> and<00:06:19.610> it<00:06:20.300> also<00:06:20.479> has<00:06:20.659> nice

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
that's what that is and it also has nice

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.260

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
movie which is a little weird because it

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.779 
movie which is a little weird because it
seems<00:06:33.259> like<00:06:33.349> with<00:06:33.770> these<00:06:33.949> sets<00:06:34.310> they<00:06:34.610> have

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 
seems like with these sets they have

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.480 
seems like with these sets they have
like<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.630> smallest<00:06:36.139> sets<00:06:36.380> being<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.919> finals

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
like the smallest sets being the finals

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.380 
like the smallest sets being the finals
of<00:06:37.639> these<00:06:37.789> movies<00:06:38.120> on

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
of these movies on

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.880 
of these movies on
don't<00:06:38.480> know<00:06:38.540> why<00:06:38.660> they're<00:06:38.870> doing<00:06:38.900> that<00:06:39.110> the

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
don't know why they're doing that the

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.130 
don't know why they're doing that the
communications<00:06:40.610> tower<00:06:40.790> is<00:06:41.000> really<00:06:41.300> cool<00:06:41.540> you
