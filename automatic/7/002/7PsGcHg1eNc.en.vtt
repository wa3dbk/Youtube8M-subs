00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 okay nice city youtube i am the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.120
 your amsterdam through room instead 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.380
 guys and officially videos on 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.179
 welcome back to the world of battlefields 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.100
 arline to treat a topic together 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.140
 while in the background we will see my own 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.480
 pre-recorded gameplay with the class of 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.880
 scout sniper elite with the flare then 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.920
 a thermal sight has white trace that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 it helps a lot in the medium field 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 radius and especially in dark maps or 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 directly even small, so maybe 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.660
 great for the deathmatch team and vi 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.790
 I assure you that maybe this little one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 copied of more thermal sniper can 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.230
 really help to do so too 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 easy those who easy point to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.950
 observe both the map from another 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.289
 perspective that identify the movements 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.870
 enemies through the vegetation that in 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.539
 arline is always present and always breaks 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 the so - called zebedeans the argument that 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.629
 I want to deal with you today is a 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.789
 problem that affects arline since its 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 since its release that unfortunately all 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.260
 how many we all know 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.960
 we are affected or the problem 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 of the spot points or the point where 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.729
 the player returns to the game 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.580
 it would seem that in arline the points of 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.710
 return are more than anything else thrown to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.950
 have no real logic 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.689
 in fact, if we remember 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.939
 come across a picture if you remember 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.670
 bumps here 4 happened that in one 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.729
 game if you were in one part 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 of the map and much we say of the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.409
 central map so let's say about the area 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.450
 central of the map was occupied by i 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.750
 enemies voices pau naves 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 obligatory or to one side or from the side 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.880
 opposite then he never did 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 to spur if not in rare cases of error 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.520
 close to enemies but at least in one 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.619
 area far enough to allow you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.259
 to travel a few meters 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.790
 maybe even 20 30 meters on foot without 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.700
 meet an enemy and then enter 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.590
 you too in battle this thing 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 in ar line it would seem not to be there 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.829
 in fact when you are killed you can 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.750
 happen that lived poniate for example 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.239
 close to the enemies there is but not yes 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.120
 it is close to 10 meters but rather 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.459
 even behind my own 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.230
 this thing hits a lot of teams 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.239
 deathmatch that is the mode 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.129
 you asked to try and in fact today 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.220
 I'm making a video in this 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.500
 commentaries is own team deathmatch on 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.470
 rigid off shore for those who have not yet 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.540
 understood what the map is and it really is 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.720
 frustrating indeed it happens that you 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.329
 die and after two seconds dispose of 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.760
 alongside the enemies behind the enemies or 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.010
 directly into the enemy spot where 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.930
 there is an entire team and e 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.120
 ready to make the so-called s 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.640
 this does not happen in two seconds 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 only to you but it also happens to 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.720
 enemies to the other players he can 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.760
 happen that paulinho lived alongside o 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.470
 behind and while you are doing one 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.599
 quiet game or maybe try to 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.629
 keeping an area appears from nowhere 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.060
 an enemy and makes you out instantly 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.340
 this is something that is there 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.519
 since the exit of arline is not even for 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.549
 example a thing just added or a 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.620
 error as soon as we say appeared in the world 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.750
 debates trusting lines but it is one thing 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.340
 that accompanies us from its release is that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.720
 I didn't even notice in the beta 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.400
 public that could already be wanting 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.010
 published could already be put on 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.079
 pedestal but I had not noticed in 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.730
 mode wins this thing not 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.629
 good or bad happens because 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.940
 fortunately there are spawn points 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:38.269
 predestined as the abcde points for 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.519
 example plus direct spots behind the 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.680
 shoulders of your teammates 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.680
 so this thing brought mind not 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.959
 affects the gameplay by conquest e 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.180
 this is a great thing but for how long 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.819
 it's about the deathmatch team and maybe the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.669
 future ways in which we would not have the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.889
 spot let's say predestined presses like 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.500
 precisely the flags of conquest 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.389
 this thing we could really say 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.099
 negatively affect gameplay 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.310
 general because he would n't let me have it 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.470
 to enjoy the title is to understand 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.139
 fully what happened in those and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.510
 in that moment of action in that 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.220
 moment of gameplay so to me it is 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.889
 a lot of success approving team 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.320
 deathmatch that when it spurred me then 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.739
 after even the times of shores boy 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.599
 only true 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.440
 boring moments because I don't know if too 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.539
 this is a mistake but rather if in a team 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.360
 deathmatch beats 4 beats filter i 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.819
 waiting times varied between 3 and 4 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.440
 seconds in arline also not here 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.479
 understand what happens because there are gods 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.699
 moments in which you feel like two seconds later 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.979
 and others after you even have to wait 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.349
 seven and a half seconds before I can 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.479
 respon areas to even appear 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.479
 in front of him maybe he is an enemy that you re 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.199
 dry and you have to wait even before 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.060
 enter the game 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.449
 so this really makes you maybe 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.669
 go up the little desire to continue 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.470
 play and get you out of the game and 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.449
 so maybe it won't let you 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.729
 continue the game itself 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.770
 as for boys, longevity 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.900
 debates from online while I answer 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.110
 you also asked me this question 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.909
 in many if it deserves or not to be bought 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.740
 arline then i can tell you guys that 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.020
 I took it at day one I took 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.750
 the most expensive edition with the premium 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.090
 integrated not because I trusted the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.250
 title but rather because being a fan of the 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.500
 let's try a series of battlefield moves 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.599
 immediately without thinking about two 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.460
 times for example sooner or later with 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.020
 the expansions will add the maps to the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.990
 weapons and modes as always happens 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.000
 how accustomed we are but how many you know 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.889
 they complained because they see arlines 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.560
 as practically a useless thing 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.570
 which does not need a useless spin off 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.360
 that does not add anything new and goes 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.349
 just messing up the gameplay 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.909
 actually guys this thing is one 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.340
 real thing because in all respects 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.130
 arline is a paste copy of 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.009
 battlefield 4 with mechanics let's say more 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.560
 even faster but does not add arcades 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.750
 nothing crazy about again 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.909
 revolutionary in the battlefield world 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.440
 in general therefore my advice if 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.360
 you want to get closer to the world of harley 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.710
 wait for it to be on offer today 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.580
 directly if at a price more 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.770
 accessible 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.990
 don't buy the premium right away if you don't 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.449
 maybe the final advice is to wait 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.699
 the premium edition so you can 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.380
 buy the game at a single price 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.580
 all the expansions this could 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.620
 be my final advice 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.759
 these guys this is the conclusion of 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.449
 video because now gameplay is 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.069
 concluding 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.419
 I hope this topic has you 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.919
 entertained had he made to think 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.539
 tell me yours if it even happened to you 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.920
 to you to let off continually behind 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.780
 of enemies that had nothing to do with it 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.950
 and what about boys if video that owes us 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.270
 ripped a smile left a beautiful 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.700
 comment and above all a nice I like
