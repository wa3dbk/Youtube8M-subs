and<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.670> bit<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:24.150> oh<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.570> wanted<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and I'm a little bit like oh I wanted to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.810 
and I'm a little bit like oh I wanted to
see<00:00:25.529> more<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> same<00:00:26.550> time

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
see more of that but at the same time

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
see more of that but at the same time
you<00:00:27.029> know<00:00:27.180> me<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.199> guess<00:00:28.680> kuba<00:00:29.010> wants<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> dangle

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you know me I guess kuba wants to dangle

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.669 
you know me I guess kuba wants to dangle
that<00:00:29.789> overhead<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.869> will<00:00:31.019> keep<00:00:31.230> reading

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that overhead so that will keep reading

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740 
that overhead so that will keep reading
I<00:00:31.769> guess<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.850> we're<00:00:33.030> gonna<00:00:33.149> drop<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.630> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
I guess like if we're gonna drop it this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.959 
I guess like if we're gonna drop it this
far<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> game<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.440> something<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
far in the game or something but of this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.880 
far in the game or something but of this

something<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> vortex<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.470> don't<00:02:58.620> even

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
something like a vortex I don't even

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.380 
something like a vortex I don't even
know<00:02:58.829> what<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.040> heck<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.160> was<00:02:59.370> but<00:03:00.239> we

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
know what the heck that was but we

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.550 
know what the heck that was but we
definitely<00:03:00.780> know<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.349> crazy

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
definitely know that this is crazy

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.539 
definitely know that this is crazy
because<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:02.190> he<00:03:02.730> got<00:03:02.910> beyond<00:03:03.329> feel<00:03:03.540> scared<00:03:03.900> I

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
because if he got beyond feel scared I

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.380 
because if he got beyond feel scared I
imagine<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.700> he<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:05.880> probably<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.269> this

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
imagine that he could probably do this

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.720 
imagine that he could probably do this
to<00:03:06.569> anyone<00:03:06.840> else<00:03:07.079> probably<00:03:07.620> except<00:03:08.190> Kenpachi

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to anyone else probably except Kenpachi

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.309 
to anyone else probably except Kenpachi

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.229 
I don't see composite' getting scared
this<00:03:10.560> was<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.310> whatsoever

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
this was you know whatsoever

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.180 
this was you know whatsoever
how<00:03:12.900> was<00:03:13.079> Bianca<00:03:13.349> gonna<00:03:13.680> get<00:03:13.860> out<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.069> this

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
how was Bianca gonna get out of this

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.250 
how was Bianca gonna get out of this
maybe<00:03:15.120> there's<00:03:15.510> some<00:03:15.720> way<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:16.049> he<00:03:16.110> could

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
maybe there's some way that he could

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.349 
maybe there's some way that he could
snap<00:03:16.440> himself<00:03:16.890> out<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.180> my

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
snap himself out of it this is my

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.210 
snap himself out of it this is my
prediction<00:03:18.630> possibly<00:03:19.350> there's<00:03:19.920> some<00:03:20.100> way

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
prediction possibly there's some way

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.710 
prediction possibly there's some way
that<00:03:20.250> he<00:03:20.400> could<00:03:20.609> get<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.880> this<00:03:21.150> because<00:03:21.450> it

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
that he could get out of this because it

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.199 
that he could get out of this because it
seems<00:03:21.959> like<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.470> most<00:03:22.709> likely<00:03:22.769> uh<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.549> guess

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
seems like it's most likely uh I guess

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.750 
seems like it's most likely uh I guess
you<00:03:24.329> could<00:03:24.450> call<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.019> genjutsu<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.980> illusion

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
you could call it genjutsu and illusion

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.039 
you could call it genjutsu and illusion
whatnot<00:03:27.269> because<00:03:27.510> that's<00:03:27.660> what<00:03:27.810> I'm<00:03:27.900> guessing

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
whatnot because that's what I'm guessing

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.170 
whatnot because that's what I'm guessing
it<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.799> because<00:03:29.190> there's<00:03:29.609> no<00:03:29.760> way<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.060> you

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
it is because there's no way that you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.490 
it is because there's no way that you
know<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:30.389> gonna<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.720> seeing<00:03:30.989> Rukia<00:03:31.350> we're

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
know it's gonna be seeing Rukia we're

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.770 
know it's gonna be seeing Rukia we're
eyeball<00:03:31.859> hanging<00:03:32.160> out<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.519> bugs<00:03:33.060> surrounding

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
eyeball hanging out and bugs surrounding

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.660 
eyeball hanging out and bugs surrounding
him<00:03:33.900> or<00:03:34.019> not<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.500> I'm<00:03:35.010> guessing<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.459> this<00:03:35.609> is

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
him or not so I'm guessing that this is

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.030 
him or not so I'm guessing that this is
an<00:03:35.910> illusion<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.510> hopefully<00:03:37.380> be<00:03:37.530> Akio<00:03:37.859> could

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
an illusion and hopefully be Akio could

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.680 
an illusion and hopefully be Akio could
work<00:03:38.190> himself<00:03:38.370> out<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.090> not<00:03:39.480> maybe

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
work himself out of it if not maybe

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.059 
work himself out of it if not maybe
Ren's<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.170> can<00:03:40.319> do<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.650> mean<00:03:40.769> renze

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
Ren's you can do it I mean renze

Ren's you can do it I mean renze
standing<00:03:41.489> right<00:03:41.609> there<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:42.590> somebody<00:03:43.590> gotta

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
standing right there so somebody gotta

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.960

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
break him out of this that's what I'm

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.479 
break him out of this that's what I'm
guessing<00:03:45.269> it's<00:03:45.359> an<00:03:45.480> illusion<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.799> was<00:03:46.920> weird

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489
