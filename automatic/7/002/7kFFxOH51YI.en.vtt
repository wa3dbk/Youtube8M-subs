00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.600
 people had an episode at the end of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.039
 week there and photo went out videos to a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.800
 lots of things that had nothing to do 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.510
 so we see that to clarify 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 my friends even asked is staying 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.369
 worried that with me for the formation of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.260
 nothing for motoboy puts one thing in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.820
 that the staff today 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.129

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.350
 I leave here on Saturday morning to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.739
 make a service a company that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.629
 work malacacheta it's on the way 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 always the bedroom taking pictures of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.590
 landscape to see if I'm going to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 next month thus leaving collective photo 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.789
 in life is more agile in the sun 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.430
 something if you like to do 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.910
 It's even to think of something that 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.680
 we make more victories and 24 defeats the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.559
 old 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.590
 the documentary telling something 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.229
 so I decided to ask for money for the dig 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.150
 the music was speaking better of a 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.990
 road in the background do not put the music 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.390
 that innovates such people hear on the go 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.850
 enjoying the sister that is not 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.640
 smoker 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.939
 smoking and did when he could have shown 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.799
 but the break for me and I talked things went 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:36.110
 to those who are injured there during the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:39.920
 stay on the road is the people that not all 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.350
 and went to shoot and like taking a photo is when 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 suddenly on a nerd curve to five 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.259
 more or less real kilometers of the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.619
 cheta 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.020
 we were making an open curve 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.200
 that's when we finished this 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 front bend with the truck is coming 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.039
 in the opposite direction, namely the famous 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.690
 against hand 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:07.400
 we had no reason no agent was 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.530
 Hi 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.930
 the way then what we saw was the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.050
 soon a beat nothing more different 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.840
 or cleaner did not do anything because the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.530
 Hill was well and very slippery. 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.540
 enough gas and fall was a drop and 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.640
 truck was climbing the only thing 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.530
 I noticed that the driver was coming apart 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.870
 of noting yet looking at me there 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.450
 rights in something like that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.130
 and that he was repairing and 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.200
 when he saw me and scared me 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.520
 I was already towards him he saw me 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.740
 be scared you 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.120
 there he tried to get back to his hand just in time 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.770
 he returned to die it was 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 worse than I imagined that I ever enter 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.000
 under the truck 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.570
 But God gives light, we think he has 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.120
 some angel in front of us people 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.980
 does the right thing not there I went and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.600
 sent a letter to the right direction that the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.160
 The truck stopped and gave 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.320
 light hit 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.970
 was not very strong despite the fact that 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.300
 story was great but went well 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.340
 weak even we did not have anything we stayed 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.170
 nothing was just a chance but even in the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.170
 neck and the other shoulder because of 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.420
 security right my colleague did not have half 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.100
 renato who is filming in bed and 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.810

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.450
