00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 I think this is Simon again 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.149
 the commitment of his players 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.949
 this time with a message or other times over 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.349
 the USD has 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.710
 and prompt some SMS 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 which is in turn 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.289
 Now I have to go deep 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.079
 against her into the water 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.199
 Brandner 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 the asylum seekers added euros to the somewhat more important topic 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.910
 Italian or Italian 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.400
 and i want to love you and live too 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.910
 Submit in March 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.570
 Even the rest of the round is going to be honest 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.740
 so will 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.740
 player 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.540
 I have an eternally young duel that will stay away " 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.380
 they are wrong 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 once again 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.600
 the streets 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 for her is 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.720
 she seems to do 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 when I get money 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 then he was the stuff 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.320
 Theissen 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 it is nice 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.190
 now 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.600
 fast cars 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 be made 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.080
 Europe-wide attack on the US market 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.829
 I work thereupon 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.929
 and that we stop it 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.210
 I still say 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.210
 many motorists to touch 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.579
 January in Ghana 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.839
 the security 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.389
 Attention recording is not part of it 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.389
 I can sell everyone here 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.489
 first time 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.019
 The promotion also Norbert Haug that were about 250 helpers 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.159
 has been published 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.079
 that's why we have 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.059
 but that has to be back 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.089
 intensively edit 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.089
 particularly powerful tool integrated 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.159
 So I can not speak 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.459
 and Miriam b and 9 percent and Opera Werner Kleemann in the Stauferpark country 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.729
 I decided to give him her name and a clear purpose 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.229
 her friend lives 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.329
 Dipl-Ing 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.219
 coincidentally that all ours fall 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.570
 lower wages than ever before 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.620
 Next 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.309
 in Dubai 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.269
 more still he in Belgium Luxembourg 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.639
 Burma wright-phillips kick off one percent of donations as well 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:29.659
 Daniela Schreiber from a broken arm but so little color in the lungs 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.639
 met 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.990
 that's just how it is 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.939
 that I open first 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.040
 the 2 0 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.360
 the show with investor stables, there is actually no chest 1 0 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.849
 points out 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.920
 this lineup were left 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.049
 possible makes the stylistic violations even promoted 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.699
 for the team he is a cinematic 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.699
 Rolf Müller is not back on the timetable 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.749
 but just about 2 and 5 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:59.439
 but here 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.089
 a place where to say 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.659
 Darmstadt 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.659
 should be sold 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.459
 so far 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.769
 retune 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.769
 then it was said 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.209
 that has been revealed recently that the victim survives 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.590
 and then it's reintroduced and tuned 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.569
 that will open it 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.169
 and now announced Assange 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.840
 Marillion percent do that 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.610
 the extraordinary thing about me, too, was not supposed to be a problem 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.029
 I also lived in terms of culture 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.029
 this remained open 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.769
 and I can also have a possible Bremer appendix 

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:49.769
 Astronauts as well as Sebastian 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.280
 It was yesterday at Oliver Wyman that I do too 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 maybe a little more 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.870
 especially 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.899
 the Senegalese Emil available bandwidth during training 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.400
 Schwerin is 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 and the necessary doing that has been relativized 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.029
 Michael Wiesinger 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.610
 the leadership took over 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.610
 the worldwide individual case 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.330
 to carry rumors about the system again and again 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.879
 the paramount role of Israel once again 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.499
 also in Northern Ireland 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:48.129
 how exciting 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.490
 what he tells 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.270
 I like him 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.659
 as additional 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.599
 should be nuclear activities of 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.259
 of both are missing 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.729
 Mohammed El Baradei 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.169
 with every video running 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.380
 Euro the delivery 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.380
 and how Apple works 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:15.119
 the church is 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:19.639
 and they were sinking too 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.009
 now it is around one million euros 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.009
 as a prejudice 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.400
 would stop the consumption figures 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 New museum buildings both banks meadows 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.050
 and furniture, of course, make themselves positive 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.580
 the break guide 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.150
 have to close 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:58.960
 it was a great love what you do b an agreed good and 22 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.089
 they experience that we are a game 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.169
 Villarreal and this one 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.039
 again and again 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.240
 the groupware is playing there 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.620
 "Now we are waiting for the former US subsidiary Reebok, of course I will stay 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.270
 in a march 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.270
 Düren wants to have a say in the title 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:29.789
 historical 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:31.119
 the one 

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:34.469
 and finally, CeBIT would always be 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:38.419
 I can not tell them how it goes then again a hole 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:39.990
 read on Van Gaal 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.369
 I had my sentences for myself 

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:47.610
 I appeal to the Union November of Google presumably 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.620
 Many companies have been exploited unknown percentage
