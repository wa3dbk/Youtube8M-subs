the<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.890> boost<00:01:32.159> from<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.700> flash<00:01:32.880> fire<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.450> go

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the the boost from the flash fire so go

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480 
the the boost from the flash fire so go
to<00:01:33.900> poopit<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.890> easily<00:01:35.040> set<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.400> my

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
to poopit are I can easily set up my

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.569 
to poopit are I can easily set up my
rocks<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.920> by<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> facts

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
rocks now and I think just by the facts

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.520 
rocks now and I think just by the facts
which<00:01:38.790> doubt<00:01:39.060> he's<00:01:39.240> probably<00:01:39.450> choice<00:01:39.840> not

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
which doubt he's probably choice not

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
which doubt he's probably choice not
quite<00:01:40.710> sure<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.189> he<00:01:41.610> could<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.790> choice<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
quite sure but he could be choice I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.929 
quite sure but he could be choice I
don't<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.630> might<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.259> whatever<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:44.759> I'm

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
don't know might not be whatever but I'm

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.999 
don't know might not be whatever but I'm
gonna<00:01:45.119> predict<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> earthquake<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.380> opposed

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
gonna predict the earthquake as opposed

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.770 
gonna predict the earthquake as opposed
to<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> wood<00:01:47.430> hammer<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.030> thought<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.659> he

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to the wood hammer I thought that he

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
to the wood hammer I thought that he
would<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> more<00:01:49.290> defensive<00:01:50.040> torterra<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
would be a more defensive torterra and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
would be a more defensive torterra and
he<00:01:51.720> actually<00:01:51.840> goes<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.290> wood<00:01:52.409> hammer

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
he actually goes for the wood hammer

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.080 
he actually goes for the wood hammer
obviously<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.159> four<00:01:53.310> times<00:01:53.460> effective<00:01:53.970> on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
obviously it's four times effective on

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.899 
obviously it's four times effective on
puter<00:01:54.509> his<00:01:54.780> poopit<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:56.070> dark<00:01:56.369> rock<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
puter his poopit are is not dark rock is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.819 
puter his poopit are is not dark rock is
in<00:01:57.030> fact<00:01:57.299> ground<00:01:57.659> rocks<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.770> go

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
in fact ground rocks so there you go

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.760 
in fact ground rocks so there you go

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
but when it does work it works really

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.710

from<00:03:17.240> this<00:03:17.330> gorebyss<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.410> i<00:03:18.440> was<00:03:18.650> thinking

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
from this gorebyss but i was thinking

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.500 
from this gorebyss but i was thinking
that<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:19.250> he<00:03:19.370> switches<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.820> in<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.300> take<00:03:20.480> a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
that if he switches it in to take a

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.390 
that if he switches it in to take a
waterfall<00:03:21.050> then<00:03:21.230> he's<00:03:21.380> gonna<00:03:21.500> take<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> crunch

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
waterfall then he's gonna take a crunch

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.610 
waterfall then he's gonna take a crunch
afterwards<00:03:23.180> when<00:03:23.870> built<00:03:24.050> our<00:03:24.230> speed<00:03:24.500> me

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
afterwards when built our speed me

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.110 
afterwards when built our speed me
obviously<00:03:24.770> cuz<00:03:25.070> I'm<00:03:25.160> faster<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:25.760> he<00:03:25.850> doesn't

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
obviously cuz I'm faster so he doesn't

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.940 
obviously cuz I'm faster so he doesn't
want<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.300> take<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.630> hit<00:03:26.840> prefers<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.620> only<00:03:27.740> take

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
still so not an issue for me i'm just

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.920 
still so not an issue for me i'm just
going<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:09.950> go<00:04:10.070> into<00:04:10.220> my<00:04:10.460> 247<00:04:11.300> take<00:04:11.660> the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
going to go into my 247 take the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.920 
going to go into my 247 take the
megahorn<00:04:12.380> here<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:14.420> actually<00:04:14.600> does<00:04:14.900> a

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
megahorn here and it actually does a

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.960 
megahorn here and it actually does a
decent<00:04:15.200> decent<00:04:15.530> chunk<00:04:15.920> so<00:04:16.250> I'm<00:04:16.400> thinking<00:04:16.820> he's

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
decent decent chunk so I'm thinking he's

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.940 
decent decent chunk so I'm thinking he's
probably<00:04:17.359> bandage<00:04:18.140> judging<00:04:18.590> by<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.770> fact

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
probably bandage judging by the fact

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.550 
probably bandage judging by the fact
he's<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.220> more<00:04:19.880> physically<00:04:20.560> physically

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
he's a more physically physically

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.730 
he's a more physically physically
running<00:04:22.160> rapid<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.820> guess<00:04:23.000> all<00:04:23.180> rap

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
running rapid I guess all rap

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.290 
running rapid I guess all rap
physical<00:04:24.160> really<00:04:24.520> i<00:04:24.550> didn't<00:04:25.060> really<00:04:25.150> know

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
physical really i didn't really know

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.460 
physical really i didn't really know
what<00:04:25.330> starts<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.900> but<00:04:26.050> I'm<00:04:26.110> gonna<00:04:26.199> go<00:04:26.349> for

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
what starts like but I'm gonna go for

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.620 
what starts like but I'm gonna go for
the<00:04:26.530> earthquake<00:04:26.979> I<00:04:27.220> don't<00:04:27.789> expect<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.419> take

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
the earthquake I don't expect it to take

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.409 
the earthquake I don't expect it to take
it<00:04:28.780> out<00:04:28.930> but<00:04:29.650> i<00:04:30.009> guess<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.699> because<00:04:31.030> poopit

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
it out but i guess that because poopit

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.330 
it out but i guess that because poopit
are<00:04:31.539> gets<00:04:31.900> stabbed<00:04:32.259> on<00:04:32.470> earthquake<00:04:32.949> unlike

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
are gets stabbed on earthquake unlike
