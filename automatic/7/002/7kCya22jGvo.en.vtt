red<00:00:02.429> nova<00:00:02.730> resonator<00:00:03.210> deck<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:04.259> deck<00:00:04.500> was

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
red nova resonator deck this deck was

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.000 
red nova resonator deck this deck was
requested<00:00:05.490> by<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.670> config<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.740> idea

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
requested by the config so the idea

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.129 
requested by the config so the idea
behind<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.580> type<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.970> deck<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.630> basically

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
behind this type of deck is basically

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.680 
behind this type of deck is basically
use<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.650> resonators<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.490> other<00:00:12.210> similar

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
use the resonators and other similar

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.589 
use the resonators and other similar
type<00:00:12.870> cards<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.710> stall<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.450> bring<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.570> red

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
type cards to stall and bring out red

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.170

Nova Archfiend and a red dragon
archfiend<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.630> then<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> use<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.500> other

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
archfiend and then you use the other

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.439 
archfiend and then you use the other
tuners<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.250> summon<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.609> red<00:00:20.760> Nova<00:00:21.000> dragon

which is a howl that it makes the deck
very<00:00:23.939> very<00:00:24.119> powerful<00:00:24.539> because<00:00:24.660> he's<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> very

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
very very powerful because he's a very

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080

most in a lot of decks but in this deck
in<00:00:52.199> particular<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:53.010> having<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.699> level<00:00:53.940> one

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
in particular because having a level one

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.790 
in particular because having a level one

the tuners in the graveyard and you're

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.190

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.810 
gonna have a ton of tuners in the
graveyard<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:32.770> usually<00:03:33.340> it'll<00:03:33.430> have<00:03:33.580> over

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
graveyard so usually it'll have over

spells traps or monsters has to be

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.470 
spells traps or monsters has to be
bounced<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:38.830> balanced<00:03:39.820> or<00:03:39.910> banished

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
bounced so balanced or banished

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.960 
bounced so balanced or banished
also<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.440> can<00:03:41.770> um<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.250> gate<00:03:42.400> attack<00:03:42.700> so

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
also you can um the gate attack so

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.820 
also you can um the gate attack so
really<00:03:43.450> really<00:03:43.570> powerful<00:03:43.810> card<00:03:44.320> very<00:03:44.530> hard<00:03:44.740> to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
really really powerful card very hard to

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.920 
really really powerful card very hard to
deal<00:03:44.980> with<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.370> then<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.210> fusions<00:03:46.540> you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
deal with and then just the fusions you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.850 
deal with and then just the fusions you
can<00:03:47.050> use<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.350> know<00:03:47.440> whatever<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:47.830> want

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
can use you know whatever you want

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.980 
can use you know whatever you want
that's<00:03:48.160> like<00:03:48.370> five<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.820> four-star<00:03:49.000> using<00:03:49.870> two

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
that's like five and four-star using two

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.780 
that's like five and four-star using two
five<00:03:50.200> zero<00:03:50.230> one<00:03:50.440> four<00:03:50.740> so<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.220> picked<00:03:51.490> o-jama

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
five zero one four so I picked o-jama

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.880 
five zero one four so I picked o-jama
Knight<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.510> dark<00:03:52.780> fire<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.470> know<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.710> up<00:03:53.770> to

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
Knight and dark fire you know it's up to

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.350 
Knight and dark fire you know it's up to
you<00:03:53.980> which<00:03:54.130> ones<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.430> want<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.640> use<00:03:54.820> if<00:03:55.030> you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
you which ones you want to use if you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.910 
you which ones you want to use if you
run<00:03:55.510> no<00:03:55.630> gem<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.200> can<00:03:56.350> run<00:03:56.470> cards<00:03:56.800> like

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
run no gem in it you can run cards like

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.950 
run no gem in it you can run cards like
go<00:03:57.100> ship<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.520> I'll<00:03:57.580> talk<00:03:57.760> about<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.900> a

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
go ship and I'll talk about that in a

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.070 
go ship and I'll talk about that in a
little<00:03:59.080> bit<00:03:59.340> but<00:04:00.340> yeah<00:04:00.760> very<00:04:00.820> nice<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.810> allow

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
little bit but yeah very nice to allow

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080 
little bit but yeah very nice to allow
those<00:04:02.320> synchro<00:04:02.740> summons<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.280> then<00:04:03.820> just<00:04:04.000> a

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
those synchro summons and then just a

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.270 
those synchro summons and then just a
few<00:04:04.120> X<00:04:04.540> Y<00:04:04.720> Z's<00:04:04.990> you<00:04:05.650> have<00:04:05.800> a<00:04:05.830> good<00:04:06.040> amount<00:04:06.250> of

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
few X Y Z's you have a good amount of

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.160 
few X Y Z's you have a good amount of
level<00:04:06.490> three<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.030> not<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> bad<00:04:07.570> idea<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.960> put<00:04:08.020> a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
level three so not a bad idea to put a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.350 
level three so not a bad idea to put a
few<00:04:08.410> three-star<00:04:08.860> X<00:04:09.040> Y<00:04:09.190> Z's<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.520> here<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.850> just

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
few three-star X Y Z's in here I just

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.790 
few three-star X Y Z's in here I just
have<00:04:10.480> one<00:04:10.630> zenmaines<00:04:11.080> I<00:04:11.320> don't<00:04:11.440> have<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.590> lot<00:04:11.680> of

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
have one zenmaines I don't have a lot of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.650 
have one zenmaines I don't have a lot of
room<00:04:11.950> in<00:04:12.040> this<00:04:12.160> Extra<00:04:12.520> Deck<00:04:12.550> I'll<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.450> also

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
room in this Extra Deck I'll you also

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.000 
room in this Extra Deck I'll you also
have<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:13.930> lot<00:04:14.080> of<00:04:14.170> ability<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.530> get<00:04:14.740> out<00:04:14.830> five

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
have a lot of ability to get out five

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.400 
have a lot of ability to get out five
stars<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.820> putting<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.239> five<00:04:16.420> star<00:04:16.690> X<00:04:16.870> Y<00:04:17.020> Z's<00:04:17.260> is

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
stars so putting in five star X Y Z's is

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.289 
stars so putting in five star X Y Z's is
a<00:04:17.440> really<00:04:17.710> good<00:04:17.830> idea<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.280> volcasaurus<00:04:18.640> and

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
a really good idea like volcasaurus and

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.650 
a really good idea like volcasaurus and
teres<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.560> now<00:04:20.680> for<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.920> side<00:04:21.100> back<00:04:21.310> side<00:04:21.940> X<00:04:22.540> in

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
teres so now for the side back side X in

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.330 
teres so now for the side back side X in
my<00:04:22.780> videos<00:04:23.080> are<00:04:23.410> just<00:04:23.440> recommended<00:04:24.070> cards

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
my videos are just recommended cards

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
my videos are just recommended cards
that<00:04:24.490> can<00:04:24.610> also<00:04:24.730> work<00:04:24.850> when<00:04:25.120> you're<00:04:25.210> building

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
that can also work when you're building

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.879 
that can also work when you're building
the<00:04:25.570> deck<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.960> isn't<00:04:26.350> necessarily

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
the deck it isn't necessarily

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.959 
the deck it isn't necessarily
saitec<00:04:27.159> for<00:04:27.460> matches<00:04:28.409> so<00:04:29.409> first<00:04:29.650> off<00:04:29.969> there

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
saitec for matches so first off there

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.369 
saitec for matches so first off there
are<00:04:31.060> other<00:04:31.180> resonators<00:04:31.749> you<00:04:31.840> can<00:04:31.990> use<00:04:32.139> but

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
are other resonators you can use but

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.170 
are other resonators you can use but
most<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.770> them<00:04:32.919> I<00:04:32.949> don't<00:04:33.129> really<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.550> first

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
most of them I don't really like first

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.700 
most of them I don't really like first
resonators<00:04:34.780> one<00:04:35.020> that's<00:04:35.229> actually<00:04:35.379> pretty

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
resonators one that's actually pretty

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.589 
resonators one that's actually pretty
interesting<00:04:35.979> because<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:36.550> two-star<00:04:37.029> so

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
interesting because it's two-star so

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.409 
interesting because it's two-star so
that<00:04:38.199> allows<00:04:38.439> you<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:38.710> use<00:04:38.919> him<00:04:39.610> with<00:04:39.789> got<00:04:40.270> like

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
that allows you to use him with got like

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.659 
that allows you to use him with got like
Kree<00:04:40.659> bones<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.620> can<00:04:41.860> make<00:04:41.949> up<00:04:42.129> red<00:04:42.340> nova

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
Kree bones so that can make up red nova

really a big deal in taipa deck I'm
running<00:06:05.680> double<00:06:06.580> summon<00:06:06.849> can<00:06:07.029> be<00:06:07.120> really

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
running double summon can be really

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.629 
running double summon can be really
useful<00:06:07.689> for<00:06:07.719> getting<00:06:08.020> out<00:06:08.289> red<00:06:09.099> nova<00:06:09.129> quicker

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
useful for getting out red nova quicker

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.579 
useful for getting out red nova quicker
so<00:06:09.879> that's<00:06:10.029> an<00:06:10.120> alternative<00:06:10.539> in<00:06:10.960> a<00:06:11.289> synchro

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
so that's an alternative in a synchro

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:12.869 
so that's an alternative in a synchro
based<00:06:11.770> deck<00:06:11.949> mind<00:06:12.189> control<00:06:12.460> can<00:06:12.610> always<00:06:12.789> be

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
based deck mind control can always be

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.159 
based deck mind control can always be
really<00:06:13.060> good<00:06:13.270> i<00:06:13.300> really<00:06:13.629> wanted<00:06:13.839> to<00:06:13.899> put<00:06:14.080> this

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
really good i really wanted to put this

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.950 
really good i really wanted to put this
in<00:06:14.289> this<00:06:14.409> deck<00:06:14.649> but<00:06:15.279> i<00:06:16.180> just<00:06:16.569> didn't<00:06:16.779> happen

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
in this deck but i just didn't happen

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.809 
in this deck but i just didn't happen
the<00:06:17.529> bad<00:06:17.680> thing<00:06:17.889> is<00:06:17.949> if<00:06:18.099> you<00:06:18.189> if<00:06:18.430> you<00:06:18.550> don't<00:06:18.669> get

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
the bad thing is if you if you don't get

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.670 
the bad thing is if you if you don't get
a<00:06:18.879> tuner<00:06:19.300> with<00:06:19.449> mind<00:06:19.659> control<00:06:19.750> it<00:06:20.500> could<00:06:20.620> be

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
a tuner with mind control it could be

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.649 
a tuner with mind control it could be
kind<00:06:20.860> of<00:06:20.919> difficult<00:06:21.370> so<00:06:21.580> there's<00:06:22.330> also<00:06:22.449> some

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
kind of difficult so there's also some

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.689 
kind of difficult so there's also some
draw<00:06:22.870> power<00:06:23.080> like<00:06:23.500> red<00:06:23.680> dragon<00:06:24.009> vase<00:06:24.159> is<00:06:24.520> an

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
interesting one you can do just to you

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.769 
interesting one you can do just to you
know<00:06:26.830> get<00:06:27.069> some<00:06:27.099> draw<00:06:27.430> power<00:06:27.639> um<00:06:27.909> not

currently<00:06:29.110> my<00:06:29.289> big<00:06:30.009> importance<00:06:30.460> in<00:06:30.580> this<00:06:30.699> deck

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879 
currently my big importance in this deck

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.550 
currently my big importance in this deck
being<00:06:31.120> able<00:06:31.210> to<00:06:31.300> get<00:06:31.419> more<00:06:31.599> cards<00:06:31.899> hoping<00:06:32.379> to

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
being able to get more cards hoping to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.320 
being able to get more cards hoping to
use<00:06:33.009> my<00:06:33.159> opening<00:06:33.460> hand<00:06:33.699> to<00:06:33.789> do<00:06:33.879> enough<00:06:34.120> but

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
use my opening hand to do enough but

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.149 
use my opening hand to do enough but
that's<00:06:34.479> an<00:06:34.569> interesting<00:06:34.959> choice<00:06:35.139> and<00:06:35.440> one<00:06:36.069> of

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
that's an interesting choice and one of

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.399 
that's an interesting choice and one of
the<00:06:36.250> other<00:06:36.339> supports<00:06:37.180> for<00:06:37.449> resonators<00:06:38.019> is<00:06:38.169> red

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
the other supports for resonators is red

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.740 
the other supports for resonators is red
screen<00:06:38.800> which<00:06:39.729> is<00:06:39.879> an<00:06:40.000> interesting<00:06:40.269> will

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
screen which is an interesting will

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.900 
screen which is an interesting will
it<00:06:41.440> cost<00:06:41.650> a<00:06:41.770> lot<00:06:41.860> of<00:06:41.920> Life<00:06:42.100> Points<00:06:42.310> to<00:06:42.550> maintain

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
it cost a lot of Life Points to maintain

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.540 
it cost a lot of Life Points to maintain
and<00:06:43.150> you<00:06:43.210> can<00:06:43.330> also<00:06:43.950> special<00:06:44.950> summon<00:06:45.190> level<00:06:45.280> 1

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
and you can also special summon level 1

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.880 
and you can also special summon level 1
tuner<00:06:45.850> so<00:06:46.090> it's<00:06:46.870> a<00:06:46.990> really<00:06:47.170> interesting<00:06:47.410> card

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
tuner so it's a really interesting card

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.160

I<00:06:48.490> definitely<00:06:49.330> can<00:06:49.420> see<00:06:49.450> it<00:06:49.660> running<00:06:49.870> some

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
I definitely can see it running some

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.770 
I definitely can see it running some
decks<00:06:50.410> but<00:06:50.590> I'm<00:06:50.740> not<00:06:50.890> a<00:06:50.950> big<00:06:51.280> fan<00:06:51.430> of<00:06:51.490> it<00:06:51.760> a<00:06:51.910> lot

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
decks but I'm not a big fan of it a lot

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.090 
decks but I'm not a big fan of it a lot
of<00:06:52.900> Life<00:06:53.020> Points<00:06:53.230> you'll<00:06:53.440> start<00:06:53.680> adding<00:06:54.010> up

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
of Life Points you'll start adding up

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.670 
of Life Points you'll start adding up
with<00:06:54.220> cards<00:06:54.430> like<00:06:54.490> this<00:06:55.020> so<00:06:56.020> that's<00:06:56.110> why<00:06:56.290> red

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
with cards like this so that's why red

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.740 
with cards like this so that's why red
Nova<00:06:56.920> resonator<00:06:57.310> deck<00:06:57.520> pretty<00:06:58.210> fun<00:06:58.420> I'm<00:06:58.600> not

Nova resonator deck pretty fun I'm not

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.690 
Nova resonator deck pretty fun I'm not
sure<00:06:58.930> how<00:06:59.080> competitive<00:06:59.410> it<00:06:59.740> can<00:06:59.860> be<00:07:00.010> but<00:07:00.580> it

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
sure how competitive it can be but it

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.100
