00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
sharp shooting pain down my legs I did

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.300 
sharp shooting pain down my legs I did
not<00:00:27.869> sleep<00:00:28.140> through<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> night<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.099> for

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
not sleep through the night that for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.010 
not sleep through the night that for
probably<00:00:29.730> two<00:00:29.910> years<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.650> sciatica<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.309> was

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
probably two years the sciatica was was

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.049 
probably two years the sciatica was was
really<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.649> difficult<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.550> pain

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
really really really difficult the pain

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.380 
really really really difficult the pain
was<00:00:36.270> constant<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:38.010> sitting<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:38.969> really

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
was constant they the sitting was really

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.720

really bad and I think what most people
don't<00:00:41.850> understand<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.600> how<00:00:42.809> irritable<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
don't understand is how irritable you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
don't understand is how irritable you
are<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:43.980> you're<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.700> pain<00:00:44.910> so

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
fusions I do I do you think that you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.380 
fusions I do I do you think that you
have<00:01:28.920> more<00:01:29.100> mobility<00:01:29.280> than<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
have more mobility than they do do you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.109 
have more mobility than they do do you
think<00:01:30.659> absolutely<00:01:31.530> no<00:01:32.009> there's<00:01:32.220> no<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:33.000> me

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
think absolutely no there's no for me

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.149 
think absolutely no there's no for me
there's<00:01:33.360> no<00:01:33.479> question<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.409> think

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
there's no question about it I think

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
there's no question about it I think
from<00:01:35.640> from<00:01:36.360> people<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.689> I've<00:01:36.810> spoken<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560 
from from people that I've spoken to
with<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> fusion<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.759> limitations<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
with the fusion there is limitations to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.050 
with the fusion there is limitations to
what<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.610> don't<00:01:41.909> feel

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
what they can do and I don't feel

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.340 
what they can do and I don't feel
there's<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> limitation<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.259> do

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
there's a limitation to what I can do

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.649 
there's a limitation to what I can do
today<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.430> recommend<00:01:44.850> Co<00:01:45.000> flex<00:01:45.240> surgery

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
today I would recommend Co flex surgery

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
today I would recommend Co flex surgery
to<00:01:46.380> anyone<00:01:46.799> who<00:01:46.920> has<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> same<00:01:47.490> type<00:01:47.759> of
