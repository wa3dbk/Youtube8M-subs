fairies how they go for it at certain

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.259 
fairies how they go for it at certain
percents<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.370> fail<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.670> breast<00:02:27.120> it

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
percents and they fail to breast it

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.440 
percents and they fail to breast it
before<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.720> fair<00:02:27.870> comes<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:28.290> yes<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.450> it

before the fair comes out yes is it
usually<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.050> because<00:02:31.200> they're<00:02:31.590> too<00:02:31.769> slow<00:02:32.070> one

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
usually is because they're too slow one

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.949 
usually is because they're too slow one
thing<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.519> they<00:02:32.730> forget<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.090> Jigglypuff<00:02:33.750> is

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
thing that they forget is Jigglypuff is

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.570 
thing that they forget is Jigglypuff is
one<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.380> lightest<00:02:34.890> weight<00:02:35.040> characters<00:02:35.489> in

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
one of the lightest weight characters in

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.550 
one of the lightest weight characters in
the<00:02:35.670> game<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.570> soon<00:02:36.720> as<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.989> throw<00:02:37.230> her<00:02:37.380> you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the game so as soon as you throw her you

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.550 
the game so as soon as you throw her you
can<00:02:37.739> move<00:02:38.070> pretty<00:02:38.519> much<00:02:38.700> immediately<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.750> lot

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
can move pretty much immediately a lot

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.259 
can move pretty much immediately a lot
of<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.830> gets<00:02:40.980> lost<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.459> translation<00:02:41.489> alike

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
of that gets lost in translation alike

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.900 
of that gets lost in translation alike
so<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:43.410> was<00:02:43.590> guaranteed<00:02:44.100> he<00:02:44.310> didn't<00:02:44.700> do<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
so that was guaranteed he didn't do the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.030 
so that was guaranteed he didn't do the
turn<00:02:45.060> hunky<00:02:45.959> box<00:02:46.140> actually<00:02:46.350> knows<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.800> best

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
turn hunky box actually knows the best

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.370 
turn hunky box actually knows the best
angle<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.640> di<00:02:47.880> on<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.450> down<00:02:48.900> throw<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.290> it's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
angle to di on a down throw and it's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.710 
angle to di on a down throw and it's
slightly<00:02:49.800> behind<00:02:49.950> doc<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> hardest

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
slightly behind doc that is the hardest

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.090 
slightly behind doc that is the hardest
angle<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.260> dunk<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:54.810> um<00:02:55.019> actually<00:02:55.560> lost<00:02:55.920> track

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
angle to dunk but um actually lost track

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.060 
angle to dunk but um actually lost track
of<00:02:56.190> where<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.459> was<00:02:57.170> before<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.590> ko<00:02:58.860> well

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
of where I was before that ko well

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.979 
of where I was before that ko well
there's<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.000> lot<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.330> stuff<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.780> happen

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
there's a lot of stuff that can happen

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.030 
there's a lot of stuff that can happen
in<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.230> match<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:01.470> I'm<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:01.830> throwing

in this match but I'm not throwing

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.979 
in this match but I'm not throwing
numbers<00:03:02.310> out<00:03:02.519> there<00:03:02.580> I'll<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.940> go<00:03:03.120> ballpark

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
numbers out there I'll just go ballpark

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.949 
numbers out there I'll just go ballpark
figures<00:03:04.410> okay<00:03:05.239> with<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.360> being<00:03:06.570> said<00:03:06.690> it's
