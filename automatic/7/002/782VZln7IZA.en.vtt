00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
weight around the middle that means you

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.410 
weight around the middle that means you
can<00:03:11.980> be<00:03:12.069> a<00:03:12.100> darker<00:03:12.519> colors<00:03:12.760> up<00:03:12.880> on<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> top<00:03:13.269> and
