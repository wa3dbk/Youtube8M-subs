the side of the building a little bit
different<00:00:46.770> than<00:00:46.890> most<00:00:47.100> houses<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:48.270> that's

different than most houses but that's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.529 
different than most houses but that's

our basket filter has a filter inside of
it<00:00:51.660> I'll<00:00:51.840> show<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.500> minute<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it I'll show you that in a minute and a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
it I'll show you that in a minute and a
diverter<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> top<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:54.960> made<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
diverter at the top that's made out of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
diverter at the top that's made out of
flashing<00:00:56.129> aluminum<00:00:56.579> flashing<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.870> what

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
flashing aluminum flashing because what

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.330 
flashing aluminum flashing because what
we<00:00:58.140> find<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.530> during<00:00:58.770> big<00:00:58.949> rains<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
we find is during big rains that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.889 
we find is during big rains that
overshoots<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.629> basket<00:01:01.260> over<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> water

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
overshoots that basket over so the water

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.250 
overshoots that basket over so the water
flows<00:01:03.989> along<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.760> we've<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> good

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
flows along here and we've got the good

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
flows along here and we've got the good
three<00:01:08.100> inch<00:01:08.250> pipe<00:01:08.310> straps<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> side<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
three inch pipe straps on the side and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.940 
three inch pipe straps on the side and
we<00:01:10.350> use<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.920> type<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.369> PVC<00:01:12.260> piping<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.770> not

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
we use a type of PVC piping that is not

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
we use a type of PVC piping that is not
intended<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.729> pressure<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.780> cheaper<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
intended for pressure it's cheaper and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
intended for pressure it's cheaper and
there's<00:01:17.189> no<00:01:17.310> reason<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> use<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> schedule<00:01:18.479> 40

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
there's no reason to use the schedule 40

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
there's no reason to use the schedule 40
pressure<00:01:19.020> pipe<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.700> drain

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
pressure pipe this is actually drain

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.380 
pressure pipe this is actually drain
pipe<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.259> meant<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.650> pressure

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
pipe that is not meant for pressure

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.899 
pipe that is not meant for pressure
comes<00:01:24.390> down<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> rubber

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
comes down to this this is a rubber

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.999 
comes down to this this is a rubber
sleeve<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.810> makes<00:01:27.960> installation<00:01:28.680> easier

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
sleeve it just makes installation easier

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.319 
sleeve it just makes installation easier
because<00:01:29.280> everything<00:01:29.820> doesn't<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> be

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
because everything doesn't have to be

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
because everything doesn't have to be
properly<00:01:30.630> aligned<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> ever<00:01:32.040> were

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
properly aligned and if you ever were

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
properly aligned and if you ever were
needing<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.299> take<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.659> whole<00:01:33.720> unit<00:01:34.290> off

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
needing have to take this whole unit off

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.859 
needing have to take this whole unit off
the<00:01:34.650> wall<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.549> lot<00:01:35.670> easier<00:01:35.880> because<00:01:36.600> if

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the wall it's a lot easier because if

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.590 
the wall it's a lot easier because if
this<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.259> hard<00:01:37.500> plumbed<00:01:37.829> into<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.310> tank<00:01:38.600> it'd

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
this was hard plumbed into the tank it'd

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
this was hard plumbed into the tank it'd
be<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> lot<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.020> difficult<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.009> if

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
be a lot more difficult so this way if

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
be a lot more difficult so this way if
we<00:01:41.250> need<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> change<00:01:41.520> things<00:01:41.939> around<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.450> take

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
we need to change things around we take

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.510 
we need to change things around we take
this<00:01:42.780> off<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.710> whole<00:01:43.829> thing<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> come<00:01:44.369> off

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
this off and the whole thing to come off

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.480 
this off and the whole thing to come off
the<00:01:44.670> wall<00:01:44.700> after<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> straps<00:01:45.930> off

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
the wall after you take the straps off

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
the wall after you take the straps off
you'll<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.579> another<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> we've<00:01:48.840> used

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you'll see another thing that we've used

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.800 
you'll see another thing that we've used
here<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> three-inch<00:01:50.430> neoprene<00:01:50.909> gasket<00:01:51.240> on

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
here is a three-inch neoprene gasket on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
here is a three-inch neoprene gasket on
the<00:01:51.990> side<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> Tanic<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.220> cut<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> hole

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the side of the Tanic we cut the hole

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
the side of the Tanic we cut the hole
out<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.180> tank<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.689> bit<00:01:54.899> bigger<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
out in the tank a little bit bigger and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.010 
out in the tank a little bit bigger and
it's<00:01:55.860> neoprene<00:01:56.189> gasket<00:01:56.490> allows<00:01:57.090> us<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it's neoprene gasket allows us to have a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.209 
it's neoprene gasket allows us to have a
nice<00:01:58.170> tight<00:01:58.439> fit<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:58.979> prevent

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
nice tight fit that will prevent

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.810 
nice tight fit that will prevent
mosquitoes<00:01:59.810> this<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> overflow<00:02:01.820> that's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
mosquitoes this is the overflow that's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.149 
mosquitoes this is the overflow that's
the<00:02:03.090> same<00:02:03.299> size<00:02:03.509> three<00:02:03.990> inches<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.799> inlet

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
the same size three inches as the inlet

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.089 
the same size three inches as the inlet
pipe<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.299> travels<00:02:06.930> along<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.710> wall

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
pipe and that travels along the wall

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.600 
pipe and that travels along the wall
this<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.520> temporary<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
this is temporary and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.730 
this is temporary and
so<00:02:09.729> we<00:02:10.000> get<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.300> better<00:02:10.509> solution<00:02:11.170> for<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.470> and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
so we get a better solution for this and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.430 
so we get a better solution for this and
this<00:02:12.220> goes<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.910> existing<00:02:13.060> drain<00:02:13.510> that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
this goes in to the existing drain that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.680 
this goes in to the existing drain that
came<00:02:14.740> off<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:14.950> roof<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.630> they<00:02:16.630> were

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
came off the roof and they were

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.300 
came off the roof and they were
eventually<00:02:16.990> going<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.860> fall<00:02:18.130> out

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
eventually going to have this fall out

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.880 
eventually going to have this fall out
to<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.790> rain<00:02:19.300> garden<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.350> see<00:02:20.590> how<00:02:20.830> that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
to a rain garden you can see how that

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.150 
to a rain garden you can see how that
works<00:02:21.640> I'll<00:02:22.360> give<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.990> view<00:02:23.320> inside<00:02:24.100> the

gallon captured for every square foot of
roof<00:02:54.880> area<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.989> get<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.530> one<00:02:57.130> inch<00:02:57.340> rain<00:02:57.700> on

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
roof area if you get a one inch rain on

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.750 
roof area if you get a one inch rain on
a<00:02:58.600> one<00:02:59.050> square<00:02:59.350> foot<00:02:59.709> roof<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.400> will<00:03:00.489> capture

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
a one square foot roof you will capture

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240 
a one square foot roof you will capture
half<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.300> gallon<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.350> figured<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.739> we<00:03:02.920> can

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
half a gallon so we figured that we can

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.470 
half a gallon so we figured that we can
capture<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:06.190> inch<00:03:06.370> range<00:03:06.670> with<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.209> tank

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
capture to one inch range with this tank

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.580 
capture to one inch range with this tank
and<00:03:07.750> they<00:03:07.840> do<00:03:07.900> need<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.260> water

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and they do need the water

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.150 
and they do need the water
I<00:03:08.890> mentioned<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.850> pump<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:12.930> leader

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
I mentioned the pump this is a leader

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.890 
I mentioned the pump this is a leader
pump<00:03:15.160> I'm<00:03:15.549> not<00:03:15.760> sure<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.090> focusing<00:03:16.720> well

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
pump I'm not sure this is focusing well

per<00:03:44.440> minute<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.209> real<00:03:46.420> nice<00:03:46.540> pump<00:03:46.840> it

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
per minute so that is real nice pump it

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.680 
per minute so that is real nice pump it
has<00:03:47.110> an<00:03:47.230> integrated<00:03:47.700> run<00:03:48.700> dry<00:03:48.940> switch<00:03:49.330> and

has an integrated run dry switch and
also<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.989> pressure<00:03:50.290> switch<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:51.580> what<00:03:52.120> that

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
also a pressure switch so what that

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.910 
also a pressure switch so what that
means<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:53.019> leave<00:03:53.200> your<00:03:53.470> hose<00:03:53.680> hooked

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
means is you can leave your hose hooked

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.729 
means is you can leave your hose hooked
up<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.400> tank<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.930> just<00:03:55.930> turn<00:03:56.140> on<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.530> end

up to the tank and just turn on the end
I'll<00:03:57.160> show<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.610> pressure<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.510> we<00:03:58.630> get

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
I'll show you the pressure that we get

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.789 
I'll show you the pressure that we get
off<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.140> system<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:01.390> can<00:04:01.540> see<00:04:01.739> now<00:04:02.739> you

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
off this system and you can see now you

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.770 
off this system and you can see now you
can<00:04:02.950> hear<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.160> pump<00:04:03.280> running<00:04:03.549> too<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.450> gives

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
can hear the pump running too that gives

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.890 
can hear the pump running too that gives
us<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.260> nice<00:04:05.440> pressure<00:04:05.769> when<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.310> release<00:04:06.640> it

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
us a nice pressure when you release it

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.569 
us a nice pressure when you release it
of<00:04:08.230> course<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.560> pump<00:04:08.769> senses<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.400> needs

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
of course the pump senses that it needs

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.850 
of course the pump senses that it needs
pressure<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.690> will<00:04:10.720> apply<00:04:11.200> pressure<00:04:11.530> and

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
pressure and it will apply pressure and

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.850 
pressure and it will apply pressure and
then<00:04:12.400> after<00:04:12.910> you<00:04:13.329> stop<00:04:13.540> using<00:04:13.780> it<00:04:14.049> it<00:04:14.500> will

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
then after you stop using it it will

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.200 
then after you stop using it it will
turn<00:04:15.700> off<00:04:15.850> because<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.419> has

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.210 
turn off because it has

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.730 
turn off because it has
here<00:04:18.210> we<00:04:18.360> can<00:04:18.510> run<00:04:18.630> both<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.990> these<00:04:19.110> faucets<00:04:19.410> at

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:19.740 
here we can run both of these faucets at

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.600 
here we can run both of these faucets at
once<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:21.360> works<00:04:21.600> real<00:04:22.410> well<00:04:22.470> skin<00:04:23.430> that's

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
once and it works real well skin that's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.120 
once and it works real well skin that's
a<00:04:23.700> hundred<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.570> fifty<00:04:24.900> feet<00:04:25.080> ahead<00:04:25.230> three
