ears here going down and plugging in
there<00:01:06.509> for<00:01:06.750> some<00:01:06.930> reason<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:08.130> looks

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
there for some reason the back looks

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
there for some reason the back looks
like<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.000> Lizzie<00:01:09.299> nuff<00:01:09.479> said<00:01:09.720> very<00:01:10.020> similar

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.260 
but right here up at the top that's
where<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> actual<00:01:13.610> antenna<00:01:14.610> terminal<00:01:15.150> was<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
where the actual antenna terminal was a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
where the actual antenna terminal was a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
rat and now then with that everything

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.069 
rat and now then with that everything
else<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.610> damn<00:01:18.090> accurate<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.899> back

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
else is really damn accurate in the back

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.539 
else is really damn accurate in the back
