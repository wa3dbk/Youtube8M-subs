Tuna challenge and today it's all about

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.790 
Tuna challenge and today it's all about
the<00:00:28.849> skid<00:00:29.090> pan<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:29.449> this<00:00:29.599> is<00:00:29.720> where<00:00:29.929> handling

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
the skid pan so this is where handling

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.259 
the skid pan so this is where handling
and<00:00:30.919> tires<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:31.279> brakes<00:00:31.609> are<00:00:31.789> really<00:00:32.119> going<00:00:32.210> to

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
and tires and brakes are really going to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:33.670 
and tires and brakes are really going to
come<00:00:32.480> into<00:00:32.599> play<00:00:32.689> it's<00:00:32.989> not<00:00:33.170> about<00:00:33.350> horsepower

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
come into play it's not about horsepower

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.799 
come into play it's not about horsepower
today<00:00:34.010> this<00:00:34.460> is<00:00:34.519> a<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.000> tight<00:00:35.239> confines<00:00:35.449> of

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
today this is a the tight confines of

it's all to do with handling been some

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.149 
it's all to do with handling been some
really<00:00:46.610> fast<00:00:46.909> times<00:00:47.180> down<00:00:47.449> there<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:48.680> little

the<00:02:16.220> tuning<00:02:16.580> industry<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.060> all<00:02:17.180> about<00:02:17.240> it's

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the tuning industry is all about it's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.500 
the tuning industry is all about it's
taking<00:02:18.170> very<00:02:18.890> standard<00:02:19.490> cars<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.180> giving

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
taking very standard cars and giving

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.030 
taking very standard cars and giving
them<00:02:20.630> some<00:02:20.900> work<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.380> making<00:02:21.650> them<00:02:21.800> into

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
them some work and making them into

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.680 
them some work and making them into
something<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.970> do<00:02:23.180> actually<00:02:23.480> want<00:02:23.570> to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
something that you do actually want to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.640 
something that you do actually want to
drive<00:02:23.930> every<00:02:24.200> day

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.110 

basically<00:02:30.980> we've<00:02:31.159> just<00:02:31.459> been<00:02:31.610> testing<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
basically we've just been testing the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.759 
basically we've just been testing the
tire<00:02:32.299> pressures<00:02:32.750> throughout<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.200> day<00:02:33.349> after

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
tire pressures throughout the day after

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.199 
tire pressures throughout the day after
each<00:02:34.159> session<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:35.420> check<00:02:35.689> hot<00:02:36.110> pressures<00:02:36.620> and

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
each session we check hot pressures and

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.729 
each session we check hot pressures and
parameter<00:02:38.209> readings<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.840> tires<00:02:39.079> are<00:02:39.230> really

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
parameter readings the tires are really

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.199 
parameter readings the tires are really
only<00:02:39.860> just<00:02:40.250> starting<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.790> get<00:02:40.879> up<00:02:41.030> to

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
only just starting to get up to

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.300 
only just starting to get up to
operating<00:02:41.450> temperatures<00:02:42.349> which<00:02:42.560> indicates<00:02:43.040> a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
operating temperatures which indicates a

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.830 
operating temperatures which indicates a
warmer<00:02:43.790> day<00:02:43.819> will<00:02:44.120> definitely<00:02:44.480> get<00:02:44.629> much

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
warmer day will definitely get much

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.770 
warmer day will definitely get much
