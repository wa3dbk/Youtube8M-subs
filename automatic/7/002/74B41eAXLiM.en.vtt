00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
faster allotted you do feel cut up

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:33.460 
faster allotted you do feel cut up
there's<00:03:23.210> no<00:03:23.330> rope<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:27.770> you<00:03:32.470> continue

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
there's no rope it's just you continue

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.620

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
looking after each other to that point

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.910 
looking after each other to that point
where<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.900> get<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.050> second<00:03:42.380> wind<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:42.830> the
