I've<00:00:37.920> never<00:00:38.100> done<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.399> before<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.270> by

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I've never done this before I'm not by

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.500 
I've never done this before I'm not by
any<00:00:40.140> means<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.860> fantastic<00:00:41.460> player<00:00:41.700> I'm<00:00:42.000> decent

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
any means a fantastic player I'm decent

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
any means a fantastic player I'm decent
but<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.530> good<00:00:43.710> enough<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.640> yet

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so this is sort of a motivation for

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.130 
so this is sort of a motivation for
myself<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.969> get<00:00:48.180> better<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> game<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
myself to get better at the game to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
myself to get better at the game to
learn<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> rulings<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> learn<00:00:50.520> how<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.760> play

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
learn the rulings to learn how to play

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.200

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
some profiles earlier today and it looks

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.690 
some profiles earlier today and it looks
really<00:02:25.350> interesting<00:02:25.490> there's<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.550> lot<00:02:26.640> of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
really interesting there's a lot of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.520 
really interesting there's a lot of
different<00:02:26.790> ways<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.210> play<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.810> it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
different ways you can play it and it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.380 
different ways you can play it and it
seems<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.220> format<00:02:29.640> stun<00:02:30.060> decks<00:02:30.270> are

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
seems like this format stun decks are

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.790 
seems like this format stun decks are
going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.570> be<00:02:30.660> good<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.350> think<00:02:31.560> something

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
going to be good so I think something

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.110 
going to be good so I think something
like<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.430> kind<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.820> slower

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
like this is just kind of like a slower

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.850 
like this is just kind of like a slower
and<00:02:33.390> more<00:02:33.450> fun<00:02:33.750> sun<00:02:34.140> deck<00:02:34.290> might<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:34.800> of

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and more fun sun deck might be kind of

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.980 
and more fun sun deck might be kind of
