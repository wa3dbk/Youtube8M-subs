00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.350 

I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:20.130> when<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.369> launched<00:00:20.699> XXR<00:00:21.449> expec

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
I think when we launched XXR expec

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.420 
I think when we launched XXR expec
is<00:00:22.450> that<00:00:23.020> we<00:00:23.110> develop<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.590> full<00:00:23.800> line<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.010> to<00:00:24.280> buy

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
is that we develop a full line of to buy

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.090 
is that we develop a full line of to buy
ten<00:00:24.700> options<00:00:25.270> at<00:00:25.510> lower<00:00:25.750> price<00:00:26.050> points<00:00:26.440> really

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
ten options at lower price points really

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.590 
ten options at lower price points really
the<00:00:27.280> confirmation<00:00:27.910> we<00:00:28.000> received<00:00:28.360> from<00:00:28.480> the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
the confirmation we received from the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.900 
the confirmation we received from the
market<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.140> endorsed<00:00:29.620> to<00:00:29.830> buy<00:00:29.950> 10<00:00:30.220> for

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
cross-country for trail riding and even

from longer travel bikes convinces the
to<00:00:35.260> buy<00:00:35.410> 10<00:00:35.620> was<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.890> right<00:00:36.040> application<00:00:36.580> for

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
to buy 10 was the right application for

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.650 
to buy 10 was the right application for
both<00:00:36.850> XO<00:00:37.360> X<00:00:37.660> 9<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.559> X<00:00:38.980> 7<00:00:39.160> component<00:00:39.790> groups

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.970 

really<00:00:45.789> we<00:00:46.789> didn't<00:00:47.059> create<00:00:47.359> two-speed<00:00:48.350> front

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
really we didn't create two-speed front

10<00:00:53.899> homemade<00:00:54.320> systems<00:00:54.769> there<00:00:55.430> were<00:00:55.550> folks<00:00:55.820> who

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
10 homemade systems there were folks who

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.340 
10 homemade systems there were folks who

do it and really there are a lot of
people<00:00:59.180> out<00:00:59.359> there<00:00:59.390> trying<00:00:59.780> to<00:01:00.199> use<00:01:00.409> 2<00:01:00.710> by<00:01:00.860> 10

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
people out there trying to use 2 by 10

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.069 
people out there trying to use 2 by 10
because<00:01:01.250> they<00:01:01.519> wanted<00:01:01.760> simpler<00:01:02.210> they<00:01:02.780> wanted

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
because they wanted simpler they wanted

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.439 
because they wanted simpler they wanted
lighter<00:01:03.320> they<00:01:03.799> wanted<00:01:04.070> cleaner<00:01:04.309> shifting<00:01:04.789> so

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
lighter they wanted cleaner shifting so

lighter they wanted cleaner shifting so
what<00:01:05.659> we<00:01:05.840> did<00:01:06.049> is<00:01:06.289> we<00:01:06.619> used<00:01:06.649> our<00:01:06.979> development

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
what we did is we used our development

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.570 
what we did is we used our development
ideas<00:01:08.990> from<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.259> road<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:10.100> really<00:01:10.280> convince

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
ideas from the road to really convince

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.340 
ideas from the road to really convince
ourselves<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:11.149> 2<00:01:11.360> by<00:01:11.509> 10<00:01:11.780> with<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> wide<00:01:12.320> range

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
ourselves to 2 by 10 with a wide range

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.039 
ourselves to 2 by 10 with a wide range
Cosette<00:01:13.070> was<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.729> better<00:01:14.060> application<00:01:14.360> for

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
Cosette was a better application for

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.050 
Cosette was a better application for
mountain<00:01:15.289> bike<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.560> really<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:16.640> was<00:01:16.670> not<00:01:17.030> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
mountain bike and really that was not a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.730 
mountain bike and really that was not a
hard<00:01:17.330> choice<00:01:17.569> to<00:01:17.630> make<00:01:17.869> when<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.380> just<00:01:18.530> race

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
hard choice to make when you just race

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.219 
hard choice to make when you just race
her<00:01:18.920> feedback<00:01:19.340> we<00:01:19.789> use<00:01:19.909> athlete<00:01:20.360> feedback<00:01:20.810> we

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
her feedback we use athlete feedback we

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.080 
her feedback we use athlete feedback we
use<00:01:21.380> user<00:01:21.740> feedback<00:01:22.069> and<00:01:22.550> just<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.880> way<00:01:23.000> that

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
use user feedback and just the way that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.059 
use user feedback and just the way that
we<00:01:23.210> like<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.479> ride<00:01:23.659> bikes<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.440> guide<00:01:24.649> us<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
we like to ride bikes to guide us to the

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.919 
we like to ride bikes to guide us to the
fact<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.340> 2<00:01:25.610> by<00:01:25.789> 10<00:01:26.060> was<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.390> better<00:01:26.600> way<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.810> go

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
fact that 2 by 10 was a better way to go

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.710 
fact that 2 by 10 was a better way to go
that<00:01:27.080> 3<00:01:27.259> by<00:01:27.409> 9

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.870 

a<00:01:31.810> lot<00:01:32.620> of<00:01:32.650> technology<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.340> trickled<00:01:33.700> down<00:01:33.730> to

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
a lot of technology is trickled down to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.050 
a lot of technology is trickled down to
XO<00:01:34.360> X<00:01:34.600> 9<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:34.990> X<00:01:35.140> 7<00:01:35.470> from<00:01:35.590> xx<00:01:36.010> but<00:01:36.640> beyond<00:01:36.940> that

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
XO X 9 and X 7 from xx but beyond that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.690 
XO X 9 and X 7 from xx but beyond that
the<00:01:37.660> philosophy<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.500> trickled<00:01:38.920> down<00:01:38.950> so

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
the philosophy is trickled down so

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.460 
the philosophy is trickled down so
really<00:01:40.030> our<00:01:40.060> philosophy<00:01:40.810> of<00:01:40.870> development<00:01:41.350> is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
really our philosophy of development is

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.530 
really our philosophy of development is
to<00:01:41.740> create<00:01:42.310> systems<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:43.060> work<00:01:43.240> for<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
to create systems that work for the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.400 
to create systems that work for the
users<00:01:43.870> out<00:01:44.020> there

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
users out there

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.200 
users out there
that's<00:01:44.800> why<00:01:44.980> 2<00:01:45.040> by<00:01:45.400> 10<00:01:45.610> with<00:01:45.910> a<00:01:45.940> wide<00:01:46.180> range

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
that's why 2 by 10 with a wide range

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.700 
that's why 2 by 10 with a wide range
cassette<00:01:46.840> works<00:01:47.170> at<00:01:47.410> X<00:01:47.560> 7<00:01:47.950> X<00:01:48.100> 9<00:01:48.340> XL<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.570> X<00:01:49.930> X<00:01:50.170> so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
cassette works at X 7 X 9 XL and X X so

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.110 
cassette works at X 7 X 9 XL and X X so
you<00:01:50.770> will<00:01:50.830> see<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.100> lot<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.490> technology

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
you will see a lot of the technology

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.690 
you will see a lot of the technology
from<00:01:52.300> xx<00:01:52.750> at<00:01:53.200> lower<00:01:53.470> price<00:01:53.770> points<00:01:54.130> but<00:01:54.310> you

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
from xx at lower price points but you

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.180 
from xx at lower price points but you
will<00:01:54.790> see<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.090> full<00:01:55.270> philosophy<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.290> xx<00:01:57.010> at

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
will see the full philosophy of xx at

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.050 
will see the full philosophy of xx at
those<00:01:57.310> lower<00:01:57.610> price<00:01:58.060> points

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.600 

well<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.870> think<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.440> once<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.980> give<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.430> try

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
well I think that once you give it a try

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.960 
well I think that once you give it a try
you<00:02:06.570> realize<00:02:07.050> why<00:02:07.440> it's<00:02:07.620> better<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.130> that's

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you realize why it's better and that's

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.219 
you realize why it's better and that's
not<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.210> statement<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.780> convince<00:02:10.050> someone

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
not a statement to convince someone

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.140 
not a statement to convince someone
that's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.530> challenge<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.670> them<00:02:11.880> try<00:02:12.120> to

rings or double ring setups up front so

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.690 
rings or double ring setups up front so
from<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.840> where<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.350> kind<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.620> took<00:04:19.980> came

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
from that is where we kind of took came

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.730 
from that is where we kind of took came
up<00:04:21.060> with<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> idea<00:04:21.540> with<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.989> 2<00:04:22.140> by<00:04:22.260> 10<00:04:22.470> system

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
up with the idea with the 2 by 10 system

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.130 
up with the idea with the 2 by 10 system
and<00:04:23.100> having<00:04:23.280> 10<00:04:23.610> gears<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.060> back<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.540> the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
and having 10 gears in back and the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.930 
and having 10 gears in back and the
appropriate<00:04:25.590> gear<00:04:25.740> ratio<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.280> up<00:04:26.400> front<00:04:26.700> and

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
appropriate gear ratio is up front and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.090 
appropriate gear ratio is up front and
that<00:04:27.450> in<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.870> 2<00:04:28.050> by<00:04:28.200> crank<00:04:28.530> up<00:04:28.740> front<00:04:29.010> that

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
that in the 2 by crank up front that

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.640 
that in the 2 by crank up front that
SRAM<00:04:29.400> offers<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:30.840> feel<00:04:31.020> like<00:04:31.169> we<00:04:31.350> meet<00:04:31.530> the
