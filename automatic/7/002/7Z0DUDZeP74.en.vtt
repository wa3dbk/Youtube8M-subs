 bit of wet with this delicious liqueur 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.240
 then cut the orange into slices 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.039
 then very thin we put a little over 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.370
 of whipped cream 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.620
 here we recommend it in thin slices 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.270
 and put them all in place 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.259
