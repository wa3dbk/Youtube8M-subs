00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.949 

so<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.129> very<00:00:02.460> basic<00:00:02.700> jumping<00:00:03.389> exercise

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
so this is a very basic jumping exercise

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.740 
so this is a very basic jumping exercise
that<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:05.160> can<00:00:05.370> start<00:00:05.700> with<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:06.480> just

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
that you can start with and it's just

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.650 
that you can start with and it's just
trotting<00:00:07.259> across<00:00:07.379> rail<00:00:07.980> with<00:00:08.760> trot<00:00:09.090> rails<00:00:09.330> set

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
trotting across rail with trot rails set

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.620 
trotting across rail with trot rails set
in<00:00:09.840> front<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> jump<00:00:10.820> trot<00:00:11.820> rails<00:00:12.120> are<00:00:12.360> set

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
in front of the jump trot rails are set

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.570 
in front of the jump trot rails are set
about<00:00:13.019> four<00:00:13.349> feet<00:00:13.559> apart<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:14.099> one<00:00:14.280> another

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
about four feet apart from one another

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.189 
about four feet apart from one another
and<00:00:14.960> then<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.220> closest<00:00:17.220> one<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.910> jump<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and then the closest one to the jump is

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
and then the closest one to the jump is
about<00:00:19.740> seven<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:20.340> eight<00:00:20.430> feet<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.760> front<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
about seven or eight feet in front of it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
about seven or eight feet in front of it
so<00:00:21.740> you<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:23.039> want<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> approach<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
so you just want to approach with the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.130 
so you just want to approach with the
medium<00:00:24.510> trot<00:00:25.130> let<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.369> horse<00:00:26.720> figure<00:00:27.720> out<00:00:27.900> its

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
medium trot let the horse figure out its

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
medium trot let the horse figure out its
way<00:00:28.380> through<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.949> rails<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:30.210> then<00:00:30.660> try<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
way through the rails and then try to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.729 
way through the rails and then try to
keep<00:00:31.320> an<00:00:31.529> even<00:00:32.600> pace<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.260> way<00:00:34.380> through

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
keep an even pace all the way through

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.520 
keep an even pace all the way through
the<00:00:34.890> rails<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.550> then<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.149> jump<00:00:36.530> my

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the rails and then over the jump my

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.040 
the rails and then over the jump my
horse<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.040> little<00:00:38.399> bit<00:00:38.520> quick<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.059> over

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
horse got a little bit quick there over

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.799 
horse got a little bit quick there over
the<00:00:40.200> top<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.680> jump<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.940> next<00:00:42.180> time<00:00:42.480> I'm

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the top of the jump so next time I'm

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.420 
the top of the jump so next time I'm
going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.260> try<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> keep<00:00:43.890> him<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> little

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
going to just try to keep him a little

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.139 
going to just try to keep him a little
bit<00:00:45.620> quieter<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> little<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.250> relaxed<00:00:47.879> over

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
bit quieter a little more relaxed over

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
bit quieter a little more relaxed over
the<00:00:48.270> jump<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.520> he<00:00:50.610> doesn't<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:51.030> fast<00:00:52.010> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the jump so that he doesn't get fast you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
the jump so that he doesn't get fast you
never<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> rush<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> trot<00:00:54.329> jump<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.989> idea

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
never want to rush a trot jump the idea

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.930 
never want to rush a trot jump the idea
is<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.250> let<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> horse<00:00:56.910> jump<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.539> you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.850 

so<00:01:01.810> just<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.290> medium<00:01:02.680> canner<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.310> the<00:01:03.460> approach

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so just a medium canner on the approach

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.660 
so just a medium canner on the approach
just<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:06.010> light<00:01:06.220> contact<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:09.070> go<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
just a light contact there we go the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.230 
just a light contact there we go the
horse<00:01:09.880> jumps<00:01:10.300> up<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.720> jumps<00:01:11.290> down<00:01:12.000> upper<00:01:13.000> body

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
horse jumps up and jumps down upper body

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.830 
horse jumps up and jumps down upper body
doesn't<00:01:13.690> make<00:01:13.840> too<00:01:14.080> much<00:01:14.260> of<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.620> motion

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
doesn't make too much of a motion

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920 
doesn't make too much of a motion
leaning<00:01:16.840> at<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.550> you<00:01:18.550> just<00:01:18.970> stay<00:01:19.420> in<00:01:19.600> your<00:01:19.630> to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
leaning at it you just stay in your to

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.219 
leaning at it you just stay in your to
point<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.500> let<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.740> horse<00:01:20.950> jump<00:01:21.250> up<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.430> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
point and let the horse jump up to you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.790 
point and let the horse jump up to you
we'll<00:01:23.229> try<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.470> once<00:01:23.740> more<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:25.690> hopefully<00:01:26.530> get

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
we'll try it once more and hopefully get

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.210 
we'll try it once more and hopefully get
the<00:01:26.950> same<00:01:27.190> result<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.840> then<00:01:29.560> once<00:01:29.800> your<00:01:30.009> horse

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
the same result and then once your horse

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.499 
the same result and then once your horse
is<00:01:30.430> good<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:31.990> exercise<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.300> can

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
is good with this exercise then you can

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.700 
is good with this exercise then you can
think<00:01:34.780> about<00:01:35.340> adding<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.350> making<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.619> a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
think about adding to it and making it a

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.370 
think about adding to it and making it a
little<00:01:38.800> more<00:01:38.950> challenging<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:43.600> horses<00:01:44.050> fine

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
little more challenging some horses fine

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.999 
little more challenging some horses fine
trot<00:01:44.740> jumps<00:01:45.130> very<00:01:45.369> difficult<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:47.410> they<00:01:47.710> tend

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
trot jumps very difficult and they tend

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.300 
trot jumps very difficult and they tend
to<00:01:48.070> get<00:01:48.340> quick<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:49.030> that's<00:01:49.479> why<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.310> extra

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
to get quick and that's why the extra

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.999 
to get quick and that's why the extra
trot<00:01:51.580> rails<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.149> front<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.570> jump<00:01:53.009> really

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
trot rails in front of the jump really

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.960 
trot rails in front of the jump really
are<00:01:54.340> helpful<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:56.369> helping<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.729> horse

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
are helpful in helping the horse

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.020 
are helpful in helping the horse
maintain<00:01:58.270> one<00:01:58.840> speed<00:01:59.770> one<00:02:00.280> rhythm<00:02:00.580> all<00:02:00.910> the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
maintain one speed one rhythm all the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.339 
maintain one speed one rhythm all the
way<00:02:01.119> through<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.500> we'll<00:02:06.069> try<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.399> now<00:02:06.640> and

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
way through it so we'll try it now and

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.770 
way through it so we'll try it now and
go<00:02:08.349> through<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.679> with<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> little<00:02:09.220> bit<00:02:09.399> more

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
go through it with a little bit more

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.449 
go through it with a little bit more
okay<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:11.140> we've<00:02:11.380> added<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.920> vertical

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
okay so now we've added a vertical

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.380 
okay so now we've added a vertical
behind<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:14.260> cross<00:02:14.500> rail<00:02:14.890> about<00:02:15.490> 18<00:02:15.940> feet<00:02:15.970> away

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
behind the cross rail about 18 feet away

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.710 
behind the cross rail about 18 feet away
and<00:02:16.990> we're<00:02:17.260> just<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.740> do<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> simple<00:02:18.720> trot

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
and we're just going to do a simple trot

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.870 
and we're just going to do a simple trot
in<00:02:20.790> Tanner<00:02:21.790> out<00:02:22.120> one<00:02:22.720> stride<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.610> trot

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
in Tanner out one stride so the trot

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.620 
in Tanner out one stride so the trot
rails<00:02:25.180> are<00:02:25.990> gonna<00:02:26.170> help<00:02:26.470> keep<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.640> trot<00:02:27.940> nice

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
rails are gonna help keep the trot nice

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.420 
rails are gonna help keep the trot nice
and<00:02:29.020> smooth<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:31.680> then<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.890> horse<00:02:33.099> jumps
