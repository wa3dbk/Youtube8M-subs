any<00:02:46.990> time<00:02:47.230> you're<00:02:47.380> going<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.590> be<00:02:47.710> putting

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
any time you're going to be putting

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.560 
any time you're going to be putting
anything<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.670> pan<00:02:48.880> let's<00:02:49.150> see<00:02:49.240> if<00:02:49.300> she<00:02:49.420> does

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
anything in a pan let's see if she does

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.670 
anything in a pan let's see if she does
it<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.930> safe<00:02:50.590> way<00:02:51.330> she<00:02:52.330> did<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.960> put<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.530> in

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
it the safe way she did you put it in

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.270 
it the safe way she did you put it in
away<00:02:54.100> from<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.990> so<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.500> oil<00:02:56.710> looks<00:02:56.890> really

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
away from you so the oil looks really

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.740 
away from you so the oil looks really
yellow<00:02:57.460> here<00:02:57.760> because<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.090> didn't<00:02:58.360> realize<00:02:58.660> I

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
yellow here because I didn't realize I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.570 
yellow here because I didn't realize I
didn't<00:02:59.020> have<00:02:59.140> enough<00:02:59.350> canola<00:02:59.650> oil<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> used

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
didn't have enough canola oil so I used

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.450 
didn't have enough canola oil so I used
half<00:03:00.850> canola<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.480> half<00:03:01.660> olive<00:03:02.050> oil<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.160> this<00:03:03.310> is

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
half canola in half olive oil so this is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.030 
half canola in half olive oil so this is
sort<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.820> Spanish<00:03:04.240> tome<00:03:04.480> captain<00:03:04.930> I'm<00:03:05.380> here

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
sort of a Spanish tome captain I'm here

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.470 
sort of a Spanish tome captain I'm here
it'll<00:03:06.160> be<00:03:06.280> delicious<00:03:06.490> because<00:03:06.910> in<00:03:07.030> Spain<00:03:07.270> they

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
it'll be delicious because in Spain they

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.190 
it'll be delicious because in Spain they
fry<00:03:07.720> everything<00:03:08.080> in<00:03:08.500> olive<00:03:08.830> oil<00:03:09.990> but<00:03:10.990> we

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
fry everything in olive oil but we

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.870 
fry everything in olive oil but we
recommend<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.770> use<00:03:11.920> canola<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:12.580> future

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
recommend to use canola in the future

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.490 
recommend to use canola in the future
because<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.240> has<00:03:13.360> less<00:03:13.390> flavor<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.320> you'll

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
because it has less flavor and so you'll

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.880 
because it has less flavor and so you'll
have<00:03:14.620> more<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.040> pure<00:03:15.310> flavor<00:03:15.640> pinko<00:03:16.770> Hugo<00:03:17.770> is

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
have more of a pure flavor pinko Hugo is

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.680 
have more of a pure flavor pinko Hugo is
nodding<00:03:18.250> yes<00:03:18.430> right<00:03:18.970> now

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.840 

so<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.650> don't<00:03:24.710> know<00:03:24.830> how<00:03:24.890> long<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.280> takes<00:03:25.490> you<00:03:25.700> go

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
think that we should have put a little

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.530 
think that we should have put a little
bit<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.350> salt<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.070> pinko<00:04:31.430> she<00:04:32.300> was<00:04:32.419> like

bit of salt in the pinko she was like
and<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.520> if<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.669> reason<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.600> that<00:04:35.870> we're

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290
