00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.230
 in this video tutorial we are going to explain 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.350
 how to change the servers and 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.930
 thermostats of a car in chivas estudio 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.930
 351 is this team that have here 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.000
 is a team to black and white as 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 that just opened louis is the duplex 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 followed at door number 2 where it is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.519
 the transfer roller and let's 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 proceed to lower the bus unit now that 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.659
 is the one that interests us to do the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.140
 dismantling of the terms and thermostats 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:43.040
 will remove a cap that is next 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.040
 straight 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.620
 from the unit its hours 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.450
 the number 3 that you can visualize there is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 the lid of the fuser unit that covers 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.380
 so that people do not burn 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.690
 When Juan is there you are bait in the 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.190
 table that we are withdrawing 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.190
 two screws are removed 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.690
 we remove the following cables ellis 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.690
 will allow us to see by forbes 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.330
 at the top there is a blue color 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.420
 and a red color and the cables if they are 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.470
 marked with blue and red ribbons 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.799
 we press the white connector for the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.480
 sides and the poplars 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.490
 to let go 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.400
 in the bottom part we have another 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.650
 connector which has the key of 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.190
 Pressure 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.190
 I 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.260
 I remove 1 and below there are others that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.250
 they are of important pressure to be able 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.090
 remove this connector we must press on 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 this part 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.030
 and so talk ok now we close again 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.610
 the lid 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.049
 and we release two screws that in this 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.049
 now they have taken us away 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.310
 this screw forgiveness and from another 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.380
 screw 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.910
 well if we take the unit for the part 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.630
 from below 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.700
 let go of the cables of an axis that 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.200
 we will show the coordination this gesture 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.450
 is to lock the cables then the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.960
 we retire to caising we remove these well 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.750
 see you close everything 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.980
 and we are going to what would be the disassembly 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.909
 of the protectors 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.909
 A) Yes 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.890
 we have the unit open 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.190
 and we are going to proceed to remove 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.770
 screws 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.130
 which are from the cleaning rolls of 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.130
 unit 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.549
 all right 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.739
 we talk upwards of the unit and 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.319
 we see a roller that is like white and a 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.050
 roll that is metallized these rollers 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.530
 are the ones who clean the band 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.940
 of the fuser unit to which is red the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.010
 which we should not touch with any 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.770
 screwdriver neither with staples nor anything 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.360
 because it can break and it's a band 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.730
 very difficult to get and a little 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:31.700
 costly 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.850
 we proceed to remove the cover that covers 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.700
 the sensor of the fuser unit 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.560
 this stage to remove it seems a 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.940
 we throw it back to you and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.960
 we proceed to remove the three screws 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.960
 that is removing louis 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.459
 we are the cover is always important 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.220
 well as they observe things if 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.750
 you are watching at all times 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.660
 what you are removing afterwards is easy 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.430
 arm release the sensor connector 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.420
 which we are going to remove for this 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.420
 part and by this wiki 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.310
 we go back to do the stage and there near the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.850
 number 4 take away votes two ready to 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.750
 withdraw another cabin and allow it was 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.750
 connect all exit 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.880
 we remove this other red piece 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.449
 and it will not allow to withdraw that point 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.210
 we are also removing the connector 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.370
 of the sensor because the territories and the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.870
 unit that is sent comes complete together 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:05.400
 with that cable then you have to remove it 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.100
 to be changed whole 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.530
 we removed these small moorings that 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.840
 they have a hook on the side with a 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.750
 shovel screwdriver 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.300
 we press him for the habit 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.610
 and they will drop it can 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.210
 remove our cables that we throw 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.940
 unit 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:30.960
 we close the lid we turn the unit and that 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.960
 is the part that we have sent 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.749
 which will remove louis 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.890
 we remove the cable from this one 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.449
 mooring so that it allows us to remove the 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.860
 full base 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.860
 and of these other two 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.540
 now yes this is the unit let's put the 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.680
 here we are going to explain a little 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.840
 I am turning it around 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.410
 this part that comes here is the 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.410
 thermostat 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.999
 this are the three terms that make 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:41.860
 leave the machine an error code that 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:43.870
 is the c4 70 472 440 ago 440 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.630
 so 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.670
 and as we disarm this we return it to 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.670
 assemble and install on the machine 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.490
 another thing to take into account in the 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.510
 machine is if it is full of dust 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:02.830
 of this as seen here we can clean 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.830
 a brush 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.430
 remove those spores and turn the unit 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.120
 until all that falls and we can 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.120
 blow well 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:20.439
 that is turning louis in this 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:24.499
 moment in the transfer band 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:26.689
 we recommend not to touch it too much and treat it 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:30.639
 very soft because any defect that 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:30.639
 you can make it break 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.110
 good up here our video tutorial 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.110
 how to change the terms 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.110
 demonstrable
