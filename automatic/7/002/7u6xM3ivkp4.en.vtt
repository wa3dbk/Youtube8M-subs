go all the way back and here we'll

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.900 
go all the way back and here we'll
simply<00:04:39.990> go<00:04:40.169> down<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.710> system<00:04:40.979> we'll<00:04:41.729> go<00:04:41.849> to

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
simply go down to system we'll go to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.089 
simply go down to system we'll go to
library<00:04:42.509> and<00:04:42.840> then<00:04:43.289> we'll<00:04:43.440> scroll<00:04:43.650> down<00:04:43.860> to

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
library and then we'll scroll down to

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.670 
library and then we'll scroll down to
where<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:44.310> says<00:04:44.639> locks<00:04:45.180> idjits<00:04:45.690> click<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.530> that

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.800 
where it says locks idjits click on that
and<00:04:46.949> then<00:04:47.160> we'll<00:04:47.340> go<00:04:47.699> ahead<00:04:47.819> and<00:04:48.120> find<00:04:48.360> rising

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
and then we'll go ahead and find rising

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.559 
and then we'll go ahead and find rising
bars<00:04:49.020> digit<00:04:49.770> open<00:04:50.250> up<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.460> folder<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:51.060> then

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
bars digit open up that folder and then

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.659 
bars digit open up that folder and then
we'll<00:04:51.750> need<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.990> open<00:04:52.259> up<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.560> very<00:04:52.919> last<00:04:53.280> file

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
we'll need to open up the very last file

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.120 
we'll need to open up the very last file
which<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.090> gonna<00:04:54.210> be<00:04:54.389> rising<00:04:54.660> bars<00:04:55.080> J<00:04:55.590> s<00:04:55.800> and

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
which is gonna be rising bars J s and

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.800 
which is gonna be rising bars J s and
then<00:04:56.340> go<00:04:56.520> ahead<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:56.729> open<00:04:56.849> it<00:04:57.090> up<00:04:57.210> in<00:04:57.419> text

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
then go ahead and open it up in text

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.749 
then go ahead and open it up in text
viewer<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.319> once<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:59.009> text<00:04:59.280> viewer<00:04:59.520> you'll

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
viewer and once in text viewer you'll

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.820 
viewer and once in text viewer you'll
get<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.180> code<00:05:00.449> and<00:05:00.720> then<00:05:01.289> we'll<00:05:01.530> need<00:05:01.680> to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
get the code and then we'll need to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.640 
get the code and then we'll need to
change<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.550> make<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.180> 12-hour<00:05:03.569> line<00:05:04.319> which<00:05:04.560> is

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
change the make it 12-hour line which is

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.710 
change the make it 12-hour line which is
gonna<00:05:04.770> be<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.949> 4th<00:05:05.250> line<00:05:05.430> is<00:05:05.699> gonna<00:05:06.150> be<00:05:06.419> on

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
gonna be the 4th line is gonna be on

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.809 
gonna be the 4th line is gonna be on
false<00:05:07.139> so<00:05:07.650> we<00:05:07.770> need<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:08.009> change<00:05:08.220> that<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.490> true

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
false so we need to change that to true

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.360 
false so we need to change that to true
if<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.210> want<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.479> do<00:05:09.659> 12-hour<00:05:10.259> clock<00:05:10.409> time<00:05:11.039> and
