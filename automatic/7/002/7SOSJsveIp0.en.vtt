00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.649 
game and just kind of go from there and
majority<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> time<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.560> play<00:01:16.740> domination

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
majority of the time I play domination

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
majority of the time I play domination
but<00:01:18.659> me<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.020> oz<00:01:19.170> were<00:01:19.350> running<00:01:19.590> around<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
but me and oz were running around in it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
but me and oz were running around in it
it<00:01:21.060> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> sucked<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.530> were

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it kind of sucked because we were

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
it kind of sucked because we were
playing<00:01:22.830> ground<00:01:23.130> war<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.930> crazy

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
playing ground war and it was just crazy

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380 
playing ground war and it was just crazy
that<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.369> some<00:01:26.520> reason<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.909> game<00:01:27.090> kept

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that for some reason the game kept

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.910 
that for some reason the game kept
lagging<00:01:27.630> every<00:01:28.110> single<00:01:28.380> match<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.799> got

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
lagging every single match that we got

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
lagging every single match that we got
into<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.579> which<00:01:30.509> made<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:30.869> difficult<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
into and which made it very difficult to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.520 
into and which made it very difficult to
play<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.240> luckily<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> still<00:01:33.780> put<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
play but luckily I still put it off I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
play but luckily I still put it off I
got<00:01:34.890> lucky<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.310> couple<00:01:35.640> times<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.210> match

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
got lucky a couple times in this match

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
got lucky a couple times in this match
but<00:01:37.439> overall<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> good<00:01:38.340> match<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.759> you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
but overall it was a good match as you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.679 
but overall it was a good match as you

also by the turtle beaches the x 40 once
but<00:04:51.240> I<00:04:51.620> don't<00:04:52.620> like<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.830> mic<00:04:53.039> quality<00:04:53.250> on<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
but I don't like the mic quality on the

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.159 
but I don't like the mic quality on the
turtle<00:04:53.820> beaches<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.479> sound<00:04:54.720> quality<00:04:54.870> is

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
turtle beaches the sound quality is

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.590 
turtle beaches the sound quality is
phenomenal<00:04:56.039> on<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.820> turtle<00:04:57.090> beaches<00:04:57.389> which

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
phenomenal on the turtle beaches which

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.960 
phenomenal on the turtle beaches which
is<00:04:57.750> why<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.380> lot<00:04:58.590> of<00:04:58.800> them<00:04:59.009> sell<00:04:59.370> because<00:04:59.669> they

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
is why a lot of them sell because they

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.540 
is why a lot of them sell because they
have<00:05:00.150> technically<00:05:00.990> had<00:05:01.169> better<00:05:01.320> quality<00:05:01.860> and

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550

what<00:06:50.070> I<00:06:50.220> mean<00:06:50.550> all<00:06:50.700> it<00:06:50.850> is<00:06:50.970> really<00:06:51.240> is<00:06:51.390> just<00:06:51.600> is

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
what I mean all it is really is just is

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.410 
what I mean all it is really is just is
it<00:06:52.230> it's<00:06:52.560> basically<00:06:52.710> a<00:06:52.980> chess<00:06:53.280> match<00:06:53.490> you<00:06:54.240> want

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.420 
it it's basically a chess match you want

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.540 
it it's basically a chess match you want
to<00:06:54.540> maximize<00:06:55.080> how<00:06:55.440> many<00:06:55.590> tags<00:06:55.800> you<00:06:56.010> get<00:06:56.190> you

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
to maximize how many tags you get you

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.790 
to maximize how many tags you get you
know<00:06:56.640> it<00:06:56.790> minimized<00:06:57.240> Desmond<00:06:58.080> you<00:06:58.260> know<00:06:58.410> the

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
know it minimized Desmond you know the

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.470 
know it minimized Desmond you know the
tags<00:06:59.040> that<00:06:59.160> you<00:06:59.250> give<00:06:59.490> up<00:06:59.730> that's<00:06:59.970> all<00:07:00.120> that<00:07:00.330> it

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
tags that you give up that's all that it

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.480 
tags that you give up that's all that it
is<00:07:00.630> so<00:07:01.140> a<00:07:01.410> lot<00:07:01.650> of<00:07:01.680> people<00:07:01.740> want<00:07:02.010> to<00:07:02.070> rush<00:07:02.310> and

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
is so a lot of people want to rush and

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.700 
is so a lot of people want to rush and
try<00:07:02.610> to<00:07:02.670> get<00:07:02.850> tags<00:07:03.090> super<00:07:03.570> fast<00:07:03.810> and<00:07:04.050> stuff

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
try to get tags super fast and stuff

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.860 
try to get tags super fast and stuff
like<00:07:04.860> that<00:07:04.920> but<00:07:05.280> it<00:07:05.790> really<00:07:06.090> can<00:07:06.390> be<00:07:06.420> a

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
like that but it really can be a

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.720 
like that but it really can be a
disadvantage<00:07:07.320> if<00:07:07.920> you<00:07:08.130> start<00:07:08.370> playing<00:07:08.610> like

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
disadvantage if you start playing like

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.340 
disadvantage if you start playing like
that<00:07:09.090> only<00:07:09.300> because<00:07:10.550> if<00:07:11.550> you<00:07:12.330> run<00:07:12.750> out<00:07:12.780> into<00:07:13.110> an

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.350 
that only because if you run out into an

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.220 
that only because if you run out into an
open<00:07:13.470> area<00:07:14.120> to<00:07:15.120> try<00:07:15.270> to<00:07:15.360> collect<00:07:15.660> a<00:07:15.780> dog<00:07:15.960> tag

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 
open area to try to collect a dog tag

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.920 
open area to try to collect a dog tag
and<00:07:16.500> you<00:07:16.830> get<00:07:16.980> killed<00:07:17.370> that<00:07:18.150> means<00:07:18.480> that

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
and you get killed that means that

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.710 
and you get killed that means that
basically<00:07:19.740> you're<00:07:20.580> down<00:07:20.850> the<00:07:21.000> tag<00:07:21.240> and<00:07:21.510> they

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
basically you're down the tag and they

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.630 
basically you're down the tag and they
get<00:07:21.870> to<00:07:21.960> gain<00:07:22.110> attack<00:07:22.380> on<00:07:22.620> you<00:07:22.800> and<00:07:23.010> if<00:07:23.550> you

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:23.640 
get to gain attack on you and if you

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.830 
get to gain attack on you and if you
play<00:07:23.820> like<00:07:24.030> that<00:07:24.210> throughout<00:07:24.480> the<00:07:24.630> match

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
play like that throughout the match

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.260 
play like that throughout the match
it'll<00:07:25.110> just<00:07:25.410> it'll<00:07:25.740> be<00:07:26.430> bad<00:07:26.640> for<00:07:26.910> you<00:07:27.000> it'll<00:07:27.150> be
