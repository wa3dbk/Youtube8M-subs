work<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.650> think<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.130> wicket<00:00:28.369> was<00:00:28.489> a<00:00:28.520> tiny<00:00:28.730> bit

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
work I think the wicket was a tiny bit

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.630 
work I think the wicket was a tiny bit
slow<00:00:29.239> but<00:00:29.800> as<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.919> said<00:00:30.980> probably<00:00:31.340> with<00:00:31.520> our

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
slow but as I said probably with our

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.060 
slow but as I said probably with our
spinners<00:00:31.939> having<00:00:32.450> spinners<00:00:33.140> in<00:00:33.260> guys<00:00:33.739> taking

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
spinners having spinners in guys taking

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.319 
spinners having spinners in guys taking
the<00:00:34.130> place<00:00:34.310> of<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.489> ball<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:34.880> medium<00:00:35.120> page

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
the place of the ball and medium page

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.729 
the place of the ball and medium page
there's<00:00:35.540> probably<00:00:35.750> suited<00:00:36.079> our<00:00:36.200> saw<00:00:36.470> little

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
there's probably suited our saw little

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.330 
there's probably suited our saw little
bit<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.720> obviously<00:00:38.720> getting<00:00:38.930> maybe<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.559> can

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
bit and obviously getting maybe I can

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.160 
bit and obviously getting maybe I can
see<00:00:40.790> out<00:00:40.940> there<00:00:41.090> with<00:00:41.210> two<00:00:41.329> of<00:00:41.450> their<00:00:41.570> big<00:00:41.780> big

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170

see out there with two of their big big
strikers<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.950> think<00:00:43.160> helped<00:00:43.460> just<00:00:43.969> send<00:00:44.179> that

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
strikers I think helped just send that

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.970 
strikers I think helped just send that
flow<00:00:44.539> in<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.750> middle<00:00:44.989> of<00:00:45.019> it<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.559> fortunately

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
flow in the middle of it the fortunately

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.110 
flow in the middle of it the fortunately
got<00:00:46.070> away<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.280> little<00:00:46.460> bit<00:00:46.579> in<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.789> end<00:00:46.969> with

got away a little bit in the end with

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.869 
got away a little bit in the end with
Lady<00:00:47.469> but<00:00:48.469> he's<00:00:48.649> a<00:00:48.679> good<00:00:48.890> player<00:00:49.010> as<00:00:49.579> we<00:00:49.760> saw

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
tonight and we knew at some stage

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.110 
tonight and we knew at some stage
they're<00:00:52.339> going<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.519> get<00:00:52.640> some<00:00:52.789> sort<00:00:53.000> of<00:00:53.030> a

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
they're going to get some sort of a

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.520 
they're going to get some sort of a
partnership<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:54.019> thought<00:00:54.230> we<00:00:54.320> did<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.469> good

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
partnership so I thought we did a good

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.400 
partnership so I thought we did a good
job<00:00:54.589> yeah<00:00:55.309> listen<00:00:56.239> I<00:00:56.390> thought<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:57.170> chase<00:00:57.379> that

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
job yeah listen I thought to chase that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.310 
job yeah listen I thought to chase that
on<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.249> slowish<00:00:58.670> wicket<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.269> do<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.570> quite

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
on a slowish wicket and to do it quite

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.569 
on a slowish wicket and to do it quite
clinically<00:01:00.800> I<00:01:00.890> thought<00:01:01.100> was<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.249> really<00:01:01.370> good

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
clinically I thought was a really good

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.520 
clinically I thought was a really good
effort<00:01:01.820> by<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:01.969> boys<00:01:02.239> couple<00:01:03.140> couple<00:01:03.469> of

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
effort by the boys couple couple of

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.170 
effort by the boys couple couple of
silly<00:01:03.769> mistakes<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:04.430> probably<00:01:04.640> more<00:01:04.820> i'm<00:01:04.940> run

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
silly mistakes but probably more i'm run

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.149 
silly mistakes but probably more i'm run
out<00:01:05.330> coming<00:01:05.690> back<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.020> third<00:01:06.260> I<00:01:06.530> didn't

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
out coming back to the third I didn't

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.830 
out coming back to the third I didn't
realize<00:01:07.190> God<00:01:07.670> was<00:01:07.850> had<00:01:08.000> such<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.210> good<00:01:08.420> arm<00:01:08.630> with

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
realize God was had such a good arm with

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.649 
realize God was had such a good arm with
no<00:01:08.870> much<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.320> bear<00:01:09.500> bad<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:09.980> butter<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.700> but<00:01:11.630> I

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
no much to bear bad in butter and but I

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.240 
no much to bear bad in butter and but I
thought<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.960> boys<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.140> really<00:01:12.560> good<00:01:12.740> job<00:01:12.890> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250
