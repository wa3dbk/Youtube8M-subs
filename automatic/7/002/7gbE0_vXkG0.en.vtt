hook of the rear it is middle biting
fish<00:01:55.710> we'll<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.220> put<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.880> middle<00:01:57.000> our

hook stays in the fish's mouth and this
rides<00:02:05.520> away<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.390> you've<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.720> nothing<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.380> do

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
putting in in line weights so we could

putting in in line weights so we could
screw<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.160> an<00:03:05.459> inline<00:03:05.820> weight<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.510> actually

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
screw on an inline weight and actually

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.500 
screw on an inline weight and actually
put<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.890> head<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.220> thing<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:09.209> a

moments you got your opportunity to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.300 
moments you got your opportunity to

without<00:03:49.939> spinners<00:03:50.889> weighted<00:03:51.889> heads<00:03:52.159> eyes

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
without spinners weighted heads eyes

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 
without spinners weighted heads eyes
different<00:03:53.719> colors<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.409> mean<00:03:54.530> it's<00:03:54.650> all<00:03:54.739> there

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
in one little box but that's not all

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.330 
in one little box but that's not all
because<00:03:57.379> you've<00:03:57.530> actually<00:03:57.709> come<00:03:58.040> out<00:03:58.129> with

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
because you've actually come out with

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.899 
because you've actually come out with
some<00:03:58.579> more<00:03:59.379> yeah<00:04:00.379> we<00:04:00.620> decided<00:04:01.099> there's<00:04:01.370> as

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
some more yeah we decided there's as

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.819 
some more yeah we decided there's as
well<00:04:02.120> as<00:04:02.209> fires<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.959> traditional<00:04:03.560> lures

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
well as fires and traditional lures

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.000 
well as fires and traditional lures
we've<00:04:04.609> got<00:04:04.849> epoxy-based<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.230> if<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.799> look<00:04:06.919> at

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
we've got epoxy-based so if you look at

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.250 
we've got epoxy-based so if you look at
these<00:04:07.099> these<00:04:07.430> are<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.669> hybrid<00:04:08.329> it's<00:04:09.049> something

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
these these are a hybrid it's something

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.039 
these these are a hybrid it's something
like<00:04:09.409> a<00:04:09.560> traditional<00:04:10.219> worth<00:04:10.909> but<00:04:11.599> with<00:04:11.810> lots

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
like a traditional worth but with lots

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
of mobility in the tail so here we've

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.240 
of mobility in the tail so here we've
got<00:04:14.299> something<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:15.199> looks<00:04:15.500> like<00:04:15.590> make<00:04:16.009> fish

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
even further I mean you'll know these

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.749 
even further I mean you'll know these
yeah<00:04:46.940> traditional<00:04:47.870> line<00:04:48.349> sees<00:04:48.650> really<00:04:49.460> really

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
yeah traditional line sees really really

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.879 
yeah traditional line sees really really
simple<00:04:50.000> unlike<00:04:50.599> normal<00:04:50.810> flying<00:04:51.199> sees<00:04:51.560> there

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
simple unlike normal flying sees there

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.490 
simple unlike normal flying sees there
again<00:04:52.190> based<00:04:52.520> on<00:04:52.699> the<00:04:52.789> tube<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.750> hook<00:04:53.900> sits<00:04:54.380> in

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
again based on the tube the hook sits in

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.850 
again based on the tube the hook sits in
the<00:04:54.620> rear<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:55.699> literally<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.539> hook<00:04:56.780> on<00:04:56.990> as
