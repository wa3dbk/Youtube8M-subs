00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
first and foremost something I really

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.500 
first and foremost something I really
like<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.010> give<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:28.460> racks<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:30.740> 19

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
like is that they give you racks for 19

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.440 
like is that they give you racks for 19
you<00:00:33.980> rack<00:00:34.980> mount<00:00:35.219> stuff<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:36.000> really

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
you rack mount stuff and that's really

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540 
you rack mount stuff and that's really
nice<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.050> normally<00:00:37.800> these<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.100> options

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
nice because normally these are options

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.360 
nice because normally these are options
and<00:00:38.850> let's<00:00:39.629> face<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.840> they're<00:00:40.590> expensive<00:00:40.920> if

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
and let's face it they're expensive if

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.060 
and let's face it they're expensive if
you<00:00:41.610> buy<00:00:41.640> them<00:00:41.910> separately<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.920> that's<00:00:43.920> really

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you buy them separately so that's really

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.740 
you buy them separately so that's really
nice<00:00:44.280> behringer<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> they're<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.480> sturdy

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
so much more than then having just going

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.320 
so much more than then having just going
the<00:05:45.710> mains<00:05:45.979> out<00:05:46.220> into<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.550> Mackie<00:05:46.760> sub<00:05:47.090> and

the mains out into the Mackie sub and
and<00:05:47.479> then<00:05:48.050> using<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:48.470> crossover<00:05:48.919> built<00:05:49.130> in

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
and then using the crossover built in

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.210 
and then using the crossover built in
there<00:05:49.490> there's<00:05:49.880> a<00:05:49.970> lot<00:05:50.150> better<00:05:50.979> so<00:05:51.979> there<00:05:52.130> you

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
there there's a lot better so there you

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.650 
there there's a lot better so there you
have<00:05:52.250> it<00:05:52.550> this<00:05:52.669> is<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:52.940> mixer<00:05:53.270> very<00:05:53.930> nice<00:05:55.660> it's

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
have it this is the mixer very nice it's

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.620 
have it this is the mixer very nice it's
kind<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.430> you<00:05:58.430> know<00:05:58.460> what<00:05:58.700> I<00:05:58.910> have<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.360> say<00:05:59.510> I've

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
kind of you know what I have to say I've

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.240 
kind of you know what I have to say I've
I've<00:05:59.780> owned<00:06:00.020> a<00:06:00.050> lot<00:06:00.320> of<00:06:00.470> behringer<00:06:00.860> stuff<00:06:01.100> in

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
I've owned a lot of behringer stuff in

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.630 
I've owned a lot of behringer stuff in
the<00:06:01.310> past<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:02.470> we've<00:06:03.470> been<00:06:03.590> mixers<00:06:03.950> and<00:06:04.160> this

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
the past and we've been mixers and this

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.930 
the past and we've been mixers and this
one<00:06:04.850> definitely<00:06:05.120> feels<00:06:05.750> like<00:06:06.520> it's<00:06:07.520> built<00:06:07.820> a

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
one definitely feels like it's built a

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.260 
one definitely feels like it's built a
lot<00:06:08.120> better

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
lot better

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.159 
lot better
everything<00:06:11.270> from<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:11.570> metal<00:06:11.930> I<00:06:13.600> can<00:06:14.600> see<00:06:14.930> the

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
everything from the metal I can see the

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.390 
everything from the metal I can see the
faders<00:06:16.750> faders<00:06:17.750> are<00:06:17.870> really<00:06:18.260> smooth<00:06:18.680> it<00:06:19.040> feels

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
faders faders are really smooth it feels

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.730 
faders faders are really smooth it feels
nice<00:06:20.860> I'm<00:06:21.860> probably<00:06:22.130> gonna<00:06:22.340> replace<00:06:22.729> it

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
nice I'm probably gonna replace it

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.650 
nice I'm probably gonna replace it
apparently<00:06:24.740> the

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
apparently the

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.530 
apparently the
the<00:06:26.930> innovator<00:06:27.560> and<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.130> pro-x<00:06:28.730> fate<00:06:29.090> fits

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
the innovator and the pro-x fate fits

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.840 
the innovator and the pro-x fate fits
right<00:06:29.900> in<00:06:30.110> so<00:06:31.010> I<00:06:31.400> can<00:06:32.320> actually<00:06:33.550> replace<00:06:34.550> this

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
right in so I can actually replace this

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.540 
right in so I can actually replace this
whole<00:06:35.030> thing<00:06:35.240> and<00:06:35.420> put<00:06:35.600> a<00:06:36.530> fader<00:06:37.100> that's<00:06:37.340> even

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
whole thing and put a fader that's even

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.460 
whole thing and put a fader that's even
better<00:06:37.730> than<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.090> rain<00:06:38.270> in<00:06:38.540> here<00:06:38.990> and<00:06:39.230> it'll

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
better than the rain in here and it'll

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.170 
better than the rain in here and it'll
fit<00:06:39.680> perfectly<00:06:40.220> and<00:06:40.580> it'll<00:06:40.880> be<00:06:41.000> MIDI

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
fit perfectly and it'll be MIDI

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.310 
fit perfectly and it'll be MIDI
assignable<00:06:43.030> these<00:06:44.030> channel<00:06:44.420> faders<00:06:44.780> are<00:06:44.990> very

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
assignable these channel faders are very

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.840 
assignable these channel faders are very
nice<00:06:45.560> they're<00:06:45.800> very<00:06:45.830> smooth<00:06:47.710> and<00:06:48.710> go<00:06:48.950> they

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
nice they're very smooth and go they

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.300 
nice they're very smooth and go they
have<00:06:50.030> some<00:06:50.540> weight<00:06:50.810> to<00:06:51.020> them<00:06:51.200> not<00:06:51.590> a<00:06:51.650> lot<00:06:52.040> but

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
have some weight to them not a lot but

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.530 
have some weight to them not a lot but
this<00:06:53.090> basically<00:06:53.600> feels<00:06:54.020> very<00:06:54.290> similar<00:06:54.590> to<00:06:55.010> the

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
this basically feels very similar to the

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.650 
this basically feels very similar to the
the<00:06:56.540> Pioneer<00:06:57.820> so<00:06:58.820> does<00:06:58.970> these<00:06:59.120> buttons<00:06:59.540> these

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
the Pioneer so does these buttons these

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.780 
the Pioneer so does these buttons these
buttons<00:07:00.080> have<00:07:00.200> some<00:07:00.410> weight<00:07:00.680> in<00:07:00.860> it<00:07:01.010> they're

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
buttons have some weight in it they're

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.700 
buttons have some weight in it they're
not<00:07:01.940> flimsy<00:07:02.570> at<00:07:02.690> all<00:07:02.870> they<00:07:03.110> actually<00:07:03.620> have

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
not flimsy at all they actually have

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.490 
not flimsy at all they actually have
some<00:07:03.890> weight<00:07:04.190> behind<00:07:04.460> them<00:07:04.880> and<00:07:05.080> I<00:07:06.080> like<00:07:06.320> that

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
some weight behind them and I like that

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.000 
some weight behind them and I like that
a<00:07:06.530> lot

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
a lot

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.870
