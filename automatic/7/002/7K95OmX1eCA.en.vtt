put in two groups

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.289 
put in two groups
maybe<00:03:09.480> there's<00:03:09.719> gonna<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:10.049> some<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.680> odd

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
maybe there's gonna be some really odd

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.420 
maybe there's gonna be some really odd
shaped<00:03:12.299> groups<00:03:12.659> I<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:13.019> really<00:03:13.169> know<00:03:13.430> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
shaped groups I don't really know the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.770 
shaped groups I don't really know the
two<00:03:14.669> other<00:03:15.199> episodes<00:03:16.199> episode<00:03:17.010> 396<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.970> 397

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
two other episodes episode 396 and 397

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.719 
two other episodes episode 396 and 397
it<00:03:19.349> seems<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.129> is<00:03:20.190> pretty<00:03:20.519> much<00:03:20.609> the

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
it seems that this is pretty much the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:25.399 
it seems that this is pretty much the
start<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:22.019> Chunin<00:03:22.290> exam<00:03:22.799> itself<00:03:23.930> with<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
start of the Chunin exam itself with a

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.990 
start of the Chunin exam itself with a
belief<00:03:25.979> first<00:03:26.310> first<00:03:26.519> we're<00:03:26.669> gonna<00:03:26.760> see<00:03:26.970> that

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
belief first first we're gonna see that

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.869 
belief first first we're gonna see that
test<00:03:27.689> the<00:03:28.199> written<00:03:28.530> exam<00:03:28.949> where<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.519> have<00:03:29.699> to

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
test the written exam where you have to

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.189 
test the written exam where you have to
basically<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:30.689> cheat<00:03:31.099> to<00:03:32.099> get<00:03:32.750> high<00:03:33.750> scores

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
basically like cheat to get high scores

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.559 
basically like cheat to get high scores
and<00:03:34.500> pass<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.069> all<00:03:35.129> that<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.900> me<00:03:37.549> these

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
and pass and all that so to me these

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.939 
and pass and all that so to me these
episodes<00:03:39.569> they<00:03:40.400> seem<00:03:41.400> promising<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:43.049> don't

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
episodes they seem promising I don't

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.179 
episodes they seem promising I don't
know<00:03:44.129> it's<00:03:44.519> fillers<00:03:45.000> without<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.840> fillers

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
know it's fillers without the fillers

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.969 
know it's fillers without the fillers
they<00:03:47.189> they<00:03:47.729> can<00:03:48.030> be<00:03:48.299> actually<00:03:48.629> good<00:03:49.229> at<00:03:49.530> some

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
they they can be actually good at some

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.360 
they they can be actually good at some
points<00:03:50.549> but<00:03:50.699> they<00:03:51.359> can<00:03:51.769> monumentally<00:03:52.769> suck<00:03:53.159> at

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
points but they can monumentally suck at

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.659 
points but they can monumentally suck at
the<00:03:53.489> same<00:03:53.729> time<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.329> it's<00:03:54.989> pretty<00:03:55.229> much<00:03:55.500> like

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
the same time so it's pretty much like

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.339 
the same time so it's pretty much like
juggling<00:03:56.669> and<00:03:57.060> seeing<00:03:57.509> what's<00:03:57.810> gonna<00:03:57.930> happen

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
juggling and seeing what's gonna happen

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.270 
juggling and seeing what's gonna happen
now<00:03:59.040> some<00:04:00.000> additional<00:04:00.359> information<00:04:00.989> or<00:04:01.319> we

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
now some additional information or we

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.869 
now some additional information or we
actually<00:04:02.639> we're<00:04:03.120> going<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.389> get<00:04:03.569> a<00:04:03.780> new<00:04:04.019> ending

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879
