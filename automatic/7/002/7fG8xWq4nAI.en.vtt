00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
think you brought up before in the show

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.270 
think you brought up before in the show
yeah<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.630> he<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.409> quoted<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.799> saying<00:01:46.829> I'm

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
yeah he was he was quoted as saying I'm

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.149 
yeah he was he was quoted as saying I'm
kind<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.790> creating<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> problem<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.689> well<00:01:49.159> I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
kind of creating the problem as well I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.130 
kind of creating the problem as well I
guess<00:01:51.090> he<00:01:51.210> needs<00:01:51.390> shedding<00:01:51.840> light<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
guess he needs shedding light in the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
guess he needs shedding light in the
fact<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:52.860> games<00:01:53.180> um<00:01:54.180> I
