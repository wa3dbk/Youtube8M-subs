00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.230
 part one of the away double pack on the 32nd 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.419
 and 33 days will take you to beautiful Hessen 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.460
 for harmony with frankfurt and power 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.859
 dozens full it is the twelfth league 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 clash between tsg and sg 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:33.370
 a guest appearance at home strong 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.339
 hosts very offensive 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.540
 Team, of course, too 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:45.010
 got a few more goals 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.609
 but also relatively dangerous against them 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.030
 troop to play this team because 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:54.460
 Of course, you have everything at home 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.640
 also extremely strong, I think nine 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.510
 play in a row now at home too 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.760
 not lost 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.399
 exactly right last defeat of the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.119
 Harmony on the eleventh day of the game 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.039
 That's it 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.810
 however one waits at the main also 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.820
 ready for six league games on one 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.110
 won four defeats and two draws 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.119
 stand to book 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.119
 ask the trainer 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.869
 work moment the feeling somewhere 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:28.420
 That's a grateful adversary 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.450
 no matter who we play against 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.690
 we have to get the best out of it otherwise 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.259
 rausholen that did not last so 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.119
 Well, they also know that they are 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.940
 Last week did not hit so well 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.880
 what was your real strength 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.009
 probably also due to the lack of 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.220
 meyer and now also from last ones 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.690
 That's why I think that's what they do 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.050
 harmony determines everything staggered 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.570
 spit again and turn a good one 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.370
 home presentation to deliver but not 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.530
 only front krems in the concord is 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.950
 meanwhile something like the shooting gallery 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.680
 the league had 60 goals in 31 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.960
 playing makes 19 in the cut and then 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.390
 comes just this opponent with 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.460
 the quote norder storm sure my 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.290
 Rosenheim Strong We do not have to be long 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.450
 to talk or discuss 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.610
 three points and falls talking long 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.320
 not in frankfurt makes nothing for the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.170
 tsg is about it again 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.580
 climb at the best of eighth place 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.240
 on the upside altogether I believe one 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.520
 dangerous opponent 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.770
 to be on the lookout because she has to 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.170
 at any time no matter what games 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.700
 I saw 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.220
 play lost but always with 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.850
 incredible commitment to the future 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.920
 play and certainly big challenge 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.870
 also because there are light opponents in the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.930
 Bundesliga just does not exist what is there 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.830
 more comfortable away games than those at 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.830
 Eintracht Frankfurt
