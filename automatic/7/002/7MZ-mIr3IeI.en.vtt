easily remove this cover access the chip
and<00:02:33.579> sets<00:02:33.940> up<00:02:35.250> both<00:02:36.250> exhausted

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
and sets up both exhausted

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.040 
and sets up both exhausted
and<00:02:38.290> at<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> front<00:02:38.770> part<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.270> remove

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
and at the front part then just remove

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.620 
and at the front part then just remove
the<00:02:43.110> front<00:02:44.110> panel<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.709> access<00:02:45.340> get<00:02:46.180> an<00:02:46.300> access

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
the front panel and access get an access

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the front panel and access get an access
on<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.990> two<00:02:47.260> fans<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.090> part<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.330> think<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.080> to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
on the two fans the part I think it's to

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.770 
on the two fans the part I think it's to
read<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:52.300> trans<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.970> others<00:02:54.970> apart<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.600> this

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
read that trans and others apart is this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.970 
read that trans and others apart is this
one<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:58.390> for<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.750> reset<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.350> one<00:02:59.709> for<00:02:59.950> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
one one for the reset and one for the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:14.940 
one one for the reset and one for the
fan<00:03:00.310> controller<00:03:13.230> okay<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.290> let's<00:03:14.680> try<00:03:14.890> to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
fan controller okay so let's try to

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.990 
fan controller okay so let's try to
access<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.700> inside<00:03:16.540> stuff<00:03:18.360> can<00:03:19.360> do<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.340> you

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
access the inside stuff can do it so you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.400 
access the inside stuff can do it so you
can<00:03:22.150> see<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.390> man<00:03:22.600> one<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.739> two<00:03:24.010> USB<00:03:24.970> 2.0<00:03:25.690> and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
can see the man one the two USB 2.0 and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.820 
can see the man one the two USB 2.0 and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
those PC enthusiasts who are in a body

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.940

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
and you are trying to look for a casing

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.850 
and you are trying to look for a casing
with<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.190> most<00:03:51.400> complete<00:03:51.640> design<00:03:52.860> especially

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
with the most complete design especially

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.069 
with the most complete design especially
on<00:03:53.980> air<00:03:54.220> cooling<00:03:54.610> or<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.390> cooling<00:03:55.720> system

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
on air cooling or on the cooling system

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.600 
on air cooling or on the cooling system
I<00:03:56.230> think<00:03:56.410> this<00:03:56.799> is<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.040> best<00:03:57.250> case<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.670> way<00:03:58.140> so

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
I think this is the best case of way so

could you

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.040 
could you
is<00:04:54.010> there<00:04:54.190> any<00:04:54.370> case<00:04:54.520> in<00:04:54.550> like<00:04:54.790> that<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:55.870> is

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
is there any case in like that it is

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.820 
is there any case in like that it is
very<00:04:56.380> thick<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:57.580> has<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.790> very<00:04:58.290> high<00:04:59.290> beat<00:04:59.590> our

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
very thick it has a very high beat our

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.700 
very thick it has a very high beat our
gaming<00:05:00.220> design<00:05:00.460> so<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.600> think<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.470> the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
gaming design so I think this is the

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.770 
gaming design so I think this is the
most<00:05:02.920> complete<00:05:03.310> especially<00:05:03.670> for<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:04.420> I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
most complete especially for this I

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.940 
most complete especially for this I
think<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:06.340> have<00:05:06.460> watched<00:05:06.760> Robocop<00:05:07.420> I<00:05:07.950> don't

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
think you have watched Robocop I don't

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.950 
think you have watched Robocop I don't
know<00:05:09.040> I<00:05:09.340> don't<00:05:09.490> want<00:05:09.670> to<00:05:09.820> tell<00:05:10.030> them<00:05:10.360> but<00:05:10.720> it's

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
know I don't want to tell them but it's

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.350 
know I don't want to tell them but it's
one<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.890> issues<00:05:12.040> that<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.610> really<00:05:13.030> notice

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
one of the issues that I really notice

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.400 
one of the issues that I really notice
on<00:05:13.510> this<00:05:13.630> case<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:16.030> gunmetal<00:05:16.420> color<00:05:16.720> is

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
on this case the gunmetal color is

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.760 
on this case the gunmetal color is
greeted<00:05:17.890> but<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.850> glossy<00:05:19.360> black<00:05:19.750> in<00:05:20.170> here<00:05:20.560> is

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
greeted but this glossy black in here is

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.730 
greeted but this glossy black in here is
something<00:05:21.700> that<00:05:21.910> I<00:05:22.270> think<00:05:22.900> I<00:05:23.170> want<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.440> remove

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
something that I think I want to remove

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.170 
something that I think I want to remove
it

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
it

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.780 
it
okay<00:05:25.180> so<00:05:25.810> anyway<00:05:26.260> that's<00:05:26.920> nothing<00:05:27.430> for<00:05:27.460> the

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
okay so anyway that's nothing for the
