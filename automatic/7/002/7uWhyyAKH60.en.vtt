have prices which are the students out
when<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.680> countries<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:05.340> because

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
when you have countries will because

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.120 
when you have countries will because
including<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.750> would<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.650> what<00:02:07.770> about<00:02:07.979> in

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
including that would have what about in

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.150 
including that would have what about in
countries<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.760> say<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:09.570> UK<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.979> might

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
countries as I say in the UK there might

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.300 
countries as I say in the UK there might
be<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.660> number<00:02:12.660> twenty<00:02:13.470> percent<00:02:13.740> difference<00:02:13.950> in

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
be a number twenty percent difference in

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.130 
be a number twenty percent difference in
price<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.000> another<00:02:15.120> country<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.660> much

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
price and then in another country a much

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.280 
price and then in another country a much
bigger<00:02:16.440> difference<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.010> price<00:02:17.220> would<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.610> be

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
bigger difference in price would that be

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.620 
bigger difference in price would that be
because<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.530> our<00:02:19.830> stock<00:02:20.790> levels<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.330> something

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
because of our stock levels or something

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.040 
because of our stock levels or something
like<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.780> well<00:02:22.260> no<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:24.209> mean<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.840> some

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
like that well no I mean there are some

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.190 
like that well no I mean there are some
all<00:02:26.010> week<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.489> subsidiaries<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
all week and subsidiaries there is a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.490 
all week and subsidiaries there is a
certain<00:02:28.590> price<00:02:28.770> policy<00:02:29.070> and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
certain price policy and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.410 
certain price policy and
for<00:02:31.500> sure<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.880> connected

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
for sure but this is not connected

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.310 
for sure but this is not connected
similar<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.080> top-level<00:02:35.090> availability<00:02:36.090> or

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
similar to top-level availability or

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.170 
similar to top-level availability or
it's<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:37.620> certain<00:02:38.280> price<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> product

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
it's just certain price for the product

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.270 
it's just certain price for the product
and<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.020> should<00:02:40.260> come<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.590> about<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.070> same

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and so it should come out about the same

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.580 
and so it should come out about the same
yes<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.870> example<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.560> have

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
yes but we have this example if you have

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.220 
yes but we have this example if you have
everything<00:02:44.400> which<00:02:44.790> needs<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.240> another<00:02:45.660> in

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
everything which needs to be another in

everything which needs to be another in

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
terms of Texas insulin you should be

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.840 
terms of Texas insulin you should be
around<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.500> same<00:02:49.740> price<00:02:49.770> there<00:02:50.640> might<00:02:50.820> be

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
around the same price there might be

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.240 
around the same price there might be
minor<00:02:51.270> differences<00:02:52.050> regarding<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.130> know

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
minor differences regarding you know

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.030 
minor differences regarding you know
selling<00:02:53.700> price<00:02:53.970> which<00:02:54.270> might<00:02:54.480> be<00:02:54.770> 19<00:02:55.770> or

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
selling price which might be 19 or

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
something no local currency as well so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.830 
something no local currency as well so
but<00:03:02.130> not<00:03:02.370> major<00:03:02.970> major<00:03:03.360> charms<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:05.480> guess<00:03:06.480> until

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
but not major major charms I guess until

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.440 
but not major major charms I guess until
it<00:03:06.990> really<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.400> stores<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:09.120> won't<00:03:09.330> know

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
it really is in the stores we won't know

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.510 
it really is in the stores we won't know
what<00:03:09.630> they're<00:03:09.810> selling<00:03:10.050> for<00:03:10.340> moving<00:03:11.340> forward

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
what they're selling for moving forward

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.200 
what they're selling for moving forward
anyway<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:13.640> differentiating<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.850> from<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
anyway so differentiating it from the

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.360 
anyway so differentiating it from the
800<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.750> think<00:03:15.960> everyone<00:03:16.530> watching<00:03:16.920> knows<00:03:17.130> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
system is really built to be more

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.440 
system is really built to be more
accessible<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.489> open<00:04:09.849> too<00:04:10.719> much

and<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:13.290> sensor<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.890> one<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.160> brand<00:04:14.459> new

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
and the sensor in that one is brand new

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.699 
and the sensor in that one is brand new
that<00:04:15.090> hasn't<00:04:15.540> been<00:04:15.690> used<00:04:15.930> obviously<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.590> any

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
that hasn't been used obviously in any

and so the the 800 to come out with the
a<00:05:10.180> variant<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.990> know<00:05:11.530> we<00:05:11.740> can<00:05:11.770> talk<00:05:12.069> about

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189 
a variant I know we can talk about

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.830 
a variant I know we can talk about
future<00:05:12.520> models<00:05:13.060> but<00:05:13.210> was<00:05:13.449> there<00:05:13.569> a<00:05:13.599> reason

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
future models but was there a reason

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.899 
future models but was there a reason
they<00:05:14.139> didn't<00:05:14.530> offer<00:05:14.710> any<00:05:15.189> variant<00:05:15.610> with<00:05:15.729> this

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
they didn't offer any variant with this

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.140 
they didn't offer any variant with this
one<00:05:16.919> one<00:05:17.919> of<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.099> main<00:05:18.280> reasons<00:05:18.669> is<00:05:18.759> that<00:05:18.819> this

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
one one of the main reasons is that this

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.379 
one one of the main reasons is that this
is<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.800> model<00:05:20.800> which<00:05:21.069> is<00:05:21.099> targeted<00:05:23.550> d800e<00:05:24.550> for

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
the very high resolutions was a very

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.240 
the very high resolutions was a very
interesting<00:05:28.169> for<00:05:29.250> professional
