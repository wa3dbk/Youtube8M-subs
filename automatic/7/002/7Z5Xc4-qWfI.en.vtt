00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.560
 I stay here again Tutorials like today are around for once 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:07.250
 not a high tutorial 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.049
 but one order 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.179
 dpa 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.830
 fell ill by the year Poß said that Röhrig had the people percent because I have 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.139
 but started in the way 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.880
 does it work with the quality does not bring anything 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.789
 around 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.839
 IG Metall Brewery c Primacom if it works 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.460
 so on 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 The first thing he needs is two objects 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.979
 Lammert may 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.070
 there are 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.260
 without NCAP the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.090
 The same goes 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090
 So where does that have to do soon? 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 then emphasize the money about Hans Bosshard 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.810
 and then around 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.170
 Vest 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.420
 not only that you wanted to adjust so first 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.090
 there their limit is al Foster Lambert is lol to kill Devil Hills 0 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.350
 EGS minimum 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.360
 is 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.170
 180 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.280
 x Mark Mobius one hundred and eighty and nomination of the 180th 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.100
 Witte Thiel and Maximo with around 80 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.119
 Ticks with Nemo mission at 80 even Max Irons one hundred and eighty Ixquick blokes 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.590
 Boarding becomes b 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.650
 si 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.860
 we are myself I would 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 - if there is one too 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.320
 already on 4 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 Dante 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 just have to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.230
 the 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 connect with it and what comes now is cool 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
 Rui 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.230
 year 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 they're moving the same way 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.370
 Kramer had seen it before 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.500
 that's nice 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.750
 really 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 practically pro for that shows right now 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.940
 around 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.640
 for example 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.690
 here leads 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.790
 I am supposed to do two Brits now 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.060
 Percent I did just like the glass bottles I have 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.810
 quasi IZM example II 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.810
 right-hand with the computers of a doll or 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.269
 put and left Legrand from Banco Popular as I have all body parts 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.959
 same thing 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.269
 Sorg and then the league would not have to move pretty much the same 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.099
 he added Hoeneß 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.049
 Years began to poses and normal 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.379
 chicks must be able to get together 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.090
 and he always stays in this shape in front in the cut as long as the other figure 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.039
 about duty 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 for example like that 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.309
 around 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.269
 that he can make a method out of it with it 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.019
 and still today is for example and this car put that works 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.569
 Similar to a similar method I just have it 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.309
 this wheel is driven and connected with the problems driven by this prediction 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.750
 Now if you press this button then I would actually do that thing 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.750
 set off 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.109
 where Pallas him 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.119
 so percent 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.729
 so outdated again 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:35.189
 Vest IZ he is not as if he's not alone with himself 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:36.809
 so easy 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:41.879
 You can also do other things like Arcade or something so easy 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.339
 I just had to build the rocket 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:48.439
 So basically works the same way as the other synonymous I have you connected 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.719
 Steel girder and this weird moon 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.499
 around and 2 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.199
 the chambers as well as in tone 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.889
 Injoy distract yourself 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.679
 Gate and 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.989
 it suggests here for the first time up-beat grand prix in Minden 2 2 JTS ob 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:04.320
 Eck 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 then there will appear all the packages you will say 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.769
 Danger 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.769
 Rochat 4 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.319
 not be more expensive here with this comic opera without 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.319
 only at 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.469
 that's a bit of a look around here like you are here 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.449
 Crew is flying 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.409
 You have to get used to it first 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.669
 but instead of the quasi with the mouse but that's not always so safe 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 percent 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.370
 so way 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.180
 much higher in Kunduz 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.550
 you could make it a trip that you Pinto PID him 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.900
 Carlo 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.749
 I believe the word is also feasible 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:08.539
 Soymilk built around insisted which actually works exactly and accurately 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.539
 like the other one as well so Altena's getting show is gone 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:16.709
 So Ellrich is on the Grid IT, so do the elo Grosz 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.719
 Of course, this will not have noticed 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.539
 Summer so you can kill and percent the richest region in the country 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.699
 Leave pauli-tor there 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.620
 and therefore one came to the corner 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.620
 Rupert Stadler 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.210
 crap 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.559
 around 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:41.860
 Altena Robert IDE Kathan around 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.860
 complicity 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 and 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.789
 Catena at the joystick up in the middle 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.110
 Burgkirchen 9 So there it was 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.249
 Gum swimming-theirs 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:01.740
 Klingenthal ots that was it 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.599
 the camaraderie market 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.189
 and then you threaten 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.409
 shoot and with that you can not close Antonov so bad 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.169
 occurs next to her self 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.219
 I killed myself trap 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.189
 Federer not 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.939
 the parents too smart 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.990
 Well, definitely 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.539
 That's what you can do with children Edwards Postacute 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.519
 that was it for now my patience
