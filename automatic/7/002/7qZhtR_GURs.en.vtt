00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.930
 benefits of green tea and everything 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.930
 you need to know about this infusion 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.990
 I am lorena romero nutritionist and 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.790
 founder in aesthetic nutrition and in 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.620
 this video I will explain what are 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.110
 the true properties of green tea 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.910
 green tea has three benefits 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.440
 main you should know the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 first is that you have greater concentration 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.270
 antioxidants and this is due to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.220
 this variety is from is much less 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.650
 processed the second benefit 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.410
 important is that this prevents you and 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.840
 slows cell growth 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 cancers of prostate and breast there are several 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.400
 studies that show that men who 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 regularly consume this tea have 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.360
 less inflammation in the tissue 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.030
 prostate and lower levels of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.489
 protein even though it is an indicator of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.989
 prostate cancer the third benefit is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.089
 that green tea has much lower 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.550
 concentration of caffeine than others 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.620
 types of tea its benefits are derived 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.059
 mainly because of its large amount of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 a group of components called 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.479
 catechins that belong to the group of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.799
 flavonoids that are polyphenols ok I know 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.270
 that there have been too many weird names 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.250
 but how important you are 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.020
 the catechins are powerful 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.329
 antioxidants that help us improve 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.700
 our cardiovascular system us 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.009
 be immune and as I mentioned to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.899
 decrease and prevent the risk of 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.729
 cancer the catechins are also 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.890
 responsible for the slight bitter taste of 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.259
 this tea so if you do not like the taste 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 at least we will see that it is consumed 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.310
 a lot of antioxidants a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.170
 additional benefit of this tea that does not 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.209
 it has to do with catechins is that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.640
 contains an amino acid called theanine 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:44.189
 which has a great calming effect 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.439
 and relaxing I hope this information 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.329
