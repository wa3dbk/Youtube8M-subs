00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
got such large openings that it can

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
got such large openings that it can
shift<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.510> easily<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:52.980> I'm

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
sort of watercolor pencil will work and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.760 
sort of watercolor pencil will work and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
just lightly scribbling in between all

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.850 
just lightly scribbling in between all
the<00:01:01.949> openings<00:01:02.399> created<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.239> stencil

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
the openings created with the stencil

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.140 
the openings created with the stencil
this<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.280> technique<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.760> picked<00:01:05.970> up

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
this was a little technique I picked up

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
this was a little technique I picked up
in<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.720> online<00:01:07.049> card<00:01:07.979> classes<00:01:08.460> stenciled

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
in that online card classes stenciled

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.429 
in that online card classes stenciled
class<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> take<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> step

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
class but I'm going to take it a step

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.660 
class but I'm going to take it a step
further<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.189> said<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.460> actually

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
further and like I said I'm actually

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910 
going to watercolor this but I wanted to
create<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:14.670> texture<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.869> pencils<00:01:16.619> in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920

with<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.649> didn't<00:01:46.950> care<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.520> didn't<00:01:48.030> mind<00:01:48.149> if

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
with this I didn't care I didn't mind if

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
with this I didn't care I didn't mind if
the<00:01:48.420> water<00:01:48.630> went<00:01:49.320> wherever<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.860> went<00:01:50.009> because

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the water went wherever it went because

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.480 
the water went wherever it went because
i'm<00:01:51.119> using<00:01:51.180> heavyweight<00:01:51.810> watercolor<00:01:52.259> paper

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
i'm using heavyweight watercolor paper

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.819 
i'm using heavyweight watercolor paper
so<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.030> quite<00:01:54.240> saturated<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.140> i<00:01:55.590> knew

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
so it can get quite saturated and i knew

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
so it can get quite saturated and i knew
with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.130> inktense<00:01:56.549> pencils<00:01:57.060> you'd<00:01:57.240> still<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
with the inktense pencils you'd still be

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.569 
with the inktense pencils you'd still be
able<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> texture<00:01:58.950> even<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.430> i<00:01:59.520> did

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
able to see the texture even if i did

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
able to see the texture even if i did
decide<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> watercolor<00:02:01.320> everywhere

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
decide to kind of watercolor everywhere

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.190 
decide to kind of watercolor everywhere
and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:02.909> another<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.540> faq<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> ink

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and then another little faq with the ink

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.050 
and then another little faq with the ink
tents<00:02:04.560> which<00:02:04.710> i<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.009> again<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:05.850> keep

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
tents which i actually again for keep

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.550 
tents which i actually again for keep
forgetting<00:02:06.479> about<00:02:06.570> i'm<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.259> used<00:02:07.320> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
forgetting about i'm just not used to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.889 
forgetting about i'm just not used to
using<00:02:07.680> them<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.129> once<00:02:08.879> they<00:02:09.119> dry<00:02:09.390> their

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
using them is once they dry their

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.170 
using them is once they dry their
permanent<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.819> go<00:02:11.940> over

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
permanent so you can kind of go over

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.220 
permanent so you can kind of go over
them<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.360> this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
them like this

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.449 
them like this
and<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.440> not<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.830> move<00:02:13.950> very<00:02:14.099> much<00:02:14.190> but

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
and it's not going to move very much but

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.430 
and it's not going to move very much but
as<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.819> closer<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> bottom<00:02:15.659> I'm<00:02:16.200> still

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
as I get closer to the bottom I'm still

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.809 
as I get closer to the bottom I'm still
going<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> bit<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.280> movement<00:02:17.430> there

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
going to get a bit of movement there

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.420 
going to get a bit of movement there
because<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.299> hasn't<00:02:18.450> fully<00:02:18.690> dried<00:02:19.049> yet<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:20.129> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
because it hasn't fully dried yet so it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.039 
because it hasn't fully dried yet so it
gives<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.909> really<00:02:20.940> neat<00:02:21.390> effect<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.930> can

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
gives a really neat effect so you can

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.140 
gives a really neat effect so you can
still<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.500> some<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.280> texture<00:02:23.640> i<00:02:23.670> created

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
still see some of the texture i created

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.780 
still see some of the texture i created
by<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.319> scribbling<00:02:25.799> between<00:02:26.099> stencil<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
by the scribbling between stencil and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.300 
by the scribbling between stencil and
yet<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:27.629> kind<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.900> watercolor<00:02:28.409> e<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.950> just

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
yet it's kind of watercolor e and just

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
yet it's kind of watercolor e and just
neat<00:02:29.549> looking<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.360> something<00:02:30.750> really

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
neat looking so it's something really

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.650 
neat looking so it's something really
fun<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.440> play<00:02:31.620> with<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:32.190> once<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.180> was<00:02:33.330> happy

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
fun to play with so once I was happy

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.539 
fun to play with so once I was happy
with<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.530> used<00:02:34.680> my<00:02:34.830> heat<00:02:34.860> tool<00:02:35.069> to

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
with it I just used my heat tool to

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.509 
with it I just used my heat tool to
drive<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:36.090> speed<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.480> process<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.340> then

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
drive to speed up the process and then

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.890 
drive to speed up the process and then
kind<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.970> bent<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.269> back<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.599> forth<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
kind of bent it back and forth to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.119 
kind of bent it back and forth to
flatten<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.260> out<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.410> little<00:02:40.650> bit<00:02:40.799> because<00:02:40.920> it

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
flatten it out a little bit because it

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.559 
flatten it out a little bit because it
does<00:02:41.280> tend<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.610> curl<00:02:41.849> especially<00:02:42.329> if<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.450> get

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
does tend to curl especially if you get

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.509 
does tend to curl especially if you get
it<00:02:42.659> really<00:02:42.840> wet<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.230> then<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.099> want<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.310> add<00:02:44.370> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
it really wet and then I want to add it

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.990 
it really wet and then I want to add it
a<00:02:44.579> few<00:02:44.760> splatters<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> used<00:02:46.200> my<00:02:46.549> MFG<00:02:47.549> blue

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
a few splatters so I used my MFG blue

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.479 
a few splatters so I used my MFG blue
raspberry<00:02:48.209> ink<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.079> press<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.950> an

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
raspberry ink and just press it on to an

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.800 
raspberry ink and just press it on to an
acrylic<00:02:50.849> block<00:02:50.879> added<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.420> bit<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.569> water

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
acrylic block added a bit of water

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.869 
acrylic block added a bit of water
picked<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.739> up<00:02:52.799> with<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> water<00:02:53.250> brush<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.849> a

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
picked it up with a water brush like a

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.580 
picked it up with a water brush like a
just<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.359> regular<00:02:54.540> water<00:02:54.870> color<00:02:55.079> brush<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
just a regular water color brush and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.259 
just a regular water color brush and
then<00:02:55.620> flicked<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.340> over<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.819> card<00:02:57.030> stock

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
then flicked that over the card stock

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.970 
then flicked that over the card stock
and<00:02:57.480> then<00:02:57.569> wiped<00:02:58.019> up<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> whole<00:02:58.590> mess<00:02:58.799> because

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
and then wiped up the whole mess because

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.220 
and then wiped up the whole mess because
of<00:02:59.069> course<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.400> gets<00:02:59.459> everywhere<00:03:00.109> but<00:03:01.109> wipe

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
of course it gets everywhere but wipe

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.750 
of course it gets everywhere but wipe
that<00:03:01.410> up<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.829> don't<00:03:02.010> end<00:03:02.099> up<00:03:02.250> picking<00:03:02.459> up

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that up so I don't end up picking up

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.210 
that up so I don't end up picking up
color<00:03:03.120> all<00:03:03.359> over<00:03:03.450> everything<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:04.829> then<00:03:04.980> just

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
color all over everything and then just

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.949 
color all over everything and then just
sponge<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.760> edges<00:03:05.790> with<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.390> same<00:03:06.660> blue

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
sponge the edges with that same blue

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.699 
sponge the edges with that same blue
raspberry<00:03:07.379> ink<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.579> soften<00:03:08.970> everything

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
raspberry ink just to soften everything

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.860 
raspberry ink just to soften everything
and<00:03:10.709> then<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.040> had<00:03:11.310> some<00:03:11.549> gold<00:03:11.879> foil<00:03:12.239> paper<00:03:12.540> my

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
and then I had some gold foil paper my

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.369 
and then I had some gold foil paper my
stash<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.950> die<00:03:14.190> cut<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.540> anchor<00:03:15.750> with<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
stash so I die cut the anchor with the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
let's get nautical dynamics and then I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.710 
let's get nautical dynamics and then I
die<00:03:19.590> cut<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.280> piece<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:21.359> blue<00:03:21.510> raspberry

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
die cut a little piece of blue raspberry

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.640 
die cut a little piece of blue raspberry
cardstock<00:03:22.380> with<00:03:22.680> one<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.370> fishtail<00:03:24.090> flags

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
cardstock with one of the fishtail flags

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.520 
cardstock with one of the fishtail flags
dynamics<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.950> I'm<00:03:26.519> inking<00:03:26.849> up<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.329> stamp<00:03:28.109> from

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
dynamics and I'm inking up a stamp from

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.190 
dynamics and I'm inking up a stamp from
the<00:03:28.829> go<00:03:28.950> overboard<00:03:29.310> stamp<00:03:29.760> set<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:31.019> of

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the go overboard stamp set and that of

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.599 
the go overboard stamp set and that of
course<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:31.829> thought<00:03:31.950> all<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.370> would<00:03:32.579> go

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
course I just thought all this would go

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.089 
course I just thought all this would go
perfectly<00:03:33.120> with<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.569> wave<00:03:33.900> stencil<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:34.980> this

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
perfectly with this wave stencil in this

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.400 
perfectly with this wave stencil in this
whole<00:03:35.250> theme<00:03:35.639> so<00:03:36.120> stamp<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
whole theme so stamp that on to the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.370 
whole theme so stamp that on to the
little<00:03:38.010> fish<00:03:38.190> tail<00:03:38.430> flag<00:03:38.730> there<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.319> wanted<00:03:40.319> to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
little fish tail flag there I wanted to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.830 
little fish tail flag there I wanted to
keep<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:41.220> embellishments<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.269> any<00:03:42.540> layers

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840

need to be able to see all these little
water<00:03:48.569> colored<00:03:48.870> waves<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.980> once<00:03:50.280> i<00:03:50.400> was<00:03:50.519> happy

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
water colored waves so once i was happy

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.180 
water colored waves so once i was happy
with<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.060> placement<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.690> got<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.049> adhered<00:03:53.010> on

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
with the placement I got that adhered on

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.949 
with the placement I got that adhered on
to<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.730> watercolor<00:03:54.209> paper<00:03:54.419> and<00:03:54.750> then<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.900> just

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
to the watercolor paper and then I just

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.559 
to the watercolor paper and then I just
flip<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.380> over<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.919> use<00:03:56.879> that<00:03:56.910> as<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.450> guide

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
flip that over and use that as a guide

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.360 
flip that over and use that as a guide
to<00:03:58.139> trim<00:03:58.470> off<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.650> little<00:03:58.919> bit<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.250> was

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
to trim off a little bit that was

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.379 
to trim off a little bit that was
hanging<00:03:59.549> off<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.879> edge<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.720> then<00:04:01.680> for<00:04:02.389> the

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
hanging off the edge and then for the

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.170 
hanging off the edge and then for the
anchor<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.230> grabbed<00:04:04.500> some<00:04:05.090> well<00:04:06.090> as

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
anchor I just grabbed some well as

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.940 
anchor I just grabbed some well as
technically<00:04:06.720> Baker's<00:04:07.169> twine<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:07.799> just

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
technically Baker's twine but it's just

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.000 
technically Baker's twine but it's just
plain<00:04:08.160> white<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.639> it's<00:04:08.790> not<00:04:08.910> striped<00:04:10.010> so

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
plain white like it's not striped so

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.819 
plain white like it's not striped so
yeah<00:04:11.129> Marie<00:04:11.579> Fred<00:04:11.879> anything<00:04:12.269> would<00:04:12.419> work<00:04:12.599> and

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
yeah Marie Fred anything would work and

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.710 
yeah Marie Fred anything would work and
threaded<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:14.010> through<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.790> anchor<00:04:15.359> and<00:04:15.629> I'm

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
threaded that through the anchor and I'm

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.240 
threaded that through the anchor and I'm
going<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.959> adhere<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.380> anchor<00:04:16.709> into<00:04:17.010> place

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
going to adhere the anchor into place

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.339 
going to adhere the anchor into place
and<00:04:17.609> then<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.239> fiddled<00:04:18.449> with<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.260> bit

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
and then I fiddled with it for a bit

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.409 
and then I fiddled with it for a bit
trying<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.919> figure<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.250> how<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.609> wanted<00:04:21.060> that

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
trying to figure out how I wanted that

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.890 
trying to figure out how I wanted that
to<00:04:21.659> go<00:04:22.700> yeah<00:04:23.700> but<00:04:23.969> the<00:04:24.180> joys<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.539> editing

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
to go yeah but the joys of editing

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.050 
to go yeah but the joys of editing
videos<00:04:25.229> as<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.500> could<00:04:25.710> cut<00:04:26.070> all<00:04:26.250> out<00:04:26.400> of

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
videos as I could cut all out of

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.060 
videos as I could cut all out of
it's<00:04:27.150> messing<00:04:27.570> around<00:04:27.690> with<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.139> but<00:04:28.410> kind<00:04:29.040> of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
it's messing around with it but kind of

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.290 
it's messing around with it but kind of
figured<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.490> wanted<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.850> off<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.180> side

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
figured I wanted it off to the side

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.060 
figured I wanted it off to the side
there<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:30.900> once<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.139> was<00:04:31.230> happy<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.710> trimmed

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
there so once I was happy that I trimmed

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.680 
there so once I was happy that I trimmed
off<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.250> extra<00:04:32.580> ends<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.150> then<00:04:33.210> taped<00:04:33.540> it

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
off the extra ends and then taped it

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.830 
off the extra ends and then taped it
down<00:04:33.840> really<00:04:34.110> well<00:04:34.230> on<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.740> back<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:36.270> got<00:04:36.630> that

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
down really well on the back so got that

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.870 
down really well on the back so got that
and<00:04:37.110> then<00:04:37.139> I<00:04:37.350> wanted<00:04:37.710> add<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.830> few<00:04:38.280> more<00:04:38.340> little

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
and then I wanted add a few more little

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.810 
and then I wanted add a few more little
embellishments<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:39.930> just<00:04:40.320> die<00:04:40.530> cut<00:04:40.860> another

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
embellishments so I just die cut another

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.440 
embellishments so I just die cut another
piece<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.419> that<00:04:42.600> foil<00:04:43.530> card<00:04:44.370> stock<00:04:44.669> with<00:04:44.940> a

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450

I<00:04:53.520> wanted<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.820> keep<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.090> pretty<00:04:54.240> simple<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:55.530> I'd

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
I wanted to keep it pretty simple so I'd

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.470 
I wanted to keep it pretty simple so I'd
purposely<00:04:56.190> cut<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.520> watercolor<00:04:56.910> paper<00:04:57.120> to

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
purposely cut the watercolor paper to

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.090 
purposely cut the watercolor paper to
four<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.020> quarter<00:04:58.230> by<00:04:58.560> five<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.070> half
