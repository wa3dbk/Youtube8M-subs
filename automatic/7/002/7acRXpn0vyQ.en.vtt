00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hi everyone, alright, thanks for being 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 watching this video and I have the voice 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.690
 Kind of like that because I got the flu 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.030
 this weekend also almost went 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 that's when I started I was unprepared and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.230
 just a great new plan here but 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 This time he attacked sonars. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.130
 fever gave nothing and today I will present 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.410
 that three cameras that I did not know 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.610
 Ana and this one came out just now that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.340
 wants to get the s5 dsr out of the canon and is a 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.920
 camera for shooting 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.999
 mainly in it is not made much 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.760
 for videos and it has a high resolution 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:44.249
 that they have 50 megapixels here in that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 of the type that we can do 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:50.300
 five photos per second the iso goes 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.239
 passwords and 400 in this sensitive up to 12800 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.539
 Absence gave 16 wherein n processors 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.609
 dual processor and but things 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.760
 of these modern cameras today in 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.769
 day the difference is the size of the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.890
 image that it produces that is 50 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.020
 megapixels I gigantic image 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.820
 that she came with a camera for studio 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.520
 even with high quality 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.479
 this new 5d of canon she has two 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.600
 she has these models and the difference 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 between rs is a filter that has low 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.280
 another that cancels the filter and this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.030
 which cancels the most costly yarn 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.930
 not cost $ 200 more expensive than 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.329
 common is the one here in bh's store has a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 call for sale but has not 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.180
 camera to sell and it really is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.259
 this same price is $ 3,900 that does not 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.200
 it's cheap 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.520
 the new camera that is leaving or already 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.070
 this new nikon of 7,200 goes out 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.950
 bring a slightly larger image, and the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.229
 the normal innovations of these cameras or 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.630
 It's always a little faster It has more 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.509
 cache memory to take more 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.679
 photos and record better and various 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.350
 other things ne 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.450
 in the end the price increases also clear, right? 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.820
 nikon is also launching this new 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.129
 three thousand three hundred also 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.670
 probably comes with the same 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.480
 saints 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 of 24 points 2 megapixels that is the same 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.360
 this sensor is that of the 7,200 or 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.459
 difference is the resistance of the body 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.090
 nor the construction of 7,200 for the 3,300 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.239
 necker 3,060 series 3 thousand 5 thousand and the series 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.330
 nikon's entrance and 7,000 already starts to 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.910
 slr series more top line that already has 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.920
 several other solutions there to use 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 these old lenses from Nikon and others 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.500
 lens accessories that also 7,200 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.590
 here she is costing cnaa the ama pain 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.080
 $ 1,196 without a lens or body 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.780
 also not cheap in the storefront 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.140
 novelty is that these cameras damaged 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.019
 is that they say that in this movie mad max was 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.610
 used in some scenes these cameras 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.250
 video of nikon nÃ© asm with sd lr used 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.370
 to shoot some scenes from this movie 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.280
 does not show the staging but say they 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.950
 that Nikon camera was used in this movie 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.720
 to know what scenes are we going 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.269
 have to wait for them to show us 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
 he is so we do not have as 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.859
 know which scenes were used 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.630
 cameras and we have to wait until the 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.359
 hour as well as show us 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.329
 what was in this scene that shows a 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:43.200
 assembly here was the original 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.560
 filmed in the media and here it is 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.940
 another scenario the sony also launched 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.480
 this alpha to 7s that was in the past launched 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.660
 her camera and she's selling it to that camera. 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.350
 that it is full frame 12 megapixels and 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.660
 4k video for the photo has few 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.650
 megapixels is a normal camera, right? 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.290
 and that to 7s that in particular and if this 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.230
 she's selling it, she's coming 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.530
 with a hd screen and a half of that mark 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.799
 atoms the goal here seven inches 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.039
 this little screen that is for you to film 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.340
 with this camera and view through the 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.130
 screen 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.550
 this set of sony that without milk only 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:36.040
 screen and the camera that full frame all 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:39.070
 is 4 thousand and 500 dollars 4493 dollars is 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.620
 almost $ 4,500 which is a price 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.510
 and you have to see what the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.870
 quality of the footage these cameras 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.090
 new here that are this new type 4k that 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.810
 It is certainly not easy to edit a 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.220
 4k si video because my normal here 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.820
 full hd 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.740
 every 15 minutes use 8 gb 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.030
 then it is quite possible that every 15 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.490
 minutes of that 4k that takes 16 gb of 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.639
 memory card or after the 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.560
 process this movie inside the editor 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.870
 you need a computer with enough 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.030
 ram memory 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.970
 on the video card is to be able to rotate 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.280
 this film without problem and then beyond 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.320
 everything has to render it that neither is 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.910
 something that takes my ass in 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.500
 video editing 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.090
 So that's it folks, thank you. 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.460
 headquarters this video until a range is 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.200
