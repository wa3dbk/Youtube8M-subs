I<00:02:20.739> think<00:02:21.340> some<00:02:21.519> of<00:02:21.549> my<00:02:21.819> steps<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.480> bowl

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:39.180 
I think some of my steps in this bowl
because<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.500> really<00:02:23.799> sitting<00:02:24.370> down
