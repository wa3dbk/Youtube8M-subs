but anyways you can pick up any of these
blocks<00:00:20.910> right<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.539> if<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.840> try<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> pick<00:00:23.010> up

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
blocks right here if you try to pick up

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.300

any custom spawner or any default

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
any custom spawner or any default
spawner<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.810> always<00:00:28.199> turns<00:00:28.680> into<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
spawner like so it always turns into a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.130 
spawner like so it always turns into a
pig<00:00:29.250> spawner<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.990> need

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
pig spawner but what you do is you need

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590 
pig spawner but what you do is you need
a<00:00:31.170> portal<00:00:31.619> gun<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.669> craft<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.180> portal<00:00:33.570> gun

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a portal gun and to craft a portal gun

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.459 
a portal gun and to craft a portal gun
you<00:00:34.200> need<00:00:34.489> to<00:00:35.489> obsidian<00:00:35.880> five<00:00:36.690> iron<00:00:36.989> one

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you need to obsidian five iron one

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
black hole consists of eight ender

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.270 
black hole consists of eight ender
pearls<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.750> nether<00:00:42.989> star<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
pearls and one nether star to get the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
pearls and one nether star to get the
ender<00:00:44.520> pearl<00:00:44.760> dust<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.210> need<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.660> under

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
ender pearl dust you need one under

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.799 
ender pearl dust you need one under
pearl<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:47.640> anyways<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.570> make

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
pearl but anyways that is how you make

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
pearl but anyways that is how you make
portal<00:00:49.289> gun<00:00:49.469> pretty<00:00:49.980> expensive<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.850> would

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
portal gun pretty expensive so I would

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.689 
portal gun pretty expensive so I would
assume<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.960> diamond<00:00:52.890> pickaxe<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:53.550> now

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
assume you have a diamond pickaxe by now

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
assume you have a diamond pickaxe by now
to<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.390> stuff<00:00:54.649> but<00:00:55.649> some<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to get all of this stuff but some of the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.500 
to get all of this stuff but some of the
stuff<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.789> can't<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
stuff you actually can't get with a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.810 
stuff you actually can't get with a
don't<00:00:57.809> pick<00:00:58.050> axe<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.469> silk<00:00:58.739> touch<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.640> for

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
don't pick axe of silk touch but for

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
don't pick axe of silk touch but for
example<00:01:00.239> these<00:01:00.390> spawners<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.829> want

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
example these spawners but what you want

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.500 
example these spawners but what you want
to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.879> pick<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.300> thing

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to do is you want to pick up the thing

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
to do is you want to pick up the thing
with<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> grab<00:01:04.229> function<00:01:04.860> which<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.250> G<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
with the grab function which is G and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
with the grab function which is G and
just<00:01:06.540> drop<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> torch<00:01:07.470> works<00:01:08.010> with

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
just drop it on the torch works with

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.440 
just drop it on the torch works with
machines<00:01:08.930> works<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.110> solar<00:01:10.439> panels<00:01:11.659> glass

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
machines works with solar panels glass

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:24.590 
machines works with solar panels glass
obsidian<00:01:18.799> also<00:01:19.799> works<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.189> beehives<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:23.600> so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
obsidian also works with beehives or so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.620 
obsidian also works with beehives or so
it's<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.080> useful<00:01:25.409> trick<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.759> could

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it's a really useful trick if you could

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's a really useful trick if you could
get<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> work<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> time<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.340> just

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
get it to work all the time you just

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.069 
get it to work all the time you just
have<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> place<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.750> amount<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
have to place it the right amount of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
have to place it the right amount of
blocks<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.770> torch<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.210> want<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
blocks over torch you don't want to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
blocks over torch you don't want to
place<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.409> where<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.250> torch<00:01:35.549> actually

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
place it like where the torch actually

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.969 
place it like where the torch actually
is<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.320> destroy

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is because that will actually destroy

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.050 
is because that will actually destroy
the<00:01:38.159> torch<00:01:39.619> sometimes<00:01:40.619> depends<00:01:41.579> how<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the torch sometimes depends how you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
the torch sometimes depends how you
place<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.689> i<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:43.020> placed<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.409> wrong<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.829> time

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
place it i just placed it wrong at time

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.580 
place it i just placed it wrong at time
but<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:45.420> also<00:01:45.750> works<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.670> barrels<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.390> way

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
but it also works with barrels in a way

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
but it also works with barrels in a way
see<00:01:49.590> how<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> craft<00:01:50.579> packet<00:01:51.060> maker<00:01:51.270> right

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
see how it is a craft packet maker right

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.319 
see how it is a craft packet maker right
now<00:01:52.070> yeah<00:01:53.070> watch<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:54.049> just<00:01:55.049> watch<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
now yeah watch this just watch you get a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.160 
now yeah watch this just watch you get a
craft<00:01:57.689> packet<00:01:58.200> maker<00:01:58.439> from<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.810> is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
craft packet maker from it that is
