00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:10.420 

you

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.560 

all<00:00:11.430> right<00:00:11.610> today<00:00:11.940> we're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> talk

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
all right today we're going to talk

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.010 
all right today we're going to talk
about<00:00:12.830> preparation<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> volley<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.150> it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
about preparation for the volley and it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.260 
about preparation for the volley and it
actually<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.740> be<00:00:16.770> quite<00:00:16.950> simple<00:00:17.700> in<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:18.090> two

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
actually can be quite simple in just two

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.290 
actually can be quite simple in just two
steps<00:00:18.770> because<00:00:19.770> too<00:00:19.980> many<00:00:20.160> times<00:00:20.460> people<00:00:20.730> make

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
steps because too many times people make

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970 
steps because too many times people make
too<00:00:21.540> many<00:00:21.689> things<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.320> they<00:00:22.500> prepare<00:00:22.950> for

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
too many things when they prepare for

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.359 
too many things when they prepare for
the<00:00:23.310> volleys<00:00:23.700> like<00:00:23.910> use<00:00:24.900> their<00:00:25.170> feet<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the volleys like use their feet the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.480 
the volleys like use their feet the
racket<00:00:26.820> goes<00:00:27.110> too<00:00:28.110> much<00:00:28.320> further<00:00:28.590> back<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.280> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
racket goes too much further back and so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.640 
racket goes too much further back and so
also<00:00:29.910> we're<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.020> simplify<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
also we're going to simplify the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
also we're going to simplify the
preparation<00:00:32.400> in<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:32.940> steps<00:00:33.320> but<00:00:34.320> before

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
preparation in just two steps but before

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.260 
preparation in just two steps but before
we<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.129> that<00:00:35.160> we're<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.090> one

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
we do that we're just going to do one

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.410 
we do that we're just going to do one
exercise<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> feel<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.030> hand

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
exercise to get the feel for the hand

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.009 
exercise to get the feel for the hand
and<00:00:39.720> this<00:00:40.290> exercise<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.129> simply<00:00:41.839> holding<00:00:42.839> the

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
and this exercise is simply holding the

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.229 
and this exercise is simply holding the
racket<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> front<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.220> and<00:00:44.550> you're

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
racket in front like this and you're

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.469 
racket in front like this and you're
just<00:00:45.269> going<00:00:45.989> 90<00:00:46.530> degrees<00:00:47.059> in<00:00:48.059> each<00:00:48.269> direction

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
just going 90 degrees in each direction

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.160 
just going 90 degrees in each direction
so<00:00:49.199> you're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.610> you're

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
so you're going like this and you're

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
so you're going like this and you're
just<00:00:52.170> doing<00:00:52.409> this<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> minute<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.420> get

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
just doing this like for a minute to get

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.680 
just doing this like for a minute to get
the<00:00:54.780> field<00:00:55.080> what<00:00:55.799> the<00:00:55.979> wrist<00:00:56.220> has<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.549> do<00:00:56.879> when

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the field what the wrist has to do when

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.530 
the field what the wrist has to do when
you<00:00:57.809> start<00:00:58.110> your<00:00:58.320> preparation<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> first

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
you start your preparation so first

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.189 
you start your preparation so first
you're<00:01:00.720> just<00:01:00.750> doing<00:01:01.170> 90<00:01:01.559> degrees<00:01:03.199> gently

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you're just doing 90 degrees gently

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.730 
you're just doing 90 degrees gently
slowly<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:05.580> let's<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.030> 45<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.290> go

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
slowly and then let's do 45 so you go

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.090 
slowly and then let's do 45 so you go
from<00:01:07.979> 45<00:01:08.549> degrees<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.119> 45<00:01:09.619> can<00:01:10.619> help<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.070> your

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
from 45 degrees to 45 can help with your

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.210 
from 45 degrees to 45 can help with your
hand<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:12.320> let's<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.980> feel

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
hand if you want let's just get the feel

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.480 
hand if you want let's just get the feel
what<00:01:14.460> does<00:01:14.640> 45<00:01:15.300> degrees<00:01:15.750> mean<00:01:16.020> roughly<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
what does 45 degrees mean roughly so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.910 
what does 45 degrees mean roughly so
roughly<00:01:17.940> 45<00:01:18.540> 5<00:01:19.170> degrees

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
roughly 45 5 degrees

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.219 
roughly 45 5 degrees
so<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.340> first<00:01:22.580> step<00:01:22.820> your<00:01:23.229> wrist

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
so that's the first step your wrist

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.730 
so that's the first step your wrist
turns<00:01:24.830> 45<00:01:25.729> degrees<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.420> then<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.140> next<00:01:27.560> step

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
turns 45 degrees and then the next step

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.760 
turns 45 degrees and then the next step
is<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:27.950> rotated<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.509> get<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.869> strings<00:01:30.409> point

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
is just rotated so get the strings point

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.660 
is just rotated so get the strings point
forward<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:32.240> 45<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.560> actually<00:01:34.070> we'll<00:01:34.280> notice

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
forward so 45 and actually we'll notice

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.980 
forward so 45 and actually we'll notice
that<00:01:34.820> your<00:01:35.270> body<00:01:35.540> turns<00:01:36.229> about<00:01:36.470> 45<00:01:37.310> degrees<00:01:37.729> -

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
that your body turns about 45 degrees -

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.570 
that your body turns about 45 degrees -
and<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.290> you're<00:01:39.470> ready<00:01:39.649> for<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.070> volley<00:01:40.310> and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
and so you're ready for the volley and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.520 
and so you're ready for the volley and
you<00:01:40.700> can<00:01:40.880> play<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:41.840> first<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.320> can<00:01:42.350> just

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
you can play so first you can just

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.690 
you can play so first you can just
practice<00:01:42.920> without<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.549> ball<00:01:44.229> 45<00:01:45.229> turn<00:01:45.770> see<00:01:46.640> if

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
practice without the ball 45 turn see if

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.940 
practice without the ball 45 turn see if
the<00:01:46.909> strings<00:01:47.240> point<00:01:47.570> forward<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.259> if<00:01:48.799> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
the strings point forward and if the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.490 
the strings point forward and if the
head<00:01:49.190> is<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:49.520> front<00:01:49.789> of<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:51.289> can

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
head is in front of you and you can

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.529 
head is in front of you and you can
simulate<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.100> volley<00:01:52.310> don't<00:01:53.090> do<00:01:53.270> anything

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
simulate the volley don't do anything

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.480 
simulate the volley don't do anything
special<00:01:54.229> with<00:01:54.350> your<00:01:54.530> feet<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.009> just<00:01:55.280> stay

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
special with your feet so just stay

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.559 
special with your feet so just stay
balanced<00:01:56.360> on<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.690> outside<00:01:57.140> foot<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:58.569> 45

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
balanced on the outside foot so 45

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.180 
balanced on the outside foot so 45
rotate<00:02:00.380> play<00:02:01.069> the<00:02:01.250> volley<00:02:01.659> 45<00:02:02.659> rotate<00:02:03.319> play

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
rotate play the volley 45 rotate play

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.340 
rotate play the volley 45 rotate play
the<00:02:04.340> volley<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.819> then<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.479> can<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.840> put

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the volley and then you can just put

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.960 
the volley and then you can just put
them<00:02:06.500> together<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:07.220> it's<00:02:07.369> one<00:02:08.300> smooth

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
them together so it's one smooth

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.850 
them together so it's one smooth
preparation<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.049> your<00:02:12.200> mind<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.650> know

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
preparation but in your mind you know

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.199 
preparation but in your mind you know
that<00:02:13.069> you're<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.400> doing<00:02:13.700> two<00:02:14.180> things

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
that you're actually doing two things

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.000 
that you're actually doing two things
one<00:02:14.900> two<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.799> one<00:02:16.610> two<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.860> make

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
one two and one two but you can make

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.630 
one two and one two but you can make
them<00:02:19.220> together<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:21.170> that's<00:02:21.440> that's<00:02:22.250> what<00:02:22.519> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
them together so that's that's what it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.550 
them together so that's that's what it
is<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:23.000> your<00:02:23.239> volley<00:02:23.569> preparation<00:02:24.380> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
is that's your volley preparation and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.400 
is that's your volley preparation and
after<00:02:25.549> that<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:26.269> just<00:02:26.540> getting<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> ball

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
after that it's just getting to the ball

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.560 
after that it's just getting to the ball
and<00:02:27.620> volleying<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.190> whether<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.209> ball<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
and volleying it whether the ball is a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.840 
and volleying it whether the ball is a
little<00:02:29.660> bit<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.110> front<00:02:30.140> or<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.430> side<00:02:31.670> don't

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
little bit in front or to the side don't

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.880 
little bit in front or to the side don't
think<00:02:32.150> about<00:02:32.420> your<00:02:32.660> feet<00:02:32.930> too<00:02:33.170> much<00:02:33.350> your<00:02:33.620> feet

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
think about your feet too much your feet

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.310 
think about your feet too much your feet
must<00:02:34.130> follow<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:34.970> you're<00:02:35.720> turning<00:02:36.170> and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
must follow you so you're turning and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.729 
must follow you so you're turning and
then<00:02:36.410> you're<00:02:36.590> going<00:02:36.829> to<00:02:36.920> play<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.030> ball<00:02:38.739> okay

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
then you're going to play the ball okay

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.610 
then you're going to play the ball okay
so<00:02:39.799> let's<00:02:40.100> try<00:02:40.280> with<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.549> ball<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:41.060> few<00:02:41.620> volleys

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
so let's try with the ball a few volleys

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.400 
so let's try with the ball a few volleys
then<00:02:43.040> you'll<00:02:43.220> see<00:02:43.370> how<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.549> looks<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.410> so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
then you'll see how that looks like so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.710 
then you'll see how that looks like so
what<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.799> can<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.160> for<00:02:46.760> practice<00:02:47.269> is<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.540> can

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
what you can do for practice is you can

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.890 
what you can do for practice is you can
do<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.989> first<00:02:48.260> 45<00:02:48.980> degrees<00:02:49.430> first<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.329> then

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
do the first 45 degrees first and then

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.920 
do the first 45 degrees first and then
wait<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.530> ball<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.299> then<00:02:53.299> play<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.750> ball

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
wait for the ball and then play the ball

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.030 
wait for the ball and then play the ball
so<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.010> do<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.250> 45<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.709> volley

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
so just do the 45 and volley

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.369 
so just do the 45 and volley
forty-five<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.510> volley<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.810> then<00:03:01.959> later<00:03:02.230> you

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
forty-five and volley and then later you

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.140 
forty-five and volley and then later you
can<00:03:02.709> wait<00:03:02.920> for<00:03:03.189> the<00:03:03.310> ball<00:03:03.489> because<00:03:03.849> you<00:03:03.879> don't

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
can wait for the ball because you don't

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.119 
can wait for the ball because you don't
know<00:03:04.269> where<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.599> ball<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.840> going<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.230> come<00:03:05.469> and

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
know where the ball is going to come and

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.140 
know where the ball is going to come and
you<00:03:06.310> volley<00:03:08.159> okay<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.489> backhand<00:03:09.879> side

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
you volley okay and on the backhand side

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.849

play the volley okay okay so as you can

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.360 
play the volley okay okay so as you can
see<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.989> preparation<00:03:41.620> for<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.980> ball<00:03:42.189> is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
see the preparation for the ball is

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.699 
see the preparation for the ball is
fairly<00:03:42.879> simple<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.780> don't<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.530> to

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
fairly simple you don't have to

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.199 
fairly simple you don't have to
complicate<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.689> with<00:03:46.689> these<00:03:46.870> two<00:03:47.439> steps<00:03:48.209> 45

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
complicate and with these two steps 45

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.220 
complicate and with these two steps 45
45

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
45

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.949 
45
you<00:03:50.650> will<00:03:50.859> keep<00:03:51.040> everything<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.730> front<00:03:51.969> will

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
you will keep everything in front will

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.809 
you will keep everything in front will
not<00:03:53.169> make<00:03:53.409> any<00:03:53.620> big<00:03:53.919> back<00:03:54.189> swings<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.760> you

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
not make any big back swings and you

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.839 
not make any big back swings and you
will<00:03:55.659> see<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.169> can<00:03:56.349> be<00:03:56.500> quite<00:03:56.739> simple<00:03:57.010> and

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
will see that it can be quite simple and

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.490 
will see that it can be quite simple and
next<00:03:58.239> time<00:03:58.389> we'll<00:03:58.540> talk<00:03:58.719> more<00:03:58.959> about<00:03:59.019> how<00:03:59.469> to
