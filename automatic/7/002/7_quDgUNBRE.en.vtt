 I will teach you to play a song there is no way out 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.429
 because 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:19.060
 I was asked and taught to play like this 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:22.269
 tell my friends friends here what else 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:27.640
 I would like to say on the channel already 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:31.269
 100 subscribers I am very happy to watch 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.980

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.160
 every day we are a little ponemnozhechku 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.320

 time will be more subscribers will be 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.140
 more views 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:51.629
 but it is more correct to want 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 I have to say everything is good personally 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:02.620
 forgot but didn't forget about the channel 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:06.310
 a little bit been busy all this time let's 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:14.549
 I guess I promised you as I promised 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.549
 play go and it sounds like that 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.630
 and so here it sounds so let's 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.380
 let's start the analysis 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.130
 The first part of this chord I will show you 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.380
 what kind 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:11.560
 the second part is the battle and the third part 3 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.560
 it is a combination of chords with pain 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:22.400
 drove the chords there are very simple they 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:32.620
 very light first chord e he sounds 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:32.620
 like this second chord c third chord g 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.980
 fourth chord d 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:46.090
 put it up so em chord put 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:49.900
 2 5 4 strings chord c is put like this 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.980
 1 lat is obtained second string 2 4 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.500
 string and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:07.950
 3 3 fret 5 string chord g then put 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:14.879
 who does not know him 2 fret 5 string and and and 3 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.879
 6 first string then what else 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.159
 chord d 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:26.189
 it is put very easily and put to you 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:28.780
 so 2 fret 3 1 strange and 3 2 string 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:32.769
 so I kind of showed you how they are 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.549
 put let's get started fights 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.549
 clamp and so here is the vulture I just 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.790
 look not a trace they themselves 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.030
 such a fight let's try to play like that 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:57.030
 I remember since it already by the way 3 part 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.030
 go 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:14.580
 let's play hortice so now 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.570
 how is everyone playing together 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.370
 chord and goes not a complete mess Nepal 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.979
 there will generally be back and there just 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.949
 part goes two blows down 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.490
 then rearrange the chord c fingers 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.490
 before game enter 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.889
 then r port 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:50.380
 play completely on it play slipped on 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:52.090
 any then chord d chord e but here it is 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.810
 here is a completely part to play twice 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.330
 then the verse in the verse is also played 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.910
 twice it's all but there goes a little 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.520
 differently firstly there at all 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.259
 chords play completely fight that is 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.759
 them too 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:14.349
 and there is a little off order 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:16.270
 chord watch as it goes 1 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:23.849
 as I said earlier to play there 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.849
 completely pain then leads the color 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.889
 g 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.070
 then put again 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:41.150
 that is, but as I said this through 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.150
 two blows down then on the years of the game enter 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.170
 then put d 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.490
 then play the type again 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.710
 I play just two times shorter, I'm from 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.710
 yourself as if to you konsolku 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.280
 but basically I taught you so she is 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.210
 the song is played 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.310
 at the beginning of it is mine completely so 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.510
