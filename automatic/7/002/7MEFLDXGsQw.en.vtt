00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.920 
I just did an overlap like this where a
little<00:03:56.549> bit<00:03:56.669> of<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.909> board<00:03:57.269> overlapped<00:03:57.719> on

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
little bit of this board overlapped on

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.020 
little bit of this board overlapped on
this<00:03:58.139> one<00:03:58.349> then<00:03:59.099> there's<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.340> screw<00:03:59.639> in<00:03:59.819> there

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
this one then there's a screw in there

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.759 
this one then there's a screw in there
and<00:04:00.359> then<00:04:00.569> it's<00:04:00.719> staked<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.169> the<00:04:01.230> ground<00:04:01.319> right

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
and then it's staked to the ground right

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.699 
and then it's staked to the ground right
here<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.599> all<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.750> those<00:04:03.870> pieces<00:04:04.199> are<00:04:04.349> joined

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
here and all of those pieces are joined

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.740 
here and all of those pieces are joined
together<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.459> at<00:04:05.939> the<00:04:06.060> corners<00:04:06.480> and

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
together like that at the corners and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.110 
together like that at the corners and
there's<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.199> stake<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.919> the<00:04:08.099> middle<00:04:08.310> on<00:04:09.060> each

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
there's a stake in the middle on each

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.030 
there's a stake in the middle on each
end<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.810> then<00:04:09.959> there's<00:04:10.169> a<00:04:10.260> stake<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.859> the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
end and then there's a stake in the

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.409 
end and then there's a stake in the
middle<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.370> each<00:04:11.489> one<00:04:11.699> of<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.819> eight<00:04:11.879> footers

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
middle of each one of the eight footers

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.360 
middle of each one of the eight footers
right<00:04:12.599> here<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.889> thing<00:04:14.069> is<00:04:14.189> pretty

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
right here and so the thing is pretty

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.180 
right here and so the thing is pretty
sturdy<00:04:14.669> all<00:04:14.909> the<00:04:15.000> way<00:04:15.090> around<00:04:15.389> also<00:04:16.229> on<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
sturdy all the way around also on the

sturdy all the way around also on the
bottom<00:04:17.810> all<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:19.079> these<00:04:19.229> boards<00:04:19.590> are<00:04:19.739> screwed

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
bottom all of these boards are screwed

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.039 
bottom all of these boards are screwed
to<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.519> bottom<00:04:21.000> piece<00:04:21.180> that's<00:04:21.630> all<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.959> way

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
to this bottom piece that's all the way

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.570 
to this bottom piece that's all the way
around<00:04:22.320> just<00:04:22.410> some<00:04:22.680> landscape<00:04:23.630> hold<00:04:25.400> Sophie<00:04:26.400> I

that easy to put together a fence out of

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.060 
that easy to put together a fence out of
just<00:04:45.180> some<00:04:45.300> scrap<00:04:45.630> lumber<00:04:45.870> go<00:04:46.650> check<00:04:46.889> out

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
just some scrap lumber go check out

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
construction job sites go on the site

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.200 
construction job sites go on the site
and<00:04:49.440> ask<00:04:49.919> if<00:04:50.250> there's<00:04:50.430> someone<00:04:50.789> that<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:51.090> can

the feet ouch

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.399 
the feet ouch
but<00:04:56.190> anyway<00:04:56.490> it's<00:04:57.150> pretty<00:04:57.750> easy<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.229> find

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
but anyway it's pretty easy to find

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.469 
but anyway it's pretty easy to find
stuff<00:04:58.620> like<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.099> and<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.430> can<00:04:59.789> repurpose<00:05:00.180> it

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
stuff like that and you can repurpose it

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.060 
stuff like that and you can repurpose it
with<00:05:00.690> just<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:01.020> little<00:05:01.110> bit<00:05:01.320> extra<00:05:01.530> lumber<00:05:01.889> and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
with just a little bit extra lumber and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.620 
with just a little bit extra lumber and
turned<00:05:02.280> into<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.550> nice<00:05:02.759> little<00:05:02.909> fence<00:05:03.240> with

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
turned into a nice little fence with

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.620 
turned into a nice little fence with
ease<00:05:03.810> not<00:05:04.470> too<00:05:04.650> hard<00:05:04.889> to<00:05:04.919> do<00:05:05.070> at<00:05:05.220> all<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.639> think<00:05:06.150> I

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
ease not too hard to do at all I think I

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.149 
ease not too hard to do at all I think I
invested<00:05:07.080> 50<00:05:07.380> dollars<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:07.979> whole

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
project and both of these Gardens will

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.649 
project and both of these Gardens will
be<00:05:09.840> fenced<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.770> when<00:05:10.949> I'm<00:05:11.039> all<00:05:11.190> done<00:05:11.509> and<00:05:12.509> now

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
be fenced in when I'm all done and now

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:21.219 
be fenced in when I'm all done and now
it's<00:05:12.840> time<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.050> till<00:05:13.469> so<00:05:14.270> filling<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.419> soil
