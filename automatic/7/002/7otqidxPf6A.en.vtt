your<00:01:11.700> too<00:01:11.850> long<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.270> starting<00:01:12.600> off<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
your too long but starting off on the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
your too long but starting off on the
bottom<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> most<00:01:14.280> disputed

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
bottom we have one of the most disputed

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.899 
bottom we have one of the most disputed
parts<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> LeBron<00:01:16.170> 12<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.920> debated<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
parts of the LeBron 12 or debated I

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.200 
parts of the LeBron 12 or debated I
guess<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.229> colored<00:01:19.680> pod<00:01:20.040> system<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
guess this colored pod system so this is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
guess this colored pod system so this is
like<00:01:21.500> hex<00:01:22.500> zoom<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.580> they're<00:01:23.700> calling<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
like hex zoom is what they're calling it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.670 
like hex zoom is what they're calling it
I<00:01:24.090> believe<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.409> there's<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I believe but as you can see there's a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
I believe but as you can see there's a
whole<00:01:25.799> bunch<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.040> hexagons<00:01:26.520> different<00:01:27.060> colors

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
whole bunch of hexagons different colors

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.999 
whole bunch of hexagons different colors
that<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.900> zoom<00:01:28.110> bags<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:28.920> as

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that all have zoom bags in it as well as

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.859 
that all have zoom bags in it as well as
the<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> heel<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.119> wasn't<00:01:30.720> too

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the one on the heel here I wasn't too

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.569
