Bend<00:01:35.590> on<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.770> fifth<00:01:36.130> fret<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.940> don't<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.360> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
Bend on the fifth fret you don't have to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.210 
Bend on the fifth fret you don't have to
but<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.280> can

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.030 

okay<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.700> part<00:01:45.090> two<00:01:45.330> we<00:01:46.260> want<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.620> back

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
okay so for part two we want to go back

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.850 
okay so for part two we want to go back
to<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.460> seventh<00:01:47.910> fret<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.870> B<00:01:49.140> string<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
to the seventh fret on the B string and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.080 
to the seventh fret on the B string and
this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.190> where<00:01:50.370> it<00:01:50.430> gets<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.670> tricky

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
this is where it gets a little tricky

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.180 
this is where it gets a little tricky
because<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.050> got<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> strum<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> three<00:01:52.950> times

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
because you got to strum it three times

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.410 
because you got to strum it three times
the<00:01:53.940> best<00:01:54.090> way<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.300> do<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:55.290> down

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the best way to do it is up down

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.140 
the best way to do it is up down
now<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.650> mean<00:01:59.460> there's<00:01:59.670> different<00:01:59.820> ways<00:02:00.090> you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
now I mean there's different ways you

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.310 
now I mean there's different ways you
can<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.510> it<00:02:00.540> depending<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.140> place

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
can do it depending on which place

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.100 
can do it depending on which place
faster<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.540> but<00:02:03.540> you're<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
faster for you but you're gonna have to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.449 
faster for you but you're gonna have to
go

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.500 

so<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.149> seven<00:02:10.310> nine<00:02:11.310> eight<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.269> not<00:02:15.390> like

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so you seven nine eight so it's not like

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:28.660 
so you seven nine eight so it's not like
this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.400 

we<00:02:29.090> gotta<00:02:29.270> let<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.570> ring<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:30.020> mean<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.260> can

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
we gotta let that ring I mean you can

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.520 
we gotta let that ring I mean you can
you<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.340> bend<00:02:31.670> up<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.030> down<00:02:32.210> on<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.450> 8th<00:02:32.720> to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
you can bend up and down on the 8th to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.610 
you can bend up and down on the 8th to
