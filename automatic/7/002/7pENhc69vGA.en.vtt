00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
since I'm 20 gauge wire you could make a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.850 
since I'm 20 gauge wire you could make a
small<00:00:26.300> one<00:00:26.540> with<00:00:26.779> this<00:00:26.930> paperclip<00:00:27.320> but<00:00:27.740> I'm

Center the bead so that you have the
same<00:00:56.269> amount<00:00:56.449> of<00:00:56.839> wire<00:00:57.170> on<00:00:57.559> each<00:00:58.280> end<00:00:59.589> now<00:01:00.589> I'm

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
same amount of wire on each end now I'm

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.109 
same amount of wire on each end now I'm
just<00:01:00.860> going<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.400> bend<00:01:01.909> that<00:01:02.420> wire<00:01:02.750> down<00:01:04.119> like

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
just going to bend that wire down like

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.109 
just going to bend that wire down like
that<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.830> I'm<00:01:06.830> going<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.250> bend<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.640> opposite

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
that and I'm going to bend the opposite

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.520 
that and I'm going to bend the opposite
side<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.900> opposite<00:01:09.380> direction<00:01:09.560> like<00:01:10.280> that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
side in the opposite direction like that

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.140

and<00:01:12.530> I'm<00:01:12.680> just<00:01:12.950> going<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.280> thread<00:01:13.490> some<00:01:13.729> small

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
and I'm just going to thread some small

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.289 
and I'm just going to thread some small
beads<00:01:14.420> on<00:01:14.750> these<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.740> end<00:01:15.979> I've<00:01:16.880> got<00:01:17.090> these

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
beads on these to end I've got these

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.760 
beads on these to end I've got these
beads<00:01:17.630> threaded<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.470> I'm<00:01:18.710> going<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.100> bend

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
beads threaded and I'm going to bend

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.570 
beads threaded and I'm going to bend
this<00:01:21.770> side<00:01:22.160> down<00:01:22.520> like<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.430> I'm<00:01:25.430> only

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
this side down like that and I'm only

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.610 
this side down like that and I'm only
putting<00:01:25.880> beads<00:01:26.270> on<00:01:26.570> here<00:01:26.870> because<00:01:27.230> I<00:01:27.350> didn't

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
putting beads on here because I didn't

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.710 
putting beads on here because I didn't
get<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:27.980> straight<00:01:28.430> if<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.000> got<00:01:29.210> this<00:01:29.390> really

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
get this straight if you got this really

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.540 
get this straight if you got this really
straight<00:01:30.230> you<00:01:30.410> could<00:01:30.560> just<00:01:30.800> leave<00:01:31.010> it<00:01:31.220> blank

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
straight you could just leave it blank

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.370 
straight you could just leave it blank
so<00:01:32.450> I'm<00:01:32.510> just<00:01:32.660> going<00:01:32.870> to<00:01:32.900> put<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> few<00:01:33.350> more

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
so I'm just going to put a few more

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.530 
so I'm just going to put a few more
beads<00:01:33.740> here<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.460> then<00:01:34.640> I'm<00:01:34.760> going<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.060> make<00:01:35.330> a

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
beads here and then I'm going to make a

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.030 
beads here and then I'm going to make a
loop<00:01:35.750> like<00:01:36.740> that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
loop like that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.130 
loop like that
I'll<00:01:37.340> cut<00:01:37.550> those<00:01:37.760> on<00:01:38.030> now<00:01:38.390> I'm<00:01:38.750> going<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.050> make

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
I'll cut those on now I'm going to make

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.340 
I'll cut those on now I'm going to make
a<00:01:39.200> loop<00:01:39.440> here<00:01:39.800> approximately<00:01:40.160> in<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.880> center

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
a loop here approximately in the center

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.649 
a loop here approximately in the center
so<00:01:42.350> I'm<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.620> going<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.010> trim<00:01:43.910> this<00:01:44.090> off<00:01:44.300> to

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
so I'm just going to trim this off to

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.570 
so I'm just going to trim this off to
about<00:01:44.720> happening<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.650> I'm<00:01:45.830> going<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.190> make<00:01:46.370> my

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
about happening and I'm going to make my

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.430 
about happening and I'm going to make my
loop<00:01:48.400> tighten<00:01:49.400> that<00:01:49.520> up<00:01:49.960> so<00:01:50.960> I'm<00:01:51.050> just<00:01:51.230> going

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
loop tighten that up so I'm just going

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.940 
loop tighten that up so I'm just going
to<00:01:51.470> do<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> same<00:01:51.950> thing<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.520> other<00:01:52.550> side

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
to do the same thing on the other side

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.850 
to do the same thing on the other side
and<00:01:55.870> this<00:01:56.870> is<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.260> one<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.590> I've<00:01:57.710> already

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
and this is the one that I've already

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.770 
and this is the one that I've already
gotten<00:01:58.190> done<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.909> don't<00:01:59.000> have<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.479> totally

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
gotten done so you don't have to totally

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.450 
gotten done so you don't have to totally
fill<00:02:00.170> these<00:02:00.409> with<00:02:00.440> beads<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.100> can<00:02:01.250> leave

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
fill these with beads you can leave

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.790 
fill these with beads you can leave
those<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:01.909> there's<00:02:02.270> some<00:02:02.330> movement<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
those so that there's some movement and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.100 
those so that there's some movement and
then<00:02:04.310> I've<00:02:04.460> shown<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.210> another<00:02:05.479> video<00:02:05.690> how

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
then I've shown you in another video how

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.600 
then I've shown you in another video how
to<00:02:06.140> make<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:06.560> change

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.090 

and<00:02:12.200> there<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.350> go<00:02:13.530> there's

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
