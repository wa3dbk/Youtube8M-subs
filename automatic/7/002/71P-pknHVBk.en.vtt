00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.710
 we are in a few shots about what is the 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.230
 technique to climb hills is important 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.150
 when we talk about the ultramarathon that 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.140
 the arms when going up the hill 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.480
 take a hard work hands 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.020
 They carry 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 or reaches chest level and lowers 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.430
 up to the level of the hip making a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.579
 strong work of arm stroke the body 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.650
 It projects 15 degrees forward 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.970
 15 meters ahead and when going up 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.910
 it is important to support the ball up 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.180
 feet and heels going to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.180
 buttocks 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.940
 some more important things when it comes to 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.909
 climb a slope to maintain a stroke 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.909
 harmonic the balancing is harmonic 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.909
 wearing 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.690
 the hands at the level 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 or at the level of the pectorals 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.470
 and projecting the hand backwards until 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.630
 the hip is the breadth of which should 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.420
 have the arm stroke at the time of going 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.330
 going up the body is projected about 15 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.580
 degrees forward and it's important 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.060
 that projection to beat the most 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.160
 possible the severity at the time of uploading 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.960
 the pleasure is intense and is handled with 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.350
 stronger than when we are 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.820
 running flat at the same time knees 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 are projected forward 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 we look for that knee to rise 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.210
 slightly more to cover a little 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.240
 more distance the body is due 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 Keep relaxed and you should avoid 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.510
 lateral movements the moments 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.510
 side effects is to project the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.000
 body in different directions what 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.320
 what we are looking for is to look for efficient and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.320
 project the body forward 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.810
 when we are going up it is important 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.780
 keep a relaxed body take a 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.290
 wide stroke that is projected from the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.290
 breast up 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.810
 the hip is the strong arm 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.290
 and it's pronounced it 's important too 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.159
 projecting our body forward 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.609
 and bring your knees exactly in one 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.019
 totally forward projection with 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.310
 about our body this wants 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.930
 say that the knees are raised 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.490
 slightly 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.180
 plus 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:52.100
 high or more flexed than when 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.100
 we are on a flat land
