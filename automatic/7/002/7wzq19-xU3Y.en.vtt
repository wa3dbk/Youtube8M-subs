on and then I went out to build a new

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.030

squad in a 4-2-3-1 formation and the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.369 
squad in a 4-2-3-1 formation and the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
squad I'm building is a slow skill squad

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230 
squad I'm building is a slow skill squad
I<00:00:16.529> will<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.920> going<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.369> quite<00:00:17.730> faster

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
I will be going with a quite faster

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.290 
I will be going with a quite faster
defense<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.250> midfield<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.939> attack

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
defense but the the midfield and attack

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.650 
defense but the the midfield and attack
is<00:00:21.510> very<00:00:21.539> very<00:00:22.199> slow<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.119> 5-star

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
is very very slow but it got 5-star

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.480 
is very very slow but it got 5-star
skills<00:00:24.960> all<00:00:25.289> around<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.890> I'll<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.279> able<00:00:26.369> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
skills all around so I'll be able to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
skills all around so I'll be able to
pull<00:00:26.910> off<00:00:27.029> some<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> skill<00:00:27.689> moves<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
pull off some of the skill moves and the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.259 
pull off some of the skill moves and the
idea<00:00:28.920> behind<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.970> bit<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
idea behind it is it's a bit of a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
idea behind it is it's a bit of a
challenge<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:30.900> seen<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.460> suggested<00:00:32.460> quite

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
challenge I've seen it a suggested quite

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
challenge I've seen it a suggested quite
a<00:00:32.730> few<00:00:32.969> times<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.899> thought<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.380> about

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a few times and I thought it was about

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.950 
a few times and I thought it was about
time<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> trying<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.850> because<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
time and trying it out because in the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
time and trying it out because in the
last<00:00:37.230> episode<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> reached<00:00:38.129> all<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.030> all<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
last episode I reached all the all the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.119 
last episode I reached all the all the
skillets<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.079> ultimate<00:00:40.469> team<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
skillets and ultimate team and it was a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.740 
skillets and ultimate team and it was a
little<00:00:41.280> bit<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> an<00:00:41.610> objective<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
little bit of an objective for the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.930 
little bit of an objective for the
series<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> felt<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> try<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.399> reach<00:00:44.640> all

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
series I felt that to try and reach all

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.090 
series I felt that to try and reach all
the<00:00:45.180> five<00:00:45.420> stars<00:00:45.750> killers<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.710> thought<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the five stars killers and I thought to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
the five stars killers and I thought to
myself<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.730> direction<00:00:48.149> should<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.570> take<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
myself which direction should I take the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720 
myself which direction should I take the
serious<00:00:49.260> intro<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:49.980> become<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
serious intro so and don't become a to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
serious intro so and don't become a to
repetitive<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> comment<00:00:52.860> on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
repetitive and this was a comment on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.610 
repetitive and this was a comment on
episode<00:00:53.430> 49<00:00:53.789> suggesting<00:00:54.620> including

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
episode 49 suggesting including

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.410 
episode 49 suggesting including
challenges<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> series<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.270> thought

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
challenges into the series and I thought

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689 
challenges into the series and I thought
it<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.199> cool<00:00:58.379> idea<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.340> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it was a really really cool idea so it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.130 
it was a really really cool idea so it's
a<00:00:59.820> cool<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> interact<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.930> guys<00:01:01.109> a

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.250 
strength I believe so that's the reason
I<00:02:39.030> used<00:02:39.209> him<00:02:39.329> as<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> striker<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.989> see<00:02:40.139> if<00:02:40.200> he

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I used him as a striker to see if he

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.530 
I used him as a striker to see if he
could<00:02:40.379> push<00:02:40.620> off<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.099> defenders<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.419> is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
could push off the defenders so that is

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.849 
could push off the defenders so that is
pretty<00:02:42.750> much<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.139> squad<00:02:43.349> I'd<00:02:43.499> be<00:02:43.620> playing

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
and apart from that I didn't create it

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.469 
and apart from that I didn't create it
much<00:03:46.739> more<00:03:47.009> in<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.400> same<00:03:47.579> house<00:03:47.879> so<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> went<00:03:48.359> to

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
much more in the same house so I went to

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.629 
much more in the same house so I went to
2-1<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.109> final<00:03:49.500> there<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.859> then<00:03:50.370> we<00:03:50.459> can

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
2-1 the final there and then we can

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.490 
2-1 the final there and then we can
start<00:03:50.849> firm<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.239> threat<00:03:51.479> from<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.109> Gold<00:03:52.319> Cup

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500

there<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:52.949> we<00:03:53.099> try<00:03:53.430> out<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.790> new<00:03:54.000> squad<00:03:54.239> we

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
there and we try out the new squad we

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.420 
there and we try out the new squad we
just<00:03:54.750> built<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.500> one<00:03:55.680> thing<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:55.949> can<00:03:56.099> say<00:03:56.129> is

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
just built and one thing I can say is

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.490 
just built and one thing I can say is
the<00:03:56.939> counter-attacks<00:03:57.689> against<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.229> squad

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
the counter-attacks against the squad

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.319 
the counter-attacks against the squad
are<00:03:58.680> really<00:03:59.099> really<00:03:59.370> difficult<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.939> defend

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
are really really difficult to defend

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.360 
are really really difficult to defend
because<00:04:00.479> the<00:04:01.349> work<00:04:01.590> words<00:04:01.829> are<00:04:02.009> just<00:04:02.189> a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
because the work words are just a

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.429 
because the work words are just a
terrible<00:04:02.790> fall<00:04:03.180> for<00:04:03.449> the<00:04:03.569> midfield<00:04:03.989> they<00:04:04.169> they

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
terrible fall for the midfield they they

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.499 
terrible fall for the midfield they they
don't<00:04:04.680> get<00:04:04.859> back<00:04:05.099> home<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.609> it's<00:04:05.849> pretty<00:04:06.389> much

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
don't get back home so it's pretty much

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.659 
don't get back home so it's pretty much
down<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.199> 40<00:04:07.500> fitness<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:07.979> have<00:04:08.219> but

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
bit nervous but I would hang on to the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.670 
bit nervous but I would hang on to the

the next round of the tournament and

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.850 
the next round of the tournament and
I'll<00:04:36.729> have<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> say<00:04:37.330> it's<00:04:38.020> really<00:04:38.620> really

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
I'll have to say it's really really

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.379 
I'll have to say it's really really
difficult<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.460> attack<00:04:39.819> with<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.150> squat

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
difficult to attack with the squat

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.700 
difficult to attack with the squat
because<00:04:40.539> you<00:04:40.840> can't<00:04:41.110> play<00:04:41.289> that<00:04:41.319> football

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
because you can't play that football

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.219 
because you can't play that football
you'll<00:04:42.130> have<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:43.030> play<00:04:43.240> patient<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:43.840> try<00:04:44.080> and

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
you'll have to play patient and try and

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.740 
you'll have to play patient and try and
break<00:04:44.410> down<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.190> defense<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.759> it<00:04:46.509> is

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
break down the the defense and it is

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.180 
break down the the defense and it is
kind<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.110> difficult<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:47.650> once<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:47.949> played<00:04:48.160> a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
kind of difficult but once you played a

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.860 
kind of difficult but once you played a
few<00:04:48.430> games<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:48.970> actually<00:04:49.419> really<00:04:49.569> really

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
few games it's actually really really

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.930 
few games it's actually really really
fun<00:04:50.169> when<00:04:50.349> you<00:04:50.440> get<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.710> goal<00:04:50.949> because<00:04:51.130> it's

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
fun when you get a goal because it's

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.460 
fun when you get a goal because it's
difficult<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.720> but<00:04:52.900> it's<00:04:53.050> really<00:04:53.259> really

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
difficult and but it's really really

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.379 
difficult and but it's really really
rewarding<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.580> get<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.759> goal<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.240> here

he<00:05:33.400> picks<00:05:33.669> it<00:05:33.820> up<00:05:33.940> and<00:05:34.090> makes<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:34.870> 1-1<00:05:35.320> but<00:05:35.470> I

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
he picks it up and makes it 1-1 but I

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.140 
he picks it up and makes it 1-1 but I
guess<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:35.889> was<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.250> serve<00:05:36.460> because<00:05:36.699> he<00:05:37.000> had

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
guess it was to serve because he had

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.240 
guess it was to serve because he had
quite<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.419> few<00:05:37.659> shots<00:05:37.960> in<00:05:38.199> but<00:05:38.770> we<00:05:38.860> go<00:05:39.070> into

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
quite a few shots in but we go into

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.129 
quite a few shots in but we go into
extra<00:05:39.669> time<00:05:39.699> I<00:05:39.909> get<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.300> shot<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.720> hits<00:05:40.960> the

extra time I get a shot and hits the

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.399 
extra time I get a shot and hits the
