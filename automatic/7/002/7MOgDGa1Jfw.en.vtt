00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.690
 the match between austria and 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.000
 how are you two teams here 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.480
 compulsory education 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 in addition, the ranking by four second places 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.379
 dropped and of course the fourth 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.449
 teams that do a good job there at the moment 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.989
 after ten minutes in the game when they receive the first yellow card here 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.490
 does not just happen 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.490
 that is the referee the toppers deserved 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 alexander shows his 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
 9 keepers are injured and the buyer has to be managed on his knee 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.050
 that is a sensitive loss of course for the problems 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 we have to pay in doing together 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.720
 I do not yet owe the stairs of voting 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.010
 positive that goal 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.720
 head disappears it is 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.400
 beautiful goals from Easter that no longer match a few days ago 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 this policy still made thousands come by 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 took advantage of the opportunity that I do not get 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 the flush is hopeless horse not long after that its optical one minute later 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.700
 who ultimately know 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.430
 raises the stand 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.950
 the team of carlo petrini 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.190
 rbc has rush hour traffic the f10 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.850
 the statistics cbs 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.850
 the austrian competition behind salzburg 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.400
 carry great joy 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 the austrian team that so quickly on the same level 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.640
 Sure that is not allowed because then they will hear what they hear about it 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.840
 at the end of the first half of the game 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 a good save from the keeper of austria on the surplus 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.270
 right foot comes from that malika 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.360
 what here 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.760
 moderate kick to the debate nevertheless everything will be fine and the court has the ball ahead 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.829
 are playing out 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.949
 although tied for the second time hidden between east on the stroke of rest 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:16.090
 two in it is of course whether the first baby is trailing a place where 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.089
 this is of course rumbling for the central defenders 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.989
 fortunately we arrive at the top 5 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 an excellent extremely cold-blooded 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.159
 dahl tomasson 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.679
 in the second half 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.359
 leave the field 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.409
 get for that 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.980
 loud applause customers 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.469
 probably the most important man employed as 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.840
 it is therefore important 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.419
 rehwinkel 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.199
 the ball tight 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.759
 but also takes care of it 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.619
 it will not come that there is some rest now 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:48.929
 from the center 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.879
 the austrian defense 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.359
 coach is that called constantini from the austrian 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 Since a couple of weeks 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.989
 the criticism of 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.819
 still has problems 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.819
 the routinier is a good players as a robot contract 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.669
 the central defender 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.039
 it's not up to lithuania 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.529
 the fact that we don't get the form 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.489
 a year ago 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.409
 played so well against the Netherlands 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.409
 this is tame 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.409
 a nice possibility for those wilders are way too high 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.189
 make something beautiful out of it for the hague 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.189
 thereby i declare him ticket 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.969
 Austria is like everything 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.620
 rightly ahead with another twenty minutes to bid against the 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:36.190
 Islam 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.439
 lending the euro 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.840
 ultimately well defended and promoted with the courage of despair 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.589
 he is the real life 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.429
 to give the last tap 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.349
 kilian the greeks from the fire the corner 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.039
 two fists 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.039
 a few more times 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.000
 again a good save 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.869
 sporting 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.209
 that is an error that itself in between 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.209
 straighten it 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.479
 time is running out for 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.479
 how are you counted in case of loss practically disabled 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.270
 the second place 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.270
 both teams started to think 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.539
 on the top ten record of the outage 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.919
 the last few weeks the free kick has been running 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.070
 the weather institute 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.330
 to just three points 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.490
 good address it is neatly prepared 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.009
 with the courage of despair louboutin, we get complaints about one 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.370
 lost battle that actually didi constantini is satisfied with it 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.990
 Austrian team 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.990
 this fights for his last chance 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.979
 this is the state of affairs
