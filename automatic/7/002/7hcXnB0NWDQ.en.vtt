00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 being on this inauguration of the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.790
 blue buses and now maría josé chávez 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.890
 it is exactly in the avenues 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.110
 to the team on July 28 to find out if 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.730
 is that the users are ready or 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.610
 how this beginning has interpreted 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 better than good morning good morning 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.500
 days karina sea and we are in 28 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.840
 July with Arequipa today Saturday 26 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.939
 July will begin to circulate the buses 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 by the trunk route of this first 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.380
 complementary corridor what we are 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.060
 seeing here is the disinformation of the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.309
 people they do not know what are the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.250
 Whereabouts routes every how long 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.710
 the buses pass, sir, we are not 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.320
 passengers in the place we are 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 protecting the reform because the reform 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.660
 It suits us because we 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.219
 We are the exploited owners of 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.770
 exploited of the big businessmen 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.710
 I know that today, today, we are 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.120
 starting then we will support what 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.640
 is reform because we 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.890
 It is convenient because we are owners 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.020
 So now there are people that others 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.430
 sites sent from the big 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.390
 businessmen 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.850
 walking as if they were passengers now if 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.770
 ok you agree there are people 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.840
 here that is desperate to get to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.700
 their jobs at home and do not know what 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 but what happens is that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.300
 example I come from coma having of 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.190
 eat without any car brought me up 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.260
 here they have had to take the parallel and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.610
 left me with the background how long 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.990
 waiting for a bug 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990
 go long enough 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:41.070
 because most people work 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.630
 to bring a workplace like this is 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.910
 there are many people who are 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.220
 waiting here for more than an hour 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.920
 in what we have here 40 minutes have 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 past only three blue buses these 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 come blue controversial buses we are 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.040
 seeing what is happening in this one 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 moment after approximately 15 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.399
 minutes but it 's completely full 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.810
 May the issue is that it will be required 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.550
 also that agents of the municipality 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080
 can give information just to 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.970
 let people know where 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.320
 for the schedules and also on the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.450
 good costs where you pay nothing for now 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.980
 however, if information is missing, thank you 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 maria jose for this information
