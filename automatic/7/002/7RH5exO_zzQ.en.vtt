I was going to go down and buy a $50
Razer<00:03:34.010> Black<00:03:34.340> Mamba<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.060> came<00:03:35.269> across<00:03:35.419> this

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
Razer Black Mamba and I came across this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.259 
Razer Black Mamba and I came across this
knowing<00:03:36.319> that<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.470> had<00:03:36.709> $20<00:03:37.639> in<00:03:37.910> gift

knowing that I had $20 in gift

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.270 
knowing that I had $20 in gift
certificates<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.900> could<00:03:39.230> put<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.530> roughly<00:03:40.069> at

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
certificates I could put this roughly at

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.740 
certificates I could put this roughly at
the<00:03:40.310> same<00:03:40.579> price<00:03:41.030> point<00:03:41.239> which<00:03:41.480> was<00:03:41.629> awesome

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
the same price point which was awesome

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.500 
the same price point which was awesome
so<00:03:42.500> let's<00:03:42.530> throw<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.189> aside<00:03:43.519> let's<00:03:43.939> pull

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
so let's throw that aside let's pull

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.119 
so let's throw that aside let's pull
this<00:03:44.689> out

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
this out

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.220 
this out
standard<00:03:47.060> literature<00:03:47.299> nothing<00:03:48.140> of

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
importance except for it does say that

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.119

it<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.629> important<00:03:51.109> information<00:03:51.290> I'll<00:03:51.890> throw

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
it is important information I'll throw

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.920 
it is important information I'll throw
that<00:03:52.189> over<00:03:52.489> here<00:03:52.819> then<00:03:53.540> we<00:03:53.659> have<00:03:53.689> a<00:03:53.810> little

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
that over here then we have a little

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.390 
that over here then we have a little
instructions<00:03:56.930> on<00:03:57.049> how<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.319> manipulate<00:03:58.069> the

instructions on how to manipulate the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.490 
instructions on how to manipulate the
weights<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:58.849> then<00:03:59.000> go<00:03:59.299> on<00:03:59.450> go<00:03:59.959> online<00:04:00.109> and

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
weights and then go on go online and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.860 
weights and then go on go online and
download<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.159> drivers<00:04:01.489> so<00:04:01.760> these<00:04:02.510> days<00:04:02.689> you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
download the drivers so these days you

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.089 
download the drivers so these days you
know<00:04:02.959> nothing<00:04:03.230> comes<00:04:03.379> with<00:04:03.530> drivers<00:04:03.799> anymore

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
know nothing comes with drivers anymore

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.640 
know nothing comes with drivers anymore
you<00:04:04.220> go<00:04:04.549> online<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:04.879> you<00:04:05.060> get<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.359> so<00:04:05.599> so<00:04:06.590> we

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
you go online and you get it so so we

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.429 
you go online and you get it so so we
got<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.769> little<00:04:06.859> magnetic<00:04:07.900> case<00:04:08.900> which<00:04:09.140> is<00:04:09.260> kind

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
got a little magnetic case which is kind

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.569 
got a little magnetic case which is kind
of<00:04:09.470> cool<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.829> little<00:04:09.890> magnet<00:04:10.280> holding<00:04:10.519> the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
of cool and a little magnet holding the

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.280 
of cool and a little magnet holding the
piece<00:04:10.730> of<00:04:10.849> plastic<00:04:10.970> on<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.510> guess<00:04:12.049> that's<00:04:12.230> a

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
piece of plastic on I guess that's a

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.559 
piece of plastic on I guess that's a
gimmicky<00:04:12.620> but<00:04:12.829> let's<00:04:13.459> see<00:04:13.730> let's<00:04:14.120> pull<00:04:14.450> this

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
gimmicky but let's see let's pull this

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.770 
gimmicky but let's see let's pull this
out<00:04:15.310> I've<00:04:16.310> got<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.609> nice<00:04:16.820> seven-foot

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
out I've got this nice seven-foot

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.300 
out I've got this nice seven-foot
braided<00:04:18.229> cord<00:04:18.579> which<00:04:19.579> is<00:04:19.609> cool<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.829> there's

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
braided cord which is cool and there's

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.040 
braided cord which is cool and there's
the<00:04:22.430> mouse<00:04:22.550> let's<00:04:22.880> set<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.300> right<00:04:23.810> there<00:04:23.900> for

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
the mouse let's set that right there for

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.980 
the mouse let's set that right there for
now<00:04:24.259> and<00:04:24.729> here<00:04:25.729> I<00:04:25.940> believe<00:04:26.330> are<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.810> weights

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
now and here I believe are the weights

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.749 
now and here I believe are the weights
so<00:04:27.470> we've<00:04:27.710> got<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> separate<00:04:28.190> little<00:04:28.400> container

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
so we've got a separate little container

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.210 
so we've got a separate little container
with<00:04:29.449> in<00:04:29.599> it<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:30.020> has<00:04:30.320> all<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.039> weights

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
with in it that has all of the weights

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.150 
with in it that has all of the weights
there<00:04:31.759> we<00:04:31.910> go<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:32.780> there's<00:04:32.960> all<00:04:33.229> five<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.860> my

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
there we go so there's all five of my

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.700 
there we go so there's all five of my
3.6<00:04:34.970> gram<00:04:35.180> weights<00:04:35.449> that<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.810> can<00:04:36.110> put<00:04:36.470> in<00:04:36.590> the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
3.6 gram weights that I can put in the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.040 
3.6 gram weights that I can put in the
mouse<00:04:36.860> in<00:04:37.160> whatever<00:04:37.340> configuration<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.300> see

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.129 
and then this is your dpi switch so this
will<00:05:09.620> show<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.010> sensitivity<00:05:10.580> based<00:05:10.789> on

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
will show you the sensitivity based on

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.620 
will show you the sensitivity based on
the<00:05:12.139> DPI<00:05:12.710> or<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.220> little<00:05:13.370> LED<00:05:13.760> indicators<00:05:14.270> so

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
the DPI or the little LED indicators so

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.210 
the DPI or the little LED indicators so
I've<00:05:14.720> got<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:14.900> free<00:05:15.110> roll<00:05:15.320> screw<00:05:15.620> scroll<00:05:16.039> wheel

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
I've got a free roll screw scroll wheel

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.649 
I've got a free roll screw scroll wheel
or<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.520> clicky<00:05:16.880> wheel<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:17.750> clicky<00:05:18.440> hyper<00:05:19.659> clicky

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
or a clicky wheel so clicky hyper clicky

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.839 
or a clicky wheel so clicky hyper clicky
I'm<00:05:21.620> not<00:05:21.800> sure<00:05:21.949> this<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.280> one<00:05:22.550> of<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:22.699> buttons

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
I'm not sure this is one of the buttons

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.399 
I'm not sure this is one of the buttons
to<00:05:23.090> be<00:05:23.270> programmed<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.780> got<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.930> button<00:05:24.110> here<00:05:24.199> and

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
to be programmed I got a button here and

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:25.750 
to be programmed I got a button here and
a<00:05:24.470> button<00:05:24.680> here<00:05:24.830> button<00:05:25.220> here<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.400> button<00:05:25.639> here

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
a button here button here to button here

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.000 
a button here button here to button here
button<00:05:25.909> here<00:05:26.060> button<00:05:26.240> here<00:05:26.449> button<00:05:27.169> there<00:05:27.289> so

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
button here button here button there so

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.529 
button here button here button there so
I'm<00:05:28.250> assuming<00:05:28.490> that<00:05:28.699> this<00:05:28.970> is<00:05:29.150> going<00:05:29.270> to<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.449> an

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
I'm assuming that this is going to be an

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:30.820 
I'm assuming that this is going to be an
alternate<00:05:29.900> button<00:05:30.110> so<00:05:30.199> it<00:05:30.289> claims<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.710> as

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
alternate button so it claims it it as

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.939 
alternate button so it claims it it as
11<00:05:31.330> programmable<00:05:32.330> buttons<00:05:32.630> so<00:05:33.050> there's<00:05:33.320> 1<00:05:33.500> 2<00:05:33.710> 3

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
11 programmable buttons so there's 1 2 3

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.000 
11 programmable buttons so there's 1 2 3
4<00:05:34.280> 5<00:05:34.460> 6<00:05:34.760> 7<00:05:35.000> press<00:05:35.840> that<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.380> then<00:05:36.710> it'll<00:05:36.830> give

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
4 5 6 7 press that and then it'll give

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.830 
4 5 6 7 press that and then it'll give
us<00:05:37.099> a<00:05:37.190> couple<00:05:37.400> extras<00:05:37.669> I<00:05:37.789> would<00:05:37.909> assume<00:05:38.120> but<00:05:38.630> I

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
us a couple extras I would assume but I

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.620 
us a couple extras I would assume but I
could<00:05:39.199> be<00:05:39.289> wrong<00:05:39.320> don't<00:05:39.800> quote<00:05:39.889> me<00:05:40.039> on<00:05:40.070> that<00:05:40.630> so

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
could be wrong don't quote me on that so

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.070 
could be wrong don't quote me on that so
that's<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.530> this<00:05:43.130> I<00:05:43.280> think<00:05:43.490> they<00:05:43.669> use

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
that's it this this I think they use

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.149 
that's it this this I think they use
specifically<00:05:45.080> as<00:05:45.199> a<00:05:45.229> programmable<00:05:45.800> kind<00:05:46.039> of<00:05:46.099> a

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
specifically as a programmable kind of a

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.800 
specifically as a programmable kind of a
sniper<00:05:46.400> button<00:05:46.729> for<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.389> first-person

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
sniper button for the first-person

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.390 
sniper button for the first-person
shooters<00:05:48.229> that<00:05:48.259> are<00:05:48.440> out<00:05:48.530> there<00:05:48.710> as<00:05:48.830> you're

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
shooters that are out there as you're

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.980 
shooters that are out there as you're
playing<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.729> game<00:05:49.759> they're<00:05:50.509> playing<00:05:50.870> a

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
playing the game they're playing a

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.029 
playing the game they're playing a
first-person<00:05:51.320> shooter<00:05:51.500> if<00:05:51.770> you're<00:05:51.860> playing

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
first-person shooter if you're playing

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.110 
first-person shooter if you're playing
sniper<00:05:52.310> and<00:05:52.430> you<00:05:52.490> want<00:05:52.639> to<00:05:52.699> zoom<00:05:52.820> in<00:05:52.940> I<00:05:53.060> think

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
sniper and you want to zoom in I think

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.060 
sniper and you want to zoom in I think
you<00:05:53.240> could<00:05:53.389> BAM<00:05:53.630> tap<00:05:53.990> that<00:05:54.169> and<00:05:54.469> it<00:05:54.650> lowers

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
you could BAM tap that and it lowers

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.469 
you could BAM tap that and it lowers
your<00:05:55.159> sensitivity<00:05:55.849> down<00:05:55.969> so<00:05:56.240> that<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:56.389> can

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
your sensitivity down so that you can

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.480 
your sensitivity down so that you can
get<00:05:56.539> that<00:05:56.690> finite<00:05:57.020> control<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:58.250> I'm<00:05:58.340> sure

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
get that finite control and I'm sure

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.530 
get that finite control and I'm sure
it's<00:05:58.610> programmable<00:05:59.000> for<00:05:59.330> men

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
it's programmable for men

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.570 
it's programmable for men
other<00:05:59.720> things<00:06:00.020> but<00:06:00.200> very<00:06:00.740> lightweight<00:06:01.010> the

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
other things but very lightweight the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.520 
other things but very lightweight the
cord<00:06:01.910> actually<00:06:02.720> weighs<00:06:02.870> as<00:06:03.080> much<00:06:03.110> as<00:06:03.260> the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
cord actually weighs as much as the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.590 
cord actually weighs as much as the
mouse<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:04.580> again<00:06:04.880> that's<00:06:05.150> because<00:06:05.270> none<00:06:05.570> of

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
mouse and again that's because none of

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.640 
mouse and again that's because none of
the<00:06:05.720> weights<00:06:05.900> are<00:06:06.020> in<00:06:06.050> there<00:06:06.200> I<00:06:06.230> believe<00:06:06.350> the

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
the weights are in there I believe the

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.890 
the weights are in there I believe the
weights<00:06:06.830> go<00:06:07.070> in<00:06:07.280> the<00:06:07.730> top<00:06:08.210> note<00:06:08.570> they<00:06:08.690> go<00:06:08.780> down

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
weights go in the top note they go down

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.780 
weights go in the top note they go down
to<00:06:09.020> here<00:06:09.110> in<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.290> bottom<00:06:09.500> so<00:06:10.130> we<00:06:10.220> pop<00:06:10.430> that<00:06:10.460> off

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
to here in the bottom so we pop that off

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.890 
to here in the bottom so we pop that off
and<00:06:10.910> there<00:06:11.030> we<00:06:11.120> go<00:06:11.240> there<00:06:11.480> you<00:06:11.540> can<00:06:11.660> see<00:06:11.810> where

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
and there we go there you can see where

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.990 
and there we go there you can see where
all<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.110> weights<00:06:12.290> go<00:06:12.580> we<00:06:13.580> can<00:06:13.700> come<00:06:13.850> in<00:06:13.970> here

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
all the weights go we can come in here

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.410 
all the weights go we can come in here
and<00:06:14.500> you<00:06:15.500> know<00:06:15.590> depending<00:06:15.890> on<00:06:16.010> how<00:06:16.130> I<00:06:16.160> want<00:06:16.640> the

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.420 
and you know depending on how I want the

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.150 
and you know depending on how I want the
weights<00:06:17.780> to<00:06:17.960> be<00:06:18.140> distributed<00:06:18.650> you<00:06:18.800> just<00:06:18.980> start

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
weights to be distributed you just start

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.210 
weights to be distributed you just start
slapping<00:06:19.550> them<00:06:19.640> in<00:06:19.760> and<00:06:20.350> set<00:06:21.350> it<00:06:21.470> all<00:06:21.590> up<00:06:21.620> for

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
slapping them in and set it all up for

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.710 
slapping them in and set it all up for
how<00:06:22.460> you<00:06:22.520> want<00:06:22.820> and<00:06:23.120> I'm<00:06:23.210> definitely<00:06:23.330> going<00:06:23.660> to

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
how you want and I'm definitely going to

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.790 
how you want and I'm definitely going to
go<00:06:23.840> through<00:06:24.050> that<00:06:24.140> process

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
go through that process

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.710 
go through that process
this<00:06:25.310> is<00:06:25.430> magnetically<00:06:25.910> held<00:06:26.180> on<00:06:26.330> which<00:06:26.570> is

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
this is magnetically held on which is

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.140 
this is magnetically held on which is
cool<00:06:27.040> slaps<00:06:28.040> in<00:06:28.220> on<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.430> side<00:06:28.640> and<00:06:29.000> then

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
cool slaps in on the side and then

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.970 
cool slaps in on the side and then
there's<00:06:30.080> just<00:06:30.230> a<00:06:30.260> little<00:06:30.470> magnet<00:06:30.800> you<00:06:30.860> can

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
there's just a little magnet you can

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.420 
there's just a little magnet you can
hear<00:06:31.490> it<00:06:31.580> clipping<00:06:32.980> but<00:06:33.980> there<00:06:34.100> you<00:06:34.190> have<00:06:34.310> it

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
hear it clipping but there you have it

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.370 
hear it clipping but there you have it
that<00:06:34.580> is<00:06:34.610> a<00:06:35.120> quick<00:06:35.600> unboxing<00:06:35.780> I'm<00:06:36.170> going<00:06:36.320> to

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
that is a quick unboxing I'm going to
