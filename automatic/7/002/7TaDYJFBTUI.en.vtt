tell the graphics enhancement has been

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.939 
tell the graphics enhancement has been
increased<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.199> talking<00:01:04.379> about<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
increased but we're talking about the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
increased but we're talking about the
cover<00:01:05.189> athlete<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.299> i<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> picture

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
cover athlete and i think this picture

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
cover athlete and i think this picture
shows<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> best<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.340> coming<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.729> one

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
shows that the best this coming up one

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.550 
shows that the best this coming up one
right<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.350> this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
right here this one right here so this

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
right here this one right here so this
is<00:01:10.590> obviously<00:01:10.860> live<00:01:11.369> 14<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.510> front

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is obviously live 14 but this front

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
is obviously live 14 but this front
court<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.650> right<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.340> think

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
court you can see right here I think

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.399 
court you can see right here I think
these<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.000> perfect<00:01:15.360> candidates<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.290> we

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
these are perfect candidates that we

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
these are perfect candidates that we
could<00:01:16.560> possibly<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> cover<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:18.450> it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
could possibly see as a cover now it's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
could possibly see as a cover now it's
