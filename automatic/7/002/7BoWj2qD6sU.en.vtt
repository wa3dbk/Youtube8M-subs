 hello iphoneros and bastoneras I'm josema 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.700
 source 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.700
 and this is market to day 1 in the market 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.950
 to this day comes from the hand of psk 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.269
 export as a distributor and specifically 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:33.720
 the brand with low some slippers 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:35.650
 escarpments mail in italy facto in italy 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.090
 100% 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.390
 from the Treviso area 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.410
 an area that already has there marks 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.989
 consecrated as if from a great garnett 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.450
 comes also the chrono mark with the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.100
 characteristic design of the brands 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.379
 transalpinas design and quality and apart 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.480
 a series of characteristics that we are going to 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.430
 see now here in the daily market 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.339
 good at first sight what we see 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.320
 what is a shoe really 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.180
 aerodynamics and we say aerodynamics 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.000
 first because at the time of placing the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.729
 foot inside the shoe we see that the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.450
 The back part of the heel comes 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.580
 really reinforced in such a way that the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.610
 narrowness that you have in your interior is going to 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.990
 cause left heel 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.149
 perfectly subject within the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
 This shoe that causes 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.600
 pedaling effectiveness of course 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.970
 The foot has no movements 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.360
 unnecessary and always all the force 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.220
 what does it do for effectiveness comes 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.200
 reinforced also this whole part 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.570
 back inside 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 with a padding that will give you a 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.590
 extra comfort 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.630
 and then the norm we see that the last for 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.910
 of placing the foot is not in those ways 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.020
 really broad that make the dance 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.970
 the foot comes very well structured from 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.609
 so it will be very foot 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.079
 well engaged 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.509
 important when holding the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.929
 sneaker they have opted for two 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.929
 velcros 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.510
 the traditional ratchet system in the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.780
 superior with a characteristic you see 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.500
 here 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 comes with a carbon reinforcement have 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.350
 opted to put a reinforcement well 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.840
 simple is an area that normally 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.690
 when we stretch with the use and with the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.000
 time then this goes away and leaves 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.310
 deteriorating in a more remarkable way 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.489
 that the rest of the shoe this 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.230
 way it will remain unchanged its 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.230
 aesthetics for much longer 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.520
 the ratchet system for good the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.550
 traditional simply introduce 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.560
 and click to click we are adjusting to the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.290
 area of â€‹â€‹the instep at the time of taking 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.280
 just press the button 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.010
 and it was the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.010
 to be a little wider or more 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.990
 narrow depending on how you have 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.040
 by the feet 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.680
 how will you hold look at this area in what 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.320
 which is the upper ratchet with a velcro 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.720
 you will be able 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.900
 adjust it 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.340
 in this case, the thickness of your skin 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.160
 tongue is another of the parties 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.600
 important of a shoe of the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.860
 Italian scale we see that this 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.930
 provided inside a padded 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.680
 that will provide you apart from 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.680
 comfort a superior breathability 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.319
 the microfiber material is going to 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.050
 adjust also together with the ties 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.580
 perfectly to the instep and that there 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.590
 well that there are no movements 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.230
 unnecessary inside the shoe 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.560
 watching this time from the front 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.270
 backwards we see that it has the toe 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.360
 very well resolved and well reinforced 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.610
 and even with the part of the sole that 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.120
 comes up to protect just the part 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.120
 frontal 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.730
 the holes together with the grid 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.450
 really provides ventilation 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.450
 extraordinary at the foot 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.940
 of instances are those that will give us 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.490
 that extra ventilation part 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.280
 Exterior 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.410
 because it comes more reinforced is a part 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.069
 that in mountain bike is much more 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.490
 exposed to friction by falls in order to paste 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.800
 with the lateral roots stones and what 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.150
 have really solved with a small 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.699
 Extra reinforcement the inner last is a 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.270
 norm that is adapted practically 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.550
 between 93 and 94 percent of the feet 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.710
 what's on the market is not a way 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.050
 excessively wide or excessively 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.050
 narrow fits perfectly to the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.210
 great majority of feet giving them the 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.599
 necessary support for the greater 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.599
 effectiveness of pedaling a template with 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:19.840
 antibacterial treatment give you a 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.530
 extra comfort as well as great 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.530
 breathability 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.689
 and already with the sole in a sneaker 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.710
 competition mountain bike as it is 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:34.400
 this model chrono track 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.220
 comes reinforced with nylon studs 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.340
 really solid but they are going to give us 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.920
 enough traction so there's no 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.250
 slips needed in case of having 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.150
 to put your foot to the ground with an extra 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.700
 to be able to put two tacos in the part 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.820
 The sole is carbon 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.200
 really rigid when trying 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:05.050
 folding the shoe gives us the feeling 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.240
 that it is doubt that it is in this 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.520
 case that will provide us with that 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.740
 pedaling effectiveness that at the time of 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.300
 print force on the pedals as 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.900
 It will not be one of those that are like chewing gum 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.360
 but it will be solid and give great 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.900
 hardness and strength to the pedal 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.389
 the weight is a reasonable weight for the 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.449
 type of shoe that is a sneaker 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:34.250

 to the conclusion that it is a sneaker 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.939
 well resolved comfortable with a design 

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:59.669
 really beautiful 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:02.370
 but as the Italians say done in 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.350
