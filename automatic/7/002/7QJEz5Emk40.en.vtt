just<00:04:18.220> AFK<00:04:18.579> now<00:04:18.880> that's<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:19.419> they<00:04:20.320> don't<00:04:20.620> hit

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
just AFK now that's it they don't hit

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.370 
just AFK now that's it they don't hit
and<00:04:21.040> polypore<00:04:21.609> hits<00:04:21.820> really<00:04:22.270> high<00:04:22.449> these<00:04:23.199> guys

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
and polypore hits really high these guys

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.820 
and polypore hits really high these guys
drop<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.160> much<00:04:24.370> stuff<00:04:24.699> is<00:04:24.910> really<00:04:25.630> good<00:04:25.830> seeds

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
there's a Snapdragon see straight away

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.510 
there's a Snapdragon see straight away
and<00:04:46.050> they<00:04:47.050> spawn<00:04:47.350> right<00:04:47.590> there<00:04:47.830> so<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.250> can

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
just learn back in understand here and

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.379 
just learn back in understand here and
AFK<00:04:52.990> again<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.979> good<00:04:54.280> times<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:55.180> also

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389

the droops most herb drops because

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.420 
the droops most herb drops because
obviously<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:09.229> takes<00:06:09.410> up<00:06:09.590> inventory<00:06:10.190> space

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430
