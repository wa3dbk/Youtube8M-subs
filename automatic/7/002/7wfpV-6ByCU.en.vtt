00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
of I had made that conscious change in

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510 
of I had made that conscious change in
my<00:00:18.359> plane<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.900> point<00:00:19.170> right

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
my plane at that point right

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.640 
my plane at that point right
I've<00:00:21.480> been<00:00:21.630> listen<00:00:21.869> Jeff<00:00:22.050> back<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.500> whatever

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
I've been listen Jeff back and whatever

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.279 
I've been listen Jeff back and whatever
I<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.310> looking<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:23.789> these<00:00:23.910> weird<00:00:24.720> which<00:00:25.170> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
I was looking for these weird which is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
I was looking for these weird which is
probably<00:00:25.529> where<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.740> came<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.160> okay<00:00:26.779> very

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
probably where that came from okay very

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.500 
probably where that came from okay very
much<00:00:27.960> back<00:00:28.199> influence<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.890> guess<00:00:29.240> that's<00:00:30.240> stain

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
much back influence I guess that's stain

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.359 
much back influence I guess that's stain
