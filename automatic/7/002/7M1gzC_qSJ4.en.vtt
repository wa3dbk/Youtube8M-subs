00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.050
 Yes here we will continue to study with the discussion in Engineering 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.950
 I think there was at the fact before such difference progression and say Naya in flight now 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.590
 Sugar chain used 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:21.350
 A say and sugar used's flame 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:23.870
 b c House When these three sequences are arithmetic progressions , brother b is such arithmetic progression 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.340
 it's adsc 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.770
 This is the seed was the sugar chain used to this there was the Tteyuu'll origins 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 Here is located in is that of a geometric sequence number 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.329
 If you want to know more about sugar chain secondhand, please watch this video with this in action 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.719
 Then I will study about escapement work 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.520
 It seems like it will be similar from now on in the escapement Arithmetic abc When this is two distant lines, this equation holds 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.560
 so 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.100
 That's a kitchen in my head b 2 squared ac 8 a 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:02.649
 I think that the square of this will be the same as this 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.210
 As you say , along with the time of Osanaka Nakakome , to remember this or to say that 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.930
 Not at all 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.960
 Rather it is important that this idea holds true 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.750
 Why is this true? 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 Coffee is I granted it but distant progression 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.360
 It is from the same thing 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:29.070
 Look at hate b when this France abc t's attention 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.180
 I calculated this how I used it in coffee bran bra 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.220
 English b or convex sheet 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:41.740
 Onajikun bead Once the new attention even though construction costs'm btl of c min 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 I'm sorry I made a mistake b minutes c minutes b minutes ctl n ya 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.700
 If this coffee is the same 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.490
 This coffee is the same 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.360
 The low formula is true 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:01.610
 This part is disgusting that this fraction both sides 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.659
 ab by and then the denominator ab by ab lesion so that this expression naturally comes out 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.320
 It's rolling 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.320
 Important do is where say Zette also it is this coffee is the same than here 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:18.860
 It was the same time even with this numerical difference sequence, but only in the voyeur series, the yellow sand is the same or the older brother b this 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 I'm satisfied that this painter always coffee in the same fellows b is in this and cried to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.190
 Please confirm 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.850
 Also available such 2 am I to people confusing too abstract only these characters 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.190
 I am 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.760
 Speaking of this in the concrete example, when 12 collections are 2 rows of tofu, public expenses are the same 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.069
 right 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.680
 In other words, what happens when you look at your heart and things 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.960
 10 Arbo I mean 10/5 opposition 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.590
 What happens when you pay attention to Kawachicho Kawachi ? 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.460
 It is 2/10 , and if these two are = = 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.060
 I am saying 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.349
 If you calculate this properly, this formula will hold 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.860
 Over 10 years 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:03.420
 I think you have triple firmly made up multiplying this issue multiplied by voice 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:08.910
 So during this escape this bb Joy this expression is true 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:13.319
 And it's nothing to remember this formula but rather this cat in the cat is the same 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:20.020
 Please buy along with the way it is more important to think 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:23.650
 This equation is mon of about say convenient if you know in order to ensure that melts quickly the problem 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:29.680
 Let's actually confirm what concrete good practice with navigation 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:35.740
 For example , when the number sequence including 3x 48 is a geometric progression, find this x 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.700
 People that are from what do the above middle in this way of thinking in the escape is a geometric progression of Appoi is 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.000
 Only this 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.740
 In other words x-23 each 48 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.660
 Suddenly you're not a gel, I don't know anyone else I 'm sitting here I do n't remember 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:56.830
 48 here attention to public expense is going Tsukoko where attention construction Hirai x part of 3 minutes and 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:59.990
 If these two public expenses put out a 1 c 4 ball formula, what button will naturally guide this formula 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.960
 If you do well to erase both sides 3x minutes this 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.720
 When the formula comes out 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:14.140
 ak's advance and x2 guess is 144 why x is Puramai 12 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:16.000
 Here many times without x car towards humanity Te-12 12 will ignore + rank only then would 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.340
 People are inside, but it is 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.580
 But also because it's out 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:29.389
 If the number which is squared and becomes 144 after all is this number at the time of foot 4 + 12 during exa pramai 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.030
 It will be 3248 if it becomes what 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.930
 In other words , he chose 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.289
 It will be said that what will happen to 8- time 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.750
 3-way is Te 48 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.660
 What is this coffee 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.110
 Speaking of which , the form is well-matched in the minor battle of this day 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:53.150
 Minus also become any Funny - omitted element is no 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.960
 I think I'll answer both firmly so I'll come both 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.950
 That's a caveat 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.100
 And the surface through when a little there four and a like number 2 application 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.750
 what to do when there are four such x -4 x 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.360
 This too 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:13.180
 It's the same problem as focusing on the previous three without having to think about anything else 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:19.480
 Before Mitsu this is also equal ratio sequence from sister 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:25.990
 Even if you go straight to the consciousness that the regular second power is heard and this holds, ok 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:30.160
 Just like coffee, it's ok to think about it and publish it from this formula 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:34.390
 If in the Ekusabura from the Nehona Ekkusu some unusual 25 years 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:38.770
 This is also I'm standing now x pro lost both is a circuit together it is 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:42.940
 It will be 5-5 when it is fun x5 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:48.430
 5 I understand that coffee is -1 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:54.260
 So say the Kuruwai to the next and I'll become in this 2-1 bet was -5 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:58.830
 Is not this next x--5- when this series of 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:02.610
 I 'm going to wind a minus- 5 y tomorrow 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.680
 It is 1 if it is coffee nothing, so in this case 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.460
 -Buy with 5th place 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.550
 I think that I want to watch in m Here scalp used 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.380
 I learned about the 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:20.800
 It is important to remember here that this formula is not completely memorized even though it is learning 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:25.569
 Rather it is important that this coffee in the cat seeks the same old 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:31.160
 Even if you do not remember the four seasons of the cat, if this formula can be put out, the answer will come out without permission 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:34.640
 Please practicing aware of the here but rather it is the Tteyuu in the heart of escape this because 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.470
 With a finger after it, so the took off so that it can be in the delivery myself 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.470
 Let's train well
