I'm<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> thread<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.370> yarn<00:00:38.820> through<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
I'm going to thread my yarn through the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.520 
I'm going to thread my yarn through the
last<00:00:39.510> stitch<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.559> bottom<00:00:40.829> piece<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:42.530> so

last stitch on the bottom piece here so
I<00:00:43.590> through<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.129> top<00:00:44.600> I'm<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> doing<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I through at the top I'm kind of doing a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
I through at the top I'm kind of doing a
duplicate<00:00:47.039> stitch<00:00:47.219> type<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.820> technique<00:00:48.300> here

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
duplicate stitch type of technique here

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
duplicate stitch type of technique here
if<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.930> familiar<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.760> put<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
if you're familiar with that put it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
if you're familiar with that put it
through<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> top<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> bottom<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.989> then

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
through the top and the bottom and then

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.490 
through the top and the bottom and then
I<00:00:52.500> bring<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> back<00:00:53.010> around<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.079> I<00:00:55.079> thread<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I bring it back around and I thread it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
I bring it back around and I thread it
through<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.800> same<00:00:56.160> stitch<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> came

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
through this same stitch that it came

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.410 
through this same stitch that it came
out<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.800> helps<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.640> round<00:01:02.879> off<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
out of and that helps to round off the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.859 
out of and that helps to round off the
end<00:01:03.680> back<00:01:04.790> round<00:01:05.790> off<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> end<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.299> close<00:01:06.600> up

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
end back round off the end and close up

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.410 
end back round off the end and close up
the<00:01:06.990> mouth<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.430> turn

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the mouth so that it's going to turn

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.310 
the mouth so that it's going to turn
into<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.840> 3-dimensional<00:01:10.830> oval<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.200> see

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
into a 3-dimensional oval you can see

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.010 
into a 3-dimensional oval you can see
I've<00:01:13.409> already<00:01:13.650> finished<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.700> side

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
I've already finished off of this side

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.770 
I've already finished off of this side
and<00:01:16.460> that's<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> should<00:01:17.759> look<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.090> when

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and that's what it should look like when

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.520 
and that's what it should look like when
it's<00:01:18.990> finished<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:20.060> okay<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.119> after<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.630> do

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
I'm just gonna use my yarn needle to go

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.069 
I'm just gonna use my yarn needle to go
alternating<00:01:29.400> sides<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.000> take<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.689> through<00:01:30.869> one

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
alternating sides I take go through one

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
alternating sides I take go through one
stitch<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> top<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:32.130> stitch<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.520> the

months in a while I'll have a little

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.580 
months in a while I'll have a little
defect<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> end<00:02:12.180> there

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
defect on the end there

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.490 
defect on the end there
where<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.250> need<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.879> either<00:02:14.690> use<00:02:14.989> duplicate

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
where I need to either use duplicate

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.670 
where I need to either use duplicate
stitch<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.040> need<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.400> use<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.780> yarn<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.349> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
stitch or I need to use the yarn on the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.350 
stitch or I need to use the yarn on the
backside<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.550> kind<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.790> tighten<00:02:20.000> up<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
backside to kind of tighten up the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.229 
backside to kind of tighten up the
stitches<00:02:20.750> from<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.959> front<00:02:21.319> side<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:23.000> just

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
stitches from the front side so it just

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.729 
stitches from the front side so it just
it<00:02:23.450> seems<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.870> work<00:02:23.900> better<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:24.319> I<00:02:24.440> do<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
it seems to work better if I do the

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.850 
it seems to work better if I do the
white<00:02:24.950> yarn<00:02:25.280> first<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.940> then<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.209> red<00:02:26.360> yarn

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
white yarn first and then the red yarn

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.970 
white yarn first and then the red yarn
so<00:02:27.860> I'm<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.160> weaving<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.610> tail<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
so I'm just weaving this tail in and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.380 
so I'm just weaving this tail in and
after<00:02:30.980> that's<00:02:31.129> done<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:33.170> a

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
after that's done now I have a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.210 
after that's done now I have a
3-dimensional<00:02:35.470> oval<00:02:36.470> kind<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:36.830> looks<00:02:37.010> like

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
3-dimensional oval kind of looks like

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.880 
3-dimensional oval kind of looks like
half<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.849> an<00:02:37.970> egg<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.560> that's<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:39.769> you're

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
half of an egg and that's what you're

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.150 
half of an egg and that's what you're
going<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.099> use<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.670> little<00:02:40.910> fiberfill<00:02:42.160> stuffing

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
going to use a little fiberfill stuffing

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.039 
going to use a little fiberfill stuffing
and<00:02:43.959> sew<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:45.200> onto<00:02:45.739> your<00:02:45.769> head<00:02:47.049> good

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049
