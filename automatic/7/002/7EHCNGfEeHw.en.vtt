00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.800

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.140
 new video guys and good this time 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.430
 I bring you one way a mod point apk another 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.810
 Once and good you know they use the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.220
 blog lunch but they have to have it 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 configured good so that way 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 good to have activated remove and deactivate 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 sorry in safe mode have activated the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.640
 add-ons and good the download mote 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
 and it is installed as an apk in the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 inscription is the forum of the creator in 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 the forum will find what will be the link 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.339
 of mediafire from dropbox and also a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.010
 Google + community for testers 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.010
 of the mod and other little things out there some 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.269
 photos of what works and what does not 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 let's say that in what the model works 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.040
 that does not do that good let's go into 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.470
 our texture map that I have 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.049
 I used and as good as that 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.750
 go in 3ds so this is like giving him a 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.309
 enhancement or depth to what are the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 blocks example the stone kim and like 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.840
 you see looks different as type 3 of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.850
 aegis also good it is exposed that if 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.520
 I just like it as more volume does not 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720
 I know how to explain this highlights the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.820
 things that should have a little more 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.229
 of real but that enchantment can 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.360
 see what he has there are some more corners 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.340
 made here same looks more 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.079
 made the stone block and it makes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.610
 you see things a little more more 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.430
 beautiful are more 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.050
 it's so to speak the boats look 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.420
 the same is not that that ship looks medium 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.090
 I think that there is a fusion not the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 boats also suffer from everything from the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.590
 three of being a little thicker though 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.590
 we are also guided by the chests 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.270
 they look the same, I think the berries are the same 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.829
 let's see here this quartz look at the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.040
 fourth as you have as with enhancement 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.180
 as well 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.980
 to see around here there's nothing 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.210
 because the stone blocks all the 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.280
 stone blocks also have that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.400
 look miren sherman pretty the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.240
 I really liked being more bastards 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.560
 the goals not the heads are not few 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.700
 blocks but well those mountains 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.770
 can go out so you have to follow 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.530
 waiting for you to continue updating and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.709
 it goes much prettier everything in this in 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.300
 this case in the oven look it looks like 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.980
 that the fund does not get tired to see that 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.190
 see the bottom or it's like an oven 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.010
 really the table of the spells the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.810
 enchantments also has the enhancement and 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.200
 around here I see nothing nothing 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.410
 not at all 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.000
 I do not see anything for you 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.530
 and one of these blocks does not 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.270
 Wood also will be great 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.670
 put that effect because the wood 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.190
 it's also like a few lines 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.270
 and because there is nothing there is nothing 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.940
 berries look the same here 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.349
 click side let's put back I did not 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.830
 nothing says nothing to me and nothing else 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.090
 and I have not been the fences I do not know if 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.739
 the berries have they look a little 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.340
 different what they do not have is 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.170
 this here the fences but metal 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.930
 is the image looks different aims 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.030
 full more volume looks 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.450
 and well let's go see here I do not know 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.230
 if this thing has from here 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.280
 transmedia see how they look 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.560
 does not have any volume I do not think there's 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.880
 way is that here gives me a lot broke 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.230
 I think it melted 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.480
 I did not go and I did not go see to see 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.540
 let there be light there and breaking everything 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.150
 I was mother here I do not know 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.860
 appear we compose this 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.990
 is 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.360
 and well I think what stands that 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.890
 it's on the enchantment table and some 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.540
 blocks comes back to repeat is like 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.940
 we have developers but it's not 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.500
 coming out is a test to follow it from 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.550
 so you have to keep waiting 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.260

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.450

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.360

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.360
 a world of normal some normal world 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.730
 the only details that the earth is 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.160
 half guided on earth is half 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.019
 play looks all dark black all me 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.359
 well but planet the color black is the 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.549
 more beautiful to everyone so that is this 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.950
