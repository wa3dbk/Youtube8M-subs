00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.270 
all die I wonder if shotguns can kill a
range<00:04:53.440> in<00:04:53.650> this<00:04:53.770> game

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
range in this game

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.420 
range in this game

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
when it comes to shotguns I remember

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.029 
when it comes to shotguns I remember
more<00:05:01.690> for<00:05:01.930> three<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.200> could<00:05:02.320> put<00:05:02.500> range<00:05:02.770> on

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
more for three you could put range on

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.140 
more for three you could put range on
your<00:05:03.070> shotgun<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:03.820> would<00:05:03.910> help

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
your shotgun and that would help

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.240 
your shotgun and that would help
tremendously<00:05:05.220> but<00:05:07.080> why<00:05:08.080> use<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.440> shotgun<00:05:08.800> on

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250
