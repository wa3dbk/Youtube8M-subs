00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
black piece here almost 80% of the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
black piece here almost 80% of the
weight<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.240> putter<00:00:24.510> head<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.930> focused<00:00:25.380> in

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
weight of this putter head is focused in

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.300 
weight of this putter head is focused in
that<00:00:25.800> black<00:00:26.400> back<00:00:27.410> when<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
that black back when you see what is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.009 
that black back when you see what is
normally<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> high<00:00:30.060> moment<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> inertia<00:00:30.539> putter

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
normally a high moment of inertia putter

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.319 
normally a high moment of inertia putter
you<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> large<00:00:32.099> unusually<00:00:32.790> shaped<00:00:33.000> butter

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
you see a large unusually shaped butter

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.020 
you see a large unusually shaped butter
you<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.870> our<00:00:34.020> drone<00:00:34.370> well<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.700> idea

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you know like our drone well the idea

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
you know like our drone well the idea
behind<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.809> being<00:00:37.170> able<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> create

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
behind this was being able to create

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.819 
behind this was being able to create
that<00:00:38.010> very<00:00:38.489> very<00:00:38.730> high<00:00:39.120> moment<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.260> inertia<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that very very high moment of inertia a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
that very very high moment of inertia a
lot<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> stability<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> putter<00:00:42.180> head<00:00:42.360> but

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
lot of stability in the putter head but

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.069 
lot of stability in the putter head but
in<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> smaller<00:00:43.350> footprint<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.780> saving<00:00:45.780> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
in a smaller footprint so saving that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.470 
in a smaller footprint so saving that
weight<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.800> area<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> big<00:00:47.940> key<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
weight out of this area was a big key to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
weight out of this area was a big key to
getting<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> moment<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.500> inertia<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:50.160> very

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
getting the moment of inertia very very

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
getting the moment of inertia very very
high<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.000> yeah<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> would<00:00:51.809> say<00:00:51.989> even<00:00:52.140> among<00:00:52.410> our

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
high and yeah I would say even among our

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.630 
high and yeah I would say even among our
Tour<00:00:52.739> players<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.280> looked<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
Tour players that have looked at this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920 
Tour players that have looked at this
thing<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> try<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.780> their

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
thing and try to the you know their

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
thing and try to the you know their
first<00:00:55.079> reaction<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
first reaction is kind of like what is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
first reaction is kind of like what is
that<00:00:57.239> however<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.680> once<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.070> hit<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> few

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that however if once they hit a few

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
that however if once they hit a few
putts<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.199> think<00:01:01.199> feels<00:01:01.530> pretty<00:01:01.739> good

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
putts with it I think feels pretty good

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
putts with it I think feels pretty good
so<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.969> definitely<00:01:03.030> something

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
so it's it's definitely something

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.289 
so it's it's definitely something
unusual<00:01:04.400> again<00:01:05.400> encompassing<00:01:05.970> our<00:01:06.060> poly

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
unusual again encompassing our poly

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.730 
unusual again encompassing our poly
metal<00:01:06.570> groove<00:01:06.750> technology<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
metal groove technology this would be a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
metal groove technology this would be a
core<00:01:08.010> insert<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:10.549> like<00:01:11.549> we

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
core insert in that one and just like we

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
core insert in that one and just like we
saw<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:11.939> drone<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:13.049> stable<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
saw with drone very very stable that's a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
saw with drone very very stable that's a
large<00:01:14.159> large<00:01:14.490> amount<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> weight<00:01:15.180> another

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
large large amount of weight another

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.359 
large large amount of weight another
interesting<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.070> kind<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
interesting thing that that kind of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
interesting thing that that kind of
shows<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.270> lot<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> our<00:01:18.600> testing<00:01:18.840> because

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
shows up in a lot of our testing because

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770 
shows up in a lot of our testing because
there's<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.159> weight<00:01:20.430> back<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.600> tray

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
there's so much weight back in this tray

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
there's so much weight back in this tray
it's<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.619> hard<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> de<00:01:23.250> sel<00:01:23.460> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it's really really hard to de sel this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.310 
it's really really hard to de sel this
putter<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.420> take<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
putter so like take it back then kind of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
putter so like take it back then kind of
quit<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.729> once<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
quit on it it it just once you get that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.880 
quit on it it it just once you get that
thing<00:01:27.600> moving<00:01:27.930> forward<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.409> stroke<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
thing moving forward in your stroke it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.770 
thing moving forward in your stroke it
just<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> wants<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> keep<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.780> yeah

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
just kind of wants to keep going yeah

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.910 
just kind of wants to keep going yeah
that's<00:01:30.900> great<00:01:31.079> I'm<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.290> looking<00:01:31.710> forward

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that's great I'm really looking forward

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.380
