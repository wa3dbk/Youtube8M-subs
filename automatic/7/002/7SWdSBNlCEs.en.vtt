00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.730
 hello youtube friends this presents them 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.009
 a design of Amazonian nails this 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.820
 with the other flowers in another video 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:23.360
 I leave it there to start with the base 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.510
 with a pink tone with golden seals 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.660
 in the part of the banks not of stands 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.079
 inward and inward 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.579
 an enamel this one 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.070
 a semitone 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.230
 and it's also the brand notice in the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.700
 center nothing more 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.809
 so that the two colors stand out 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.470
 has to be perfect this is not a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.470
 perfect work 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.430
 I have a craquelure 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.290
 in pink and what I do is put the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.850
 I put a few dots 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.450
 as simulating cracks has been very 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.710
 father because as two colors are 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.710
 it combines quite well 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.950
 we are already applying the dots 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.680
 and look here they are already dry 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.829
 and it's already cracked and they look 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.049
 the two colors where the Chinese 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.049
 buy these flowers 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:45.270
 and we are going to apply them in the pongo 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:45.270
 I want this shine so that I can adhere 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.180
 I'm going to take you 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.480
 Y 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:01.120
 look and there's the pressure is with a 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:05.860
 pin or with a toothpick or with a 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.440
 pointer and do not press and you're this 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.830
 they would be very parents because they absorb all 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.120
 the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.120
 the paint appear as a cloth type 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.770
 and not 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.280
 not inserted 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.760
 and to seal you put this dryer or 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.230
 some sealer 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.230
 is this the same 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.069
 look at it you extend 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.750
 let's bring the camera closer so that 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.700
 mayors to notice 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.900
 look 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.900
 I already put 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.980
 all but like I saw that they were missing 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.890
 something then this grip um 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.810
 in this enamel with glitter in gold 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.340
 and I also put them on random so they do not 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.060
 has to be perfect this is a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.140
 more striking work does not exist that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.420
 look so so so so square no and what 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.580
 you apply where else you feel that the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.360
 skirt I put everything around the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.910
 little flowers that is the finished work 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.440
