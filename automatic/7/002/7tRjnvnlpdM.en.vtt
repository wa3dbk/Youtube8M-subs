00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you look at it closely it has very very

smooth lines everything's just been

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.030 
smooth lines everything's just been
touched<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.360> car<00:01:15.630> looks<00:01:15.900> even<00:01:16.890> better

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
touched up and the car looks even better

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.020 
touched up and the car looks even better
than<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> did<00:01:17.520> before

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the dfi engine has followed into this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
the dfi engine has followed into this
car<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.509> more<00:01:22.020> power<00:01:22.080> units<00:01:22.680> even<00:01:22.830> more

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
car it's got more power units even more

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.310 
car it's got more power units even more
fuel<00:01:23.340> efficient<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.930> PDK<00:01:25.290> transmission

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
fuel efficient and the PDK transmission

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
fuel efficient and the PDK transmission
is<00:01:25.979> also<00:01:26.310> followed<00:01:26.670> suit<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.270> been<00:01:27.420> refined

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is also followed suit it's been refined

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
is also followed suit it's been refined
as<00:01:28.020> well<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> shifts<00:01:29.009> even<00:01:29.100> smoother<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
as well so it shifts even smoother and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.980 
as well so it shifts even smoother and
faster<00:01:30.000> than<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.420> did<00:01:30.509> before

faster than it did before

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.490 
faster than it did before
it's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.950> remarkable<00:01:32.630> drivetrain<00:01:33.630> setup<00:01:34.079> very

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.380 
they able to put the power to the ground
in<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.100> way<00:01:44.219> that<00:01:44.340> nobody<00:01:44.610> else<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
in a way that nobody else can what I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
in a way that nobody else can what I
really<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.140> Cayman<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
really like about the Cayman is that it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.399 
really like about the Cayman is that it
truly<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> performance<00:01:48.539> parlor

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
truly is a performance parlor

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440 
truly is a performance parlor
not<00:01:49.920> unlike<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> rest<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.610> our<00:01:50.729> vehicles<00:01:51.210> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
not unlike the rest of our vehicles but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.930 
not unlike the rest of our vehicles but
the<00:01:52.259> drivetrain<00:01:52.710> layout<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
the drivetrain layout it's a

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.780 
the drivetrain layout it's a
which<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.470> key<00:01:55.770> factor<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.520> true

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
which really is a key factor in a true

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.420 
which really is a key factor in a true
true<00:01:57.150> performance<00:01:57.900> sports<00:01:58.170> car<00:01:58.470> so<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.370> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
true performance sports car so it's a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.490 
true performance sports car so it's a
very<00:01:59.610> very<00:01:59.730> neutrally<00:02:00.210> balanced<00:02:00.660> car<00:02:00.900> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
very very neutrally balanced car it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.940 
very very neutrally balanced car it's
very<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:03.210> very<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:04.230> know<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.440> Telegraph's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
performance that we can put out so and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
car don't don't pass on the Porsche the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.790 
car don't don't pass on the Porsche the
Porsche<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.180> surprisingly<00:03:06.930> affordable<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.709> lot

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800

their<00:03:09.300> price<00:03:09.510> range<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.080> then<00:03:10.500> they<00:03:10.650> come<00:03:10.830> in

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
their price range and then they come in

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.650 
their price range and then they come in
here<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.220> they<00:03:11.340> are<00:03:11.550> very<00:03:11.940> very<00:03:12.180> surprised<00:03:12.570> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
here and they are very very surprised to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.240 
here and they are very very surprised to
see<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.930> our<00:03:13.170> price<00:03:13.440> range<00:03:13.650> isn't<00:03:13.860> as<00:03:14.040> much

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
see that our price range isn't as much

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.100 
see that our price range isn't as much
as<00:03:14.400> they<00:03:14.550> thought<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> would<00:03:15.750> definitely

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
as they thought so I would definitely

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.780 
as they thought so I would definitely
consider<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.470> Porsche<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:17.040> lot<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.459> guys<00:03:17.580> are
