00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 way you guys it's sexy so 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.950
 today feels for a small 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.629
 video so I have lower copts which I 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.940
 tell you live but I him Saturday 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.570
 is a friend who passed before my xbox 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.429
 forgiveness heart while playing that nickel 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.650
 it's good I still have the cd of the ain 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.190
 and seeing that I played quite a lot 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.109
 still 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 with them it's not the others I'm you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.199
 were talking about my classes so I'm going to you 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.939
 explain a little 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.789
 and what do I take them all 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.250
 accessories etc etc 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 so I'm going to start directly by 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.899
 the triggerfish then the triggerfish acquired from 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.950
 level 43 blocks 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.300
 so that's not bad because he 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.480
 is 57 level so you have to go 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.640
 so I limit or just with the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.590
 fast charger ie you 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.690
 recharge faster and we can not 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 put the improved loader with so I 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.120
 advise you to take if ua because 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.190
 that will change middle in order to load 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.690
 cloak there are not many 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 balls which more basic and after if 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.329
 we recharge and finally it's a bit 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.500
 hassle 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.070
 then I put the sights on the ballista 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.960
 after I show you is beautiful our 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.949
 class with the visa but I put the sea 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.100
 that is, you do not have the viewfinder 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.350
 it's just the lock so it's very 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.330
 very very nice because it was 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.090
 present only on the trend never seen 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 it was really enjoyable so it was 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.200
 I put this and for third asset 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.600
 third forgiveness props I put 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.259
 the fmj so the shirt balls and so 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 the word to all is a map at wholesale 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.460
 you have three cards at the bottom of the screen 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.990
 you can see and choose that one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 to have a third incidentally 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.240
 main lady so I did not put any weapons 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.130
 observed secondary or six days this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.570
 is not a scared toy and after but 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.049
 my strengths I spoke to you a little 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.640
 after because my classes are are 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.439
 almost not doing its all the same when 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.420
 you will have so I will explain a little 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.340
 the tactical inserts the trumps all 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.829
 to love but that strict after so 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.110
 Then I will show you my other 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.509
 class so there what just changes you 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.770
 have you see in the place of the test this 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.899
 will be a city in celebration that allows me 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.610
 believe that aiming faster but 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.040
 not much but it's still the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.570
 museum more quickly so kind of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.789
 mini pass passes in quotation marks it's 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.879
 a nice little hole right 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.349
 I wanted to me on this ballista who already 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.730
 for the markup does not really know what 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.519
 actually different because I do not have 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.810
 really more here than that but for the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.659
 next class that I showed you 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.469
 you will see that the dsr 50 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.200
 this accessory is still 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:28.049
 indispensable because I at first I 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.030
 tell me fucking I galley more we feel 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.099
 that something is missing and I put this 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.829
 accessory is and I can tell you that 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.180
 it's enjoyable at pleasure so good 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.379
 that's it then I'll talk to you 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.889
 quickly and a few of my strict keys including 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.970
 you saw I read and saw the game knows 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.200
 what is it a paper plane your 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.299
 suddenly you throw that kills someone would 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.909
 waiting for a bape and the package 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.340
 strategic good here 3 attoub asia for 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.989
 I prefer the I prefer to put that one 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.250
 see a small personal choice pascal it's 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.340
 hard to unlock the killstreaks so 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.930
 here is the class with mount des 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.379
 deer 50 when I told you exactly 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.569
 the same as the previous one but I you 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.430
 honestly say the viewfinder to aim a 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.769
 a little bit faster there it is very useful so 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.269
 the 2nd skin and war accessories is very 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.519
 very very useful so I advise you 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.829
 enormously then like everyone else 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.959
 jimmy so I do not see very well here 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.129
 so wait I'll see that's it 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.470
 so I took the sort of anti shield 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.790
 explosion that is to say that for you 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.260
 feel mans the damage exposes us 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.819
 here paid xixe limit to you 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.859
 tickles everything so it's very 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.109
 interesting simple second asset that's 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.729
 a kind of detectable one can not you 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.519
 noticed in the radar all that the 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.780
 planes and and god knows it's very 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.329
 important when we do the girl 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.919
 of your according to dexterity so the 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.870
 third round I took what you 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.159
 lets advance to skip funerals more 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.340
 quickly aim faster when 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.629
 you are touched you see it's I 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.720

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.280

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.560
