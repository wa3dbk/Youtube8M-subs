out the whole 3m but it still has a
smooth<00:03:42.680> texture<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.930> added<00:03:45.230> features<00:03:45.500> I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
smooth texture to it so added features I

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.440 
smooth texture to it so added features I
gave<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.540> eggplant<00:03:47.650> purple<00:03:48.850> heel<00:03:49.850> tab<00:03:50.120> so
