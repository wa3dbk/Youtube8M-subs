 our right hand let's enter the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.820
 as well as I have it taking into account 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.159
 that this sample that is here should go and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.310
 match the drawing that has the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.130

 has as you can see has the notch 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 down and to my left or towards 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.509
 the left of the cell phone as I have it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.000
 I positioned myself then of that same 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.539
 way and with the contacts that are these 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.670

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.630
 without charge 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.280

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.400
 count the notch down 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.770
 to introduce without having to do 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.470
 additional pressure simply until 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.790
