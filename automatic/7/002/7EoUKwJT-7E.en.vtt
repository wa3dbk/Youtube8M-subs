 A dessert for you is a kind of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.140
 more 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 the first way to prepare these 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 using the scratch card machine 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 of ice if you do not have the machine 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.289
 I 'm desperate to show you another 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.320
 way a little more laborious but that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.140
 it gets super delicious you go 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.140
 put ice to shave and ready 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.130
 in this first recipe I used the beans 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.710
 canned candy that you find in the 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.260
 Korean grocery stores but if it was difficult 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.300
 find this reported do not despair 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.590
 that I'll show you how to make your 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.380
 own beans 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.290
 in a little bit looks like he 's texture 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.470
 of this bean reports is super concentrated 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.150
 and it is welcome if now is the only mount 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.660
 first you will put a layer of 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:43.640
 scratch card will put a 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:46.310
 a little milk and sweet beans and the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.110
 finally condensed milk at first 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.009
 this basic recipe 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.979
 only I'm going to put fruit ice cream 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.650
 motives coito cereal farofa sweet everything 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.759
 that you have the available dossier is 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.759
 Welcome, it's good. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:14.470
 finally we put the milk 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:16.480
 condensed and it's a delight to have 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.160
 eat I like to mix everything 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.690
 but for those who do not like a lot of mess 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.190
 You can eat everything separately. It's okay. 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.349
 It was super easy, right? 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.790
 Now I'm going to teach you how to prepare the 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.590
 sweet beans 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.230
 first you will need to leave the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.569
 Raw red bean soaking in water by 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.180
 about six hours or more 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.239
 after six hours it looks like beans 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.310
 was well hydrated 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.959
 Let's put the beans in the pan and 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.780
 amount of water will be four 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.930
 times the amount of beans that is me 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.650
 I treated 200 grams of beans that gave 400 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.160
 mL 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.040
 I then placed 600 thousand ml of water 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.540
 boil for 10 minutes over high heat and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.890
 then for another 30 minutes over medium heat 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.549
 then you will reduce the fire 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.269
 add sugar to the salt and glucose of 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.010
 corn 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.829
 if you do not have a corn case, you can 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.829
 replace with honey or more sugar 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:28.900
 now let's stir this mixture into fire 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:32.770
 down for 15 minutes to leave the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.930
 very dense broth the dough some beans and 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.600
 Now to check if the beans are good. 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.250
 cooked with your fingers if she 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.760
 To undo it well means that it is in the 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.470
 right point 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.700
 wait cool and it's ready to be 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.100
 consumed now for those who have not 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.380
 ice scraper machine the cileite 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.780
 I put it in the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.630
 ice to make it easier to hit 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.870
 beat the milk cubes in the blender 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.770
 frozen office along with a little bit 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.770
 condensed milk 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.100
 If you do not have a blender, you can 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.020
 even use a fork for this because the 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.650
 cubs they do not get so hard 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.650
 neither ice 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.540
 Look how the texture of it gets super 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.040
 I need snow, right? 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.560
 now just go back to the layers like me 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.870
 showed earlier 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.650
 I put a layer of ice linen 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.650
 milk 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:55.560
 with a little bit of good home-made beans 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.310
 most delicious and the reasons put 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.310
 some fruits 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:20.970
 Finally, the condensed taster 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.300
 for you because it will not melt 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.240
 Come on. I like to mix everything up. 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.880
 people actually eat in a bowl knows 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.820
 great justify puts all fruits 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:43.919
 put all that is something that is 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:46.229
 possible to make a gororoba a very good one 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.120
 much better than the crowded anthem because 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.160
 you can control the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:56.010
 amount of sugar you want in the 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.990
 your bean then ours and that ram and that 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:05.070
 g line of milk people are very 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:08.400
 Creamy recipe is always if you 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.830
 have all sides but it's hard is 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.349
 complicated if you have not and will have to 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.240
 cooking but it's much better much more 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.400
 healthy because there you will get 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.159
 control the level of sugar you 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.039
 either in beans it has no additive they do not have 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:25.139
 preservatives in the then is super more 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.970
 healthy then was that no one to 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.759
 swing because it did not work 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.250
 to clean is an excuse is not anymore 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.919
 because the ice cream is melting here I 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.659
 I wanted to record the work you and the 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.330
 What do you have at home adding?
