00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
three weeks ago or a month ago I'd be

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.430 
three weeks ago or a month ago I'd be
unboxing<00:02:15.790> for<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.030> while<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.420> never<00:02:16.599> uploaded

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.559 
unboxing for a while and never uploaded
it<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.790> noticed<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.329> that's

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
it that if you noticed this that's

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.600 
it that if you noticed this that's
probably<00:02:19.810> why<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.170> review<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.250> close<00:02:21.579> to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.360 
actually I was using this when I got it
this<00:04:39.310> was<00:04:39.550> like<00:04:39.729> what<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:39.940> use<00:04:40.270> never<00:04:40.479> sit<00:04:40.840> on<00:04:40.930> my

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
this was like what I use never sit on my

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.390 
this was like what I use never sit on my
Berlin<00:04:42.370> wood<00:04:42.960> which<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:43.990> more<00:04:44.380> expensive<00:04:44.770> and

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
Berlin wood which is more expensive and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.060 
Berlin wood which is more expensive and
I<00:04:46.060> can<00:04:46.270> used<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.630> this<00:04:46.780> shape<00:04:47.050> now<00:04:47.260> how<00:04:47.560> much<00:04:47.740> I

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
I can used to this shape now how much I

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.129 
I can used to this shape now how much I
actually<00:04:48.400> like<00:04:48.789> it<00:04:48.970> better<00:04:49.000> than<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:49.720> Berlin

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
actually like it better than a Berlin

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.560 
actually like it better than a Berlin
wood<00:04:50.349> I<00:04:53.430> don't<00:04:54.430> know<00:04:54.520> why<00:04:54.729> it's<00:04:54.970> really<00:04:55.330> dumb

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
wood I don't know why it's really dumb

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.689 
wood I don't know why it's really dumb
but<00:04:55.770> probably<00:04:56.770> because<00:04:56.979> I'm<00:04:57.130> used<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.490> the

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
but probably because I'm used to the

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.409 
but probably because I'm used to the
shape<00:04:58.050> what<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.080> use<00:04:59.620> right<00:04:59.770> now<00:04:59.940> but<00:05:00.940> like<00:05:01.150> I

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
shape what I use right now but like I

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.900 
shape what I use right now but like I
can<00:05:01.690> do<00:05:01.840> pretty<00:05:01.870> much<00:05:02.169> this<00:05:02.320> picture

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.100

they're really nice this is not metal
it's<00:06:15.880> wooden<00:06:17.220> but<00:06:18.220> yeah<00:06:18.400> like<00:06:18.730> I<00:06:19.150> was<00:06:19.600> using<00:06:19.810> it

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
it's wooden but yeah like I was using it

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.870 
it's wooden but yeah like I was using it
on<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.230> poles<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.740> my<00:06:20.920> scooter<00:06:21.280> a<00:06:21.430> while<00:06:21.670> ago

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
on the poles of my scooter a while ago

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.050 
on the poles of my scooter a while ago
those<00:06:22.510> always<00:06:22.690> hurt<00:06:23.670> maybe<00:06:24.670> it<00:06:24.880> was<00:06:25.000> the

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
those always hurt maybe it was the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.640 
those always hurt maybe it was the
middle<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.450> the<00:06:25.630> scooter<00:06:27.660> wheels<00:06:28.660> bearing

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
middle of the scooter wheels bearing

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:38.940 
middle of the scooter wheels bearing
wheels<00:06:30.000> we're<00:06:31.000> all<00:06:31.060> really<00:06:31.270> nicely<00:06:36.180> I<00:06:37.950> don't

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
wheels we're all really nicely I don't

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.000 
wheels we're all really nicely I don't
know<00:06:39.100> if<00:06:39.280> this<00:06:39.550> is<00:06:39.760> actually<00:06:40.510> happens<00:06:41.170> but

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
know if this is actually happens but

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.050 
know if this is actually happens but
like<00:06:42.070> you<00:06:42.340> know<00:06:42.370> when<00:06:42.580> you<00:06:42.670> get<00:06:42.760> a<00:06:42.820> real

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
like you know when you get a real

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.370 
like you know when you get a real
skateboard<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:43.780> you're<00:06:43.960> working<00:06:44.170> your

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
skateboard and you're working your

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.310 
skateboard and you're working your
bearings<00:06:44.950> and<00:06:45.070> they<00:06:45.220> go<00:06:45.400> like<00:06:45.640> faster<00:06:46.600> when<00:06:47.230> I

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
bearings and they go like faster when I

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.070 
bearings and they go like faster when I
got<00:06:47.530> these<00:06:47.680> wheels<00:06:48.010> they<00:06:48.250> were<00:06:48.310> spinning<00:06:48.550> like

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
got these wheels they were spinning like

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.350 
got these wheels they were spinning like
like<00:06:50.080> and<00:06:50.550> then<00:06:51.550> now<00:06:51.790> there's<00:06:52.060> been<00:06:52.210> like<00:06:54.360> so

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
like and then now there's been like so

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.810 
like and then now there's been like so
yeah<00:06:55.690> so<00:06:56.140> I<00:06:56.170> guess<00:06:56.650> they<00:06:56.800> got<00:06:56.980> worked<00:06:57.310> in<00:06:57.520> now

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
yeah so I guess they got worked in now

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.220 
yeah so I guess they got worked in now
I'm<00:06:58.690> like<00:06:58.900> better<00:06:59.260> than<00:06:59.590> when<00:06:59.770> I<00:06:59.800> got<00:07:00.070> them

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
I'm like better than when I got them

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.910 
I'm like better than when I got them
that's<00:07:02.230> good

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:02.920 
that's good

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.300 
that's good
and<00:07:03.850> so<00:07:04.810> that's<00:07:04.990> pretty<00:07:05.140> much<00:07:05.380> the<00:07:05.860> review

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
and so that's pretty much the review

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.810 
and so that's pretty much the review
it's<00:07:06.580> really<00:07:06.910> sick<00:07:07.410> just<00:07:08.410> what<00:07:09.190> I<00:07:09.220> have<00:07:09.430> to<00:07:09.610> say
