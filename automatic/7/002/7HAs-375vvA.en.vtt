00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
here's what it looks like on installed I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
here's what it looks like on installed I
think<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.379> looks<00:01:01.410> pretty<00:01:01.710> cool<00:01:01.949> actually<00:01:04.369> it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
think it looks pretty cool actually it

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.760 
think it looks pretty cool actually it
seems<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.780> most<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.470> should<00:01:07.890> say<00:01:08.159> your

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
seems all well most of I should say your

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.440 
seems all well most of I should say your
icons<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.100> springboard<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.970> turns<00:01:12.210> them

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
icons on your springboard it turns them

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.109 
icons on your springboard it turns them
into<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.930> circles<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.860> which<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.850> think

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
into little circles and which I think

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.539

here auy and i use the I hacks repo to

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.880 
here auy and i use the I hacks repo to
find<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:51.920> because<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.239> paid<00:03:53.890> theme

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890
