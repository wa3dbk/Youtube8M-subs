moving through the windows stuff of that

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.379 
moving through the windows stuff of that
nature<00:02:53.349> using<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> arrow<00:02:54.549> keys<00:02:54.639> you<00:02:54.909> can<00:02:55.060> turn

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
nature using the arrow keys you can turn

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:01.020 
nature using the arrow keys you can turn
right<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.970> left<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.840> can<00:03:00.030> basically

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
right right and left you can basically

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.780 
right right and left you can basically
use<00:03:01.389> those<00:03:01.599> to<00:03:01.780> navigate<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:03.189> that's<00:03:03.579> how<00:03:03.760> all

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
use those to navigate and that's how all

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.819 
use those to navigate and that's how all
navigation<00:03:04.540> works<00:03:07.109> you<00:03:08.109> can<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.409> back<00:03:08.620> into

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
navigation works you can go back into

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.199 
navigation works you can go back into
the<00:03:09.010> adventures<00:03:09.459> hall<00:03:14.729> and<00:03:15.729> are<00:03:15.819> back<00:03:16.000> out

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the adventures hall and are back out

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.449 
the adventures hall and are back out
again<00:03:16.449> here<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.440> move<00:03:20.560> forward

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
again here we can move forward

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.990 
again here we can move forward
there's<00:03:22.239> Margot's<00:03:22.750> he's<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.169> weapon<00:03:23.470> dealer

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
there's Margot's he's the weapon dealer

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.399 
there's Margot's he's the weapon dealer
so<00:03:25.000> really<00:03:25.720> pretty<00:03:25.870> much<00:03:26.079> that's<00:03:26.290> just

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
so really pretty much that's just

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.199 
so really pretty much that's just
basically<00:03:26.829> how<00:03:27.040> movements<00:03:27.459> gonna<00:03:27.609> be<00:03:27.819> you<00:03:28.060> can

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
basically how movements gonna be you can

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.050 
basically how movements gonna be you can
tell<00:03:28.419> it's<00:03:28.540> really<00:03:28.599> old-school<00:03:29.199> it's<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
tell it's really old-school it's in the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.849 
tell it's really old-school it's in the
vein<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.479> a<00:03:31.569> lot<00:03:31.690> of<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:31.900> mine<00:03:32.139> magic<00:03:32.620> lanes

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
vein of a lot of like mine magic lanes

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.740 
vein of a lot of like mine magic lanes
will<00:03:33.040> or<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.340> type<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.669> thing

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
will or that type of thing

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.979 
will or that type of thing
so<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.829> know<00:03:35.919> it's<00:03:36.190> pretty<00:03:36.430> basic<00:03:37.359> right<00:03:37.810> now

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so I know it's pretty basic right now

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.659 
so I know it's pretty basic right now
but<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.709> want<00:03:38.889> to<00:03:38.979> give<00:03:39.069> you<00:03:39.099> guys<00:03:39.310> an<00:03:39.519> idea

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
but I just want to give you guys an idea

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.930 
but I just want to give you guys an idea
what<00:03:40.569> was<00:03:40.720> going<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.669> new<00:03:42.669> gameplay

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
what was going on and new gameplay
