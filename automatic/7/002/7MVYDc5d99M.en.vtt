now<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> lot<00:01:08.909> easier<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.450> than<00:01:09.630> like

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
now that's a lot easier to do than like

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
knife lunging I go on top of the map

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
knife lunging I go on top of the map
whatever<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> good<00:01:13.320> barrier<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
