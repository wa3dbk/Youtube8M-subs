taking it easier I'm going to be taking

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.269 
taking it easier I'm going to be taking
along<00:00:17.730> my<00:00:18.029> 6<00:00:18.570> x<00:00:18.690> 17<00:00:19.140> panoramic<00:00:19.770> camera<00:00:20.130> which

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
along my 6 x 17 panoramic camera which

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.599 
along my 6 x 17 panoramic camera which
is<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.699> smaller<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.510> lighter<00:00:22.220> easier<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
is a lot smaller and lighter easier to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.820 
is a lot smaller and lighter easier to
use<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.119> some<00:00:24.449> ways<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.710> use

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
use in some ways to because I can use

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.939 
use in some ways to because I can use
roll<00:00:26.099> film<00:00:26.369> instead<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> sheet<00:00:27.119> film<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.949> think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
roll film instead of sheet film I think

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.420 
roll film instead of sheet film I think
today<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.369> day<00:00:29.640> more<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> exploration<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
today is a day more of exploration and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.920 
today is a day more of exploration and
scouting<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.579> trying<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> figure<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.540> where

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
scouting out trying to figure out where

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.650 
scouting out trying to figure out where
i'm<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.469> shots<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.360> coming

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
week when the color is better in this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
week when the color is better in this
area<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.270> point<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.140> trees<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
area at this point the trees are kind of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200 
area at this point the trees are kind of
a<00:00:40.890> greenish<00:00:41.280> yellow<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.879> they're<00:00:42.059> not

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
a greenish yellow but they're not

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510 
a greenish yellow but they're not
anywhere<00:00:42.930> near<00:00:42.989> peak<00:00:43.860> there's<00:00:44.160> still<00:00:44.370> many

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
anywhere near peak there's still many

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
anywhere near peak there's still many
days<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> let's<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.670> warmer<00:00:47.910> today<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
days to go so let's be warmer today that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.420 
days to go so let's be warmer today that
would<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.320> nice<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
would be nice because it's going to be a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:41.210 
would be nice because it's going to be a
very<00:00:50.489> wet<00:00:50.789> day

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.970 

so<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.210> camera<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.660> took<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:43.020> me<00:01:43.230> today<00:01:43.470> it's

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
so the camera I took with me today it's

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.390 
so the camera I took with me today it's
6<00:01:44.790> x<00:01:44.910> 17<00:01:45.420> panoramic<00:01:45.960> camera<00:01:46.260> uses<00:01:47.040> medium

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
6 x 17 panoramic camera uses medium

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.700 
6 x 17 panoramic camera uses medium
format<00:01:47.670> film<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.330> it's<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.470> rangefinder

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
format film and it's a rangefinder

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.980 
format film and it's a rangefinder
camera<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.460> has<00:01:50.730> a<00:01:51.030> viewfinder<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.810> clips

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
camera so it has a viewfinder that clips

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560 
camera so it has a viewfinder that clips
onto<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> top<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.120> this<00:01:54.120> viewfinder<00:01:54.360> is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
onto the top here and this viewfinder is

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
onto the top here and this viewfinder is
nice<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.260> pull<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> off<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:56.310> can

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
nice because you can pull it off you can

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.090 
nice because you can pull it off you can
hang<00:01:56.910> around<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.920> hold

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
hang around with it and I can just hold

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
hang around with it and I can just hold
it<00:01:59.220> up<00:01:59.370> look<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.810> viewfinder<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it up look right that viewfinder and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.440 
it up look right that viewfinder and
I'll<00:02:02.010> know<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.550> composition<00:02:03.150> is<00:02:03.270> good

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
I'll know if the composition is good

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
I'll know if the composition is good
without<00:02:03.720> even<00:02:03.930> pulling<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.170> camera<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.650> so<00:02:05.370> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
without even pulling the camera out so I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.710 
without even pulling the camera out so I
keep<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.910> POC<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.330> here<00:02:06.480> it's

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
keep that in a POC right here it's

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:38.180 
keep that in a POC right here it's
really<00:02:06.900> nice

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.440 

I<00:02:38.250> gotta<00:02:38.580> say<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:38.910> been<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> great<00:02:39.270> day<00:02:39.330> for

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.740 
I gotta say it's been a great day for
scouting

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
scouting

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.750 
scouting
I<00:02:40.810> found<00:02:41.170> two<00:02:41.410> particular<00:02:41.860> photos<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.460> think

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
I found two particular photos I think

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.310 
I found two particular photos I think
they'll<00:02:42.910> be<00:02:42.940> great<00:02:43.450> should<00:02:44.050> them<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
as I had today which shouldn't be very

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.380 
as I had today which shouldn't be very
difficult<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:55.040> clear<00:02:55.520> skies<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:56.300> all

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.640 
be there and also the rough idea for the
cameras<00:03:02.810> ain't<00:03:02.990> any<00:03:03.170> use

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
cameras ain't any use

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.640 
cameras ain't any use
I<00:03:04.970> think<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.090> will<00:03:06.150> be<00:03:06.209> productive<00:03:07.140> next<00:03:07.470> few

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
I think it will be productive next few

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.720 
I think it will be productive next few
days<00:03:07.799> here<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.189> Narrows<00:03:08.459> and
