00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
and the walls pretty big and you can
just<00:01:23.250> pack<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> turn<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:23.970> side<00:01:24.210> it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
just pack it and turn on your side it's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.870 
just pack it and turn on your side it's
really<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:24.840> helpful<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.430> in<00:01:26.430> addition<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
really really helpful and in addition to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
really really helpful and in addition to
this<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.090> also<00:01:27.240> has<00:01:27.750> quite<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.290> effect<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
this it also has quite a good effect on

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.789 
this it also has quite a good effect on
kill<00:01:28.979> streaks<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.590> another<00:01:31.590> piece<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
kill streaks and another piece of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260 
kill streaks and another piece of
equipment<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> show<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.119> the

equipment I'm going to show you is the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.670 
equipment I'm going to show you is the
shock<00:01:33.479> charges<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:34.590> probably

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
shock charges which is you're probably

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
shock charges which is you're probably
gonna<00:01:34.920> find<00:01:35.100> these<00:01:35.250> lying<00:01:35.490> around<00:01:35.579> map<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> lot

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
gonna find these lying around map a lot

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
gonna find these lying around map a lot
and<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:37.200> probably<00:01:37.380> miss<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.920> quite

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
and you probably miss this is quite

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
and you probably miss this is quite
quick<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:39.000> hack<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.420> because

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
quick but you can hack these because

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.810 
quick but you can hack these because
they're<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.409> very<00:01:40.770> prevalent<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.460> black<00:01:41.640> ops

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
they're very very prevalent in black ops

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
they're very very prevalent in black ops
2<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.090> you'll<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:42.360> them<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> lot<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.930> he<00:01:43.560> can

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
2 and you'll see them a lot and he can

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
2 and you'll see them a lot and he can
see<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> Dragon<00:01:44.399> Fire<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.930> hack

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
see the Dragon Fire and you can hack

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.389 
see the Dragon Fire and you can hack
this<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.710> simple

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
this it's pretty simple

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.889 
this it's pretty simple
dragon<00:01:47.850> fires<00:01:48.000> pretty<00:01:48.210> weak<00:01:48.509> they're<00:01:48.720> pretty

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
dragon fires pretty weak they're pretty

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.240 
dragon fires pretty weak they're pretty
easy<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> shoot<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.470> well<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.070> hack

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
easy to shoot as well but you can hack

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.060 
easy to shoot as well but you can hack
them<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:51.000> black<00:01:51.659> hat<00:01:51.840> PDA<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
them in just one black hat PDA also the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.800 
them in just one black hat PDA also the
UAV<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.600> hack

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
UAV you can see right here you can hack

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
UAV you can see right here you can hack
that<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.380> takes<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.770> second<00:01:56.219> you've<00:01:56.700> got

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that it just takes a second you've got

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.160 
that it just takes a second you've got
to<00:01:56.880> follow<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.090> around<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> map<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.750> make

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to follow it around the map and make

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.569 
to follow it around the map and make
sure<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> keep<00:01:58.680> keep<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.189> crosshairs

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
sure you keep keep your crosshairs

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.859 
sure you keep keep your crosshairs
locked<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> you'll<00:02:00.240> destroy<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
locked on it you'll destroy it and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.050 
locked on it you'll destroy it and
there's<00:02:01.469> certain<00:02:01.770> five<00:02:01.950> points<00:02:02.430> err<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.850> only

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
there's certain five points err the only

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 
there's certain five points err the only
downside<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> guess<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.290> destroys<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
downside I guess is that it destroys the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
downside I guess is that it destroys the
equipment<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.670> can't<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.329> again<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
equipment and you can't use again so you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.510 
equipment and you can't use again so you
need<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.039> you're<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
need to if you're going to want to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.740 
need to if you're going to want to
destroy<00:02:08.670> two<00:02:08.970> things<00:02:09.270> or<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:09.479> you're<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
destroy two things or if you're going to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.960 
destroy two things or if you're going to
want<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.440> hack<00:02:11.039> something<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
want more so when you hack something it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.910 
want more so when you hack something it
gets<00:02:12.420> destroyed<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.170> goes<00:02:13.410> away

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
gets destroyed it goes away

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
gets destroyed it goes away
and<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.640> see<00:02:14.760> right<00:02:14.849> here<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.240> hack<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and you can see right here just hack the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.290 
and you can see right here just hack the
Centurion<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.610> yeah<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.790> very<00:02:17.970> very<00:02:18.150> useful

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
Centurion and yeah it's very very useful

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.050 
Centurion and yeah it's very very useful
very<00:02:18.540> useful<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.470> destroy<00:02:20.250> enemy<00:02:20.819> equipment

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
very useful to destroy enemy equipment

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.900 
very useful to destroy enemy equipment
and<00:02:21.480> also<00:02:21.720> kill<00:02:21.959> streaks<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.760> can

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and also kill streaks and here you can

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.729 
and also kill streaks and here you can
see<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.420> am<00:02:24.690> taking<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.500> actual

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
see that I am taking out the actual

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.170 
see that I am taking out the actual
stealth<00:02:26.099> chopper<00:02:26.430> which<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.880> very<00:02:27.060> high

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
stealth chopper which is a very high

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.449 
stealth chopper which is a very high
kill<00:02:27.420> streak<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.840> black<00:02:28.050> ops<00:02:28.230> 2<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:29.280> works

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
kill streak in black ops 2 and it works

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.680 
kill streak in black ops 2 and it works
just<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.910> stinger<00:02:30.239> or<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.540> like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
just like a stinger or just like

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.300 
just like a stinger or just like
anything<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.050> takes<00:02:31.380> down<00:02:31.680> kill<00:02:31.980> streaks

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
anything that takes down kill streaks

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.640 
anything that takes down kill streaks
just<00:02:33.000> then<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> use<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.540> hunter<00:02:34.380> killer<00:02:34.560> drone

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
just then I use the hunter killer drone

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.559 
just then I use the hunter killer drone
which<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.190> also<00:02:35.670> something<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.090> takes<00:02:36.360> down

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
which is also something that takes down

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.880 
which is also something that takes down
in<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> kill<00:02:37.020> streaks<00:02:37.319> if<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.590> didn't<00:02:37.800> know

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
in the kill streaks if you didn't know

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.370 
in the kill streaks if you didn't know
that<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.520> also<00:02:38.700> goes<00:02:38.940> for<00:02:39.360> players<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.200> you

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that it also goes for players but if you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.809 
that it also goes for players but if you
if<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.860> throw<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.160> really<00:02:41.250> high<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.670> sky

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
if you throw it really high to the sky

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.059 
if you throw it really high to the sky
it<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.090> go<00:02:42.269> after<00:02:42.450> kill<00:02:42.810> streaks<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.319> their

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
it will go after kill streaks and their

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.470 
it will go after kill streaks and their
eyes<00:02:44.190> use<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> strap<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.269> flares

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
eyes use that to the strap on the flares

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.380 
eyes use that to the strap on the flares
and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.930> hacked<00:02:46.170> use<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> black<00:02:47.069> cap<00:02:47.280> PDA<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and then I hacked use a black cap PDA to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.090 
and then I hacked use a black cap PDA to
destroy<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.350> it's<00:02:49.739> actually<00:02:49.980> working

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
destroy it and it's actually working

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.890 
destroy it and it's actually working
pretty<00:02:50.280> effective<00:02:50.850> here<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.510> using<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
pretty effective here I'm using the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.449 
pretty effective here I'm using the
Hunter<00:02:52.290> Killer<00:02:52.380> again<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.920> get<00:02:53.040> rid<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.220> one<00:02:53.370> of

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
Hunter Killer again to get rid of one of

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.009 
Hunter Killer again to get rid of one of
the<00:02:53.519> flares<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.239> orbit<00:02:54.510> took<00:02:54.810> north

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
the flares this the orbit took north

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.390 
the flares this the orbit took north
orbital<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.819> VSAT<00:02:56.819> kill<00:02:57.450> streak<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.400> heroes

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
orbital the VSAT kill streak and heroes

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.729 
orbital the VSAT kill streak and heroes
use<00:02:59.610> another<00:02:59.880> black<00:03:00.090> cat<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.510> use<00:03:01.470> another

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
use another black cat and use another

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.500 
use another black cat and use another
one<00:03:01.890> because<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.310> comes<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.610> two<00:03:02.790> flares<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
one because it comes in two flares and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.720 
one because it comes in two flares and
there<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.440> goes<00:03:04.470> destroyed<00:03:05.069> so<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.610> can

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
there it goes destroyed so you can

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.680 
there it goes destroyed so you can
actually<00:03:05.850> see<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.269> pretty<00:03:06.390> effective

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
actually see it's pretty effective

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.630 
actually see it's pretty effective
obviously<00:03:07.410> you'll<00:03:07.530> need<00:03:07.590> three<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.220> take<00:03:08.430> down

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
obviously you'll need three to take down

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.120 
obviously you'll need three to take down
the<00:03:08.819> VTOL<00:03:09.390> warship<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:10.080> things<00:03:10.799> quite

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
the VTOL warship because things quite

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.580 
the VTOL warship because things quite
beast<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.910> yeah<00:03:12.600> with<00:03:12.870> three<00:03:13.110> black<00:03:13.410> cat
