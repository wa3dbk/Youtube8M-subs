00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello friends with you valery 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.719
 Rudenko and we continue to colonize the bees 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:17.430
 ghouls suppose you have this 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 already prepared otvodok or swarm 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 which you caught the street trap that is 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 here you have this universal box 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.769
 on the hull whether the hive but you do not need it 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.649
 disinfect you set this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.719
 nice board so the bees don't crawl on 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.700
 the walls did not rebuild their tongues there in the summer 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.219
 enough heat is necessary for that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 lit by smoke for the sake of this mesh mitten 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.989
 all you have you cover 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.539
 spacing a little over the top 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:58.320
 frames do not have to smoke there much like this 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 on top divided set as it is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.270
 move the framework here without touching the bees 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.770
 and can one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.729
 for example take the important cascian you have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 cooked somewhere you put it here 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:22.439
 can be in the middle and here and so alternate 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.070
 that is all you usually have 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.700
 sell off vodka for 4 or 5 frame but you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.090
 if 4 5 put if 5 then I feel 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.840
 and it will be good to close this all 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.130
 household 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.760
 this box there brows naturally remain 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.080
 can be 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.960
 here them somehow later 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.770
 sure to close like this 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.970
 the hole is desirable so that you can 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.950
 feed or 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.500
 or here a feeder some put you 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.440
 for years you close the syrup here 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.080
 gauze can be per liter jar and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.460
 sharply turn everything for what 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.030
 fertilizing with heavy flow 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.390
 bee nectar starts to secrete the brain and 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.330
 rebuild the hollow quickly and very quickly 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.490
 upset that is if you are here with you 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.950
 this can put even two cars 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.710
 that is, to alternate and if there have 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.850
 already a framework with a wrinkle that all which is 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:37.380
 rearrange here put this 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.510
 body one more and close the lid then 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.610
 people do not get here and no grown 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.489
 everything will not be covered everything is sealed and 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.350
 are all such open all ready 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.690
