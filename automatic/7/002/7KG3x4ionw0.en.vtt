no<00:00:31.710> trouble<00:00:31.769> finding<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> resources<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
no trouble finding the resources for it

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720 
no trouble finding the resources for it
so<00:00:33.390> let's<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.750> closer<00:00:34.020> look<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.730> before

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
so let's take a closer look now before

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.940 
so let's take a closer look now before
any<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.270> get<00:00:36.450> wild<00:00:36.960> ideas<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.559> all<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
any of you get wild ideas of all of the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.500 
any of you get wild ideas of all of the
crazy<00:00:38.250> things<00:00:38.399> you're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.059> hiding

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
crazy things you're going to be hiding

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
crazy things you're going to be hiding
underneath<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.020> ground<00:00:40.230> such<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.620> chests<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
underneath the ground such as chests and

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.490 
underneath the ground such as chests and
furnaces<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.510> other<00:00:42.840> bits<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> bobs<00:00:43.260> like

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
furnaces and other bits and bobs like

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
furnaces and other bits and bobs like
that<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.879> tell<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that I do just want to tell you that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
that I do just want to tell you that
unfortunately<00:00:46.590> those<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> things<00:00:47.489> can't

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
unfortunately those kind of things can't

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
unfortunately those kind of things can't
be<00:00:47.940> pushed<00:00:48.210> by<00:00:48.390> pistons<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.469> means<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
be pushed by pistons which means that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.410 
be pushed by pistons which means that
they<00:00:50.039> can't<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.370> used<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.850> build<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.270> might

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
they can't be used in this build I might

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.060 
they can't be used in this build I might
as<00:00:51.510> well<00:00:51.539> crush<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.170> hopes<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.559> before<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
as well crush your hopes now before you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
as well crush your hopes now before you
actually<00:00:53.250> start<00:00:53.489> building<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.090> anyway<00:00:54.690> let's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
actually start building it anyway let's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
actually start building it anyway let's
take<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> look<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> mechanism<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.399> can

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
take a look at the mechanism so you can

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
take a look at the mechanism so you can
see<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.390> step<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.960> pressure

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
see that we just step over that pressure

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.959 
see that we just step over that pressure
plate<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.850> get

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
plate and as you can see we get

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.479 
plate and as you can see we get
ourselves<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.510> emerald<00:01:01.320> block<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.340> when

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
ourselves an emerald block and then when

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
ourselves an emerald block and then when
we<00:01:02.579> step<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.879> again<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.080> light<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
we step on again we get a light so that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.679 
we step on again we get a light so that
can<00:01:05.040> light<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.549> room<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.210> finally

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
can light up the room and then finally

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
can light up the room and then finally
we<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:07.020> ourselves<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.470> crafting<00:01:08.010> bench<00:01:08.070> which

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
we got ourselves a crafting bench which

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
we got ourselves a crafting bench which
is<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> most<00:01:09.150> common<00:01:09.510> uses<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.900> these

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
is one of the most common uses for these

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140 
is one of the most common uses for these
blocks<00:01:10.320> hoppers<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.860> finally<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.850> stand

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
blocks hoppers and finally when we stand

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.370 
blocks hoppers and finally when we stand
on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> pressure<00:01:12.510> plate<00:01:12.570> once<00:01:12.930> again<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
on the pressure plate once again it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.469 
on the pressure plate once again it
cycles<00:01:14.010> back<00:01:14.070> around<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.939> ourselves

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
cycles back around and we get ourselves

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.820 
cycles back around and we get ourselves
the<00:01:15.600> floor<00:01:15.869> color<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.650> go

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the floor color so there we go

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.359 
the floor color so there we go
it<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.520> completely<00:01:18.210> hidden<00:01:18.659> away<00:01:19.100> I'm<00:01:20.100> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it is completely hidden away I'm just

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
it is completely hidden away I'm just
going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> throw<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:20.970> there<00:01:21.030> before

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
going to throw this out there before

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.210 
going to throw this out there before
anyone<00:01:21.780> gets<00:01:21.930> too<00:01:22.140> confused<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:22.979> have

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
anyone gets too confused you don't have

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.039 
anyone gets too confused you don't have
to<00:01:23.340> use<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.729> specific<00:01:24.330> set<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.509> blocks<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to use that specific set of blocks in

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
to use that specific set of blocks in
the<00:01:25.080> blocks<00:01:25.380> whopper<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.280> use<00:01:26.430> whatever

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the blocks whopper you can use whatever

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.130 
the blocks whopper you can use whatever
you<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.360> long<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.570> they're<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you like as long as they're not the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.600 
you like as long as they're not the
blocks<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> mentioned<00:01:29.009> earlier<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.490> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
blocks that I mentioned earlier on in

thing is you don't have to use a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.539 
thing is you don't have to use a
pressure<00:01:40.350> plate<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:40.860> use<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> button<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
pressure plate you could use a button a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.940 
pressure plate you could use a button a
lever<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.689> form<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> hidden<00:01:43.350> activation

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
let's take a closer look at the Redstone

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
let's take a closer look at the Redstone
behind<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.079> here<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.680> our

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
behind it and here it is this is our

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
behind it and here it is this is our
flush<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> floor<00:01:53.549> four-way<00:01:54.240> multi

blocks<00:01:54.869> whopper<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
blocks whopper I don't know if that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.190 
blocks whopper I don't know if that
names<00:01:56.909> gonna<00:01:57.180> stick<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.049> bit

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
names gonna stick it's a little bit

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.609 
names gonna stick it's a little bit
wordy

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
wordy

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.859 
wordy
but<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.430> go<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.850> extremely<00:02:00.630> small

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
but there we go it is extremely small

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.050 
but there we go it is extremely small
nice<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.680> compact<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
nice and compact as you can see the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.639 
nice and compact as you can see the
Redstone<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.570> very<00:02:03.899> tight<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> close

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
Redstone is very tight and close

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.230 
Redstone is very tight and close
together<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.219> I'm<00:02:05.280> actually<00:02:05.460> fairly<00:02:06.060> happy

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
together and I'm actually fairly happy

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.270 
together and I'm actually fairly happy
with<00:02:06.810> how<00:02:06.960> small<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.350> managed<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.770> make<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
with how small I managed to make it so

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.309 
with how small I managed to make it so
I'm<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> give<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.940> rough<00:02:09.179> explanation<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
I'm going to give a rough explanation of

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.610 
I'm going to give a rough explanation of
what<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.649> happening<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
what is happening here and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.039 
what is happening here and
he<00:02:11.739> uses<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.250> piston<00:02:12.459> feed<00:02:12.940> tape<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.659> push<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
he uses a piston feed tape to push the

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.080 
he uses a piston feed tape to push the
blocks<00:02:14.260> around<00:02:14.409> in<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:14.860> circle<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.760> as<00:02:15.819> soon<00:02:15.940> as

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
blocks around in a circle so as soon as

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
blocks around in a circle so as soon as
you<00:02:16.180> hit<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.390> button<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:17.140> block<00:02:17.409> that<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.739> at

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
you hit that button the block that is at

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.530 
you hit that button the block that is at
the<00:02:17.950> floor<00:02:18.159> level<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.580> retracted<00:02:19.120> downwards

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the floor level is retracted downwards

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.660 
the floor level is retracted downwards
and<00:02:19.629> then<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.379> blocks<00:02:20.620> are<00:02:20.860> pushed<00:02:21.099> around<00:02:21.280> in

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
and then the blocks are pushed around in

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.970 
and then the blocks are pushed around in
a<00:02:21.730> circle<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.330> then<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.080> block<00:02:23.379> goes<00:02:23.590> back<00:02:23.799> up

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
a circle and then the block goes back up

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.890 
a circle and then the block goes back up
and<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.340> will<00:02:24.430> show<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.330> newer<00:02:25.540> blocks

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
and it will show one of the newer blocks

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.809 
and it will show one of the newer blocks
now<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.650> want<00:02:26.830> any<00:02:26.980> more<00:02:27.159> information<00:02:27.370> on

things<00:02:39.549> started<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.120> 5<00:02:40.360> by<00:02:40.599> 4<00:02:40.659> area<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
things started with a 5 by 4 area the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.869 
things started with a 5 by 4 area the
first<00:02:41.650> thing<00:02:41.799> we're<00:02:42.040> going<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.400> doing<00:02:42.549> is

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
first thing we're going to be doing is

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.910 
first thing we're going to be doing is
laying<00:02:43.360> out<00:02:43.569> all<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.170> pistons<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.859> you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
laying out all of the pistons so you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.500 
laying out all of the pistons so you
want<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.280> place<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.670> sticky<00:02:45.970> piston<00:02:46.180> facing

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
want to place a sticky piston facing

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.539 
want to place a sticky piston facing
upwards<00:02:47.079> this<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.650> going<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.310> block

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
upwards this is going to be the block

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.640 
upwards this is going to be the block
extender<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.359> retractor<00:02:49.930> then<00:02:50.349> you<00:02:50.470> just

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
extender and retractor then you just

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.259 
extender and retractor then you just
want<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.859> place<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.190> piston<00:02:51.430> facing<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.120> this

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
want to place a piston facing in this

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.479 
want to place a piston facing in this
direction<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.989> piston<00:02:53.739> facing<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.190> this

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
direction a piston facing in this

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.759 
direction a piston facing in this
direction<00:02:54.730> slightly<00:02:55.450> offset<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.319> then<00:02:56.709> you

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
and that should mean that this block

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.460 
and that should mean that this block
here<00:03:18.370> will<00:03:18.700> extend<00:03:19.269> now<00:03:19.930> we're<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:20.260> going<00:03:20.410> to

redstone dust on the top and that will

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.490 
redstone dust on the top and that will
deal<00:03:42.010> with<00:03:42.040> these<00:03:42.370> two<00:03:42.639> Pistons<00:03:43.060> here<00:03:43.319> all<00:03:44.319> we

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
deal with these two Pistons here all we

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.439 
deal with these two Pistons here all we
have<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.829> do<00:03:44.919> now<00:03:45.129> is<00:03:45.160> wire<00:03:45.730> up<00:03:45.940> this<00:03:46.180> last

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
have to do now is wire up this last

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.000 
have to do now is wire up this last
piston<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.109> to<00:03:47.199> do<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.530> we're<00:03:47.709> going<00:03:47.889> to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
piston and to do that we're going to

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.409 
piston and to do that we're going to
take<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.280> output<00:03:48.459> from<00:03:48.879> this<00:03:49.060> piece<00:03:49.299> of

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
take the output from this piece of

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.119 
take the output from this piece of
redstone<00:03:49.690> dust<00:03:49.810> by<00:03:50.199> placing<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.650> block<00:03:50.859> like

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
redstone dust by placing a block like

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.699 
redstone dust by placing a block like
this<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.629> repeater<00:03:52.629> set<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.169> two<00:03:53.379> tix

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
this a repeater set it to two tix

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.920 
this a repeater set it to two tix
running<00:03:54.069> into<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.459> block<00:03:54.879> and<00:03:55.090> then<00:03:55.690> another

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
running into a block and then another

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.050 
running into a block and then another
block<00:03:56.169> there<00:03:56.470> with<00:03:56.680> another<00:03:57.160> repeater<00:03:57.549> set<00:03:57.940> it

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
block there with another repeater set it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.949 
block there with another repeater set it
to<00:03:58.180> two<00:03:58.389> ticks

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
to two ticks

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.839 
to two ticks
now<00:03:59.349> if<00:03:59.590> we<00:03:59.739> fill<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.129> all<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.400> this<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.790> you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
now if we fill in all of this and you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.400 
now if we fill in all of this and you
have<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.150> do<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.359> in<00:04:01.449> a<00:04:01.510> very<00:04:01.750> specific<00:04:02.019> order

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
have to do it in a very specific order

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.589 
have to do it in a very specific order
so<00:04:02.919> you<00:04:02.980> want<00:04:03.099> to<00:04:03.160> have<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.280> block<00:04:03.639> here<00:04:03.669> a<00:04:04.090> block

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
so you want to have a block here a block

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.080 
so you want to have a block here a block
there<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.169> then<00:04:05.560> two<00:04:06.099> blocks<00:04:06.340> like<00:04:06.549> that<00:04:06.790> so

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
there and then two blocks like that so

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.180 
there and then two blocks like that so
if<00:04:07.329> this<00:04:07.780> piston<00:04:08.169> was<00:04:08.290> retracted<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:08.889> have

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
if this piston was retracted you have

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.970 
if this piston was retracted you have
like<00:04:09.430> two<00:04:09.940> blocks<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.419> then<00:04:10.870> two<00:04:11.139> blocks<00:04:11.470> with

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
like two blocks and then two blocks with

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.920 
like two blocks and then two blocks with
a<00:04:12.010> gap<00:04:12.310> on<00:04:12.519> either<00:04:12.849> side<00:04:13.180> like<00:04:13.389> that<00:04:13.569> but<00:04:13.780> let's

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
a gap on either side like that but let's

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.680 
a gap on either side like that but let's
see<00:04:14.169> if<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.500> cycles<00:04:14.949> there<00:04:15.489> we<00:04:15.609> go<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.030> there

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
see if it cycles there we go and there

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.689 
see if it cycles there we go and there
is<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.109> cycling<00:04:17.620> motion<00:04:17.979> so<00:04:18.130> as<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.370> can<00:04:18.519> see

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
is the cycling motion so as you can see

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.230 
is the cycling motion so as you can see
it<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.209> working<00:04:19.630> like<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.870> charm<00:04:20.200> but

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 
it is working like a charm but

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
it is working like a charm but
unfortunately<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.510> all<00:04:22.539> I've<00:04:22.900> got<00:04:22.930> time

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
unfortunately that is all I've got time

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.570 
unfortunately that is all I've got time
for<00:04:23.500> for<00:04:23.650> today<00:04:23.710> ladies<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.159> gents
