 the last years now she starts to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 write a story in the world of 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.770
 you were killed on March 18 last 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
 santainés in the marathon of Seoul debuted 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.330
 officially in this type of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.739
 competences the best result could not 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.510
 be two hours 30 minutes and 4 seconds 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.790
 enough time to achieve the sixth 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 place with which he also reached the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.590
 brand and especially the classification to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.590
 the olympic games of man 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.920
 five years pretty 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 I looking to spend something new something 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.130
 new for me on the same day if 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.080
 compete them entry with a goddess and this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.790
 descent is the first time that this leaves 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.369
 bad that only lasts until 30 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.799
 kilograms of base I can not run it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 it takes a lot of energy to know that the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.399
 coach knows you more than another 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.229
 person because he has seen your 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.990
 workouts and starting state if you go 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.820
 to do is going to do less than 230 korn in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.070
 the fears were left behind 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.649
 Ines and her story and she is the fourth athlete 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.110
 woman qualified to the olympic games 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.780
 of london in the first time that 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.700
 conquered and is a pretty brand 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.739
 surprising because the national record and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.739
 that rate of the best brand in South America 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.270
 I had a good move two times 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.739
 three for running first thing not and the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.780
 that gives you more confidence also to 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.120
 be able to run the second and the others 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.520
 marathons for example in olympics the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.760
 The coach's goal is to lower this 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.300
 mark of 230 and there is some possibility of 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.590
 be in the 28 66 but the race 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.560
 Ines has also had to overcome 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.110
 difficult moments the suspension by a 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.330
 positive doping however it does not 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.220
 It has stained its trajectory and is that what 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.410
 we have witnessed his career 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.959
 we know that his only road to success has 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:57.540
 been simply discipline and a lot 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:03:02.110
 I'm not going to do training because 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.690
 I must do it is not to be the best 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.299
 world is difficult but inés assures that 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.819
 not impossible at this time should be 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.130
 in huancayo preparing for the appointment in 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.840
 londres although in may it has a tournament 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.540
 important that will be part of your 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.230
 preparation we refer to 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.090
 movistar lima 42k and last year already 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.030
 you saw the transmission very good and rusty 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.439
 congratulate you did to you and do 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.230
 a special imitation to all

 people who participate this May 20 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.189
 the marathon movistar lima 42k I think that 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.439
 there are three tests to choose it and ten 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.290
 miles to the phones and you're the 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.689
 speed in which one we are more or 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.689
 less and 42 likes the distance there 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.790
 tests to choose from and every year has 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.079
 the organization has been pretty good 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.180
 has what this year has improved 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.769
 quite and it will be more fun 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.349
