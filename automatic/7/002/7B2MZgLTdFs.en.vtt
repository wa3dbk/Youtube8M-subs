00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.949 

you<00:02:28.689> will<00:02:28.840> see<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:30.280> big<00:02:30.489> rotations<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.269> mean

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
you will see really big rotations I mean

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.259 
you will see really big rotations I mean
especially<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.459> skills<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:34.150> this

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
especially with the skills because this

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:44.200 
especially with the skills because this
case<00:02:34.510> basically<00:02:35.109> does<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:36.060> bigger<00:02:37.060> rotation

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.910 

I<00:02:45.910> don't<00:02:46.910> think<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.360> put<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.780> outside<00:02:48.710> their

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
I don't think they put the outside their

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.250 
I don't think they put the outside their
own<00:02:49.100> limits<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.760> don't<00:02:50.090> think<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.390> maybe<00:02:50.900> some

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
own limits I don't think so maybe some

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.800 
own limits I don't think so maybe some
people<00:02:51.580> somebody<00:02:52.580> can<00:02:52.820> say<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.240> because<00:02:53.390> our

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
people somebody can say that because our

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.990 
people somebody can say that because our
wow<00:02:54.080> that's<00:02:54.440> that's<00:02:54.920> crazy<00:02:55.070> how<00:02:55.580> they<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:55.880> do

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
wow that's that's crazy how they can do

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.370 
wow that's that's crazy how they can do
that<00:02:56.030> they<00:02:56.420> do<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.690> because<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.200> conf

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
that they do that because it's a conf

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.530 
that they do that because it's a conf
edition<00:02:57.770> patel<00:02:58.040> alone<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.520> didn't<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.210> almost

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
edition patel alone I didn't that almost

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:16.420 
edition patel alone I didn't that almost
every<00:02:59.990> weekend<00:03:00.320> every<00:03:00.500> day

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.530 

but<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.549> most<00:03:17.730> important<00:03:18.150> thing<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
but the most important thing is the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.559 
but the most important thing is the
speed<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:19.680> sure<00:03:19.860> before<00:03:20.519> competitions<00:03:21.420> have

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
speed for sure before competitions have

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.229 
speed for sure before competitions have
a<00:03:21.629> scaling<00:03:22.170> time<00:03:22.379> so<00:03:23.010> all<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.549> people<00:03:23.879> can<00:03:24.030> try

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
a scaling time so all the people can try

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.059 
a scaling time so all the people can try
the<00:03:24.299> chance<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.930> see<00:03:25.079> okay<00:03:25.319> i<00:03:25.560> need<00:03:25.799> this

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
the chance and to see okay i need this

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.179 
the chance and to see okay i need this
speed<00:03:26.730> or<00:03:26.939> this<00:03:27.120> we'd<00:03:27.329> have<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:27.810> go<00:03:28.110> faster<00:03:28.349> or

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
speed or this we'd have to go faster or

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:35.960 
speed or this we'd have to go faster or
slower<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:34.739> time<00:03:34.950> when<00:03:35.159> you<00:03:35.250> go<00:03:35.400> into<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
slower the all time when you go into the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.369 
slower the all time when you go into the
others<00:03:36.269> from<00:03:36.420> back<00:03:36.659> when<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.959> have<00:03:37.140> never

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
others from back when you have never

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.339 
others from back when you have never
been<00:03:37.650> there<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.549> have<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.940> learn<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.690> shape

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
been there you have to learn the shape

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.569 
been there you have to learn the shape
because<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.640> ship<00:03:41.849> is<00:03:42.120> complete<00:03:42.900> different

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
because the ship is complete different

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.039 
because the ship is complete different
from<00:03:44.579> another<00:03:44.760> shape<00:03:45.150> from<00:03:45.420> another<00:03:45.780> snow

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
from another shape from another snow

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.610 
from another shape from another snow
parka<00:03:46.379> to<00:03:46.560> turn<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:50.930> think<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:52.079> either<00:03:52.349> have<00:03:52.590> a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.710 
parka to turn I think we either have a
fan<00:03:52.920> just<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.370> TV<00:03:53.790> show<00:03:53.970> okay<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.569> go<00:03:54.690> first

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
fan just to TV show okay you go first

I'm going on you go for something I'm

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.160 
I'm going on you go for something I'm
all<00:03:57.599> right<00:03:58.459> but<00:03:59.459> even<00:04:00.209> just<00:04:00.389> for<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.690> security

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
all right but even just for the security
