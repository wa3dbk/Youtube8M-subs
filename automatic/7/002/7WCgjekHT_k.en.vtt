you have the line distinctive line this
kind<00:01:10.790> of<00:01:10.880> similar<00:01:11.270> just<00:01:11.570> illusion<00:01:12.229> wise<00:01:12.470> mom

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
kind of similar just illusion wise mom

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.070 
kind of similar just illusion wise mom
we<00:01:13.400> have<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.760> certain<00:01:14.210> pattern<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.810> then<00:01:14.930> it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
we have a certain pattern and then it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.910 
we have a certain pattern and then it
changes<00:01:15.410> completely

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
changes completely

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
changes completely
break<00:01:17.790> support<00:01:18.720> edge<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.560> it's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
break support edge and I think it's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.980 
break support edge and I think it's
really<00:01:20.189> neat

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
really neat

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.430
