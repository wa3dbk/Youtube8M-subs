but in the last pic to diana for the
Giants<00:00:39.840> i<00:00:39.930> really<00:00:40.200> feel<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.680> should<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.040> just

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
Giants i really feel it should have just

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
Giants i really feel it should have just
been<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> champion<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.790> could<00:00:41.969> wave<00:00:42.180> clear<00:00:42.510> go

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
been a champion I could wave clear go

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.990 
been a champion I could wave clear go
even<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> mid<00:00:43.469> lane<00:00:43.680> allow<00:00:44.309> Giants<00:00:44.760> play

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
even in the mid lane allow Giants play

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.670 
even in the mid lane allow Giants play
around<00:00:45.180> their<00:00:45.360> strong<00:00:45.690> side<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.170> eventually

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
around their strong side and eventually

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
around their strong side and eventually
even<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.820> rumble<00:00:48.120> fizz<00:00:48.270> matchup<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
even if the rumble fizz matchup is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.970 
even if the rumble fizz matchup is
losing<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.110> teleport<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.530> down<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.800> try<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
losing just teleport and down and try to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
losing just teleport and down and try to
die<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> both<00:00:50.489> side<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.910> feel<00:00:51.329> Giants

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
die at the both side I feel Giants

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.819 
die at the both side I feel Giants
really<00:00:51.870> dropped<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> ball<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.440> because

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
really dropped the ball on that because

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
really dropped the ball on that because
we<00:00:52.949> saw<00:00:53.129> early<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> game<00:00:53.850> Betsy<00:00:54.510> was

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
we saw early in the game Betsy was

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.049

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
constantly pushing in Pepe narrow he was

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.490 
constantly pushing in Pepe narrow he was
getting<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.449> agitated<00:00:57.690> eventually

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
getting a little agitated eventually

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.660 
getting a little agitated eventually
lost<00:00:58.559> his<00:00:58.739> tower<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.129> saw<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> player

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
lost his tower and we saw the player

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
lost his tower and we saw the player
cams<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.090> well<00:01:00.210> he<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.480> getting<00:01:00.690> upset<00:01:00.960> Europe

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
cams as well he was getting upset Europe

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
cams as well he was getting upset Europe
he<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.340> playing<00:01:02.940> aggressive<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.449> constantly

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
he was playing aggressive and constantly

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.149 
he was playing aggressive and constantly
dying<00:01:03.930> while<00:01:04.229> his<00:01:04.350> butt<00:01:04.530> Lane<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.830> actually

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
dying while his butt Lane was actually

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
dying while his butt Lane was actually
winning<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.030> feel<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.869> too<00:01:07.020> much

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
winning so I really feel it was too much

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.270 
winning so I really feel it was too much
of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> same<00:01:07.500> too<00:01:07.740> much<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.070> dive

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
of the same too much of this dive

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
of the same too much of this dive
skirmish<00:01:08.760> type<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.659> could

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
skirmish type of thing when they could

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
skirmish type of thing when they could
just<00:01:09.840> picked<00:01:10.200> away<00:01:10.380> clear<00:01:10.650> mid<00:01:10.830> relied<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.580> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.960 
the blue he stopped him from doing the
blue<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.860> putting<00:02:40.100> pressure<00:02:40.340> like<00:02:40.610> that's<00:02:40.820> a

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
blue to putting pressure like that's a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.250 
blue to putting pressure like that's a
really<00:02:41.300> good<00:02:41.390> move<00:02:41.600> because<00:02:41.630> then<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.110> see

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
really good move because then you see

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.870 
really good move because then you see
where<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.470> jungler<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:42.830> even<00:02:43.520> warded<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
where the jungler is even warded the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.490 
where the jungler is even warded the
blue<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:44.330> pretty<00:02:44.510> obvious<00:02:44.870> Rex<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.290> gonna

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
blue so it's pretty obvious Rex is gonna

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.990 
blue so it's pretty obvious Rex is gonna
go<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.800> both<00:02:45.950> side<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.370> they<00:02:46.610> still<00:02:46.850> led

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
go like both side and they still led

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.820 
go like both side and they still led
yeah<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.750> was<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> tiny<00:02:48.110> mistake<00:02:48.410> from<00:02:48.530> gamut

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
yeah that was a tiny mistake from gamut

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.410 
yeah that was a tiny mistake from gamut
but<00:02:48.950> they<00:02:49.040> adapted<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.520> feel<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.820> Giants<00:02:50.300> were

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
but they adapted I feel like Giants were

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.670 
but they adapted I feel like Giants were
constantly<00:02:50.780> making<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.110> same<00:02:51.290> mistake<00:02:51.560> over

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
constantly making the same mistake over

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.840 
constantly making the same mistake over
and<00:02:51.830> over<00:02:51.950> again<00:02:52.160> yeah<00:02:52.490> one<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.670> those

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
and over again yeah one of those

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.250 
and over again yeah one of those
mistakes<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.360> got<00:02:53.510> made<00:02:53.660> over<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:53.990> over<00:02:54.080> again

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
mistakes I got made over and over again

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.840 
mistakes I got made over and over again

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.750 
by both his mid laner and his jungle but
it<00:03:14.930> seems<00:03:15.110> like<00:03:15.290> why<00:03:15.830> do<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.100> keep<00:03:16.340> giving

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
it seems like why do you keep giving

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.910 
it seems like why do you keep giving
that<00:03:17.030> up<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.360> allowing<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.290> game<00:03:18.560> too<00:03:18.739> slow
