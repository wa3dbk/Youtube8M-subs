00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 canada we all have to go for such all 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.020
 or a burger you tell me then choose something 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.520
 similar but no, I should later 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.770
 expand and expand our you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 fast foods and now let's go to one of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 most popular fast foods probably in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.250
 all over the world this shawarma what shawarma is 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.930
 Shawarma is an Arabic dish with something 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.810
 quite tasty and popular in 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.000
 Central Asia but also popular 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.969
 In Russia, I think every person at least 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 once but tried shawarma and I think that she 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.750
 really deserves a spot fund quickly 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.969
 peak now shop shawarma and then 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.550
 let's go in the office take 3 but because 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.590
 start on mcdonalds for example no 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 nothing like screw shawarma is pita 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.260
 chicken and cabbage water is the only 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.800
 Russian and collected hiding ethics more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.130
 salad wrapped tortilla 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.890
 dipiphr announcement of grief 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.110
 this 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.189
 [music] 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.189
 [applause] 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.180
 kill you 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.180
 but 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.799
 [applause] 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.850
 [music] 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.850
 you got too close dude 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.930
 no need to watch the video on the street now 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.340
 very cold i think that this is the most 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.650
 the best time to take advantage 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.670
 express buttons and still on not 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.670
 works so let's go 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.320
 [music] 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.690
 so 3 star is in fact the most real 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 alternative to shawarma from two options 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.360
 original or sharp it costs only 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 103 rubles but I remember the times when 300 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.020
 so he sang himself became 79 rubles and what 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.390
 Regarding shawarma, I think that shawarma 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.580
 it is like an ideal currency which is not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.110
 support inflation like i am for the first time 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.450
 meet shawarma on cost 100 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.450
 rubles so now it costs exactly 100 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.770
 rubles I would invest in such a currency 1 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.080
 sector really catches my eye 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.030
 this is what shawarma she wrapped up with 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.430
 by love 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.310
 tristar shove box 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.480
 always the same all quickly absolutely 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.340
 identical shawarma 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.000
 that ahmed or mahomed or who is her business 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.060
 put there a maximum of love tinctures 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.300
 he loved her with they even cracked and kind of 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.650
 it is cool also there is fixed with 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.240
 some dude who do 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.250
 Shawarma then you can ask that you 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.990
 put more meat or both drums 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 no sauce with twister fuck mom could 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.730
 do you either original or sharp 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.739
 and or in general also shawarma happens in 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.870
 a huge number of completely different 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.330
 options from extensive your father for example 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.070
 Here it happens in the usual pita happens with 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.650
 lamb beef with chicken all that 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.439
 please 3 sides 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.150
 you are an orphan 300 the nature of their name is not 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.010
 what really comfortably whistled 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.019
 so this package opens enough 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.959
 simply and does not dirty hands like for example 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.810
 from shawarma but just look at the size 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.180
 300 glad that note is more expensive and 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.299
 on the size of shawarma and give here to here 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.579
 same something really just no i would 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.280
 said that shawarma is a dish that 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.519
 you can eat at 1 you can 2 importance at 3 and 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.920
 maybe there is even a dessert with rick 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.090
 eat cucumbers meat a bunch of different sauce and 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.269
 it looks all quite appetizing 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.340
 do it like this so that you just 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.139
 show and what I myself represents tristar 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.139
 for 103 rubles 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.150
 took sticky 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.340
 when makdake job says that 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.139
 he this y rapan he was very something you 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.540
 Should go on greek.ru he shorter room and 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.099
 by showing how he is going to shawarma 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.469
 it would be much easier to turn around here 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.609
 stuck together 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.499
 goodness then so here is enough 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.189
 just deployed and showed how Che lays down 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:14.530
 one after another all this and what norms 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.239
 There and installation if this is this 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.900
 Essentially all that we have on Twitter is 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.330
 two strips and a little tomato salad and 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.800
 I don't like some kind of fig sauce 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.750
 south twist and about it i'm separately you 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.840
 bought garlic sauce for 18 rubles and 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.120
 now I get 300 worth 120 1 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.720
 ruble is even more 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.220
 and we are shorter enough disgusting 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.760
 If this is deployed, but if you collect it 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.740
 principle, you can eat 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.740
 [music] 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.720
 Twister is more expensive than shawarma right 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.520
 achieved even do more because 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.960
 but once now such are all diesel 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.180
 the queue and I just waited a long time to 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.860
 order shawarma you said no turn 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.870
 us very quickly you made a tributary we 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.910
 seen how it was done that is possible 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.560
 everything is not quite according to the rules but I still 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.050
 I do not see from the process tristar 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.360
 I absolutely do not know how you did to me 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.400
 who made him and he is very small 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.419
 so I had to why such garbage 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.419
 to eat 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:20.360
 we thought that this we gathered here 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.819
 gotta go eat but bogdan now 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.110
 tired and everything is also so even shave 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:29.719
 we thought we had such shawarma 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:32.289
 but but precisely shawarma and I think that this 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:36.679
 there will be power all kidney new videos 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.419
 which we will choose shawarma where 

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:41.719
 sold with a volume better just the thing 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.789
 tasty shawarma and the first release which 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:48.559
 This is the issue we have allegedly proved that 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:50.659
 shaurma it is better than any more advanced 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:53.209
 industrial ost real analogs 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.050
 like twister do some rolls in 

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:56.229
 mcdonalds 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.520
 the screen is really this dish which is already 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.349
 several hundred years really good 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.050
 you are even much more years old I think that 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.849
 she was eaten by the whispers of babylon or sometime there 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.490
 it is shorter a few thousand years ago then 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.589
 there is a twister and it is absolutely not rocky 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.229
 showroom here and I because it will 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:14.089
 really nice place map 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.249
 so far only in Moscow I will be sold 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.229
 the best shawarma 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:20.839
 the only thing that I do not know yet is how 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.149
 You must probably name the show somehow 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.610
 up fast hit show personal pope or something like that 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:27.139
 so well, in short, if you are interested and 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.580
 you want to know how in this as well not 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.620
 forget subscribe we will go to 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.400
 tactics to leave their 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.400
 realtor 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.490
 can 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.900
 dismiss 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.960
 01 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.960
 but
