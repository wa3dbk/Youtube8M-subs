implement them in this business because

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
going to be too philosophical but this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
going to be too philosophical but this
is<00:01:30.510> probably<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.500> what

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
is probably what you can see in what

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
is probably what you can see in what
people<00:01:32.520> call<00:01:32.729> outer<00:01:33.060> style<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.350> see

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
people call outer style because you see

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.220 
we put them together north
nothing<00:02:15.220> fits<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.239> research<00:02:16.659> where<00:02:17.080> is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
nothing fits and then research where is

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.070 
nothing fits and then research where is
the<00:02:17.500> biggest<00:02:18.040> mistake<00:02:18.370> what<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.390> what<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
the biggest mistake what is what is the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.130 
the biggest mistake what is what is the
worst<00:02:21.480> confrontation<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.629> comes<00:02:22.900> out<00:02:23.110> of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
worst confrontation that comes out of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.080 
worst confrontation that comes out of
two<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.470> then<00:02:23.950> we<00:02:24.129> start<00:02:24.430> again<00:02:24.580> from<00:02:24.879> that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
two and then we start again from that

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.600 
two and then we start again from that
point<00:02:25.390> because<00:02:25.840> we<00:02:26.590> try<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:26.860> embrace<00:02:27.129> mistakes

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
point because we try to embrace mistakes

00:02:27.610 --> 00:03:04.290 
point because we try to embrace mistakes
we<00:02:27.819> think<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.360> what<00:02:28.540> nature<00:02:28.840> does<00:02:28.870> best

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.670 

it<00:03:05.300> tried<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.600> look<00:03:05.900> smaller<00:03:06.200> than<00:03:06.500> it

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
it tried to look smaller than it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.580 
it tried to look smaller than it
actually<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:08.060> was<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.480> first<00:03:08.780> and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.370 

the<00:03:12.590> one<00:03:12.890> milestone<00:03:13.850> we<00:03:14.390> were<00:03:14.540> always<00:03:14.870> trying

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
the one milestone we were always trying

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.260 
the one milestone we were always trying
to<00:03:15.830> keep<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:16.850> our<00:03:16.970> minds<00:03:17.270> and<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:19.270> achieved

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
to keep in our minds and we achieved

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.780 
to keep in our minds and we achieved
this<00:03:20.450> by<00:03:20.510> not<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.290> simply<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.460> stands

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
this by not just simply and it stands

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.000 
this by not just simply and it stands
instance<00:03:23.450> there<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:23.960> you<00:03:24.290> have<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.590> parasite

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
instance there is you have this parasite

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.650 
instance there is you have this parasite
which<00:03:25.490> is<00:03:25.670> surrounded<00:03:26.090> with<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.330> buildings

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
which is surrounded with the buildings

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.320 
which is surrounded with the buildings
and<00:03:26.810> on<00:03:27.440> on<00:03:27.950> sentry<00:03:28.400> have<00:03:28.550> poles<00:03:28.820> basically

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
and on on sentry have poles basically

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.590 
and on on sentry have poles basically
and<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.920> was<00:03:31.160> there<00:03:31.400> was<00:03:31.550> one<00:03:31.790> gap<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.330> this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
and it was there was one gap in this

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.390 
and it was there was one gap in this
between<00:03:33.080> two<00:03:33.350> existing<00:03:33.770> hotels<00:03:34.070> by<00:03:34.370> the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
between two existing hotels by the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.370 
between two existing hotels by the
forest<00:03:34.880> behind<00:03:35.209> this<00:03:35.630> far<00:03:35.900> as<00:03:36.020> order<00:03:36.260> is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
forest behind this far as order is

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.350 
forest behind this far as order is
porous<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.800> this<00:03:37.280> new<00:03:37.430> building<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:37.970> quite

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
porous and this new building this quite

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.090 
porous and this new building this quite
big<00:03:38.570> new<00:03:38.720> building<00:03:39.020> was<00:03:39.440> supposed<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.830> be<00:03:39.920> set

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
big new building was supposed to be set

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.280 
big new building was supposed to be set
on<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.340> edge<00:03:40.459> of<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:40.760> forest<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:42.020> should

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
on the edge of this forest so it should

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.810 
on the edge of this forest so it should
be<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.650> should<00:03:42.680> be<00:03:42.950> built<00:03:43.250> another<00:03:43.550> wall

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
be it should be built another wall

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.580 
be it should be built another wall
should<00:03:44.090> be<00:03:44.209> built<00:03:44.450> which<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:44.870> our<00:03:44.990> minds<00:03:45.290> but

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
should be built which in our minds but

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.860 
should be built which in our minds but
would<00:03:46.280> cover<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.730> view<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.360> forest<00:03:47.660> which

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
would cover the view to the forest which

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.070 
would cover the view to the forest which
is<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.200> main<00:03:48.380> feature<00:03:48.590> around<00:03:49.220> there

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
is the main feature around there

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.500 
is the main feature around there
completely<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.410> what<00:03:51.620> we<00:03:51.740> decided<00:03:51.860> we<00:03:52.520> we<00:03:53.300> cut

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
completely so what we decided we we cut

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.260 
completely so what we decided we we cut
it<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:54.020> one<00:03:54.410> single<00:03:54.830> volume<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:56.000> many

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
it this one single volume and in many

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.150 
it this one single volume and in many
volumes<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:57.110> spread<00:03:57.470> them<00:03:57.650> down<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
volumes and we spread them down the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.500 
volumes and we spread them down the
slope<00:03:58.370> because<00:03:58.700> fortunately<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.330> have<00:03:59.480> a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
slope because fortunately we have a

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.150 
slope because fortunately we have a
slope<00:03:59.780> there<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.140> we<00:04:00.260> can<00:04:00.410> make<00:04:00.709> use<00:04:00.890> of<00:04:00.920> that

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
slope there and we can make use of that

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.150 
slope there and we can make use of that
out<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.330> rain<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:02.959> these<00:04:03.470> volumes<00:04:03.769> are<00:04:04.010> now

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
out of the rain so these volumes are now

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.490 
out of the rain so these volumes are now
in<00:04:04.670> perspective<00:04:05.180> view<00:04:05.330> because<00:04:05.630> of<00:04:06.230> course

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
in perspective view because of course

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.880 
in perspective view because of course
obviously<00:04:06.709> review<00:04:07.310> in<00:04:07.430> front<00:04:07.700> around<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:09.620> this

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
obviously review in front around in this

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.740 
obviously review in front around in this
these<00:04:10.310> volumes<00:04:10.700> are<00:04:10.940> now<00:04:11.060> covering<00:04:11.600> each

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
these volumes are now covering each

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.009 
these volumes are now covering each
other<00:04:11.930> we<00:04:12.320> lower<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.120> imagine<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.510> if

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
other we lower the if you imagine the if

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.220 
other we lower the if you imagine the if
you<00:04:15.200> imagine<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:16.630> square<00:04:17.630> building<00:04:18.049> being

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
you imagine the square building being

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.570 
you imagine the square building being
built<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:20.140> on<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.290> terrain<00:04:21.560> what<00:04:22.040> we<00:04:22.160> did<00:04:22.340> we

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
built and on the terrain what we did we

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.120 
built and on the terrain what we did we
we<00:04:22.940> lower<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.540> extreme<00:04:24.470> part<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.890> extreme

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
we lower the extreme part the extreme

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.620 
we lower the extreme part the extreme
edges<00:04:25.310> of<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.669> building<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.210> ground<00:04:26.240> and

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
edges of the building to the ground and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.570 
edges of the building to the ground and
we<00:04:26.780> covered<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.200> building<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.890> with

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
we covered the building with the with

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.730 
we covered the building with the with
the<00:04:28.669> with<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.240> Russ<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:29.840> basically<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.500> comes

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
the with the Russ so basically it comes

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.200 
the with the Russ so basically it comes
out<00:04:30.950> of<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.250> train<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:32.030> goes<00:04:32.650> fluently<00:04:34.210> also

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
out of the train it goes fluently also

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.360 
out of the train it goes fluently also
make<00:04:35.510> some<00:04:35.750> internal<00:04:36.290> edges<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.860> came<00:04:37.070> closer

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
make some internal edges to came closer

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.430 
make some internal edges to came closer
to<00:04:37.669> come<00:04:37.820> closer<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.450> surrounding

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
to come closer to the surrounding

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.320 
to come closer to the surrounding
building<00:04:39.800> scale<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:40.280> then<00:04:40.610> goes<00:04:40.760> back<00:04:40.970> into

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
building scale and then goes back into

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.750 
building scale and then goes back into
the<00:04:41.510> ground<00:04:41.840> so<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.020> have<00:04:42.290> this<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:42.950> grass

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
the ground so you have this this grass

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.700 
the ground so you have this this grass
waves<00:04:44.060> coming<00:04:44.780> out<00:04:44.990> of<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.260> grounds<00:04:45.530> which

waves coming out of the grounds which

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.100 
waves coming out of the grounds which
are<00:04:45.860> placed<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.910> front<00:04:47.120> of<00:04:47.330> each<00:04:47.419> other<00:04:47.570> now

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
are placed in front of each other now

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.580 
are placed in front of each other now
you<00:04:48.169> have<00:04:48.410> grass<00:04:49.040> beneath<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:49.820> grass<00:04:50.590> over

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
you have grass beneath it and grass over

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.440 
you have grass beneath it and grass over
it<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:51.890> somehow<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.669> caught<00:04:53.120> in<00:04:53.330> between

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
it so somehow it is caught in between

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.190 
it so somehow it is caught in between
and<00:04:54.440> we<00:04:54.620> also<00:04:54.740> wanted<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.690> coat<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.900> building

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
and we also wanted to coat the building

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.930 
and we also wanted to coat the building
with<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.410> nature<00:04:57.979> also<00:04:58.190> in<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.520> other<00:04:58.669> way<00:04:58.880> so

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
with the nature also in the other way so

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.420 
with the nature also in the other way so
let's<00:04:59.450> say<00:04:59.540> we<00:04:59.690> have<00:04:59.840> this<00:05:00.080> done

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
let's say we have this done

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.750 
let's say we have this done

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
are left they are not covered with any

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
protective through it or anything so

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.380 
protective through it or anything so
they'll<00:05:16.900> have<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.290> be<00:05:17.700> aged<00:05:18.700> by<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.180> weather

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
they'll have to be aged by the weather

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.620 
they'll have to be aged by the weather
now<00:05:19.870> they<00:05:20.050> are<00:05:20.200> to<00:05:20.770> some<00:05:20.950> point<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.630> those

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
now they are to some point and those

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.690 
now they are to some point and those
elements<00:05:22.990> are<00:05:23.200> there<00:05:23.260> that<00:05:23.890> because<00:05:24.340> we<00:05:24.520> want

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
elements are there that because we want

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.370 
elements are there that because we want
to<00:05:24.820> also<00:05:24.940> intertwined<00:05:25.690> this<00:05:25.900> feeling<00:05:26.230> with

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
to also intertwined this feeling with

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.000 
to also intertwined this feeling with
the<00:05:26.470> tree<00:05:26.650> trunks<00:05:26.980> behind<00:05:28.680> behind<00:05:29.680> the

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
the tree trunks behind behind the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.280 
the tree trunks behind behind the
building<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.430> we<00:05:30.580> have<00:05:30.730> building<00:05:31.540> codes<00:05:31.780> in

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
building so we have building codes in

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.530 
building so we have building codes in
this<00:05:32.560> direction<00:05:32.890> between<00:05:33.610> grass<00:05:34.060> fields<00:05:34.390> and

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
this direction between grass fields and

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.480 
this direction between grass fields and
in<00:05:34.630> this<00:05:34.810> direction<00:05:35.020> between<00:05:35.470> three<00:05:36.250> trunks

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
in this direction between three trunks

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.540 
in this direction between three trunks
so<00:05:36.940> we<00:05:37.420> try<00:05:37.660> to<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:38.560> is<00:05:40.020> from<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.200> point<00:05:41.440> on<00:05:42.190> it

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
so we try to it is from that point on it

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.810 
so we try to it is from that point on it
is<00:05:42.790> just<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:45.070> way<00:05:45.250> of<00:05:45.460> visualizing<00:05:45.820> this<00:05:46.620> this

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
is just the way of visualizing this this

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.380 
is just the way of visualizing this this
this<00:05:50.250> feeling<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:51.400> want<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:51.760> achieve<00:05:51.850> this

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
this feeling you want to achieve this

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.220 
this feeling you want to achieve this
attraction<00:05:53.170> of<00:05:53.410> this<00:05:53.800> concept<00:05:54.250> you<00:05:54.430> want<00:05:54.610> to

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
attraction of this concept you want to

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.290 
attraction of this concept you want to
do<00:05:56.230> to<00:05:56.590> get<00:05:56.740> through<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.160> this<00:05:57.910> is<00:05:58.060> where

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
do to get through and this is where

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.020 
do to get through and this is where
projects<00:05:58.930> differ<00:05:59.140> between<00:05:59.710> each<00:06:00.340> other<00:06:00.580> to

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
projects differ between each other to

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.920 
projects differ between each other to
the<00:06:01.120> concept<00:06:01.450> phase<00:06:01.660> there<00:06:02.170> it<00:06:02.800> is<00:06:02.860> very

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
the concept phase there it is very

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.990 
the concept phase there it is very
fairly<00:06:04.930> common<00:06:05.350> idea<00:06:05.670> there<00:06:06.670> is<00:06:06.700> a<00:06:06.820> lot<00:06:06.970> of

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
fairly common idea there is a lot of

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.380 
fairly common idea there is a lot of
situations<00:06:08.400> in<00:06:09.400> space<00:06:09.670> where<00:06:09.940> you<00:06:09.970> want<00:06:10.210> to

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
situations in space where you want to

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:31.390 
situations in space where you want to
combine<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.230> nature<00:06:12.100> and<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.310> building

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.570 

Lester<00:06:32.400> came<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:32.760> us<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.090> said<00:06:33.150> I<00:06:33.830> i<00:06:34.830> see<00:06:35.340> that

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
Lester came to us and said I i see that

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.680 
Lester came to us and said I i see that
you<00:06:36.270> believe<00:06:36.810> in<00:06:37.290> this<00:06:37.590> approach<00:06:37.919> but<00:06:38.610> I'm<00:06:39.270> not

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
front of the entrance you have to be

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.030 
front of the entrance you have to be
this<00:06:45.330> big<00:06:45.540> building<00:06:45.960> behind<00:06:46.080> you<00:06:46.410> we<00:06:46.650> design

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
this big building behind you we design

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.740 
this big building behind you we design
and<00:06:47.250> you<00:06:47.340> say<00:06:47.520> I<00:06:47.550> was<00:06:47.850> during<00:06:48.120> a<00:06:48.210> tous<00:06:48.419> Italia

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
and you say I was during a tous Italia

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.320 
and you say I was during a tous Italia
and<00:06:48.780> this<00:06:48.990> is<00:06:49.110> my<00:06:49.229> picture<00:06:49.440> of<00:06:49.740> this<00:06:49.919> and<00:06:50.330> we

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
and this is my picture of this and we

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.620 
and this is my picture of this and we
came<00:06:51.510> from<00:06:51.840> but<00:06:52.729> from<00:06:53.729> these<00:06:54.000> different

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
came from but from these different

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.600 
came from but from these different
positions<00:06:55.080> but<00:06:55.740> somehow<00:06:56.430> we<00:06:57.419> we<00:06:58.370> it<00:06:59.370> was

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
positions but somehow we we it was

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.430 
positions but somehow we we it was
completely<00:07:00.030> based<00:07:00.419> on<00:07:00.630> trust<00:07:00.930> I<00:07:01.139> believe

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
completely based on trust I believe

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.080 
completely based on trust I believe
because<00:07:03.560> somehow<00:07:04.560> they<00:07:04.889> believe<00:07:05.400> this<00:07:05.729> story

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
because somehow they believe this story

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.150 
because somehow they believe this story
of<00:07:06.330> ours<00:07:06.630> and<00:07:06.660> now<00:07:07.080> they<00:07:07.290> embraced<00:07:07.650> it<00:07:07.800> already

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
of ours and now they embraced it already

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.430 
of ours and now they embraced it already
but<00:07:08.430> they<00:07:08.580> wanted<00:07:08.850> big<00:07:09.360> buildings<00:07:09.780> we<00:07:10.139> wanted

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
but they wanted big buildings we wanted

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.680 
but they wanted big buildings we wanted
to<00:07:10.500> have<00:07:10.760> big<00:07:11.760> buildings<00:07:12.180> that<00:07:12.330> look<00:07:12.389> like

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
to have big buildings that look like

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.500 
to have big buildings that look like
small<00:07:12.840> ones<00:07:13.169> but<00:07:13.560> when<00:07:13.860> we<00:07:14.040> when<00:07:14.550> we<00:07:14.580> overcame

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.510 
small ones but when we when we overcame
