00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and they look fantastic

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.030 
and they look fantastic
because<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.239> think<00:02:14.530> when<00:02:15.530> they're<00:02:15.680> shooting

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
because I think when they're shooting

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.320 
because I think when they're shooting
these<00:02:16.310> films<00:02:16.640> when<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.819> were<00:02:16.909> making<00:02:17.090> these

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
these films when they were making these

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.520 
these films when they were making these
films<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.720> think<00:02:17.750> they<00:02:18.049> put<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.230> little<00:02:18.379> more

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
films I think they put a little more

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.740 
films I think they put a little more
money<00:02:18.680> into<00:02:18.920> them<00:02:19.239> second<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.330> third<00:02:20.450> films

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
money into them second and third films

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.210 
money into them second and third films
were<00:02:20.870> shot<00:02:21.110> back-to-back<00:02:21.709> as<00:02:21.890> sort<00:02:22.099> of<00:02:22.129> a

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
were shot back-to-back as sort of a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.979 
were shot back-to-back as sort of a
two-part<00:02:22.459> story<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.239> not<00:02:23.420> when<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.780> watched

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
two-part story what not when you watched

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.680 
two-part story what not when you watched
part<00:02:24.620> two<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.519> second<00:02:25.970> film<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.450> kind<00:02:26.629> of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
part two the second film it kind of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.320 
part two the second film it kind of
leaves<00:02:27.379> it<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.980> sort<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.400> halfway<00:02:29.299> point

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
leaves it in the sort of a halfway point

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.390 
leaves it in the sort of a halfway point
more<00:02:29.840> or<00:02:29.900> less<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.799> gives<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.129> kind<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.340> a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
more or less it gives it kind of a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.880 
more or less it gives it kind of a
halfway<00:02:31.610> point<00:02:31.760> feel<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.230> whole<00:02:33.349> film<00:02:33.650> so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
halfway point feel to the whole film so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.830 
halfway point feel to the whole film so
yeah<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.400> two<00:02:34.670> films<00:02:34.940> are<00:02:35.030> meant<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.209> be<00:02:35.599> seen

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
yeah the two films are meant to be seen

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.750 
yeah the two films are meant to be seen
as<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.080> whole<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.430> put<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.640> lot

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
as a whole and I think they put a lot

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.059 
as a whole and I think they put a lot
more<00:02:37.819> money<00:02:38.090> into<00:02:38.360> doing<00:02:39.349> these<00:02:39.500> films<00:02:39.890> so

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
more money into doing these films so

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.190 
more money into doing these films so
that<00:02:40.640> really<00:02:40.760> shows<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.329> this<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.989> film

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
that really shows in this in the film

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.199 
that really shows in this in the film
entire<00:02:42.409> thing<00:02:42.620> productive<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> little<00:02:44.000> higher

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
entire thing productive a little higher

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.660 
entire thing productive a little higher
you<00:02:44.959> got<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.170> little<00:02:45.349> bit<00:02:45.470> more<00:02:45.670> better

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
you got a little bit more better

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.030 
you got a little bit more better
cinematography<00:02:47.569> lighting<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.470> lot<00:02:48.650> dark<00:02:48.920> a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
cinematography lighting is a lot dark a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.550 
cinematography lighting is a lot dark a
lot<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> lot<00:02:49.519> more<00:02:49.879> cinematic<00:02:50.629> or<00:02:50.750> anything<00:02:50.959> it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
lot a lot more cinematic or anything it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.690 
lot a lot more cinematic or anything it
just<00:02:51.859> looks<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.069> they<00:02:52.220> put<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> little<00:02:52.519> bit

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
just looks like they put a little bit

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.190 
just looks like they put a little bit
more<00:02:52.879> money<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.180> little<00:02:53.359> more<00:02:53.450> effort<00:02:53.629> into<00:02:54.079> it

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
more money a little more effort into it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.530 
more money a little more effort into it
because<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.859> first<00:02:54.980> film<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:56.180> first<00:02:56.299> one

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
because the first film is the first one

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.009 
because the first film is the first one
is<00:02:56.599> pretty<00:02:56.780> good

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
is pretty good

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.349 
is pretty good
but<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:57.829> a<00:02:57.859> little<00:02:57.950> basic<00:02:58.549> as<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:59.120> vampire

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
but it's a little basic as a vampire

but it's a little basic as a vampire

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.280 
on subspecies four I probably I imagine
that<00:04:35.580> comes<00:04:35.760> in<00:04:35.910> about<00:04:36.450> sometime<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.050> next

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
that comes in about sometime the next

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.930 
that comes in about sometime the next
year<00:04:37.440> what<00:04:37.620> not<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.040> what<00:04:38.340> I'll<00:04:38.550> be<00:04:38.580> looking

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
year what not so what I'll be looking

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.720 
year what not so what I'll be looking
forward<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.740> these<00:04:40.740> are<00:04:40.980> some

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
forward to that and these are some

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.460 
forward to that and these are some
really<00:04:42.150> solid<00:04:42.540> films<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.110> think<00:04:43.140> they're

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
really solid films I think they're

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.790 
really solid films I think they're
really<00:04:43.650> entertaining<00:04:44.220> they<00:04:45.030> got<00:04:45.210> some<00:04:45.800> maybe

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
really entertaining they got some maybe

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.090 
really entertaining they got some maybe
not<00:04:47.100> don't<00:04:47.910> all<00:04:48.180> appeal<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.740> modern

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
not don't all appeal to a modern

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.040 
not don't all appeal to a modern
audience<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.670> what<00:04:50.820> not<00:04:51.000> or<00:04:51.510> this<00:04:51.630> slower

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
audience so what not or this slower

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.010 
audience so what not or this slower
pacing<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.830> more<00:04:53.640> focus<00:04:53.970> on<00:04:54.090> atmosphere<00:04:54.690> mood

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
pacing and more focus on atmosphere mood

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.540 
pacing and more focus on atmosphere mood
and<00:04:55.320> stuff<00:04:55.500> like<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.890> but<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.160> think<00:04:56.310> is

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
and stuff like that but I think is

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.480 
and stuff like that but I think is
really<00:04:56.880> really<00:04:57.210> good<00:04:57.600> vampire<00:04:58.380> films<00:04:58.920> they

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
really really good vampire films they

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.430 
really really good vampire films they
don't<00:04:59.700> get<00:04:59.880> too<00:05:00.210> chaotic<00:05:00.510> they<00:05:00.990> get<00:05:01.200> their

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
don't get too chaotic they get their

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.200 
don't get too chaotic they get their
really<00:05:01.800> establish<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.250> mood<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.730> story<00:05:03.000> and

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
really establish a mood and story and
