00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
founding mother of the research on high

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.550 
founding mother of the research on high
sensitivity<00:00:23.580> she<00:00:24.210> established<00:00:25.109> high

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
sensitivity she established high

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
sensitivity she established high
sensitivity<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> trait<00:00:26.789> separate<00:00:27.750> from

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
sensitivity as a trait separate from

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.519 
sensitivity as a trait separate from
other<00:00:28.230> traits<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.630> recently<00:00:30.630> she's<00:00:31.019> gone<00:00:31.260> on

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
other traits and recently she's gone on

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.940 
other traits and recently she's gone on
to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.940> some<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:34.170> gather<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.590> group<00:00:34.649> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
to do some to gather a group of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.060 
to do some to gather a group of
scientists<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:36.030> some<00:00:36.989> brain<00:00:37.469> scan

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
scientists and do some brain scan

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.420 
scientists and do some brain scan
studies<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.809> she<00:00:40.260> had<00:00:40.469> highly<00:00:40.980> sensitive

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
studies and so she had highly sensitive

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
studies and so she had highly sensitive
people<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> non<00:00:42.090> sensitive<00:00:42.660> people<00:00:42.840> look<00:00:43.620> at

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
people and non sensitive people look at

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.170 
people and non sensitive people look at
these<00:00:43.920> sort<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.280> detailed<00:00:44.670> pictures<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
these sort of detailed pictures of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.170 
these sort of detailed pictures of
scenes<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:47.100> turns<00:00:47.309> out<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.879> highly

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
scenes and it turns out that the highly

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.680 
scenes and it turns out that the highly
sensitive<00:00:48.600> people<00:00:48.870> did<00:00:50.390> use<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.660> eye

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
sensitive people did use more eye

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.350 
sensitive people did use more eye
movements<00:00:52.620> spent<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.250> time<00:00:53.309> looking<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
movements spent more time looking and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
movements spent more time looking and
the<00:00:55.199> parts<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.649> their<00:00:55.739> brain<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.520> are

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the parts of their brain that are

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.889 
the parts of their brain that are
involved<00:00:57.539> deeper<00:00:57.899> processing<00:00:58.440> lit<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.899> so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
involved deeper processing lit up so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
involved deeper processing lit up so
there<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.710> her<00:01:01.949> initial<00:01:02.160> study

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
there was in her initial study

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.630 
there was in her initial study
definitely<00:01:03.120> evidence<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.470> real<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
definitely evidence that it's real that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.039 
definitely evidence that it's real that
we<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.420> process<00:01:06.869> information

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
we really do process information

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.660 
we really do process information
differently<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:09.320> then<00:01:10.320> I'll<00:01:10.470> turn<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.100> Susan

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
differently and then I'll turn to Susan

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
good research and I'll start with us she

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.359 
good research and I'll start with us she
talked<00:01:20.580> about<00:01:22.310> Jerome<00:01:23.310> Kagan<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.150> he<00:01:24.659> did

from<00:01:30.659> babies<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> adolescence<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.930> he<00:01:34.850> did<00:01:35.850> us

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
from babies to adolescence and he did us

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.109 
from babies to adolescence and he did us
like<00:01:37.409> how<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.040> reacted<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> startle<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:41.119> he

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
like how they reacted to startle and he

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.990 
like how they reacted to startle and he
called<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> kids<00:01:42.960> highly<00:01:43.799> reactive<00:01:44.009> who's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
called the kids highly reactive who's

amygdalas really reacted strongly to
startle<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> low<00:01:50.670> reactive<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.840> kids<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
startle and low reactive the kids and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.380 
startle and low reactive the kids and
adolescents<00:01:53.000> who<00:01:54.079> had<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.680> less<00:01:56.390> reactive

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
adolescents who had a much less reactive

adolescents who had a much less reactive
amygdala<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.840> he<00:02:00.840> also<00:02:01.020> found<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:02.159> these

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
amygdala and he also found that these

amygdala and he also found that these
kids<00:02:02.670> literally<00:02:03.060> used<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.810> eye<00:02:03.840> movements

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
kids literally used more eye movements

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.930 
kids literally used more eye movements
and<00:02:04.770> looked<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.579> things<00:02:06.140> longer<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.250> was

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and looked at things longer so that was

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180 
and looked at things longer so that was
sort<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.750> similar

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
sort of a similar

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.370 
and the Migdal of the low reactive group
still<00:02:55.290> reacted<00:02:55.860> less<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.000> held<00:02:57.480> across

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
last researcher David Dobbs that I want

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.420 
last researcher David Dobbs that I want
to<00:03:08.460> mention<00:03:08.610> also<00:03:08.970> from<00:03:09.360> Susan's<00:03:09.750> book<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:11.160> he

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to mention also from Susan's book and he

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
to mention also from Susan's book and he
put<00:03:11.820> together<00:03:11.940> something<00:03:12.390> called<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.020> orchid

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
put together something called the orchid

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.680 
put together something called the orchid
hypothesis<00:03:14.310> which<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.030> think<00:03:15.270> I'm<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.510> gonna

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
hypothesis which I think I'm just gonna

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.100 
hypothesis which I think I'm just gonna
read<00:03:16.140> directly<00:03:17.010> from<00:03:17.130> Susan<00:03:18.440> his<00:03:19.440> hypothesis

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
read directly from Susan his hypothesis

read directly from Susan his hypothesis
highly<00:03:22.110> reactive<00:03:22.320> kids<00:03:23.010> are<00:03:23.310> more<00:03:23.670> influenced

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
highly reactive kids are more influenced

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.770 
highly reactive kids are more influenced
by<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.750> world<00:03:25.050> around<00:03:25.470> them<00:03:26.450> many<00:03:27.450> children

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
by the world around them many children

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.840 
by the world around them many children
like<00:03:28.230> dandelions<00:03:29.010> are<00:03:29.190> able<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.490> farhat

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
like dandelions are able to farhat

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.890 
like dandelions are able to farhat
thrive<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:30.890> many<00:03:31.890> different<00:03:32.160> environments

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
thrive in many different environments

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.340 
thrive in many different environments
but<00:03:33.900> others<00:03:34.350> like<00:03:34.380> orchids<00:03:35.280> wilt<00:03:35.880> easily<00:03:36.570> but

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
but others like orchids wilt easily but

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.230 
but others like orchids wilt easily but
under<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.740> right<00:03:37.920> conditions<00:03:38.190> can<00:03:39.060> grow

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
under the right conditions can grow

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.610 
under the right conditions can grow
strong<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.770> magnificent<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.780> are<00:03:42.959> really

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
strong and magnificent so we are really

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.790 
strong and magnificent so we are really
seeing<00:03:44.840> evidence<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.370> true<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.810> our

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
seeing evidence that it is true that our

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.580 
seeing evidence that it is true that our
temperament<00:03:50.640> our<00:03:51.030> genes<00:03:51.480> our<00:03:51.840> brains<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.530> our

temperament our genes our brains and our

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.790 
temperament our genes our brains and our
nervous<00:03:52.860> systems<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:54.350> really<00:03:55.350> different<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
nervous systems are really different and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.880 
nervous systems are really different and
you've<00:03:58.800> heard<00:03:59.040> people<00:03:59.070> say<00:04:00.680> kind<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.739> this

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
you've heard people say kind of this

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.770 
you've heard people say kind of this
thing<00:04:02.160> it's<00:04:02.370> never<00:04:02.610> too<00:04:03.030> late<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.360> have<00:04:03.720> a

healthy childhood and I want to bring
that<00:04:06.540> up<00:04:06.600> because<00:04:08.900> what<00:04:09.900> happens<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.590> if<00:04:10.709> you

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
that up because what happens is if you
