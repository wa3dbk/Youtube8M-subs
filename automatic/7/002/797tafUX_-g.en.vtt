alright<00:01:01.470> so<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.580> well

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
alright so how to do it well

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:15.070 
alright so how to do it well
given<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:05.670> original<00:01:05.910> version

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.160 

first<00:01:16.080> thing<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.120> is<00:01:18.140> pull<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
first thing you have to do is pull the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
first thing you have to do is pull the
volume<00:01:19.620> knob<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:22.200> would<00:01:22.470> give<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.980> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
volume knob out that would give you the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.050 
volume knob out that would give you the
comp<00:01:24.570> cut<00:01:26.300> so<00:01:27.300> compression<00:01:28.080> cut<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
comp cut so compression cut and then you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
comp cut so compression cut and then you
have<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.330> take<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.690> volume<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.440> put<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> at

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
have to take the volume and put it at

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.040 
have to take the volume and put it at
about<00:01:32.160> nine<00:01:32.640> o'clock<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.330> give<00:01:33.510> you<00:01:33.750> something

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
about nine o'clock to give you something

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.790 
about nine o'clock to give you something
close<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.770> unity<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:36.060> tone<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.350> want<00:01:37.560> between

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
close to unity the tone you want between

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.160 
close to unity the tone you want between
I<00:01:38.580> would<00:01:39.390> say<00:01:39.800> nine<00:01:40.800> o'clock<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.170> twelve

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
I would say nine o'clock and twelve

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.249 
I would say nine o'clock and twelve
o'clock<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.710> dot<00:01:43.800> oh<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.900> first

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
o'clock on the dot oh the first

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.190 
o'clock on the dot oh the first
overdrive<00:01:47.330> it's<00:01:48.330> really<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> depend<00:01:48.840> on

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
overdrive it's really going to depend on

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.560 
overdrive it's really going to depend on
how<00:01:49.410> hot<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:49.740> pickups<00:01:50.369> are<00:01:50.550> in<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.910> case<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
how hot your pickups are in this case I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.180 
how hot your pickups are in this case I
have<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.810> overdrive<00:01:52.440> set<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.330> about<00:01:54.330> one<00:01:55.229> 130

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
have the overdrive set to about one 130

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.820 
have the overdrive set to about one 130
and<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.970> have<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.390> boost<00:01:57.720> set<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.320> about<00:01:58.500> two

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
and I have the boost set to about two

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.080 
and I have the boost set to about two
o'clock<00:01:58.980> so<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> key<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.310> always<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
o'clock so the key is to always have the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.219 
o'clock so the key is to always have the
boost<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.080> pedal<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:08.540> so<00:02:09.540> here's<00:02:09.810> my<00:02:09.959> clean

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
boost on the pedal on so here's my clean

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:41.940 
boost on the pedal on so here's my clean
tone

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.650 

so<00:02:42.950> I'm<00:02:43.040> here<00:02:43.190> do<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:43.640> with<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.090> boost<00:02:44.360> off

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
so I'm here do this with the boost off

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:58.130 
so I'm here do this with the boost off
is<00:02:45.050> pretty<00:02:46.180> ordinary

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.780 

so<00:02:59.450> kind<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.570> thin<00:03:00.870> sounding<00:03:01.620> not<00:03:02.310> really<00:03:02.610> much

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
so kind of thin sounding not really much

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.910 
so kind of thin sounding not really much
to<00:03:02.820> write<00:03:03.120> home<00:03:03.180> about<00:03:03.360> he<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.560> kick<00:03:04.770> the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
to write home about he is to kick the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:44.069 
to write home about he is to kick the
boost<00:03:16.880> all<00:03:17.880> sounds<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.660> Robin

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.509 

now<00:03:45.079> what's<00:03:45.260> cool<00:03:45.530> about<00:03:45.560> too<00:03:45.980> as<00:03:46.099> he<00:03:46.220> cleans

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
now what's cool about too as he cleans

00:03:46.519 --> 00:04:49.200 
now what's cool about too as he cleans
up<00:03:46.730> with<00:03:46.939> your<00:03:47.120> bowing<00:03:47.390> down

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.700 

that's<00:04:50.210> my<00:04:50.450> zero<00:04:50.750> for<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.020> full<00:04:51.200> tone<00:04:51.440> full

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
that's my zero for the full tone full

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.980 
that's my zero for the full tone full
