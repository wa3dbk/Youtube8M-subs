then<00:00:41.070> proceed<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.820> next<00:00:42.120> level<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.769> also

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
then proceed to the next level you also

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.829 
then proceed to the next level you also
get<00:00:44.190> additional<00:00:44.489> points<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.359> any<00:00:45.600> other

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
get additional points about any other

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.619 
get additional points about any other
words<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.409> you<00:00:46.559> generate<00:00:47.179> after<00:00:48.179> you've

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
words that you generate after you've

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.770 
words that you generate after you've
saved<00:00:49.050> him<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.249> there's<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.730> high<00:00:51.239> scores

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
saved him and then there's a high scores

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.610 
saved him and then there's a high scores
ward<00:00:52.589> which<00:00:52.769> is<00:00:52.890> connected<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.819> Internet

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
ward which is connected to the Internet

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.169 
ward which is connected to the Internet
so<00:00:55.620> let's<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.100> wait<00:00:56.249> for<00:00:56.429> that<00:00:56.550> slowed<00:00:56.850> so

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
so let's just wait for that slowed so

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.989 
so let's just wait for that slowed so
the<00:00:57.719> top<00:00:57.929> scorer<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.379> moment<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.999> twenty-two

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
the top scorer at moment is twenty-two

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.849 
the top scorer at moment is twenty-two
thousand<00:01:00.539> seven<00:01:00.839> hundred<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.289> sixty<00:01:01.620> nine

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
thousand seven hundred and sixty nine

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.890 
thousand seven hundred and sixty nine
points<00:01:02.659> okay<00:01:03.659> so<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.200> you<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.380> and<00:01:05.720> just<00:01:06.720> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
points okay so there you go and just to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
points okay so there you go and just to
show<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.230> the<00:01:07.500> actual<00:01:07.980> game<00:01:08.430> play<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
show you what the actual game play is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.680 
show you what the actual game play is
like<00:01:09.570> itself<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.940> level<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
like itself so for this level we have to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:43.450 
like itself so for this level we have to
generate<00:01:12.960> six<00:01:13.560> words

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.279 

okay<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.789> we<00:01:44.819> go<00:01:44.939> we've<00:01:45.270> generated<00:01:45.749> the

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
okay so there we go we've generated the

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.440 
okay so there we go we've generated the
six<00:01:46.799> words<00:01:47.130> you've<00:01:47.850> got<00:01:48.229> 324<00:01:49.229> points<00:01:49.469> to<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.990 

so<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> see<00:01:54.719> we've<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.079> created<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:56.000> novel

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
so you see we've just created a novel

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
so you see we've just created a novel
word<00:01:57.179> so<00:01:57.450> we've<00:01:57.600> got<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:57.959> extra<00:01:58.229> point<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
word so we've got one extra point and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.059 
word so we've got one extra point and
we've<00:01:59.429> slowed<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.599> suppose<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.709> could<00:02:01.859> call<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
we've slowed I suppose you could call it

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.339 
we've slowed I suppose you could call it
the<00:02:02.429> tsunami<00:02:02.849> but<00:02:03.539> Sam's<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> helicopter

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.309 
and there we go made him land on the
platform<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.829> we've<00:03:10.950> got<00:03:11.069> 23<00:03:11.519> points<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.030> that

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
platform so we've got 23 points to that

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.250 
platform so we've got 23 points to that
and<00:03:13.319> then<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.560> over<00:03:13.799> shot<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.819> time<00:03:15.260> and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
and then we over shot that time and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.620 
and then we over shot that time and
there<00:03:16.530> we<00:03:16.650> go<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.579> after<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:18.000> while<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.299> do<00:03:18.450> get

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
there we go so after a while you do get

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.520 
there we go so after a while you do get
a<00:03:18.660> knack<00:03:18.930> for<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:20.419> it<00:03:21.419> is<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.019> quite<00:03:22.290> fun

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
a knack for it and it is it is quite fun

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.069 
a knack for it and it is it is quite fun
to<00:03:22.560> play<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:23.609> does<00:03:23.819> get<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.060> bit<00:03:24.209> harder<00:03:24.840> over

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
to play it does get a bit harder over

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.360 
to play it does get a bit harder over
time<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> free<00:03:26.549> app<00:03:26.669> it<00:03:26.849> is<00:03:26.970> good<00:03:27.269> fun

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
time and for a free app it is good fun

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.030 
time and for a free app it is good fun
so<00:03:29.370> obviously<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.380> platform<00:03:31.380> stage<00:03:31.680> change

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
so obviously the platform stage change

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.850 
so obviously the platform stage change
in<00:03:32.250> size

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.590 

and<00:03:36.860> then<00:03:37.010> we've<00:03:37.130> got<00:03:37.160> another<00:03:37.520> 25<00:03:38.150> points

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
and then we've got another 25 points

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.930 
and then we've got another 25 points
there<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.050> I<00:03:39.890> think<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.160> get<00:03:40.340> free<00:03:40.580> or<00:03:40.730> four
