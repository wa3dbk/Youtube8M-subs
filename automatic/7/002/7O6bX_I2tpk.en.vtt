00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
itself has been built of the same engine

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.850 
itself has been built of the same engine
and<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:09.390> pretty<00:02:09.599> much<00:02:09.720> since<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> beginning

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and for pretty much since the beginning

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.860

and it hasn't changed very much and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.400 
and it hasn't changed very much and
that's<00:02:12.930> be

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that's be

that's be
down<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> fact<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.160> these<00:02:14.400> development

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
down to the fact that these development

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.640 
down to the fact that these development
teams<00:02:15.150> only<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:15.540> literally<00:02:15.930> two<00:02:16.170> years<00:02:16.500> to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
teams only get literally two years to

turn<00:02:16.890> around<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.340> game<00:02:17.610> release<00:02:18.330> DLC<00:02:18.930> then

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
turn around the game release DLC then

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.750 
turn around the game release DLC then
start<00:02:19.470> working<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> next<00:02:20.220> game<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:20.730> a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
start working on the next game so it's a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.790 
start working on the next game so it's a
very<00:02:20.790> very<00:02:21.150> tight<00:02:21.600> schedule<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:22.650> would

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
very very tight schedule and this would

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.750 
very very tight schedule and this would
give<00:02:22.830> them<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.130> little<00:02:23.220> bit<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.520> breathing

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
give them a little bit more breathing

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.940 
give them a little bit more breathing
room<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.210> hopefully<00:02:24.690> deliver<00:02:25.110> us<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> better

there sort of new pillar and I wouldn't
be<00:02:43.860> surprised<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:44.310> sledgehammer<00:02:44.730> games<00:02:44.790> came

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
be surprised if sledgehammer games came

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.760 
be surprised if sledgehammer games came
along<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.570> their<00:02:45.660> own<00:02:45.840> unique<00:02:45.870> thing<00:02:46.560> as
