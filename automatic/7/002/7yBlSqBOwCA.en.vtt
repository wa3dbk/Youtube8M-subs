again<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.010> is<00:01:38.220> rated<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.790> 200<00:01:39.660> amps<00:01:40.290> so

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
again this is rated at a 200 amps so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.590 
again this is rated at a 200 amps so
let's<00:01:42.660> switch<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.650> machine<00:01:44.010> on<00:01:44.240> I'll<00:01:45.240> probably

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
let's switch a machine on I'll probably

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
let's switch a machine on I'll probably
I<00:01:46.200> don't<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.710> you're<00:01:46.830> going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.130> able<00:01:47.190> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
I don't think you're going to be able to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.469 
I don't think you're going to be able to
hear<00:01:47.430> me<00:01:47.550> talking<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> machine<00:01:48.450> running

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
hear me talking with the machine running

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.740 
hear me talking with the machine running
so<00:01:49.399> more<00:01:50.399> than<00:01:50.460> likely<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> wind<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.600> doing

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
so more than likely what I wind up doing

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.460 
so more than likely what I wind up doing
is<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> show<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:53.270> I'll<00:01:54.270> I'll<00:01:54.930> try<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> put<00:01:55.440> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
is you show you I'll I'll try to put a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
is you show you I'll I'll try to put a
word<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.820> maybe<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.420> come

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
word in see you know maybe that you come

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
word in see you know maybe that you come
out<00:01:57.780> over<00:01:58.020> top<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.289> noise<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.160> machine

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
out over top the noise of the machine

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.180 
out over top the noise of the machine
the<00:01:59.700> motor<00:01:59.910> running<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.950> let's

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
the motor running so here we go let's

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.889 
the motor running so here we go let's
see<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.550> what<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.090> thing<00:02:03.330> will<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.600> again

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
see what what this thing will do again

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.740 
see what what this thing will do again
we're<00:02:04.080> going<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> start<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.680> about<00:02:05.240> 700<00:02:06.240> rpm

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
we're going to start out about 700 rpm

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.720 
we're going to start out about 700 rpm
and<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.020> don't<00:02:07.229> see<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.890> does

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:27.020 

I<00:02:16.819> kept<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> machine<00:02:17.810> on<00:02:18.050> powered<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.769> up

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.229 

right<00:02:27.450> at<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:28.080> at<00:02:28.260> about<00:02:28.470> 15<00:02:29.010> volts

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.479 

amperage<00:02:33.930> isn't<00:02:34.290> doing<00:02:34.560> anything<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:35.370> know

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
amperage isn't doing anything you know

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.619 
amperage isn't doing anything you know
maybe<00:02:35.790> 15<00:02:36.420> 20<00:02:37.170> amps<00:02:37.530> without<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> load<00:02:38.450> keep<00:02:39.450> in

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
maybe 15 20 amps without a load keep in

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.809 
maybe 15 20 amps without a load keep in
mind<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.409> a<00:02:40.439> bench<00:02:40.799> tester<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.609> there

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
mind this is on a bench tester so there

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.290 
mind this is on a bench tester so there
is

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
is

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.940 
is
loaded<00:02:43.570> on<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.750> at<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.200> time<00:02:44.260> that's<00:02:44.770> why

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
loaded on it at this time that's why

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.070 
loaded on it at this time that's why
there's<00:02:45.250> no<00:02:45.430> amperage

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
there's no amperage

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.570 
there's no amperage
we'll<00:02:47.230> load<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.650> thing<00:02:47.890> out<00:02:48.160> let<00:02:48.370> me<00:02:48.430> get

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
we'll load this thing out let me get

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.360 
we'll load this thing out let me get
about<00:02:48.790> 700<00:02:49.510> rpms<00:02:50.020> or<00:02:50.290> load<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.620> up<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.100> show

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
about 700 rpms or load it up and show

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.230 
about 700 rpms or load it up and show
you<00:02:51.430> what<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:51.850> doing

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
you what it's doing

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.590 
you what it's doing
had<00:02:53.450> idle<00:02:53.870> what

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
had idle what

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:17.390 
had idle what
kind<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.960> averaging<00:02:55.470> voltage

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.160 

right<00:03:18.000> there<00:03:18.209> we're<00:03:18.450> running<00:03:18.780> right<00:03:18.959> at

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
right there we're running right at

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.160 
right there we're running right at
getting<00:03:19.739> close<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.159> 175<00:03:21.120> amps

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
getting close to 175 amps

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:30.300 
getting close to 175 amps
we're<00:03:22.680> actually<00:03:22.770> about<00:03:23.040> 800

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.220 

let<00:03:30.700> me<00:03:30.820> bring<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.210> up<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.570> see<00:03:31.780> what<00:03:31.960> we<00:03:32.110> can

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
let me bring it up and see what we can

00:03:32.230 --> 00:04:15.570 
let me bring it up and see what we can
get<00:03:32.320> out<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:32.890> at<00:03:33.040> around

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.290 

again<00:04:16.209> as<00:04:16.390> you<00:04:16.540> can<00:04:16.570> see<00:04:16.720> we<00:04:17.709> were<00:04:17.800> getting

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.300 
again as you can see we were getting

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.840 
again as you can see we were getting
getting<00:04:19.300> pretty<00:04:19.510> close<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:20.020> 225<00:04:20.890> amps<00:04:21.550> around

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
getting pretty close to 225 amps around

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.040 
getting pretty close to 225 amps around
225<00:04:22.690> amps<00:04:23.290> out<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.590> this<00:04:23.710> one<00:04:23.920> my<00:04:24.040> say<00:04:24.250> this<00:04:24.430> was

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
225 amps out of this one my say this was

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.340 
225 amps out of this one my say this was
CS<00:04:26.050> 130<00:04:26.590> model<00:04:27.010> it's<00:04:27.160> rated<00:04:28.350> compressor

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
CS 130 model it's rated compressor

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.710 
CS 130 model it's rated compressor
cutoff<00:04:29.770> it's<00:04:30.700> rated<00:04:31.180> at<00:04:31.300> 200<00:04:31.870> are<00:04:31.990> 200<00:04:32.920> amps<00:04:33.720> we

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
cutoff it's rated at 200 are 200 amps we

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.170 
cutoff it's rated at 200 are 200 amps we
were<00:04:34.780> getting<00:04:35.080> about<00:04:35.140> 225<00:04:35.980> out<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.850> and

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
were getting about 225 out of it and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.980 
were getting about 225 out of it and
under<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.800> 225<00:04:39.090> amperage<00:04:40.090> output<00:04:40.630> we<00:04:40.870> were

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
under a 225 amperage output we were

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.120 
under a 225 amperage output we were
still<00:04:41.260> showing<00:04:41.530> 14<00:04:42.280> volts<00:04:43.410> so<00:04:44.410> again<00:04:44.770> this<00:04:44.950> is

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
still showing 14 volts so again this is

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.300 
still showing 14 volts so again this is
just<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.960> one<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.140> our<00:04:47.320> lower<00:04:47.530> end<00:04:47.860> models

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
just this is one of our lower end models

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.420 
just this is one of our lower end models
also<00:04:48.720> let's<00:04:49.720> say<00:04:49.870> this<00:04:50.050> is<00:04:50.260> just<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.560> 200<00:04:51.070> amp<00:04:51.220> we

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
also let's say this is just a 200 amp we

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.190 
also let's say this is just a 200 amp we
do<00:04:51.580> build<00:04:51.820> up<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.150> 350<00:04:53.110> amps<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:55.030> just<00:04:55.480> want<00:04:56.080> to

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
do build up to 350 amps so just want to

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.970 
do build up to 350 amps so just want to
get<00:04:56.710> our<00:04:57.810> second<00:04:58.810> video<00:04:59.080> which<00:04:59.350> is<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.650> this

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
get our second video which is this this

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.800 
get our second video which is this this
is<00:05:00.190> our<00:05:00.340> actual<00:05:00.580> first<00:05:01.060> video<00:05:01.390> of<00:05:01.660> a

is our actual first video of a

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.960 
is our actual first video of a
performance<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.620> an<00:05:02.770> alternator<00:05:03.280> we'll<00:05:03.850> have

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
performance of an alternator we'll have

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.660 
performance of an alternator we'll have
many<00:05:04.120> more<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.450> come
