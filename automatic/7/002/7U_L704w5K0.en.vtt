another now 360 has two forms of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
another now 360 has two forms of
grinnell<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.870> compatibility<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.070> them<00:00:59.309> they

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
grinnell of compatibility with them they

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.479 
grinnell of compatibility with them they
have<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> call<00:01:00.109> normal<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.489> 360

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
have what I call normal and 360

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.789 
have what I call normal and 360
compatibility<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.539> normal<00:01:04.170> consists<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
compatibility now normal consists of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.770 
compatibility now normal consists of
just<00:01:04.860> regular<00:01:05.339> controller<00:01:05.790> working<00:01:06.240> where

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
just regular controller working where

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.620 
just regular controller working where
360<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> same<00:01:08.939> thing<00:01:09.210> let<00:01:09.420> me<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
360 is about the same thing let me just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.020

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
well that's not too much with any

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
well that's not too much with any
controller<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.830> yeah<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.250> rumble<00:01:20.640> that's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
controller but yeah the rumble that's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.350 
controller but yeah the rumble that's
about<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.310> allows<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.909> says<00:01:24.119> like

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
about it but it also allows it says like

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.800 
about it but it also allows it says like
you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.780> B<00:01:25.110> X<00:01:25.439> Y<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.400> whatever<00:01:26.939> we're<00:01:27.540> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you know a B X Y or whatever we're on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
you know a B X Y or whatever we're on
normal<00:01:28.200> compatibility<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.040> he<00:01:29.159> like

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
normal compatibility it was he like

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.660 
normal compatibility it was he like
either<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.759> most<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.150> 0<00:01:30.570> 1<00:01:31.020> 2<00:01:31.170> 3<00:01:31.200> 4<00:01:31.380> 5<00:01:31.860> 6<00:01:32.159> 7<00:01:32.369> 8

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
either like most like 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.069 
either like most like 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:01:32.700> 10<00:01:32.880> 11<00:01:33.420> 12<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.570> question<00:01:39.570> number<00:01:39.600> two<00:01:39.869> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
9 10 11 12 so question number two is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.140 
9 10 11 12 so question number two is
duo's<00:01:40.530> developers<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.340> games<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.850> work

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
duo's developers have games that work

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
duo's developers have games that work
through<00:01:42.450> steam<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.049> they<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.380> separate<00:01:43.799> um

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
through steam or they are separate um

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
through steam or they are separate um
both<00:01:44.930> most<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.619> work<00:01:46.770> with

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
both most of them actually do work with

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590 
both most of them actually do work with
steam<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.460> ones<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> were<00:01:48.210> Christine

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
steam and the ones that were Christine

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.410 
steam and the ones that were Christine
you'll<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.290> um<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.909> three

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you'll know because um like about three

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.749 
you'll know because um like about three
or<00:01:51.450> four<00:01:51.920> seconds<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.399> game<00:01:53.430> actually

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
or four seconds into the game actually

you<00:02:26.400> know<00:02:26.430> most<00:02:27.090> likely<00:02:27.210> because<00:02:27.780> um<00:02:28.310> those

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you know most likely because um those

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.990 
you know most likely because um those
particular<00:02:29.610> things<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:30.150> its<00:02:30.300> own<00:02:31.970> their<00:02:32.970> own

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
particular things have its own their own

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.370 
particular things have its own their own
connection<00:02:33.570> with<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.320> example

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
connection with like I for example

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.920 
connection with like I for example
street<00:02:34.770> fighter<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.340> Batman<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.630> on

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
street fighter and Batman will have on

connection with Xbox to me on with life

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110 
connection with Xbox to me on with life
so<00:02:40.460> that's<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.580> reason<00:02:41.610> why<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.970> not

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
so that's the reason why it's not

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.420 
so that's the reason why it's not
compatible<00:02:42.720> with<00:02:43.140> steams<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.860> connections

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
compatible with steams in connections

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.760 
compatible with steams in connections
