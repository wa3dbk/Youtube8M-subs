00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
transition yeah it's it's always tough

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.639 
transition yeah it's it's always tough
and<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.570> biggest<00:02:00.869> thing<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.079> wanted<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.469> do

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
and the biggest thing we wanted to do

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
and the biggest thing we wanted to do
since<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> season<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:02.909> until<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.420> was

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
since the season was over until now was

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.890 
since the season was over until now was
I<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.259> put<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.649> ton<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.860> work<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.369> put<00:02:05.640> in

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
I was put in a ton of work and put in

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.530 
I was put in a ton of work and put in
a<00:02:05.930> ton<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.740> energy<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.550> just<00:02:08.149> wanted<00:02:08.390> to

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
a ton of energy and and just wanted to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.999 
a ton of energy and and just wanted to
show<00:02:08.720> improvement<00:02:08.990> between<00:02:09.619> then<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:09.830> now

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
show improvement between then and now

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.790 
show improvement between then and now
and<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.520> think<00:02:10.759> we've<00:02:10.880> been<00:02:10.910> able<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.270> do<00:02:11.480> that

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
and I think we've been able to do that

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.190 
and I think we've been able to do that
and<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.430> staying<00:02:13.730> within<00:02:13.940> myself<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:15.140> know

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
and it's staying within myself you know

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.300 
and it's staying within myself you know
everyone<00:02:15.530> has<00:02:15.650> things<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:15.950> do<00:02:16.100> great

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
everyone has things that do great

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.470 
everyone has things that do great
everyone<00:02:16.700> has<00:02:16.820> things<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.120> they<00:02:17.360> aren't

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
everyone has things that they aren't

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480 
everyone has things that they aren't
very<00:02:17.630> good<00:02:17.720> at<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.070> really<00:02:19.370> about

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
very good at so it's really about

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.250 
very good at so it's really about
minimizing<00:02:19.940> those<00:02:20.210> weaknesses<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.930> just

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
minimizing those weaknesses and just

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.840 
minimizing those weaknesses and just
making<00:02:21.560> them<00:02:21.710> giving<00:02:22.400> them<00:02:22.520> as<00:02:22.610> good<00:02:22.730> as

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
making them giving them as good as

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.220 
making them giving them as good as
possible<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.690> leaning<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.080> your

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
possible but you know leaning on your

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.720 
possible but you know leaning on your

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.970 
strengths and that's what I hope to
continue<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.270> do<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:27.320> know<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.740> need<00:02:27.830> is

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.320 
to this point you changing your form or
just<00:03:15.170> about<00:03:15.380> repetition<00:03:15.590> yeah<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:17.000> looked<00:03:17.209> at

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
just about repetition yeah we looked at

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.820 
just about repetition yeah we looked at
the<00:03:17.420> form<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.750> little<00:03:17.780> bit<00:03:18.019> obviously<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.709> know

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
the form a little bit obviously you know

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.830 
the form a little bit obviously you know
everyone<00:03:19.489> wants<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.760> shoot<00:03:19.970> like<00:03:20.330> Steph<00:03:20.570> Curry

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
everyone wants to shoot like Steph Curry

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.900 
everyone wants to shoot like Steph Curry
and<00:03:20.989> with<00:03:21.230> perfect<00:03:21.440> form<00:03:21.769> like<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.070> but<00:03:22.430> no

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
and with perfect form like that but no

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.820 
and with perfect form like that but no
one<00:03:23.150> no<00:03:23.480> one<00:03:23.630> does<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.050> except<00:03:24.530> for<00:03:24.560> him

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
one no one does that except for him

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.500 
one no one does that except for him
everyone<00:03:25.640> kind<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:25.940> has<00:03:26.090> their<00:03:26.239> own<00:03:26.360> little

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
everyone kind of has their own little

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.330 
everyone kind of has their own little
quirks<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:26.989> things<00:03:27.050> so<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.860> was<00:03:27.980> about<00:03:28.100> what

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
quirks and things so it was about what

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.310 
quirks and things so it was about what
was<00:03:28.459> finding<00:03:28.730> comfortable<00:03:29.180> for<00:03:29.360> me<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.720> once

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
was finding comfortable for me and once

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.780 
was finding comfortable for me and once
we<00:03:30.470> found<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.860> comfortability<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.640> was

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
we found that comfortability it was

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.370 
we found that comfortability it was
repeating<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.360> over<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.660> over<00:03:32.959> again<00:03:33.050> and

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
repeating that over and over again and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.470 
repeating that over and over again and
and<00:03:33.560> being<00:03:34.190> confident<00:03:34.550> with<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:35.390> know

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
and being confident with it you know

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.720 
and being confident with it you know
getting<00:03:35.780> outside<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.200> my<00:03:36.350> head<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.709> it's<00:03:37.370> okay

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
getting outside of my head and it's okay

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.610 
getting outside of my head and it's okay
you<00:03:37.790> know<00:03:38.060> you're<00:03:38.330> gonna<00:03:38.480> miss<00:03:38.660> shots<00:03:38.870> you

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
you know you're gonna miss shots you

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.900 
you know you're gonna miss shots you
don't<00:03:39.650> have<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.950> overanalyze<00:03:40.160> every<00:03:40.700> miss

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
don't have to overanalyze every miss

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.970 
don't have to overanalyze every miss
just<00:03:41.360> just<00:03:41.540> keep<00:03:41.690> doing<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.959> same<00:03:42.110> way<00:03:42.320> and
