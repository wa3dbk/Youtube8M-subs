 hello dear friends today we are going to do 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.340
 homemade passion fruit pulp forms the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.720
 ingredients are 100 grams of water 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.720
 20 grams of sugar 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.330
 1500 grams of passion fruit 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 we started making a central cut and 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.119
 we extract the seed pulp 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.760
 we repeat the process until we finish all 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.760
 the fruit 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.010
 i 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.770
 to separate the seed pulp we put it 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 in the blender and liquefy taking in 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.660
 not to crush the seed much 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.930
 with a strainer we separate the pulp from the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.930
 seed 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.230
 but it's not water 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.710
 we pour the sugar 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.799
 we mix well 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.110
 we pass it to a container and to the freezer 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.110
 until it freezes 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.710
 good 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.850
 As you can see, the passion fruit pulp was not 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 necessary bactericide unlike 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.659
 other public this is because 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.729
 It has a great acidity and not three in both 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.580
