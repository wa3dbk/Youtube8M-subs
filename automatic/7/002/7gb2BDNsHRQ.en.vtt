00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.570
 and whatsapp friends today I'm going 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.820
 to say some tips to not get drunk 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.610
 tired of just taking you drunk 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.530
 of tired not being able to match your friends 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.889
 when they are throwing the glasses or that is 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.450
 come some tips of number 1 the tip 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.880
 number one must be very well known is 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.360
 the one they say you should eat before 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.640
 to go to take 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.860
 second type you should eat a spoonful 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.870
 olive in the mornings or before going to 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.030
 take with your friends or before you leave 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.760
 of perote fourth tip if you're a 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.890
 beginner you did not do alcohol so 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.840
 fast or go if you are a person who does not 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 is used to be taking no 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.690
 Be one of those who drink the glasses of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.150
 very fast way 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.660
 make it quieter smoother but here 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.820
 comes the real tea this if it is the best in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.059
 that holder is the one that you must 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.150
 take a little bit of yeast like that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.460
 yeast the best way to take this 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.380
 dry yeast well in powder is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.810
 ingesting it with a little yogurt 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.450
 because because I guess with yogurt 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.570
 the taste of yeast will not be so 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.880
 fierce after all 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.590
 because the yeast contains an enzyme 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.479
 that helps break down the molecules of 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.030
 alcohol this means that the process 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.620
 the chemical reaction is going to be slower 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.290
 inside and alcohol is not going to get 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.510
 completely direct to the liver that by 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.920
 that the yeast will help us to be 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.360
 break those molecules that do not 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.800
 we will send so fast it means that 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.050
 You will be able to take everything you want 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.090
 that night and you will not add that is 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.340
 100% sure you will take everything 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.940
 you want but you're not going to deliver and the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.590
 detail there is a project against the pro is 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.740
 that you will not get drunk that night 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.189
 You can take everything you want but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.040
 if you abuse that yeast the next day 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.680
 let's say you're going to have double or 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.159
 triple hangover that you would commonly have 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.140
 this means that it is not recommended 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.690
 do it so often 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.360
 what do you want I want to give you understand 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.370
 that will run some yeast 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.350
 but do not overdo it either do not have to 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.140
 say nothing because in fact much lift 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.630
 I'll crack beer until more 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.490
 power or alcohol or whiskey dingo what 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.770
 you want for summer the 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.800
 guys here what I can remind you of the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.560
 echo remember and recommend friends is that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.120
 is in small portions do not go to 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 exceed this because then yes we 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.770
 is going to lead to the other day we have 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.750
 a hangover from hell so that's what 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.910
 I can recommend them, I hope there is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.460
 I hope you have served them something 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.170
 and it is true and I hope and you take 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.240
 into account on a weekend they know 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.550
 to take with friends they go in a meeting 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.860
 on either side of having indexes or 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.160
 alcohol we are in the next video 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.819
 Give it like you subscribe and chau and remember 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.300
 friends all this is to not pass this 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.290
 this 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.090
 and this is how it is all for not passing those 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.950
 boats that commonly then not usually 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.950
 happen where we are seeing the next
