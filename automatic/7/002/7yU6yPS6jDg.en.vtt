00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
tighter they can be left loose but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.380 
tighter they can be left loose but
sometimes<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:01.280> brain<00:01:01.489> might<00:01:01.760> be<00:01:01.789> a<00:01:02.120> little

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
sometimes the brain might be a little

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.970 
sometimes the brain might be a little
loose<00:01:02.600> throughout<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.140> day<00:01:03.289> and<00:01:03.410> not<00:01:03.530> last<00:01:03.739> as

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
loose throughout the day and not last as

loose throughout the day and not last as
long<00:01:04.100> as<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:04.399> not<00:01:04.550> as<00:01:04.729> tight<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.920> then<00:01:07.039> as

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
long as it's not as tight so then as

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.469 
long as it's not as tight so then as
you're<00:01:07.399> working<00:01:07.580> you're<00:01:07.880> gonna<00:01:07.970> have<00:01:08.180> two

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
you're working you're gonna have two

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.450 
you're working you're gonna have two
strands<00:01:08.869> primarily<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.530> most<00:01:09.740> most<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.399> the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
strands primarily the most most of the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.120 
strands primarily the most most of the
time<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:11.119> you're<00:01:11.690> grabbing<00:01:11.960> hair<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.710> adding

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
time and you're grabbing hair and adding

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.160 
time and you're grabbing hair and adding
it<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.670> top<00:01:13.940> strand<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.660> create<00:01:14.959> one

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
it to that top strand to create one

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.680 
it to that top strand to create one
strand<00:01:15.530> that's<00:01:16.340> gonna<00:01:16.580> cross<00:01:16.940> over<00:01:17.179> your

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
strand that's gonna cross over your

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.109 
strand that's gonna cross over your
lower<00:01:18.050> strand<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.099> I<00:01:19.520> just<00:01:19.700> pinch<00:01:19.940> those

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
lower strand and I just pinch those

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.490 
lower strand and I just pinch those
together<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.450> holds<00:01:20.720> them<00:01:20.810> in<00:01:20.869> place<00:01:20.929> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
together that holds them in place and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.309 
together that holds them in place and
you're<00:01:21.740> gonna<00:01:21.830> grab<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.310> hair<00:01:22.580> from<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.819> bottom

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
you're gonna grab a hair from the bottom

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.990 
you're gonna grab a hair from the bottom
that's<00:01:24.319> going<00:01:24.619> to<00:01:24.770> cross<00:01:25.009> over<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.490> be<00:01:25.849> your

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
that's going to cross over and be your

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.050 
that's going to cross over and be your
new<00:01:26.149> bottom<00:01:26.539> strand<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:28.340> one<00:01:28.490> drops<00:01:28.670> out<00:01:28.849> so

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
new bottom strand that one drops out so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.500 
new bottom strand that one drops out so
now<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.179> have<00:01:29.300> your<00:01:29.330> two<00:01:29.479> strands

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
from the bottom and crossing it over top

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.150 
from the bottom and crossing it over top
that<00:01:44.360> top<00:01:45.320> stream<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:45.830> you're<00:01:45.920> going<00:01:46.100> to

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
that top stream that you're going to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.429
