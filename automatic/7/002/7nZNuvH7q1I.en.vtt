pocket here you can zoom on it and these

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.480 
pocket here you can zoom on it and these
pockets<00:00:25.699> supposed<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> receive<00:00:27.920> this<00:00:28.920> picture

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
pockets supposed to receive this picture

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.410 
pockets supposed to receive this picture
that<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> used<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:31.430> connect<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.700> wheel<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that is used to connect the wheel on the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.229 
that is used to connect the wheel on the
shaft<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.800> avoid<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.579> wheel<00:00:35.790> getting<00:00:36.090> out

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
shaft and to avoid the wheel getting out

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
shaft and to avoid the wheel getting out
of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> shaft<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:39.170> we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> same

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
of the shaft so we have to do the same

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.180 
of the shaft so we have to do the same
thing<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.420> wheel<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> tomato

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
thing and on this wheel so to tomato

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
thing and on this wheel so to tomato
pocket<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.059> way<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.800> wheel

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
pocket here and and this way the wheel

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.470 
pocket here and and this way the wheel
can<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.309> fixed<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.230> shaft<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> setup

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
can be fixed on the shaft so the setup

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.639 
can be fixed on the shaft so the setup
was<00:00:57.660> done<00:00:57.960> under<00:00:58.620> whele<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.969> make

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
was done under whele we have to make

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.000 
was done under whele we have to make
zero<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.949> x<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.699> y<00:01:03.019> just<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> middle<00:01:04.559> here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
zero on x and y just in the middle here

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.820 
zero on x and y just in the middle here
so<00:01:05.939> i<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:08.420> caliper<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.560> short

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so i use a caliper and two to be short

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
so i use a caliper and two to be short
to<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> middle<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> program<00:01:15.150> was

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to be in the middle and the program was

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.280 
to be in the middle and the program was
made<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:16.619> usual<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
made as usual and you can see on the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
made as usual and you can see on the
screen<00:01:20.900> what<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:23.210> meeting

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
screen what would be the the meeting

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:54.190 
screen what would be the the meeting
operation<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> pocket<00:01:25.920> created

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:04:05.520

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
so it is the new wheel this one is the

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.640 
so it is the new wheel this one is the
previous<00:04:10.760> one<00:04:11.170> plastic<00:04:12.170> wheel<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:15.560> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650
