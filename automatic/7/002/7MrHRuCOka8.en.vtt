traveling backwards in the air and you
can<00:00:26.410> get<00:00:26.530> all<00:00:26.680> crazy<00:00:27.010> angles<00:00:27.730> on<00:00:27.910> it<00:00:29.340> step<00:00:30.340> one

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
can get all crazy angles on it step one

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.010 
can get all crazy angles on it step one
you're<00:00:31.119> going<00:00:31.240> to<00:00:31.300> find<00:00:31.480> out<00:00:31.600> which<00:00:31.720> way<00:00:31.960> you

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
you're going to find out which way you

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.200 
you're going to find out which way you
feel<00:00:32.440> comfortable<00:00:32.680> spinning<00:00:33.250> your<00:00:33.370> 360<00:00:33.880> and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
feel comfortable spinning your 360 and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.750 
feel comfortable spinning your 360 and
find<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.320> suitable<00:00:35.559> jump<00:00:35.950> try<00:00:36.280> it<00:00:36.340> on<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.520> fly

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
find the suitable jump try it on the fly

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.630 
find the suitable jump try it on the fly
out<00:00:36.940> top<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.720> a<00:00:37.780> box<00:00:37.989> out<00:00:38.410> of<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:38.710> quarter<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.520> get

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
out top of a box out of a quarter to get

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.640 
out top of a box out of a quarter to get
the<00:00:39.760> feeling<00:00:40.390> of<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.600> doing<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.900> 360<00:00:41.410> on<00:00:41.500> your

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
the feeling of a doing a 360 on your

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.299 
the feeling of a doing a 360 on your
bike<00:00:43.230> step<00:00:44.230> 2<00:00:44.440> what<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:44.890> want<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.100> do<00:00:45.160> is

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
bike step 2 what you want to do is

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.560 
bike step 2 what you want to do is
approach<00:00:45.580> to<00:00:45.760> jump<00:00:46.000> a<00:00:46.090> little<00:00:46.180> bit<00:00:46.390> faster

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
approach to jump a little bit faster

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.869 
approach to jump a little bit faster
then<00:00:47.230> you<00:00:47.379> would<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.680> do<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.830> straight<00:00:48.190> jump<00:00:48.460> and

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
then you would to do a straight jump and

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.550 
then you would to do a straight jump and
when<00:00:48.970> you<00:00:49.030> get<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.239> it<00:00:49.540> you're<00:00:50.079> going<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.260> turn

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
when you get to it you're going to turn

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.810 
when you get to it you're going to turn
and<00:00:50.860> initiate<00:00:51.370> your<00:00:51.550> carve<00:00:51.940> on<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.300> takeoff

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and initiate your carve on the takeoff

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.130 
and initiate your carve on the takeoff
step<00:00:54.820> 3<00:00:55.150> when<00:00:55.329> you've<00:00:55.510> carved<00:00:55.780> off<00:00:56.020> the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
step 3 when you've carved off the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.110 
step 3 when you've carved off the
takeoff<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:57.100> look<00:00:57.280> straight<00:00:57.610> back<00:00:57.820> at<00:00:57.970> your

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
takeoff you look straight back at your

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.240 
takeoff you look straight back at your
rear<00:00:58.329> axle<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:58.989> that<00:00:59.950> will<00:01:00.040> give<00:01:00.070> you

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
rear axle and that will give you

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.280 
rear axle and that will give you
momentum<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> 360<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:01.989> don't<00:01:02.110> want<00:01:02.230> to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
momentum of the 360 you don't want to

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.600 
momentum of the 360 you don't want to
stop<00:01:02.440> looking<00:01:02.590> if<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:02.950> stop<00:01:03.130> looking<00:01:03.280> you're

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
stop looking if you stop looking you're

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.070 
stop looking if you stop looking you're
not<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:03.880> to<00:01:03.940> carry<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.720> with<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:04.899> rotation

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
not going to carry on with your rotation

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.889 
not going to carry on with your rotation
at<00:01:05.740> this<00:01:06.220> point<00:01:06.520> if<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.880> want<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.090> dump<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.630> or

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
at this point if you want to dump it or

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.050 
at this point if you want to dump it or
flat<00:01:08.380> spin<00:01:08.649> it<00:01:08.770> basically<00:01:09.399> you<00:01:09.490> drop<00:01:09.850> your

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
flat spin it basically you drop your

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.670 
flat spin it basically you drop your
shoulder<00:01:10.450> just<00:01:10.869> before<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.140> take<00:01:11.380> off<00:01:11.500> as

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
shoulder just before you take off as

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.560 
shoulder just before you take off as
well<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.100> drop<00:01:12.520> your<00:01:12.640> shoulder<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.030> turn<00:01:13.360> and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
well I drop your shoulder and turn and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.290 
well I drop your shoulder and turn and
look<00:01:14.080> slightly<00:01:14.830> down<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:16.149> will<00:01:16.270> give

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
look slightly down and that will give

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.120 
look slightly down and that will give
you<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.810> slight<00:01:17.110> drop<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.740> give<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.979> bit

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
you a slight drop and give you a bit

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.889 
you a slight drop and give you a bit
more<00:01:18.160> style<00:01:18.610> what<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.300> don't<00:01:19.450> want<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.630> do<00:01:19.750> is

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
more style what you don't want to do is

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.410 
more style what you don't want to do is
pull<00:01:20.259> off<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.890> take<00:01:21.070> off<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.940> will<00:01:22.060> make<00:01:22.210> you

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
pull off the take off that will make you

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.539 
pull off the take off that will make you
throw<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:22.960> like<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.200> ballerina<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.250> your<00:01:24.340> land

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
throw it like a ballerina and your land

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.430 
throw it like a ballerina and your land
rear<00:01:24.909> wheel<00:01:25.120> first<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.690> that's<00:01:26.500> never<00:01:26.770> good

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
rear wheel first and that's never good

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.140 
rear wheel first and that's never good
step<00:01:29.440> 4<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.460> where<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.700> spot<00:01:31.030> your

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
step 4 this is where you spot your

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.820 
step 4 this is where you spot your
landing<00:01:31.210> straight<00:01:31.810> away<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.110> look<00:01:32.409> where

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
landing straight away you look where

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.170 
landing straight away you look where
you're<00:01:32.860> going<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.159> land<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.580> down<00:01:33.729> ramp<00:01:33.909> if

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
you're going to land on the down ramp if

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.020 
you're going to land on the down ramp if
you're<00:01:34.600> over<00:01:34.900> rotating<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:36.310> push<00:01:36.549> your<00:01:36.729> arms

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
you're over rotating you push your arms

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.660 
you're over rotating you push your arms
out<00:01:37.210> into<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.260> down<00:01:38.409> ramp<00:01:38.619> it'll<00:01:39.250> slow<00:01:39.610> you

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
out into the down ramp it'll slow you

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.570 
out into the down ramp it'll slow you
down<00:01:39.940> if<00:01:40.360> you're<00:01:41.020> under<00:01:41.260> rotating<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:42.310> pull

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
down if you're under rotating you pull

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.190 
down if you're under rotating you pull
in<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> bars<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.240> speed<00:01:43.479> up<00:01:43.600> your<00:01:43.720> rotation

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
in the bars to speed up your rotation

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.050 
in the bars to speed up your rotation
and<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.530> will<00:01:44.710> give<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.610> little<00:01:45.880> bit

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
and that will give you a little bit

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.380 
and that will give you a little bit
extra<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.659> get<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.049> into<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.260> landing

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
extra to get you into the landing

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:57.240 
extra to get you into the landing
I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.550 

so<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.150> was<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.330> 360<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.170> when<00:01:59.290> you've<00:01:59.410> got

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
so that was the 360 and when you've got

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.440 
so that was the 360 and when you've got
that<00:01:59.680> dial<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.370> opens<00:02:00.850> up<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.120> whole<00:02:01.150> new

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
that dial in that opens up a whole new
