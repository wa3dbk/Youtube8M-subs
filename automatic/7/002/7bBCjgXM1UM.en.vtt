00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.860
 against change in the basketball-bundesliga the substance from the 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.730
 the dreams are or sometimes movies are such a club story 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.090
 has the Hagener Traditionsverein 1 founding member of the Bundesliga 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.979
 successful years 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.890
 long fight against that makes it 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.939
 AbtsgmÃ¼nd 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.259
 fall to visit 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:44.390
 October 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.880
 and this heavily stocky man with the number 9 was one of the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.079
 Players decide the actors in the movie 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.100
 Hagen's team captain Pfund Audience favorite Matthias Grothe 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.920
 the two-meter 1 tall winger made a significant contribution to the climb 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 but for the level of the first league it is enough for the 31-year-old sometimes 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.720
 no longer is not the fastest 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.080
 The Hagener in the yellow jerseys have been waiting for five games to win today 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.740
 for nothing with a good start 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 Account Manager on Bernd Wolff 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.670
 Dusseldorf is a very offensive oriented 7 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.690
 first with problems 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.380
 Koko Archibong 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 Tietje Carter 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.530
 well defended 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.080
 Felix days with Shakespeare stand 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.260
 and friend last year alone out there 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.210
 Intershop 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.280
 15 0 for the home side 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
 The Giants Dusseldorf managed in the first quarter surprisingly little ball losses 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 to Krafts Roms 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.570
 gives self-confidence 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.930
 directly after 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.930
 again Dusseldorf with problems Bretten Winters 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.479
 again Filho and 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.479
 battles 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.759
 a so-called Henry's hand game 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.260
 was promising for the time being missed this sport has to offer 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.150
 and Fleetwood two meters 6 land is a 20 to ten was short in the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.199
 first 7th 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.969
 secondly 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.130
 Photo Bartl still 8 points back though 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.240
 Worry is preparing now 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 with orderly game construction 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.369
 SID Koko Archibong 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.389
 yes, who can throw threesome 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.329
 only five points behind 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.229
 then again Ballgewinn Dusseldorf and now shows Koko Archibong already 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.549
 in Bamberg Berlin 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.929
 and Frankfurt played 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.929
 the athlete's first game too 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.229
 Dusseldorf was back in the game 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.819
 Time for acoustics without interfering Matthias Grothe came promptly 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.459
 the beefy winger 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.439
 put his feet 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.439
 but the game remained in attack after Hagen again 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.639
 patient set Mey 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.369
 Matthias Grothe beautiful pass winter 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:28.079
 fix same position betrayed 30 to 25 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.699
 played really well 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.329
 Part-time actor 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.949
 Trier's breads 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.089
 Dusseldorf clarified better now 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:40.139
 Logan Kosmalski 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.759
 in addition to praise 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.859
 Siegburg League 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.799
 on a threesome score scores after two quarters 36 to 34 sseldorf added 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.309
 even after the paging 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.239
 Crack Live Spaces into the last quarter 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.919
 Hagen renewed attack in the score of 67 2 percent 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.599
 and nice touch on center John Turek two points ahead 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.629
 five coaches Timo freer a rather quiet representative of the sideline the 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.869
 hosts 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:09.329
 Note 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.119
 al-Maliki 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:16.709
 even to a source of ignition 71 10 67 just under 3 minutes to play we 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.769
 no longer 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.829
 on the seats 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.669
 nice allusion to Jonathan Kale car center Rizzi a total of 12 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.219
 then the last piece is supposed to be the smallest with Bobby Walker 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.039
 he can shorten again to two points only 76 to 74 out front 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.789
 she is with the 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:35.689
 for Hagen 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.689
 important point of attack 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.870
 plays the clock 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.069
 and what happened last year 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.630
 sat twice 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.380
 79 to 74 the decision 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.129
 the Hagener win at the end of 5 and 8 17 77 a real breakdown the play 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.330
 Pounds too 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.469
 the captain Matthias Grothe was satisfied 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.169
 Harrison is always Super Eagles Wyrwoll over that 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:12.659
 around 100 work 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.749
 this year they were all tied up so you should immediately 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.229
 but even if it does not cause any problems he emphasized we want him to do the same 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:19.909
 been 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.909
 What they did not want that he wanted hostages 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:28.219
 About every second cyclist expects that it would be easier to do so twice 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:29.669
 a lot of 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.669
 Everything will be more expensive than planned but the weather 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:37.249
 Westerwelle wool 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.560
 he can stop his defeat series 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.740
 the third victory of the season gives them air to the relegation ranks 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.550
 and now even ninth place in the table one rank before canned
