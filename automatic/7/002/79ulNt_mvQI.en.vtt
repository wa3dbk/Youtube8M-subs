00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.270
 you can have the cake and the 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.700
 drunk wife but a car that can 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.220
 do almost 50 km with a liter and more than 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.220
 360 horses is the new BMW i8 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.660
 are two numbers that summarize well 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.480
 this plug in hybrid sports that has a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.160
 design really like few other cars 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.559
 looks like a saloon car with 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.050
 low front and wide and then there are 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.720
 these beautiful doors that open 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.589
 upwards that make it all a bit 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.629
 special 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.370
 the tail is very strange especially in the 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.620
 light colors because the bodywork is 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.839
 excavated to have a coefficient of 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.360
 presentation of the dynamics 0 26 while 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.829
 I would say that in dark colors he puts on 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.829
 emphasize even more the LED headlights 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 and by the way the yacht is the first car 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.220
 standard fit the headlights on request 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.020
 front lasers that arrive at 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.970
 illuminate up to 600 meters double 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.140
 of LEDs consuming 30 percent of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.400
 less energy 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.680
 and it is energy that is the protagonist 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.940
 of this sport so different that it has 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 an electric motor connected to the wheels 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.450
 front and a heat engine to those 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 behind which in fact and traction 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.710
 full hybrid and in addition has a second 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.900
 electric motor on the rear axle that does 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.270
 from generator but above all harmonizes 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.010
 makes the 250 newtonmetri of the couple talk 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.440
 of the electric motor that all arrive 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.930
 immediately with the 320 newton meters in 3 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.850
 1500 turbo gasoline cylinders of 231 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.479
 horses that even a bad sound 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.479
 feel here 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.329
 this first test drive and soon there 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.580
 they would have to tell so many things 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.849
 on a car like that but definitely one of the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.730
 most important is the sound there are 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.420
 amplifiers that make it more enjoyable 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.700
 mechanical and exhaust noise 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.510
 of the three cylinders through the boxes 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.510
 hi-fi system 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.620
 the engineers also of other manufacturers 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.400
 in fact they are trying to make more 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.880
 addictive 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.190
 the sound of these engines that good 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.370
 substance they are of the six cylinders in half and 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.100
 then make them sing like a 6 in line 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.800
 bmw for example or a boxer 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.360
 porsche 911 and by chance it's not like that 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.030
 distant as price compared to this 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.910
 to the 8 I have to say that it has a sound that 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.540
 somewhat reminiscent of the six cylinders 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.580
 raucous scratching maybe sinking with 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.310
 the gas is a little too heavy 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.410
 speech of amplification through 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.400
 the cases of the aifa but anyway it is a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.400
 noise that I really like 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.100
 let's talk about performance, of course we are 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.880
 in sport mode at the number level la 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.240
 total power of 362 horses 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.910
 44 seconds are enough to reach 100 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.280
 them starting from standstill up to 250 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.220
 times of maximum self-limited speed 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.260
 to the 120 per hour mode purely 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.340
 electric when you have an autonomy 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.930
 37 km maximum level instead of 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.070
 beautiful sensations 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.990
 the machine is fluid fast then we tend 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.300
 to take the rhythm with the center of gravity 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.140
 so low and the couple that is always 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:01.620
 very present and therefore it is a way of 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.620
 go fast different but fun 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.530
 another way to drive the i8 e in 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.140
 comfort mode also eco pro when 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.079
 the most unexpected side of comes out 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.140
 a sport that is the one of the guide 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.269
 relaxed when just this machine 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.820
 it becomes a very silent hybrid 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.370
 fluid with the petrol engine that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.590
 intervenes almost 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.870
 imperceptible to recharge the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.470
 especially partial gas battery 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.840
 sometimes it's true that maybe it stays on 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.270
 when you remove gas and then this is it 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.700
 sort of push that is not expected 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.500
 But in general driving in traffic and 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.070
 very relaxing and just traveling in 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.460
 Relax 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.070
 all this translates into consumption for 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.510
 how I drove today that is exploring a 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.580
 all the modes of the machine 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.410
 often sinking gas to understand the 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.970
 performance also exploiting the mode 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.780
 purely electric to get out of the 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.150
 city ​​and therefore understand the character a little 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.940
 overall consumption of the machine 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.510
 I said on average today they were 7.5 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.880
 liters 100 km about 14 km with a liter e 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.710
 with declared CO2 emissions of 49 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.050
 grams per kilometer you will be thinking 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.810
 that we are far away linked to 2.1 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.910
 liters on 100 km almost 50 km per liter 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.100
 but the homologation cycles are not known 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.810
 realistic especially on plugins that 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.729
 they do most of the route only in 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.620
 electric without consuming gas but but 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.880
 I think it makes 14 with a liter on one 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.560
 machine with this power these 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.120
 performance is truly remarkable 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 and then it is a result that is obtained 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.970
 quietly in the guide of all 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.440
 days since the yacht is beautiful from 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.479
 drive in traffic like on weekends 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.220
 with a cockpit that seems to come from 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.850
 future but also comfortable as well as 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.850
 good looking 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.710
 is a two-seater plus 2 then behind a 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.690
 adult can resist for a short time 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.910
 shift while there is enough 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.470
 space for children and in the boot there 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.850
 soft suitcases are no problem 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.470
 the same for a weekend 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.120
 remember that the engine warms up a bit 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.490
 strange things that better ray is there 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.960
 instrumentation unclear at 8 and fast 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.280
 and satisfying but not the right car for 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.720
 who wants to drive dirty hear the 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.520
 machine break down between the curves or 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.810
 check a power skid 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.640
 even the same could be more 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.200
 sensitive and six- speed automatic transmission 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.670
 gear that mates the reducer of 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.410
 electric motor to the converter 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.510
 you changed the hydraulic and also in sports 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.160
 they are never really immediate in others 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.990
 words a surgical sport for one 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.610
 clean and precise guide with the crus 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.410
 of the electric driving experience in 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.600
 terms of feeling and comfort to this 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.600
 point you are wondering how much it costs 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.730
 it starts from just over € 184,000 but 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.290
 at the end of the day the question is successful 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.880
 a hybrid sports car like this ad 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.590
 be exciting 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.420
 my answer is yes and you who 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.420
 think comment below
