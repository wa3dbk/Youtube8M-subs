00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
gripper so I use the game gripper that

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.440 
gripper so I use the game gripper that
was<00:03:07.070> nice<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.610> while<00:03:07.820> but<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.150> kept<00:03:08.330> on

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
was nice for a while but it kept on

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.020 
was nice for a while but it kept on
sliding<00:03:08.720> off<00:03:09.050> having<00:03:09.769> actual<00:03:10.250> hardware

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
sliding off having actual hardware

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.390 
sliding off having actual hardware
controls<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:13.220> actually<00:03:13.700> very<00:03:13.730> nice<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:16.160> this
