after<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:03.659> finished<00:00:04.170> developing<00:00:04.950> an<00:00:05.040> analysis

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
after we finished developing an analysis

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.700 
after we finished developing an analysis
services<00:00:05.790> cube<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:07.019> of<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> last<00:00:07.410> things

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
services cube one of the last things

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.890 
services cube one of the last things
that<00:00:07.800> we<00:00:08.130> were<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.610> want<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
that we were going to want to do is to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.450 
that we were going to want to do is to
put<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.170> into<00:00:10.290> production<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.190> put<00:00:11.370> it

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
put it into production and to put it

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.800 
put it into production and to put it
into<00:00:11.580> production<00:00:11.760> it<00:00:12.240> needs<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.600> start

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.810 
into production it needs to start

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.530 
into production it needs to start
processing<00:00:13.050> itself<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.040> no<00:00:14.790> more<00:00:14.970> processing

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
processing itself so no more processing

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.300 
processing itself so no more processing
it<00:00:15.660> from<00:00:15.840> the<00:00:15.930> development<00:00:16.379> environment<00:00:16.470> we

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
it from the development environment we

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.220 
it from the development environment we
need<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.820> happen<00:00:17.849> on<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> schedule

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
need this to happen on a schedule

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.700 
need this to happen on a schedule
automatic<00:00:20.009> basis<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.140> often<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.349> question

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
automatic basis and often the question

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.700 
automatic basis and often the question
comes<00:00:23.009> how<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:23.999> I<00:00:24.119> actually<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.470> I'm

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
comes how do I actually do that so I'm

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.960 
comes how do I actually do that so I'm
going<00:00:25.829> to<00:00:25.859> show<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.189> very<00:00:26.429> simple<00:00:26.699> way<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
going to show you a very simple way to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.899 
going to show you a very simple way to
do<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.230> probably<00:00:29.009> a<00:00:29.279> method<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:29.849> going

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:29.909 
do it and probably a method that's going

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.900 
do it and probably a method that's going
to<00:00:30.149> work<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.989> the<00:00:31.949> majority<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> cubes

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to work for the majority of the cubes

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.029 
to work for the majority of the cubes
you'll<00:00:33.090> you'll<00:00:33.420> already<00:00:33.720> developed<00:00:34.079> I'm

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
you'll you'll already developed I'm

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.310 
you'll you'll already developed I'm
going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> begin<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:36.090> pretending<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.170> I'm

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
going to begin by pretending that I'm

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.400 
going to begin by pretending that I'm
going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> process<00:00:37.949> this<00:00:38.460> database<00:00:39.410> analysis

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
going to process this database analysis

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.919 
going to process this database analysis
services<00:00:40.769> database<00:00:41.280> manually<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
services database manually and at the

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.860 
services database manually and at the
top<00:00:43.109> of<00:00:43.609> management<00:00:44.609> Studios<00:00:45.000> dialog<00:00:45.480> boxes

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
top of management Studios dialog boxes

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.329 
top of management Studios dialog boxes
usually<00:00:46.260> you'll<00:00:46.410> find<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.679> script<00:00:46.949> button<00:00:47.129> like

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
usually you'll find a script button like

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.160 
usually you'll find a script button like
this<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.699> so<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.059> says<00:00:48.269> script<00:00:48.570> action<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> new

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
this one so it says script action to new

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.349 
this one so it says script action to new
window<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.859> can<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.160> script<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
window you can actually script this to

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:52.459 
window you can actually script this to
the<00:00:51.449> clipboard<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:51.989> would<00:00:52.140> make<00:00:52.289> more

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the clipboard which would make more

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.439 
the clipboard which would make more
sense<00:00:52.679> for<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.339> to<00:00:53.519> do<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:53.940> I'm

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
sense for what I'm about to do but I'm

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.939 
sense for what I'm about to do but I'm
going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> put<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.989> into<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> new<00:00:55.469> window<00:00:55.769> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
going to put it into a new window so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.799 
going to put it into a new window so
that<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.399> take<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.179> at<00:00:57.269> that<00:00:57.449> command

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that we can take a look at that command

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
that we can take a look at that command
first<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.899> I'll<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> script<00:01:01.620> button

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
first so I'll have the script button

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.200 
first so I'll have the script button
some<00:01:02.159> things<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.519> happened<00:01:02.670> behind<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
some things have happened behind the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
some things have happened behind the
scenes<00:01:03.269> I'm<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> cancel<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.860> we

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
scenes I'm going to cancel and what we

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
scenes I'm going to cancel and what we
see<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> what's<00:01:05.760> called<00:01:05.940> an<00:01:06.120> XML<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.660> command

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
see is what's called an XML a command

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.350 
see is what's called an XML a command
commands<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.070> analysis<00:01:08.490> services<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.030> do

actions not queries but but

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
actions not queries but but
administrative<00:01:12.960> functions<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.710> and

administrative functions and and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.420 
administrative functions and and
commands<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.480> XML<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
commands are going to be in XML a

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
commands are going to be in XML a
actually<00:01:17.430> even<00:01:17.640> queries<00:01:17.940> become<00:01:18.240> XML<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.720> in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
actually even queries become XML a in

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.040 
actually even queries become XML a in
the<00:01:18.960> long<00:01:19.110> run<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.160> probably<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
the long run but you probably think of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.960 
the long run but you probably think of
queries<00:01:22.050> more<00:01:22.230> being<00:01:22.440> an<00:01:22.530> MD<00:01:22.770> X<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.070> DX<00:01:23.190> but<00:01:23.550> in

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
queries more being an MD X or DX but in

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.690 
queries more being an MD X or DX but in
any<00:01:24.090> case<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.110> tangent<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.550> an

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
any case that's a tangent so this is an

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.580 
any case that's a tangent so this is an
XML<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> command<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> process<00:01:27.870> of<00:01:27.990> cube<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.410> we

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
XML a command a process of cube and we

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
XML a command a process of cube and we
can<00:01:28.710> tell<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.520> says<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.910> in<00:01:30.120> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
can tell that because it says in in a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.750 
can tell that because it says in in a
batch<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:31.200> parallel<00:01:31.950> courses<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> only<00:01:32.580> one

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
batch in parallel courses of only one

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.950 
batch in parallel courses of only one
command<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.240> there's<00:01:33.390> only<00:01:33.480> one<00:01:33.630> thing<00:01:33.870> in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
command so there's only one thing in

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.980 
command so there's only one thing in
parallel<00:01:34.400> process<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:36.090> object<00:01:36.630> called

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
parallel process this object called

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.100 
parallel process this object called
contoso<00:01:37.620> es<00:01:38.010> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> database<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.120> what

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
contoso es which is a database and what

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.200 
contoso es which is a database and what
kind<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> processing<00:01:40.950> should<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.310> take<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
kind of processing should it take and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.730 
kind of processing should it take and
that's<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.870> be<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> processable<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that's it's going to be a processable so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.850 
that's it's going to be a processable so
this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.460> everything<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.870> could<00:01:46.140> put<00:01:46.440> more

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
this is do everything you could put more

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.650 
this is do everything you could put more
fine-grained<00:01:47.610> commands<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.150> here<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> know

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
fine-grained commands in here you know

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.570 
fine-grained commands in here you know
this<00:01:48.780> could<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.050> any<00:01:49.230> XML<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
this could be any XML a but this is the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.240 
this could be any XML a but this is the
most<00:01:50.820> basic<00:01:51.000> simple<00:01:51.770> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.800> process

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
most basic simple kind of process

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.960 
most basic simple kind of process
command<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.900> get<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
command that that you can get so what I

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.790 
command that that you can get so what I
want<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.330> do<00:01:57.540> though<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.870> send<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.470> command

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
want to do though is send that command

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.060 
want to do though is send that command
on<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.010> scheduled<00:01:59.430> basis<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.410> happens<00:02:01.800> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
on a scheduled basis and it so happens I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.930 
on a scheduled basis and it so happens I
can<00:02:02.460> use<00:02:02.640> another<00:02:02.850> tool<00:02:03.240> within<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.230> engine

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
can use another tool within the engine

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.089 
can use another tool within the engine
called<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:06.240> sequel<00:02:07.230> agent<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.770> send<00:02:07.980> these

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
called a sequel agent to send these

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.210 
called a sequel agent to send these
commands<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> connect<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.569> my

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
commands so I'm going to connect to my

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.860 
commands so I'm going to connect to my
relational<00:02:11.220> instance<00:02:11.730> because<00:02:11.970> sequel<00:02:12.510> agent

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
relational instance because sequel agent

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.360 
relational instance because sequel agent
kind<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> runs<00:02:13.560> embedded<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.280> that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
kind of runs embedded in that

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.110 
kind of runs embedded in that
environment

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
environment

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.690 
environment
so<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.349> use<00:02:16.500> sequel<00:02:16.800> agent<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.280> send<00:02:17.610> this

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so I can use sequel agent to send this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.339 
so I can use sequel agent to send this
command<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> scheduled<00:02:18.720> basis<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.260> I'm

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
command on a scheduled basis and I'm

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.360 
command on a scheduled basis and I'm
going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.830> create<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.910> new<00:02:21.120> job<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.750> send<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
going to create a new job to send a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.830 
going to create a new job to send a
command<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.610> daily<00:02:24.000> basis<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.510> I'll<00:02:24.629> call

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
command on a daily basis so I'll call

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.820 
command on a daily basis so I'll call
this<00:02:24.900> daily<00:02:25.379> process<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:27.140> contoso<00:02:28.140> queue<00:02:30.830> now

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
this daily process of contoso queue now

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.530 
this daily process of contoso queue now
steps<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.459> could<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> lot<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.030> steps<00:02:33.330> in

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
steps I could have a lot of steps in

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.960 
steps I could have a lot of steps in
here<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.769> example<00:02:35.280> I'll<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.580> have

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
here but for this example I'll just have

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.720 
here but for this example I'll just have
one<00:02:36.360> step<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.049> is<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.730> process

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
one step so this is going to be process

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.009 
one step so this is going to be process
full<00:02:39.019> database<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:41.640> command<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.450> going

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
full database and this command is going

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.520 
full database and this command is going
to<00:02:43.319> be<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.549> come<00:02:44.910> down<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.120> look<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.690> will

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
to be if I come down and look I will

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.850 
to be if I come down and look I will
find<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.810> analysis<00:02:48.810> services<00:02:49.110> command<00:02:49.590> sync

server<00:02:50.130> now<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.310> for<00:02:50.610> now<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.760> doesn't<00:02:50.940> say<00:02:51.180> XML

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690

server now so for now it doesn't say XML
a<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:51.989> that's<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.349> it's<00:02:52.470> expecting<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
a but that's what it's expecting and I

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.000 
a but that's what it's expecting and I
have<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.690> tell<00:02:54.840> what<00:02:55.079> server<00:02:55.319> I<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.829> to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
have to tell what server I want this to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.140 
have to tell what server I want this to
be<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.549> server<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
be on and that server is going to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.910 
be on and that server is going to
include<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.420> instance<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.110> have<00:02:58.410> ones<00:02:58.680> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
include the instance if I have ones and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.729 
include the instance if I have ones and
in<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.160> case<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.519> do<00:02:59.579> and<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.780> slaps<00:03:01.140> equal<00:03:01.530> one

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
in this case I do and it slaps equal one

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.720 
in this case I do and it slaps equal one
back<00:03:02.069> slash<00:03:02.430> MD<00:03:03.860> my<00:03:04.860> command<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.400> one

back slash MD my command is that one

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.990 
back slash MD my command is that one
I'll<00:03:06.660> just<00:03:06.810> paste<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:08.670> could<00:03:08.849> write

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
I'll just paste that in you could write

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.699 
I'll just paste that in you could write

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
this by hand if you want but I always

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.430 
this by hand if you want but I always
find<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.069> easier<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.549> try<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.299> develop<00:03:13.140> as<00:03:13.260> much

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
find it easier to try to develop as much

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.479
