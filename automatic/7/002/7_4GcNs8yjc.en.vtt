already<00:02:40.440> noticed<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:40.980> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.190> say

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
already noticed that I was going to say

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.960 
already noticed that I was going to say
hello<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.300> then<00:02:42.540> i<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.840> type<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.730> hospital<00:02:44.730> and

hello so then i can type in hospital and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.940 
hello so then i can type in hospital and
it<00:02:45.600> already<00:02:45.750> knows<00:02:46.020> i'm<00:02:46.170> doing<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.740> as

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it already knows i'm doing that and as

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.000 
it already knows i'm doing that and as
you<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.940> really<00:02:48.630> makes<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.800> lot

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
you can see it really makes it a lot

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.750 
you can see it really makes it a lot
easier<00:02:50.280> let's<00:02:50.880> try<00:02:51.150> I'm<00:02:51.420> oh<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:53.430> didn't

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
easier let's try I'm oh that didn't

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.070 
easier let's try I'm oh that didn't
correct<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.360> one<00:02:54.600> but<00:02:55.350> there<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.100> go<00:02:56.220> I'm

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
correct that one but there we go I'm

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.690 
correct that one but there we go I'm
typing<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.640> see<00:03:00.410> with

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.720 

predictive<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.250> pretty<00:03:07.520> good<00:03:07.670> actually

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
predictive so it's pretty good actually

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.050 
predictive so it's pretty good actually
I<00:03:08.180> mean<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.510> does<00:03:08.750> have<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:10.060> predictive

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
I mean it does have that predictive

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.590 
I mean it does have that predictive
keyboard<00:03:11.330> feel<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:14.060> seen<00:03:14.330> on

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
keyboard feel to it as you have seen on

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.840 
keyboard feel to it as you have seen on
several<00:03:15.260> different<00:03:15.410> Android<00:03:16.100> devices<00:03:16.459> with

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
several different Android devices with

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.270 
several different Android devices with
the<00:03:17.030> little<00:03:18.020> row<00:03:18.230> at<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.590> top<00:03:18.800> there<00:03:19.069> that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
the little row at the top there that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.720 
the little row at the top there that
populates<00:03:20.270> as<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:21.050> type<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.709> let's<00:03:22.580> go<00:03:22.640> ahead

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
populates as you type and let's go ahead

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.820 
populates as you type and let's go ahead
and<00:03:22.880> type<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.390> keyboard<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.230> really<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.770> only

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
and type in keyboard so really you only

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.070 
and type in keyboard so really you only
have<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.250> get<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.030> first<00:03:26.570> few<00:03:26.810> letters

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
have to get in the the first few letters

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.800 
have to get in the the first few letters
of<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.620> word<00:03:27.650> for<00:03:28.520> it<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.790> appear<00:03:29.150> in<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:29.510> top

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
of a word for it to appear in this top

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.410 
of a word for it to appear in this top
row<00:03:30.230> up<00:03:30.500> here<00:03:30.830> as<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.130> can<00:03:31.160> see<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.730> does<00:03:32.150> work

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
row up here as you can see it does work

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.420 
row up here as you can see it does work
pretty<00:03:32.450> well<00:03:32.870> though<00:03:33.230> I'm<00:03:33.470> definitely

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
pretty well though I'm definitely

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.670 
pretty well though I'm definitely
impressed<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:35.090> does<00:03:35.360> make<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> lot<00:03:36.080> faster

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
impressed it does make it a lot faster

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.460 
impressed it does make it a lot faster
