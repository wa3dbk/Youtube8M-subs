they're<00:02:30.990> hot<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.950> break<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.430> is

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
they're hot so to break that is

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.930 
they're hot so to break that is
impossible<00:02:32.990> these<00:02:33.990> however<00:02:34.370> they're<00:02:35.370> not<00:02:35.520> so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
impossible these however they're not so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.660 
impossible these however they're not so
tight<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.410> won't<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.070> hassle

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
tight you know you won't have a hassle

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.210 
tight you know you won't have a hassle
to<00:02:38.820> take<00:02:39.120> them<00:02:39.240> apart<00:02:39.440> once<00:02:40.440> they're<00:02:40.650> off<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
to take them apart once they're off you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.520 
to take them apart once they're off you
know<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.210> take<00:02:42.420> these<00:02:42.600> babies<00:02:43.050> off<00:02:43.200> here

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
know and you take these babies off here

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.430 
know and you take these babies off here
this<00:02:44.070> thing<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.460> glide<00:02:44.670> off<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.480> before<00:02:46.140> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this thing can glide off and before you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.160 
this thing can glide off and before you
start<00:02:46.680> doing<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.100> right<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.520> here<00:02:48.170> there's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
start doing that right up here there's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.700 
start doing that right up here there's
that<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:50.300> motor<00:02:51.300> right<00:02:51.600> here<00:02:51.630> which<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.380> this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
that the motor right here which is this

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.270 
that the motor right here which is this
right<00:02:52.920> here<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:54.330> up<00:02:54.510> here<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:55.620> know<00:02:55.740> it's

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
right here it's up here you know it's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.820 
right here it's up here you know it's
difficult<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.760> take<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.710> manifold<00:02:58.710> out

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
difficult to take that manifold out

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.160 
difficult to take that manifold out
without<00:02:59.220> without<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.820> being<00:03:00.150> off<00:03:00.270> just<00:03:00.990> take

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
without without this being off just take

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.340 
without without this being off just take
that<00:03:01.290> off<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.740> put<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.980> aside<00:03:02.070> over<00:03:02.370> here

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
that off and you put it aside over here

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.580 
that off and you put it aside over here
all<00:03:04.350> my<00:03:04.560> hoses<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.190> all<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.490> stuff<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:06.030> just

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
all my hoses and all that stuff I just

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.470 
all my hoses and all that stuff I just
normally<00:03:07.590> put<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:07.860> bolts<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.670> them<00:03:08.820> not<00:03:09.180> nuts

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
normally put in bolts in them not nuts

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.410 
normally put in bolts in them not nuts
you<00:03:10.380> know<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.710> they<00:03:10.920> won't<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.970> screws<00:03:12.270> from

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
you know so they won't the screws from

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.330 
you know so they won't the screws from
the<00:03:12.510> from<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.410> manifold<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:14.070> know<00:03:14.190> they're

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
the from the manifold you know they're

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.800 
the from the manifold you know they're
fat<00:03:14.550> enough<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.970> fit<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.270> there<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.600> way<00:03:15.690> they

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
fat enough to fit in there that way they

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.120 
fat enough to fit in there that way they
won't<00:03:15.930> leak<00:03:16.200> all<00:03:16.500> along<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.190> freeze<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.830> then

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
won't leak all along and freeze and then

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.220 
won't leak all along and freeze and then
these<00:03:20.370> holes<00:03:20.670> are<00:03:20.940> very<00:03:20.970> difficult<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:22.020> to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
these holes are very difficult to get to

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.830 
these holes are very difficult to get to
but<00:03:22.500> once<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.920> get<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.970> know<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> needlenose

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
but once you get you know a needlenose

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.170 
but once you get you know a needlenose
plier<00:03:25.910> get<00:03:26.910> one<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.150> these<00:03:28.730> these<00:03:29.730> guys<00:03:29.940> right

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
plier get one of these these guys right

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.640 
plier get one of these these guys right
here<00:03:30.240> will<00:03:30.570> help<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.840> out<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.230> know<00:03:31.320> squeeze

in<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.520> particular<00:03:40.220> setup<00:03:41.220> here<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:41.670> I'm

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
in this particular setup here that I'm

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.000 
in this particular setup here that I'm
fixing<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.140> know<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.800> way<00:03:43.950> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
fixing it's you know this this way you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.890 
fixing it's you know this this way you
can<00:03:44.280> do<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> lot<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.760> stuff<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.209> know<00:03:45.360> it's<00:03:45.480> easy

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
can do a lot of stuff you know it's easy

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.210 
can do a lot of stuff you know it's easy
to<00:03:46.050> take<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.350> apart<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.709> took<00:03:46.860> me<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.070> about

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
to take that apart it took me like about

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.030 
to take that apart it took me like about
10<00:03:47.610> minutes<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:49.290> take<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.620> amount<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.860> foot

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
10 minutes to take the amount of foot

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.070 
10 minutes to take the amount of foot
out<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.580> replace<00:03:50.970> all<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:53.780> are<00:03:54.780> your

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
out you can replace all your are your

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.449 
out you can replace all your are your
you<00:03:55.980> know<00:03:56.070> spark<00:03:56.370> plugs<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.850> all<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
you know spark plugs and all that in the

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.220 
you know spark plugs and all that in the
back<00:03:59.640> part<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.270> very<00:04:00.540> difficult<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.110> get

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
back part this is very difficult to get

to
you<00:04:02.130> know<00:04:02.250> these<00:04:02.430> vans<00:04:03.530> don't<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.680> enough

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
you know these vans don't have enough

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.540 
you know these vans don't have enough
space<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.670> be<00:04:06.570> able<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:07.160> take<00:04:08.160> these<00:04:08.310> off

without having to take off the manifold

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.090 
without having to take off the manifold
you<00:04:11.910> have<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.330> take<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.600> off<00:04:12.920> regardless<00:04:13.920> of

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
you have to take that off regardless of
