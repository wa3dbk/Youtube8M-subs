00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.630
 Yes, so this time about the recommended lure for trout fishing at the management fishing area 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.679
 I want to introduce 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:15.610
 Yes there are 2 tips for fishing a lot 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.730
 First to perform one eye lure color rotation 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.180
 Broadly divided and flashy colors 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:27.340
 It is with the color of the metallic system from sober system 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:30.340
 If you're starting out, give it a flashy appeal 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.600
 I 'll paint and I can't catch it 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:40.760
 Or try changing the metallic accounting or try changing to plain system to change the color 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:46.940
 The second is has become a facility for up to fishing by changing the color 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.649
 Changing the weight of the lure Here you can fish ass The nesting you can fish changes 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.570
 There is for 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.570
 I think being based on it like to introduce spoon set of this recommendation 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.840
 Oh Ie to recommend this time 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.840
 Ofuto 's spoon set 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:15.850
 There are 10 spoons in this one and it's a flashy system and a sober system metallic system 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.880
 Basic color is included 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.990
 Also at 8 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.990
 Storing a spoon makes the red case easy to use, though 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.770
 It is in the form like this 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.320
 This is also 8 well 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.140
 As there is size development from 1 g to a 3 g , we use depending on place 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.640

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.160

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.160
 We also sell a solid red case 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:04.520
 Finally the hook releaser here is a product to extend the fishing results 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.599
 This is the hook without touching the fish 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.729
 It has become a very useful product that can be removed from the fish 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.729
