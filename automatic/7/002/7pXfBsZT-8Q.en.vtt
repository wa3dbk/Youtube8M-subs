00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:08.629 
to your own bike to make it run better

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
that maybe it's best to leap to the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.890 
that maybe it's best to leap to the
experts<00:00:12.889> one<00:00:13.249> such<00:00:13.490> thing<00:00:13.759> is<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.419> adjusting

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
experts one such thing is the adjusting

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.140 
experts one such thing is the adjusting
of<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.169> gears<00:00:15.499> I<00:00:15.740> will<00:00:16.250> say<00:00:16.430> it's<00:00:16.550> it's<00:00:16.850> not<00:00:17.120> a

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
of the gears I will say it's it's not a

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.400 
of the gears I will say it's it's not a
difficult<00:00:17.660> thing<00:00:17.690> to<00:00:17.840> do<00:00:18.080> but<00:00:18.260> it<00:00:18.380> is

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
difficult thing to do but it is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.290 
difficult thing to do but it is
something<00:00:18.860> that<00:00:19.010> if<00:00:19.250> you<00:00:19.520> do<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:19.790> improperly

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
something that if you do it improperly

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.880 
something that if you do it improperly
you<00:00:20.540> can<00:00:20.690> make<00:00:20.900> a<00:00:21.170> lot<00:00:21.380> more<00:00:21.530> work<00:00:21.740> for

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
you can make a lot more work for

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.530 
you can make a lot more work for
yourself<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:22.430> it'll<00:00:22.670> end<00:00:22.910> up<00:00:23.000> costing<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:23.450> a

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
yourself and it'll end up costing you a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.270 
yourself and it'll end up costing you a
lot<00:00:23.720> more<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:24.080> have<00:00:24.200> that<00:00:24.410> that<00:00:24.680> fixed<00:00:25.100> at<00:00:25.190> the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
lot more to have that that fixed at the

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.210 
lot more to have that that fixed at the
bike<00:00:25.460> store<00:00:25.700> but<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:26.210> will<00:00:26.390> point<00:00:26.570> out<00:00:26.810> that

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
bike store but I will point out that

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.850 
bike store but I will point out that
generally<00:00:28.220> when<00:00:28.310> gears<00:00:28.640> when<00:00:29.060> bikes<00:00:29.270> stop

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
generally when gears when bikes stop

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.080 
generally when gears when bikes stop
shifting<00:00:30.860> properly<00:00:31.280> it's<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.700> problem<00:00:32.000> with

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
shifting properly it's a problem with

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.119 
shifting properly it's a problem with
the<00:00:32.210> cable<00:00:32.780> adjustment<00:00:32.899> not<00:00:33.829> with<00:00:34.010> the

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
the cable adjustment not with the

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.729 
the cable adjustment not with the
adjustment<00:00:34.609> of<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.789> derailers<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:35.989> it<00:00:36.499> may<00:00:36.710> be

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
adjustment of the derailers so it may be

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.439 
adjustment of the derailers so it may be
natural<00:00:36.980> for<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.579> start<00:00:37.820> kind<00:00:38.179> of<00:00:38.269> playing

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
natural for you to start kind of playing

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.299 
natural for you to start kind of playing
with<00:00:38.659> the<00:00:38.780> screws<00:00:39.170> on<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.589> front<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.280> the

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
with the screws on the front and on the

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.979 
with the screws on the front and on the
front<00:00:40.609> and<00:00:40.760> on<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.909> rear<00:00:41.059> derailleur<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.899> I'll

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
front and on the rear derailleur so I'll

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.569 
front and on the rear derailleur so I'll
advise<00:00:42.289> you<00:00:42.320> against<00:00:42.920> that<00:00:43.070> if<00:00:43.219> unless

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
advise you against that if unless

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.479 
advise you against that if unless
someone<00:00:44.149> has<00:00:44.269> adjusted<00:00:44.780> those<00:00:44.929> in<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.230> past

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
someone has adjusted those in the past

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.309 
someone has adjusted those in the past
they<00:00:46.969> should<00:00:47.179> be<00:00:47.300> set<00:00:47.539> fine<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:47.989> they're<00:00:48.109> good

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
they should be set fine and they're good

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:49.840 
they should be set fine and they're good
for<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.620> life<00:00:48.769> of<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.010> bike<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:49.460> just<00:00:49.640> take<00:00:49.760> it

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
for the life of the bike so just take it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.189 
for the life of the bike so just take it
to<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.030> bike<00:00:50.149> shop<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.449> they'll<00:00:50.690> adjust<00:00:50.839> your

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.840 
to the bike shop and they'll adjust your
cable<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.679> get<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:51.920> shifting<00:00:52.249> smoothly<00:00:52.579> like

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
cable and get it shifting smoothly like

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.509 
cable and get it shifting smoothly like
it<00:00:52.969> should<00:00:53.179> be<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:54.319> last<00:00:54.530> thing<00:00:54.710> we're<00:00:55.309> going

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
if the saddle is too high you're just

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.480 
if the saddle is too high you're just
gonna<00:01:11.930> be<00:01:12.140> rocking<00:01:12.590> back<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:12.799> forth<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.399> the

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
legs almost fully extended so if the leg

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.190 
legs almost fully extended so if the leg
was<00:01:47.600> too<00:01:48.350> straight<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:49.399> would<00:01:49.520> be<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
was too straight that would be to the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.719 
was too straight that would be to the
saddle<00:01:51.469> would<00:01:51.530> be<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.679> little<00:01:51.890> bit<00:01:51.979> too<00:01:52.159> high<00:01:52.369> if

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
saddle would be a little bit too high if

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.999 
saddle would be a little bit too high if
obviously<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.509> was<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.990> was<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.380> lot<00:01:54.619> more<00:01:54.829> of<00:01:54.920> a

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
obviously it was it was a lot more of a

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.169 
obviously it was it was a lot more of a
bend<00:01:55.189> in<00:01:55.280> there<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.579> saddle<00:01:55.850> would<00:01:55.939> be<00:01:56.030> too

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
bend in there the saddle would be too

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.910 
bend in there the saddle would be too
low<00:01:56.359> so<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.079> about<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.409> position<00:01:57.799> that
