00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.339 

the<00:00:09.030> fourth<00:00:09.300> step<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.050> my<00:00:10.170> all-time

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
favorites is Wi-Fi feel what this app

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.419 
favorites is Wi-Fi feel what this app
does<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> name<00:00:12.780> says<00:00:13.080> kills<00:00:13.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:13.889> not

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
does is as the name says kills Wi-Fi not

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.000 
does is as the name says kills Wi-Fi not
in<00:00:14.549> channeling<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.299> some<00:00:15.450> people<00:00:15.890> so<00:00:16.890> we

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
in channeling but for some people so we

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.290 
in channeling but for some people so we
have<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.160> pretty<00:00:17.310> simple<00:00:17.580> layout<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.150> auto

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
have a pretty simple layout and auto

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.370 
have a pretty simple layout and auto
switch<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.810> activating<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.350> deactivating

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
switch for activating or deactivating

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.279 
switch for activating or deactivating
the<00:00:20.070> app<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.240> logic<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> stops

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the app and the logic and the stops

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
the app and the logic and the stops
working<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.369> mimics<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.789> IP<00:00:24.060> address

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
working is that it mimics the IP address

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.570 
working is that it mimics the IP address
of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.019> router<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.830> makes<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
of the router and makes this as the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
of the router and makes this as the
router<00:00:26.730> for<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> devices<00:00:27.420> connected<00:00:27.960> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
router for all the devices connected to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.410 
router for all the devices connected to
the<00:00:28.380> Wi-Fi<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.519> then<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> control

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the Wi-Fi so then you have the control

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
the Wi-Fi so then you have the control
of<00:00:30.510> serving<00:00:31.140> Wi-Fi<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> someone<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:32.279> some

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of serving Wi-Fi to someone and not some

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.630 
of serving Wi-Fi to someone and not some
English<00:00:32.759> someone<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> pretty<00:00:35.010> simple

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
English someone so this is pretty simple

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.670 
English someone so this is pretty simple
