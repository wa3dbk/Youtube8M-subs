00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
the thunderous now made me sad that it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.990 
the thunderous now made me sad that it
lived<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.250> know<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.460> resistant<00:02:50.910> but

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
lived because I know the resistant but

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.300 
lived because I know the resistant but
it<00:02:51.060> still<00:02:51.180> made<00:02:51.270> me<00:02:51.390> sad<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.840> lived<00:02:52.050> so<00:02:52.350> I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it still made me sad that it lived so I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.800 
it still made me sad that it lived so I
don't<00:02:53.670> want<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.850> get<00:02:53.970> T<00:02:54.180> waived<00:02:54.330> or<00:02:54.510> anything

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
don't want to get T waived or anything

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.360 
don't want to get T waived or anything
someone<00:02:55.140> go<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.380> into<00:02:55.740> my<00:02:55.830> he<00:02:56.010> trained<00:02:56.190> as<00:02:56.280> he

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
someone go out into my he trained as he

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.710 
someone go out into my he trained as he
does<00:02:56.520> reveal<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.910> sludge<00:02:57.180> wave<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.690> I

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
does reveal the sludge wave so I

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.240 
does reveal the sludge wave so I
definitely<00:02:57.960> could've<00:02:58.290> stayed<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.980> if<00:02:59.160> I

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
definitely could've stayed in on it if I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.760 
definitely could've stayed in on it if I
know<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.850> didn't<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.180> T<00:03:00.360> wave<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.840> guess<00:03:01.650> I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
know they didn't have T wave I guess I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.080 
know they didn't have T wave I guess I
should<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:01.980> seen<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> u-turn<00:03:02.640> coming

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
should have seen the u-turn coming

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.970 
should have seen the u-turn coming
because<00:03:03.420> him<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.900> turning<00:03:04.320> him<00:03:04.560> revealing

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
and I shouldn't because politoed is

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.590 
and I shouldn't because politoed is
bulky<00:04:04.590> enough<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:04.890> eat<00:04:05.100> one<00:04:05.370> up<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.970> got<00:04:06.330> to

bring at least lower than that but for
some<00:04:09.480> reason<00:04:09.720> was<00:04:09.870> very<00:04:10.050> confident<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.650> it

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
some reason was very confident that it

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.860 
some reason was very confident that it

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
could kill and as you can see I get it

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.530 
could kill and as you can see I get it
doesn't<00:04:13.230> kill<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:14.100> took<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.520> kill<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.150> it

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
doesn't kill it took that kill and it

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.420 
doesn't kill it took that kill and it
just<00:04:15.959> knocked<00:04:16.169> me<00:04:16.350> out<00:04:16.380> at<00:04:16.620> times<00:04:16.890> for<00:04:17.220> ice

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
just knocked me out at times for ice

because now the zoom role is in kill

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.749 
because now the zoom role is in kill
range<00:05:13.419> of<00:05:13.690> an<00:05:14.349> earthquake<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.340> I'm<00:05:15.639> looking

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
range of an earthquake so I'm looking

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.610 
range of an earthquake so I'm looking
very<00:05:16.060> very<00:05:16.270> good<00:05:16.509> on<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.990> because<00:05:17.259> before

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
very very good on that because before

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.839 
very very good on that because before
earthquake<00:05:18.219> would<00:05:18.340> have<00:05:18.430> definitely<00:05:18.580> not

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
earthquake would have definitely not

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.330 
earthquake would have definitely not
killed<00:05:19.029> it<00:05:19.120> from<00:05:19.240> that<00:05:19.360> range<00:05:20.009> but<00:05:21.009> now<00:05:21.159> it's

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
killed it from that range but now it's

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.040 
killed it from that range but now it's
in<00:05:21.460> kill<00:05:21.669> range<00:05:21.849> and<00:05:22.120> we<00:05:22.270> wanted<00:05:22.449> to<00:05:22.509> a<00:05:22.599> KO<00:05:22.870> the

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
in kill range and we wanted to a KO the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.080 
in kill range and we wanted to a KO the
ferrothorn<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.740> earthquake<00:05:24.219> had<00:05:24.909> you<00:05:25.000> have

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
ferrothorn that earthquake had you have

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.279 
ferrothorn that earthquake had you have
not<00:05:25.240> commanded<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.750> stealth<00:05:25.960> rocks<00:05:26.199> he

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
not commanded the stealth rocks he

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.420 
not commanded the stealth rocks he
definitely<00:05:26.529> would<00:05:26.710> have<00:05:26.740> lived<00:05:27.009> so<00:05:27.190> rocks

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
definitely would have lived so rocks

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.430 
definitely would have lived so rocks
ended<00:05:27.699> up<00:05:27.789> being<00:05:27.940> a<00:05:28.090> beneficial<00:05:28.870> factor<00:05:29.229> on

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
ended up being a beneficial factor on

the way I can get intimidate off on this

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.140 
the way I can get intimidate off on this
thing<00:05:35.440> because<00:05:35.680> Aquajet<00:05:36.370> could<00:05:36.610> kill<00:05:36.879> me<00:05:36.969> from

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
thing because Aquajet could kill me from

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.519 
thing because Aquajet could kill me from
that<00:05:37.300> range<00:05:37.479> but<00:05:37.690> after<00:05:37.930> intimidate<00:05:38.409> it

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
that range but after intimidate it
