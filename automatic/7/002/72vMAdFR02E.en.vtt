00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.840
 hi to all with that cups 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.390
 mobile.fr we are abu dhabi in nokia world 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.230
 of light montÃ¨ze in the hand the asha sa 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.219
 strap 2502 is that which is at 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.800
 middle of the range 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.560
 finally the range of new ones new 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.570
 terms they have so we have the 500 that 502 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.310
 and the 503 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.240
 can you also find videos there 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.920
 there is a video of taking in hand of that 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.020
 to other terminals on the chain 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.910
 youtube and on that moment so this 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.010
 502 that they are these particularities 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.809
 compared to the other two 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.050
 we have a screen 3 inches like the others 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.960
 we have a 5 megapixel camera with 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.500
 flash led like the 503 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.050
 we have this same design here in yellow with 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.360
 this transparent plastic side that gives 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.900
 a slightly sad effect alpe a little bit of 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.590
 ice all fall gloves 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.090
 and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 and was there 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.970
 the hen we will say that the big 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.410
 change on it what is not 3g 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.120
 is just 503 g and 3g this one is 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.800
 judged and 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.230
 also unlock dual sim in this way 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.620
 there is no editing there is no editing 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.000
 single sim so 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.450
 that I 'm doing this to you quickly 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.189
 if I want no 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.350
 like that I'm not super yet at 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.860
 the esm to see you have the options 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.810
 of dual sim that are right here 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.280
 so what's new on this on this heap 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.340
 no, and we're just going for a moment 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.550
 go around design is here 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:41.970
 up the jack the micro usb volume unlock 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.410
 micro here and there the camera the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.060
 little difference in design here so what 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.340
 full block if you want to differentiate 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.340
 compared to 500 3 for example 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.030
 you base against 500 rooms 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.280
 does not have a led flash it also allows 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.600
 to differentiate it double tap 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.510
 normally works but it's true 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.150
 that he has a little bit complicated to 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.370
 use in what I was going through there 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.780
 while they were flying you can 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.530
 launch cameras that way 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.800
 there and then 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.350
 switch on video that way 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.920
 and then access your shots as 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.300
 that's the 3 small movements 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.840
 sideways that manipulate 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.010
 quickly the camera and we have 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.920
 also a new version of this 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.360
 which they call fast lane which is this 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.220
 screen to left there is not necessarily 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.680
 a left as everything goes in circles 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 like that which allows quick access to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.610
 these neighbors heal their activities 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.989
 today so there for example told him 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.540
 today I pleaded a photo on 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.140
 facebook that kind of thing what is that 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.790
 I did yesterday 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.709
 it also allows quick access 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.670
 at the end the applications you 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.100
 have opened today all the activities 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.360
 that you have with whom were made 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.489
 on a device you can access it 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 here it's a way a little bit of 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.520
 to make a small azra measure where 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.290
 I had not really existed 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.160
 rather practical after for the rest 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.410
 it's classic shopping with a 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 consistent interface 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.700
 New Delhi 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.709
 m 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.709
 he added 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.660
 here for example take pictures 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.610
 that's it for you 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.680
 r I prayed to god you share 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.030
 quickly on facebook or others 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.980
 on other platforms if you have 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.460
 configured if you have not weakened 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.680
 configure 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.210
 with other shapes and normally 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.630
 that's how we can come back very 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.060
 quickly on this screen there it's a 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.760
 device that seems rather interesting 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.220
 who is a bit my team and that 2,500 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.040
 3.1 say worried 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.710
 the gloves threw away the original gloves and 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.120
 you can remove to their name on 503 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.550
 you can I do not know if on the stand 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.500
 where it's possible regions we do not have 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.610
 the button I have the impression of the hull 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.720
 is removable in any case out of a hundred 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.440
 fifty strokes and remove the rating 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.220
 change the colors 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.030
 I'm here I'm not quite on 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.200
 questions about what appears 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.200
 do not hesitate to see you soon
