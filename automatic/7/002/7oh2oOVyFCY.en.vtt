know<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.360> left<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:24.840> that's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
know the up down left or right that's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.490 
know the up down left or right that's
where<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:25.920> B<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.200> B<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
where your B and a is I think it's B and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.789 
where your B and a is I think it's B and
a<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.270> figured<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
a I think is how I figured it out the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
a I think is how I figured it out the
left<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.460> B<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
left to be and B the right to be a I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.890 
left to be and B the right to be a I
guess<00:01:34.970> I'm<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.150> quite<00:01:36.360> sure<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.780> then

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
guess I'm not quite sure it and then

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.980 
guess I'm not quite sure it and then
this<00:01:37.079> thing<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.530> top<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.979> actually<00:01:38.490> for

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
this thing up top is actually for

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.469 
this thing up top is actually for
basically<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.439> light<00:01:40.770> gun<00:01:40.979> games<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> can

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
basically for light gun games so you can

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300 
basically for light gun games so you can
even<00:01:42.720> play<00:01:43.229> stuff<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.770> duck<00:01:43.979> hunt<00:01:44.189> or

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
even play stuff like duck hunt or

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
even play stuff like duck hunt or
whatnot<00:01:44.490> or<00:01:45.390> what<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
whatnot or what they have on here and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.080 
whatnot or what they have on here and
now<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.710> only<00:01:47.040> has<00:01:47.250> ten<00:01:47.700> built-in

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
now this thing only has ten built-in

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.480 
now this thing only has ten built-in
games<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.890> loosely<00:01:50.310> because

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
games and I use that you loosely because

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.630 
games and I use that you loosely because
I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.000> few<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.270> them<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.570> been<00:01:52.640> screwed

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
I think a few of them have been screwed

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090 
I think a few of them have been screwed
up<00:01:53.759> including<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> weird<00:01:54.840> duck<00:01:55.829> hunt

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
up including like a weird duck hunt

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.620 
up including like a weird duck hunt
variation<00:01:56.670> where<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:56.939> change<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.390> Ducks

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
variation where they change the Ducks

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
variation where they change the Ducks
and<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.409> helicopters<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.310> you're<00:01:59.430> shooting

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and do helicopters so you're shooting

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.260 
and do helicopters so you're shooting
down<00:01:59.909> helicopters<00:02:00.979> like<00:02:01.979> Apache<00:02:02.490> helicopters

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
down helicopters like Apache helicopters

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.400 
down helicopters like Apache helicopters
which<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.850> wrong<00:02:05.850> yeah<00:02:07.190> but<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:10.140> did

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
which is kind of wrong yeah but it did

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.510 
which is kind of wrong yeah but it did

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
eight and there's 84 games on this bad

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.980 
eight and there's 84 games on this bad
boy

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
boy

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.050 
boy
and<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.740> actually<00:02:19.950> plugged<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:20.970> back

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
and you actually plugged it in and back

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.600 
and you actually plugged it in and back
here<00:02:21.420> into<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.900> cartridge<00:02:22.290> slot<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.460> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
here into that cartridge slot now if you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.980 
here into that cartridge slot now if you
guys<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:23.790> thinking<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.510> looks<00:02:24.810> an

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
guys are thinking that this looks an

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.310 
guys are thinking that this looks an
awful<00:02:25.440> lot<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.670> Famicom<00:02:27.180> cart<00:02:27.690> that's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
awful lot like a Famicom cart that's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440 
awful lot like a Famicom cart that's
because<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.800> will<00:02:29.040> actually<00:02:29.070> work<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.270> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
because this will actually work in a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.060 
because this will actually work in a
Famicom<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:31.140> least<00:02:31.320> from<00:02:31.470> what<00:02:31.620> I've<00:02:31.650> seen

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
Famicom at least from what I've seen

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.340 
Famicom at least from what I've seen
from<00:02:32.760> some<00:02:32.970> other<00:02:33.150> videos<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.720> YouTube<00:02:34.110> when<00:02:34.320> I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
from some other videos on YouTube when I

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.890 
from some other videos on YouTube when I
was<00:02:34.530> researching<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:36.060> power<00:02:36.240> joy<00:02:36.480> here<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
was researching the power joy here and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.680 
was researching the power joy here and
in<00:02:36.960> fact<00:02:37.520> other<00:02:38.520> Famicom<00:02:39.300> carts<00:02:39.600> like

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
in fact other Famicom carts like

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.200 
in fact other Famicom carts like
legitimate<00:02:40.440> Famicom<00:02:40.980> carts<00:02:41.310> will<00:02:41.490> actually

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
legitimate Famicom carts will actually

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.310 
legitimate Famicom carts will actually
work<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:43.350> here<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.640> essence<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.390> technically

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
work in here so in essence I technically

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.270 
work in here so in essence I technically
have<00:02:47.330> Famicom<00:02:48.710> here's<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.830> thing<00:02:50.040> where<00:02:50.190> you

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
have Famicom here's the thing where you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.070 
have Famicom here's the thing where you
can<00:02:50.400> plug<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.730> second<00:02:51.090> controller<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.810> yes

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
can plug in a second controller and yes

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.720 
can plug in a second controller and yes
it's<00:02:52.350> shaped<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:52.650> say<00:02:52.920> Genesis<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.520> haven't

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it's shaped like say Genesis I haven't

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.710 
it's shaped like say Genesis I haven't
tried<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:55.050> second<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:55.740> yet<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.940> will<00:02:57.120> try<00:02:57.360> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
tried a second one yet but I will try a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.500 
tried a second one yet but I will try a
Genesis<00:02:58.290> controller<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:59.130> I'll<00:02:59.250> try<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.640> NES

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
Genesis controller and I'll try the NES

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.090 
Genesis controller and I'll try the NES
controller<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.830> Thomas<00:03:03.140> Thomas<00:03:04.140> 31:20<00:03:04.890> made

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
controller that Thomas Thomas 31:20 made

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.630 
controller that Thomas Thomas 31:20 made
for<00:03:05.340> me

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
for me

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.100 
for me
a<00:03:05.670> while<00:03:06.090> back<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:08.040> my<00:03:08.160> Atari<00:03:08.490> 1700<00:03:09.330> but<00:03:09.990> I'll

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
a while back for my Atari 1700 but I'll

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.050 
a while back for my Atari 1700 but I'll
see<00:03:10.320> if<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.650> will<00:03:10.860> work<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.490> as<00:03:11.850> well

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
see if that will work in this as well

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.860 
see if that will work in this as well
and<00:03:12.360> maybe<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.690> will<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.090> thing<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.480> here

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
and maybe it will and this thing up here

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.190 
and maybe it will and this thing up here
is<00:03:15.930> where<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.410> battery<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:16.890> going<00:03:18.200> it's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
is where the battery is going it's

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.710 
is where the battery is going it's
powered<00:03:19.709> by<00:03:19.740> if<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:20.760> open<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.450> for

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
powered by if I get this open here for

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.640 
powered by if I get this open here for
triple-a<00:03:24.720> batteries<00:03:27.020> it's<00:03:28.020> kind<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.380> hard<00:03:28.620> to

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
triple-a batteries it's kind of hard to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:41.270 
triple-a batteries it's kind of hard to
get<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:36.140> big<00:03:37.140> enough<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.959> tell<00:03:40.280> they

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
get it big enough you can you tell they

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.330 
get it big enough you can you tell they
kind<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.580> hold<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.940> side<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.209> was<00:03:42.480> popping<00:03:42.900> up

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
kind of hold this side I was popping up

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.560 
kind of hold this side I was popping up
and<00:03:44.340> then<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.640> cord<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.030> coming<00:03:45.390> out

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
and then the cord that is coming out

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.240 
and then the cord that is coming out
since<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:45.990> not<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.200> power<00:03:46.470> cord<00:03:46.770> it's<00:03:46.950> your

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
since it's not a power cord it's your

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.360 
since it's not a power cord it's your
your<00:03:47.940> video<00:03:48.240> cord<00:03:48.630> now<00:03:49.130> obviously<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.220> know

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
your video cord now obviously I know

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.920 
your video cord now obviously I know
what<00:03:50.490> these<00:03:50.640> two<00:03:50.700> are<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.270> is<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.600> know<00:03:51.720> your

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
what these two are this is you know your

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.030 
what these two are this is you know your
standard<00:03:52.620> RCA<00:03:52.950> jacks<00:03:53.580> audio<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.900> mono<00:03:55.800> audio

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
standard RCA jacks audio and mono audio

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.790 
standard RCA jacks audio and mono audio
and<00:03:56.520> video<00:03:56.850> but<00:03:57.780> what<00:03:58.050> in<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.230> heck<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.560> this

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
and video but what in the heck is this

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.160 
and video but what in the heck is this
if<00:03:59.100> anybody<00:03:59.459> knows<00:03:59.700> what<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.300> jack<00:04:00.630> goes<00:04:00.870> to

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
if anybody knows what this jack goes to

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.830 
if anybody knows what this jack goes to
maybe<00:04:02.160> that's<00:04:02.430> something<00:04:02.700> for<00:04:02.880> how<00:04:03.330> regions

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
maybe that's something for how regions

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.760 
maybe that's something for how regions
or<00:04:04.430> Japanese<00:04:05.430> regions<00:04:05.959> Chinese<00:04:06.959> regions<00:04:07.500> I

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
or Japanese regions Chinese regions I

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.870 
or Japanese regions Chinese regions I
have<00:04:08.400> no<00:04:08.520> idea<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.890> I've<00:04:10.890> never<00:04:11.400> seen<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.700> hook

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
have no idea but I've never seen a hook

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.910 
have no idea but I've never seen a hook
up<00:04:12.030> like<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.600> before<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.350> if<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.470> know<00:04:13.709> let

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
exactly like a zapper but it actually

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.040 
exactly like a zapper but it actually
sounds<00:04:53.390> pretty<00:04:53.450> close<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:55.720> yeah<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.020> the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050

sounds pretty close and yeah the the
sounds<00:04:57.710> aren't<00:04:57.860> bit<00:04:58.100> off<00:04:58.250> from<00:04:58.670> some<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.090> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
both of those downloaded onto my wii

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.320 
both of those downloaded onto my wii
from<00:05:14.450> the<00:05:14.540> virtual<00:05:14.840> console<00:05:15.170> as<00:05:15.290> well<00:05:15.700> and<00:05:16.700> the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
from the virtual console as well and the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.270 
from the virtual console as well and the
Wii<00:05:17.570> Virtual<00:05:18.050> Console<00:05:18.530> sounds<00:05:19.070> more

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
Wii Virtual Console sounds more

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.190 
Wii Virtual Console sounds more
authentic<00:05:20.860> then<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.750> tendinous<00:05:23.750> sounds<00:05:24.080> on

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
authentic then the tendinous sounds on

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.260 
authentic then the tendinous sounds on
this<00:05:24.410> that's<00:05:24.710> because<00:05:24.950> they<00:05:25.070> use<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.880> NES

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
this that's because they use the the NES

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.140 
this that's because they use the the NES
on<00:05:26.450> a<00:05:26.480> chip<00:05:26.720> or<00:05:26.870> Famicom<00:05:27.320> on<00:05:27.470> a<00:05:27.500> chip

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
on a chip or Famicom on a chip

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.659 
on a chip or Famicom on a chip
architecture<00:05:29.150> but<00:05:29.770> in<00:05:30.770> essence<00:05:31.280> you<00:05:31.430> know<00:05:31.460> all

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
architecture but in essence you know all

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.430 
architecture but in essence you know all
the<00:05:31.760> games<00:05:31.910> do<00:05:32.210> play<00:05:32.419> well<00:05:32.630> they<00:05:32.780> look<00:05:33.050> they

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
the games do play well they look they

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.810 
the games do play well they look they
