00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
if you see the two pieces balanced

here<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.460> what's<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.519> temperature<00:00:11.759> do<00:00:11.910> you

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
here for what's the temperature do you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
here for what's the temperature do you
think<00:00:12.150> Weather<00:00:12.509> Channel<00:00:12.870> says<00:00:13.049> 94<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.679> say

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
think Weather Channel says 94 you say

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.770 
think Weather Channel says 94 you say
it's<00:00:13.950> 104<00:00:14.519> well<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.940> tell<00:00:15.150> me<00:00:15.269> what<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.450> says

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
it's 104 well you tell me what that says

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.369 
it's 104 well you tell me what that says
to<00:00:15.990> you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
to you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.750 
to you
yeah<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.400> about<00:00:17.550> 98<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.340> feels<00:00:20.580> like

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
yeah it's about 98 it just feels like

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.880 
yeah it's about 98 it just feels like
104<00:00:21.359> impacts<00:00:22.020> take<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> pieces<00:00:22.769> pieces<00:00:23.550> yeah

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
104 impacts take the pieces pieces yeah

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.669 
104 impacts take the pieces pieces yeah
hot<00:00:26.750> they<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:28.730> very<00:00:29.730> nice<00:00:29.939> tracing<00:00:30.560> very<00:00:31.560> good

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
hot they are very nice tracing very good

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
hot they are very nice tracing very good
have<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.830> done<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:31.980> before<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:33.110> yeah

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
have you done this before you know yeah

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
have you done this before you know yeah
have<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> made<00:00:35.130> those<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.460> turkeys<00:00:35.820> yeah

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
have you made those little turkeys yeah

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
have you made those little turkeys yeah
in<00:00:36.360> school<00:00:36.600> yeah<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.559> never<00:00:38.370> liked<00:00:38.579> those<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
in school yeah I never liked those I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.040 
in school yeah I never liked those I
didn't<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.300> anything<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.809> don't<00:00:39.989> look

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
didn't have anything they don't look

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.119 
didn't have anything they don't look
like<00:00:40.110> Turkey<00:00:40.559> it'll<00:00:40.739> look<00:00:40.800> anything<00:00:41.010> like

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
like Turkey it'll look anything like

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.319 
like Turkey it'll look anything like
turkeys<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.030> doing

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
turkeys now what are we doing

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.959 
turkeys now what are we doing
Tracey<00:00:43.110> why<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.010> doing<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.550> safe<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
Tracey why are we doing it so safe it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.180 
Tracey why are we doing it so safe it
expands<00:00:45.450> when<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.020> put<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> freezer<00:00:46.649> or

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
expands when we put it in the freezer or

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.440 
expands when we put it in the freezer or
contract<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.149> likely<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
contract which is a more likely to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 
contract which is a more likely to
expand<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:48.960> contract<00:00:49.050> contract<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.430> would

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
expand or contract contract I would

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
expand or contract contract I would
think<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.090> too<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.539> thought<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.350> not

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
think so too I thought is it it's not

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.139 
think so too I thought is it it's not
going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.430> figured<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> temperature

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
going to so we figured the temperature

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
going to so we figured the temperature
of<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.360> pieces<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.899> probably<00:00:55.199> 105<00:00:55.770> degrees

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
of these pieces is probably 105 degrees

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.459 
of these pieces is probably 105 degrees
one<00:00:56.640> more<00:00:56.820> no<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.840> probably<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.199> than<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
one more no I'm probably more than that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860 
one more no I'm probably more than that
which<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.070> hop<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.879> hope<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.570> than<00:01:00.750> you're

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
which is hop you hope more than you're

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:12.730 
which is hop you hope more than you're
ever<00:01:00.899> gonna<00:01:01.109> get<00:01:01.410> inside<00:01:01.620> someone's<00:01:02.309> home

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.460 

on<00:01:13.740> top<00:01:14.010> sure

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
on top sure

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.610 
on top sure
and<00:01:17.070> we'll<00:01:17.570> see<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.690> they've<00:01:18.840> resized<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.530> all

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
and we'll see if they've resized at all

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.870 
and we'll see if they've resized at all
how<00:01:20.400> long<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> think

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
how long do you think

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.460 
how long do you think
it's<00:01:22.210> gonna<00:01:22.420> take<00:01:22.660> about<00:01:22.750> an<00:01:22.930> hour<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.230> can

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
it's gonna take about an hour to can

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's gonna take about an hour to can
cool<00:01:23.740> down<00:01:23.770> okay<00:01:25.080> yeah<00:01:26.080> we're<00:01:26.290> about<00:01:26.410> four

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
cool down okay yeah we're about four

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.750 
cool down okay yeah we're about four
hours

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.530 

from<00:01:33.390> old<00:01:34.170> pieces<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:35.100> decided<00:01:35.820> 98<00:01:36.210> degrees

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
from old pieces up decided 98 degrees

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.980 
from old pieces up decided 98 degrees
right

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
right

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.550 
right
yeah<00:01:37.500> 98<00:01:37.950> degrees<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.030> found<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.230> would

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
yeah 98 degrees and then found I would

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
yeah 98 degrees and then found I would
say<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.160> little<00:01:41.520> freezing<00:01:41.760> negative

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
say that's a little freezing negative

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.010 
say that's a little freezing negative
for<00:01:43.110> sure<00:01:43.260> how<00:01:43.980> are<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.100> doing<00:01:44.370> on<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.610> one

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.810 

there's<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> line<00:01:49.410> going<00:01:49.800> around<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.280> yeah

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
there's the line going around it yeah

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.660 
there's the line going around it yeah
what<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.480> drew<00:01:51.780> yeah<00:01:52.440> that's<00:01:52.680> really<00:01:52.980> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
what you drew yeah that's really just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.970 
what you drew yeah that's really just
right<00:01:53.970> there's<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.600> much<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.590> different

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
right there's just much just different

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.510 
right there's just much just different
now

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
now

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.610 
now
well<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.150> doesn't<00:01:57.630> he<00:01:57.720> hasn't<00:01:58.230> directly

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
well then it doesn't he hasn't directly

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.380 
well then it doesn't he hasn't directly
half<00:01:58.770> an<00:01:58.890> inch<00:01:59.010> quarter<00:01:59.220> being<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.180> no

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
half an inch quarter being like that no

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.360 
half an inch quarter being like that no
and<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.170> wish<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.530> had<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> discernible

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
and I wish you had a discernible

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.610 
and I wish you had a discernible
expanding<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.480> retracting<00:02:03.570> nothing<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
expanding and retracting nothing that

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.230 
expanding and retracting nothing that
you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.830> really<00:02:05.010> see<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:06.120> we<00:02:06.210> are

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you can really see right and we are

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.090 
you can really see right and we are
talking<00:02:06.510> about<00:02:06.720> going<00:02:06.990> home<00:02:07.110> 98<00:02:07.590> degrees<00:02:07.890> down

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
talking about going home 98 degrees down

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.940 
talking about going home 98 degrees down
to<00:02:08.220> probably<00:02:08.610> 20<00:02:08.850> it's<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.869> no<00:02:09.960> expansion<00:02:10.230> yeah

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
to probably 20 it's a no expansion yeah

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
to probably 20 it's a no expansion yeah
no<00:02:11.190> no<00:02:11.610> contraction<00:02:12.150> nothing<00:02:12.960> excellent
