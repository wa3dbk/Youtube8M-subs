00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
bit and put out a little bit more damage

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.190 
bit and put out a little bit more damage
I<00:02:18.950> went<00:02:19.950> with<00:02:20.040> revenge<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.730> obviously<00:02:21.720> as

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
I went with revenge because obviously as

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.030 
I went with revenge because obviously as
tanks<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> still<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:22.829> to<00:02:22.860> worry<00:02:22.980> about

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
tanks you still want to worry about

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.119 
tanks you still want to worry about
damage<00:02:23.400> output<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.319> figure<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> 50<00:02:25.950> extra

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
damage output so I figure the 50 extra

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.190 
damage output so I figure the 50 extra
percent<00:02:26.730> damage<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.420> definitely<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> good

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
percent damage it's definitely a good

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.600 
percent damage it's definitely a good
increase<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.970> sight<00:02:30.329> um<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:31.140> think<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
increase in sight um I think that the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.309 
increase in sight um I think that the
talents<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:32.940> pretty<00:02:33.090> much<00:02:33.209> garbage<00:02:33.450> are<00:02:33.900> glyphs

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
talents a pretty much garbage are glyphs

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.050 
talents a pretty much garbage are glyphs
so<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.250> went<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.610> first<00:02:35.849> thing<00:02:35.970> that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
so I just went with the first thing that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.190 
so I just went with the first thing that
came<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.299> mind<00:02:36.450> i<00:02:36.569> figured<00:02:36.629> i<00:02:36.870> could<00:02:36.900> put<00:02:37.110> out

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
came to mind i figured i could put out

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.229 
came to mind i figured i could put out
damage<00:02:37.530> for<00:02:37.680> free<00:02:37.890> why<00:02:38.220> not<00:02:38.459> i'm<00:02:38.700> constantly

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
damage for free why not i'm constantly

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.819 
damage for free why not i'm constantly
want<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.450> reduce<00:02:39.629> damage<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.140> taken<00:02:40.440> why<00:02:40.680> not

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
want to reduce damage and taken why not

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.110 
want to reduce damage and taken why not
put<00:02:40.980> out<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.069> little<00:02:41.220> more<00:02:41.430> while<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.909> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
put out a little more while in the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.410 
put out a little more while in the
process<00:02:42.859> um<00:02:45.530> gemming<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.849> really<00:02:47.849> kind<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.239> just

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
process um gemming I really kind of just

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.869 
process um gemming I really kind of just
went<00:02:48.569> stand<00:02:48.900> when<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.049> have<00:02:49.409> the<00:02:49.560> gear<00:02:49.859> I<00:02:50.069> am

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
went stand when I have the gear I am

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.970 
went stand when I have the gear I am
actually<00:02:51.090> expertise<00:02:51.959> kept<00:02:52.290> as<00:02:52.530> well<00:02:52.709> as<00:02:52.829> it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
actually expertise kept as well as it

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.039 
actually expertise kept as well as it
kept<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.000> kind<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> gear<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.840> put<00:02:55.019> a

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
kept so I kind of have the gear to put a

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.629 
kept so I kind of have the gear to put a
fart<00:02:55.260> around<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.620> put<00:02:55.739> as<00:02:55.829> much<00:02:55.950> stamina<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.549> I

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
fart around and put as much stamina as I

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.039 
fart around and put as much stamina as I
can<00:02:56.879> um<00:02:58.609> but<00:02:59.609> if<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.970> don't<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.480> gear<00:03:00.659> to

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
can um but if you don't have the gear to

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.509 
can um but if you don't have the gear to
put<00:03:01.200> yourself<00:03:01.470> above<00:03:01.560> expertise<00:03:02.159> camp<00:03:02.400> I

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
put yourself above expertise camp I

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.949 
put yourself above expertise camp I
would<00:03:02.639> recommend<00:03:02.940> going<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.480> expertise

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
would recommend going the expertise

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.629 
would recommend going the expertise
build<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.409> putting<00:03:05.010> your<00:03:05.129> expertise<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.519> to

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
build and putting your expertise up to

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.180 
build and putting your expertise up to
fifteen<00:03:05.940> percent<00:03:06.269> um<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:07.680> maybe<00:03:07.859> suck

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
fifteen percent um and then maybe suck

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.149 
fifteen percent um and then maybe suck
enough<00:03:08.430> putting<00:03:08.639> some<00:03:08.790> stamina<00:03:09.079> mastery

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
enough putting some stamina mastery

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.470 
enough putting some stamina mastery
until<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:11.400> high-end<00:03:11.670> heroic<00:03:12.239> geared

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
until you get high-end heroic geared

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.509 
until you get high-end heroic geared
it's<00:03:12.690> pretty<00:03:13.019> much<00:03:13.139> garbage<00:03:13.409> for<00:03:13.739> us<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:14.340> does

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
it's pretty much garbage for us it does

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.039 
it's pretty much garbage for us it does
not<00:03:14.670> increase<00:03:14.879> our<00:03:15.060> block<00:03:15.329> but<00:03:15.569> increases<00:03:15.930> are

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
not increase our block but increases are

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.490 
not increase our block but increases are
critical<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.209> it's<00:03:18.209> pretty<00:03:18.750> slop<00:03:19.410> um<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:21.500> for

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
critical so it's pretty slop um and for

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.289 
critical so it's pretty slop um and for
rotation<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.160> could<00:03:23.370> really<00:03:23.519> just<00:03:23.639> recommend
