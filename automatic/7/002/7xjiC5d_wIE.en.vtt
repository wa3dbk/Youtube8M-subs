00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.079
 this river 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.370
 let's start 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.610
 good friends friends 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.890
 friend 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.630
 hey old I told you 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.350
 we even have a managua purchase 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.620
 they made a toast in layers and almost 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.070
 nothing you like more this has been good 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:46.420
 but they are a cup that I drink every 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.420
 more time but drink beer is bad 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.839
 delicious 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.659
 I invite you to that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.850
 he wants to be my boyfriend 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.520
 all right 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.520
 and that's a lot of cigar 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.290
 view 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:47.400
 and he kills her and now who can 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.400
 defend ourselves now or the movie with giant 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.900
 I have come to save the day and take 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.900
 beer is very bad 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.630
 just take a few complete accounts 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 to me what I am I have always 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.460
 known that it is better to take a bath 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.940
 water to drink a beer a beer 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.830
 They can be made even 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.720
 must finish 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.210
 that can cause problems and I 've 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.570
 spoken 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.790
 pÃ­pi we have beers someone buys 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.560
 half of all the beers they bring 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.730
 have 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:36.010
 and here is 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.010
 how is it criticizable in this cart 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.210
 now they came and I 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.280
 Y 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:02.050
 you have to ask a man who this 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.160
 Punch 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.160
 10 strikeouts 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.090
 already 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.629
 and exposes me 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.629
 and I guess it varies a little bit of punch 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.440
 and this punch tastes really good, let's try a 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.440
 little more a few drinks later 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:43.780
 If I have run out of all the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.780
 partridges except this but he 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.909
 and they finished it 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.829
 it has happened that because you have run out 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.499
 they believed that the tip 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.499
 street p 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.280
 as you can see the drunks come back 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.280
 very crazy shut up 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.360
 and he wants to be noble 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:32.360
 although it is a beautiful time because it is 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:37.300
 good but it happened pretty well the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.300
 tragedy with the boyfriend 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.920
 little drunk 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.600
 he grabbed his beer and threw him 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.120
 and then she decided to go back 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.169
 but he left 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.169
 and killed her 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.840
 with the invisible car 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:17.919
 and I was his will then 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:22.680
 decided to take more greens and realized 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.680
 that drunks are left alone 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:38.650
 a good account already the cups have passed 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:41.220
 more both streets to go down 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.220
 something bad 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:50.319
 listen to your conscience today.es 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.629
 look , we are all alone 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.719
 I am because I am your conscience you 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:01.589
 his best friend is all angry his girlfriend 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:07.400
 it's dead you realize what you've done 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:09.800
 skin street I do what I want 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.960
 but I am aware of what you have 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.090
 to let the birds do not want 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.530
 and after not leaving it comes back what 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.800
 it happened was 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:25.759
 he had vomited his stools 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.759
 it is the sixth 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.389
 Y 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.200
 all right 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:43.260
 and with some drinks 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:46.770
 and of efficiency he spoke I told him that 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.240
 you'll stop the beer and now you tell me 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.280
 we have to go is this I have spent and 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.260
 remember the beer can happen to them 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.420
 new forces this but can not 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.130
 pass them the one that does look worse so 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.130
 remember the beer is very bad 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.550
 I'm dead 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.460
 the beer is very bad so never 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.680
 also beer and if your parents come 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.419
 drink beer tell them to reflect 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.580
 about what it is good to take the 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.580
 company the best but not so much to his dad 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:33.220
 remember that if you want to finish as 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.450
 the 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.450
 I 'm not interested 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.540
 I notice 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.170
 i 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.170
 goodbye
