00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 I do not doubt that soon they will walk 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.080
 paulo victor in the brazilian team and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.330
 by the time he is living there 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.280
 I think exaggeration andrade thinks he can have 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.200
 this moment he can receive this 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
 opportunity as received by the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
 marcelo grohe who is a goalkeeper who 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 also emerged for the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 that he deserves for the moment that he is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
 living a goal today he has a lot of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.750
 trust him and say that he has 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.609
 two good that few goalkeepers only 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.590
 services that are our balls then 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 he discovered this opportunity 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 It's nice to solve the problem of the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.920
 who had a fierce crowd who 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.079
 Felipe is talking a lot as well. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 team is neither a goalkeeper nor a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.980
 hit the other side talk more 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.110
 property is the first year I think 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.700
 this is exaggeration to speak in selection already the self 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 I think he is he is exactly 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.739
 building this but it is a detail that the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.480
 board of the Flemish that comes 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.760
 about controversial issues and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.309
 actions involving black red have to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.360
 speak because you have already begun to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.879
 Flemish who is the knight who 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.340
 Flemish which is not true so it's more 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.580
 than just someone on the board 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.799
 coach on any bank the goalkeeper 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.939
 bruno coming is paulo vitor does not have 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.439
 that to evaluate does not have any of this 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.750
 unless it is true that I do not 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.860
 I believe it would be a nonsense would 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 surely not be that already has 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.630
 proposals, we do not know because it's 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.970
 in 2009 he happened the goalkeeper had the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.369
 bruno had marcelo lomba and I like 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.500
 his and the three goalkeepers is the fastest 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.960
 low the bar so much that he follow in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.020
 popular he trained by decom against the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.880
 adriano bets and records all bets and 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.220
 ended up annoying the adrian knows 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 so he always demonstrated on board with 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.360
 a very quick goalkeeper and is now 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 surprising to have that exit of the goal 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.189
 and work a lot at andrÃ© works 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.350
 big the strong ball knows what it is to lose 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.240
 the more secure you have to have the humility to 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.369
 my doubt is to train and third 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.259
 fifth goalkeeper but without giving up 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.570
 For example, he is now with 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.780
 Working 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.200
 the seller went to 4 in the third was so 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.390
 was provided solely for the dedication 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.040
 commitment to reach 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.040
 I think maybe
