00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.640
 hi everyone is falling apart i hope 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.900
 that you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.730
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.029
 little tutorial video tomorrow that still a 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.730
 times on i and this time leads to the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.349
 attack so frankly the spot 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.149
 I think you expect a little 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.399
 so we will simply place ourselves in 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.110
 starting in the corner that is works 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.870
 what is on your left forgiveness 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.660
 a lot of nothing complicated for what 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.770
 is the placement of the tomahawk momentum with 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.129
 the red marker shows you that it takes 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.880
 put the bottom of your benchmark at the level 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.100
 of this kind of small beam and the 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.500
 stick it to movies with electrical wires 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.700
 have learned more than to jump so 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.050
 do not forget to skip what it is 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.240
 super important otherwise you will not touch 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.950
 the enemy you wish to launch 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.680
 and there you do a lil he 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.450
 friendly early in the game 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.510
 so what about 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:10.280
 from the trajectory of the nasty tomahawk that 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.280
 it goes up it goes up it's still a 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.220
 once a tone when is nigh scared he goes 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.690
 just go tickle the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.729
 skull of our enemy so you see 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.020
 that he is he is crouching so you in 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.820
 do not it seems a tomahawk pole 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.830
 but he will touch any enemy even 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.340
 squatting situ that is at his place 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.690
 there so it's really a very good spot 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.910
 and you to prove to yourself that it works 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.610
 so here it was the first run 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.229
 of the game and in the second run 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.810
 I made my little son friendly me 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.810
 am placed 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.100
 we're here again and here we are 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.450
 did not address first without but 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.010
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.360
 will have more than that will help you do 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.360
 a few frags hi everyone
