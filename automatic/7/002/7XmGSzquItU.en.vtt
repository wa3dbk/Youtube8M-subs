what
it's<00:01:16.220> may<00:01:17.030> have<00:01:17.240> been<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:19.220> lot<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.700> people

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
it's may have been and a lot of people

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.630 
it's may have been and a lot of people
believe<00:01:22.730> that's<00:01:23.090> he<00:01:23.780> based<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.260> off<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.640> wine

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
believe that's he based it off of wine

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.360 
believe that's he based it off of wine
fest<00:01:25.970> which<00:01:26.360> was<00:01:27.340> available<00:01:29.140> locally<00:01:30.160> in<00:01:31.160> mine

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
fest which was available locally in mine

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.610 
fest which was available locally in mine
system<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.410> I<00:01:34.270> faced<00:01:35.270> my<00:01:35.600> press<00:01:35.900> on<00:01:36.290> that

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
system and I faced my press on that

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.150 
system and I faced my press on that
principle<00:01:37.160> because<00:01:38.710> starting<00:01:39.710> from<00:01:39.890> scratch

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
principle because starting from scratch

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.620 
principle because starting from scratch
like<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:41.090> know<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:41.510> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
like you know this is like the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.780 
like you know this is like the
first-ever<00:01:41.990> printing<00:01:42.770> press<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.290> he<00:01:45.790> might

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
first-ever printing press and he might

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.820 
first-ever printing press and he might
have<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.420> he<00:01:47.660> was<00:01:47.780> limited<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.290> budget<00:01:48.680> as

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
have and he was limited on budget as

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.000 
have and he was limited on budget as
well<00:01:48.980> so<00:01:49.930> he<00:01:50.930> might<00:01:51.080> have<00:01:51.290> just<00:01:51.560> gone<00:01:51.740> with

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
well so he might have just gone with

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.560 
well so he might have just gone with
what<00:01:52.250> was<00:01:52.490> available<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.100> what<00:01:55.570> craftsmen

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
what was available and what craftsmen

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.010 
what was available and what craftsmen
were<00:01:56.780> done<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.460> workshop<00:01:58.880> there<00:01:59.660> was

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
were done of the workshop there was

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.770 
were done of the workshop there was
making<00:02:00.380> already<00:02:00.740> which<00:02:01.010> was<00:02:01.450> wine<00:02:02.450> pressed

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
making already which was wine pressed

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.530 
making already which was wine pressed
paper<00:02:03.650> pressed<00:02:04.040> linen<00:02:04.760> press<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:07.360> based<00:02:08.360> on

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
paper pressed linen press and I based on

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.590 
paper pressed linen press and I based on
to<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.500> obviously<00:02:10.130> just<00:02:10.550> with<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> slight

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
to that and obviously just with a slight

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.590 
to that and obviously just with a slight
modification<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:12.620> those<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:14.210> can<00:02:14.390> have<00:02:14.570> a

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
modification to those you can have a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.090 
modification to those you can have a
printing<00:02:15.020> press<00:02:15.200> because<00:02:15.500> they<00:02:15.650> all<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.950> use

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
printing press because they all have use

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.020 
printing press because they all have use
the<00:02:16.250> same<00:02:16.430> principle<00:02:18.910> moving<00:02:19.910> Clapton<00:02:20.870> down

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
the same principle moving Clapton down

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.910 
the same principle moving Clapton down
using<00:02:23.030> screw<00:02:25.330> with<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.480> small<00:02:26.959> modification

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
using screw with the small modification

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.340 
using screw with the small modification
such<00:02:28.160> as

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.620 

two<00:02:32.920> out<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.340> our<00:02:33.490> modification<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.300> prevent

two out of our modification to prevent

two out of our modification to prevent
the<00:02:34.780> patent<00:02:35.200> from<00:02:35.380> spinning<00:02:36.630> he<00:02:37.630> got<00:02:38.260> his

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
the patent from spinning he got his

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.150 
the patent from spinning he got his
verdict<00:02:39.370> pressed<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:40.600> little<00:02:41.350> bit<00:02:41.470> crude<00:02:41.770> but

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
verdict pressed a little bit crude but

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.550 
verdict pressed a little bit crude but
it<00:02:42.520> still<00:02:42.850> functions<00:02:43.980> more<00:02:44.980> or<00:02:45.100> less<00:02:45.780> same

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.260 

yeah<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:51.070> group<00:02:51.340> which<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.060> most

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
yeah this group which is the most

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.680 
yeah this group which is the most
important<00:02:52.930> thing<00:02:53.170> for<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.890> press<00:02:56.040> basically

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
important thing for a press basically

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.760 
important thing for a press basically
what<00:02:58.690> they<00:02:58.840> would<00:02:59.020> have<00:02:59.050> done<00:02:59.140> at<00:02:59.440> what<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.590> did

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
what they would have done at what I did

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.390 
what they would have done at what I did
was<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.880> start<00:03:01.150> off<00:03:01.210> with<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.510> would

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
was you start off with the would

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.720 
was you start off with the would
typically<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:04.530> either<00:03:05.530> square<00:03:05.890> or<00:03:06.040> round

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
typically it's either square or round

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.770 
typically it's either square or round
but<00:03:07.060> as<00:03:07.210> there<00:03:07.540> would<00:03:07.720> be<00:03:07.780> therapist<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.750> know

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
but as there would be therapist you know

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.720 
but as there would be therapist you know
they<00:03:10.960> would<00:03:11.110> penetrate<00:03:11.800> which<00:03:12.250> would<00:03:12.460> be<00:03:12.580> like

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
they would penetrate which would be like

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.760 
they would penetrate which would be like
this<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.450> was<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:13.720> cut<00:03:13.900> off<00:03:13.990> smaller

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
this and it was just cut off smaller

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.620 
this and it was just cut off smaller
slot<00:03:16.860> pieces<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:17.980> wood<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.390> they<00:03:19.390> would<00:03:19.540> have

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
slot pieces of wood and they would have

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.860 
slot pieces of wood and they would have
put<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.900> into<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> leaf<00:03:20.590> or<00:03:21.600> they<00:03:22.600> would<00:03:22.750> have

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
put it into a leaf or they would have

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.960 
put it into a leaf or they would have
used<00:03:23.670> either<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.760> free<00:03:25.390> fly<00:03:26.170> wheel<00:03:26.700> late<00:03:27.700> or

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
used either a free fly wheel late or

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.220 
used either a free fly wheel late or
spring<00:03:28.750> blue

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
spring blue

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.280 
spring blue
it's<00:03:29.740> like<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.860> medieval<00:03:30.100> version<00:03:30.520> very<00:03:31.290> crude

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
it's like a medieval version very crude

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.650 
it's like a medieval version very crude
but<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.770> still<00:03:33.100> gets<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.910> job<00:03:34.090> done<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.450> what

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
but it still gets the job done and what

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.150 
but it still gets the job done and what
it<00:03:34.750> does<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.160> makes<00:03:36.300> square<00:03:37.300> parts<00:03:37.720> round<00:03:38.230> cuts

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
it does is makes square parts round cuts

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.420 
it does is makes square parts round cuts
of<00:03:39.280> Li<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:42.340> do<00:03:42.460> the<00:03:42.930> threads<00:03:44.040> that's<00:03:45.040> a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
of Li and to do the threads that's a

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.550 
of Li and to do the threads that's a
very<00:03:45.970> tricky<00:03:46.510> thing<00:03:48.090> there<00:03:49.090> are<00:03:49.320> several<00:03:50.320> ways

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
very tricky thing there are several ways

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.480 
very tricky thing there are several ways
of<00:03:50.740> doing<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.430> can<00:03:51.880> either<00:03:52.380> draw<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.440> on<00:03:53.590> by

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
of doing it you can either draw it on by

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.350 
of doing it you can either draw it on by
hand<00:03:54.760> using<00:03:56.310> like<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.340> ruler<00:03:57.730> with<00:03:57.790> an<00:03:58.000> angle

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
hand using like a ruler with an angle

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.450 
hand using like a ruler with an angle
and<00:03:58.810> that's<00:03:58.990> sort<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.230> like<00:03:59.290> rotating<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.430> a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
and that's sort of like rotating it a

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.030 
and that's sort of like rotating it a
little<00:04:00.610> bit<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.820> enjoyment

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
little bit of enjoyment

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.710 
little bit of enjoyment
you<00:04:03.340> know<00:04:03.599> but<00:04:04.599> that's<00:04:05.849> completely<00:04:06.849> accurate

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
you know but that's completely accurate

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.240 
you know but that's completely accurate
and<00:04:09.840> from<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.049> they<00:04:11.260> would<00:04:11.470> have<00:04:11.620> then<00:04:11.950> just

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
and from that they would have then just

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.330 
and from that they would have then just
used<00:04:12.879> carpenter<00:04:13.480> tools<00:04:13.689> and<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:14.129> carve<00:04:15.129> out

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
used carpenter tools and just carve out

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.840 
used carpenter tools and just carve out
like<00:04:15.579> a<00:04:15.610> groove

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
like a groove

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.469 
like a groove
do<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.940> want<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.150> explain<00:04:19.739> why<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:21.270> oh<00:04:22.270> yeah

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
do you want to explain why this oh yeah

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.129 
do you want to explain why this oh yeah
normally<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:26.620> printer<00:04:27.010> would<00:04:27.160> stand<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:28.139> the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
normally the printer would stand on the

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.439 
normally the printer would stand on the
opposite<00:04:29.590> side<00:04:29.940> because<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.120> know<00:04:31.180> there<00:04:31.360> was

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
opposite side because you know there was

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.040 
opposite side because you know there was
this<00:04:31.539> thing<00:04:31.780> about<00:04:31.810> being<00:04:32.620> right-handed<00:04:33.990> at<00:04:34.990> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
this thing about being right-handed at a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.939 
this thing about being right-handed at a
time<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.780> handed<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:37.990> not<00:04:38.650> really<00:04:38.919> a

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
time and that handed is not really a

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.490 
time and that handed is not really a
good<00:04:39.430> thing<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:40.720> but<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.860> am<00:04:42.370> left-handed<00:04:43.500> so

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
good thing so but I am left-handed so

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.790 
good thing so but I am left-handed so
when<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.400> made<00:04:45.699> this<00:04:45.940> proof<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.690> sort<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.530> made

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
when I made this proof I sort of made

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.210 
when I made this proof I sort of made
according<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.370> my<00:04:52.470> how<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.530> naturally<00:04:53.830> would

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
according to my how you naturally would

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.360 
according to my how you naturally would
yeah<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.199> by<00:04:56.199> time<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:56.620> finished<00:04:57.130> with<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
yeah and by time I finished with the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.490 
yeah and by time I finished with the
school<00:04:57.669> I<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.389> put<00:04:58.990> everything<00:04:59.229> together

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
school I and put everything together

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.189 
school I and put everything together
I've<00:05:00.100> just<00:05:00.550> noticed<00:05:00.910> that<00:05:01.030> it's<00:05:01.449> going<00:05:02.050> down

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
I've just noticed that it's going down

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.400 
I've just noticed that it's going down
away<00:05:02.970> because<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.000> printed<00:05:04.780> if<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.169> printer

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
away because I printed if the printer

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.740 
away because I printed if the printer
was<00:05:05.500> there<00:05:05.770> pulling<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.669> platen<00:05:07.449> would<00:05:07.570> just

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
was there pulling the platen would just

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.710 
was there pulling the platen would just
screw<00:05:07.900> up<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.500> want<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:08.710> go<00:05:08.800> down<00:05:08.979> so

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
screw up and you want to go down so

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.129 
screw up and you want to go down so
Emma's<00:05:10.720> for<00:05:10.900> just<00:05:11.050> illustration<00:05:11.740> I<00:05:13.139> just

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
Emma's for just illustration I just

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.740 
Emma's for just illustration I just
stopped<00:05:14.349> it<00:05:14.470> as<00:05:14.590> is

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.470 

again<00:05:18.500> usually<00:05:18.860> takes<00:05:19.130> about<00:05:19.270> two<00:05:20.270> or<00:05:20.450> three

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
again usually takes about two or three

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.830 
again usually takes about two or three
to<00:05:20.900> get<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.110> ink

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.659 

but<00:05:27.380> they<00:05:27.500> wouldn't<00:05:27.770> have<00:05:27.889> wanted<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.490> waste

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
but they wouldn't have wanted to waste

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:36.129 
but they wouldn't have wanted to waste
too<00:05:28.880> much<00:05:28.910> paper<00:05:29.330> because<00:05:33.490> it's<00:05:34.490> still<00:05:35.139> even

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
too much paper because it's still even

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.780 
too much paper because it's still even
in<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:37.270> books<00:05:38.270> today

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
in the books today

00:05:39.790 --> 00:06:05.219 
in the books today
paper<00:05:40.790> is<00:05:41.120> one<00:05:41.449> of<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.660> most<00:05:41.979> expensive

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.260 

so<00:06:05.740> in<00:06:05.830> our<00:06:05.949> last<00:06:06.189> demonstration<00:06:06.580> we<00:06:07.090> had

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
so in our last demonstration we had

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.519 
so in our last demonstration we had
problems<00:06:08.199> with<00:06:08.669> this<00:06:09.669> particular<00:06:10.240> form<00:06:12.060> where

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
problems with this particular form where

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.820 
problems with this particular form where
the<00:06:14.529> type<00:06:14.889> was<00:06:15.189> not<00:06:15.219> picking<00:06:15.909> up<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:17.590> ink

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
the type was not picking up the the ink

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.540 
the type was not picking up the the ink
as<00:06:18.009> well<00:06:18.039> and<00:06:19.620> one<00:06:20.620> of<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.860> things<00:06:21.099> to

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
as well and one of the things to

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.360 
as well and one of the things to
compensate<00:06:22.120> for<00:06:22.300> that<00:06:22.360> is<00:06:22.930> doing<00:06:23.529> what<00:06:23.740> Emery

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
compensate for that is doing what Emery

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.519 
compensate for that is doing what Emery
has<00:06:24.520> just<00:06:24.759> done<00:06:24.909> and<00:06:25.120> putting<00:06:25.330> a<00:06:25.659> little<00:06:26.169> strip

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
has just done and putting a little strip
