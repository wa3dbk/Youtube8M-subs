on this side the customer would

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.910 
on this side the customer would
introduce<00:03:48.790> virgin<00:03:49.540> material<00:03:49.990> which<00:03:50.560> may<00:03:50.740> be<00:03:50.800> a

single component or maybe a blend and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.110 
single component or maybe a blend and
the<00:03:53.890> Virgin<00:03:54.340> travels<00:03:54.910> down<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.570> arm<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.530> is

the Virgin travels down this arm and is

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.790 
the Virgin travels down this arm and is

mixed with the fluff that comes down the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.590 
mixed with the fluff that comes down the
auger<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.370> whole<00:04:01.440> trim<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:03.600> recaptured

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
auger and the whole trim is recaptured

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.060 
auger and the whole trim is recaptured
into<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.870> extrusion<00:04:05.110> process<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.860> it's<00:04:06.010> a

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
into the extrusion process so it's a

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.180 
into the extrusion process so it's a
closed-loop<00:04:06.370> system<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:08.650> an<00:04:08.800> inexpensive

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
closed-loop system it's an inexpensive

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.850 
closed-loop system it's an inexpensive
solution<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:10.380> capture<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.470> trim<00:04:11.710> of<00:04:11.830> the

know how fast the material is coming out

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.740 
know how fast the material is coming out
and<00:05:23.290> with<00:05:23.860> these<00:05:24.100> two<00:05:24.430> measurements<00:05:24.820> the
