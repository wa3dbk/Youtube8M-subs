00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
milliampere so that should that should

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.520 
milliampere so that should that should
charge<00:04:10.209> pretty<00:04:10.570> fast<00:04:10.810> which<00:04:11.080> is<00:04:11.110> actually

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
charge pretty fast which is actually

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.110 
charge pretty fast which is actually
important<00:04:11.980> because<00:04:12.040> when<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.820> have<00:04:13.000> these

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
important because when you have these

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.750 
important because when you have these
massive<00:04:13.420> batteries<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.290> 2000<00:04:15.160> find<00:04:15.640> in

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
massive batteries of 2000 find in

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.880 
massive batteries of 2000 find in
milliampere<00:04:16.269> etc<00:04:16.720> quick<00:04:17.169> charging<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.709> very

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
milliampere etc quick charging is very

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.380 
milliampere etc quick charging is very
important<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.489> also<00:04:18.789> pretty<00:04:19.090> much<00:04:19.299> the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
important this is also pretty much the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.000 
important this is also pretty much the
same<00:04:19.539> accessories<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.080> comes<00:04:20.440> with<00:04:20.560> rest

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
same accessories that comes with rest

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.050 
same accessories that comes with rest
and<00:04:21.100> there's<00:04:21.610> a<00:04:21.700> micro<00:04:22.230> there's<00:04:23.230> a<00:04:23.290> microUSB

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
and there's a micro there's a microUSB

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.220 
and there's a micro there's a microUSB
called<00:04:25.060> for<00:04:25.330> charging<00:04:25.720> as<00:04:25.840> well<00:04:25.990> as<00:04:26.080> for

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
called for charging as well as for

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.140 
called for charging as well as for
connecting<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.010> overall<00:04:27.280> pretty<00:04:27.670> much<00:04:27.850> a

connecting so overall pretty much a
similar<00:04:28.900> same<00:04:29.200> package<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:29.980> get<00:04:30.190> with

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
similar same package that you get with

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.820 
similar same package that you get with
the<00:04:31.390> z10<00:04:31.810> except<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.200> back<00:04:32.380> blackberry

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the z10 except the back blackberry

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.290 
the z10 except the back blackberry
hasn't<00:04:33.130> really<00:04:33.310> screamed<00:04:33.700> on<00:04:33.940> any<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.270> that

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
hasn't really screamed on any of that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.980 
hasn't really screamed on any of that
and<00:04:34.630> from<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.410> first<00:04:35.650> looks<00:04:35.920> of<00:04:36.640> this<00:04:36.940> unit<00:04:37.870> of

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
and from the first looks of this unit of

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.140 
and from the first looks of this unit of
the<00:04:38.440> z3<00:04:38.890> doesn't<00:04:39.550> seem<00:04:39.730> like<00:04:39.970> they've

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
the z3 doesn't seem like they've

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.910 
the z3 doesn't seem like they've
stripped<00:04:40.390> on<00:04:40.600> materials<00:04:41.050> either<00:04:41.200> this<00:04:41.560> one

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
stripped on materials either this one

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.970 
stripped on materials either this one
seems<00:04:42.700> very<00:04:43.420> very<00:04:43.600> solid<00:04:44.020> I'm<00:04:44.290> really<00:04:44.830> really

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
seems very very solid I'm really really

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.190 
seems very very solid I'm really really
impressed<00:04:45.180> with<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.270> build<00:04:46.390> quality<00:04:46.570> on<00:04:47.050> this

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
impressed with the build quality on this

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.740 
impressed with the build quality on this
one<00:04:47.440> but<00:04:47.950> more<00:04:48.250> on<00:04:48.370> that<00:04:48.400> later<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.910> closer<00:04:49.510> to

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
one but more on that later a closer to

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.440 
one but more on that later a closer to
when<00:04:49.900> we<00:04:50.020> have<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.350> actual<00:04:50.740> unit<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:52.150> can

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
when we have the actual unit and can

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.270 
when we have the actual unit and can
actually<00:04:52.660> try<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.050> out<00:04:53.290> let's<00:04:53.560> see<00:04:53.680> how<00:04:53.800> the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
actually try it out let's see how the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.880 
actually try it out let's see how the
1.5<00:04:54.820> gb<00:04:55.150> ram<00:04:55.300> for<00:04:55.600> instance<00:04:55.990> performs<00:04:56.740> as

1.5 gb ram for instance performs as

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.320 
1.5 gb ram for instance performs as
