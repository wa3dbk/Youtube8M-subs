00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
him down to the mat as I go back side

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.499 
him down to the mat as I go back side
right<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:40.189> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.430> reverse<00:01:41.790> side<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.329> that

right there on the reverse side of that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.889 
right there on the reverse side of that
or<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.619> guess<00:01:44.280> another<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> say<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.420> if

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
or I guess another way to say that is if

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.620 
or I guess another way to say that is if
we<00:01:46.140> hit<00:01:46.549> then<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.880> both<00:01:48.149> hands<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.600> the
