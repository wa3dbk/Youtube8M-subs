00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.780
 good afternoon today we will tell you about 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.360
 little stainless steel handy knife here 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.139
 the first thing to pay attention to and sizes in 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.119
 assembled here so that forever it is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.690
 assembled like this in packed 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.990
 the form 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.900
 for scale, here we use a pack of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.119
 matches you can see that there are literally 10-12 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 centimeters 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.740
 the whole package weighs 320 grams like this 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.740
 packaged 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.050
 our stove is a timpan made of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.070
 stainless steel thickness of 1 millimeter 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.870
 Here we show such records 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.309
 dividers 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 which is set so that later 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.210
 could have been on top of the divider and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.219
 convenient to set the mug and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.219
 and oh his little kitty heater 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 kindling our stove will produce 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.930
 using small pieces of paper 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 such schools kan which we will throw 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:23.270
 inward and then we will quietly 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.270
 add a little wood 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.899
 So let's turn it around so that the wind blows it. 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.899
 our paper better burning 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.359
 on this side you see there is a hole 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.900
 which allows us to add too 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.900
 humanely 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.099
 add a little bit along with the paper 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.099
 firewood 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.730
 yes the stove gets hot 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.450
 firewood can be added bold and for some reason 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.500
 what is the temperature of the wood 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.959
 burns well the dignity of this stove 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.660
 will be in one more thing is that 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.660
 she is less whimsical to 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.130
 wood moisture if pyrolysis 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.080
 the stoves are such a timper they require 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 only dry fuel in principle this 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.519
 stove due to the fact that large 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.170
 the number of holes the wood burns 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:58.230
 faster then you can ignite even raw 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.230
 wood 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.519
 here we have the stove goes to mode 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.360
 wood gets hotter we can 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.360
 add there such chips and 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 more 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:35.479
 paper in fact can already 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.320
 for ignition and not throw well 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.389
 warmed up 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.430
 the stove burns steadily large enough 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.310
 power see what kind of flame 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.710
 as it warmed up, coals were already formed 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.389
 there it will be possible on top 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.090
 put some capacity water and and 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:58.419
 warm up and add a little bit there 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:02.419
 sprigs cones all sorts of small sticks 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.520
 boil water to boil 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.770
 large amounts of water and cook 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.150
 You can offer just such a model 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:14.090
 with larger sizes somewhere 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.419
 three times it is more so that you 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.949
 presented here the dimensions of this stove 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:25.880
 then again put boxes with 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:31.250
 matches if it's 5 centimeters you 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:34.970
 approximately width length width this is 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.110
 about 15 cm height is like 18 cm then 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.479
 there is such a stove can already afford to 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.960
 put more fuel and accordingly 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.320
 faster warm your water kettles in 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.320
 pot
