00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.490 

this<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.460> looks<00:00:02.760> at<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:03.480> can<00:00:03.750> use<00:00:04.259> the

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
this video looks at how we can use the

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.639 
this video looks at how we can use the
mean<00:00:05.150> which<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.359> type<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.600> average<00:00:07.020> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
mean which is a type of average to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:17.570 
mean which is a type of average to
compare<00:00:08.420> two<00:00:09.420> sets<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:10.759> data<00:00:16.220> now<00:00:17.220> suppose<00:00:17.550> we

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
compare two sets of data now suppose we

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.560 
compare two sets of data now suppose we
know<00:00:17.880> two<00:00:18.420> sets<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.020> scores<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.340> test<00:00:20.609> jacks

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
know two sets of scores in a test jacks

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.420 
know two sets of scores in a test jacks
and<00:00:22.220> Simon's<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:24.439> we<00:00:25.439> want<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> find<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.130> who

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and Simon's and we want to find out who

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.679 
and Simon's and we want to find out who
does<00:00:26.609> better<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.119> average<00:00:28.640> now<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:30.150> way<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.420> do

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
does better on average now one way to do

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.870 
does better on average now one way to do
this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> find<00:00:31.769> what's<00:00:31.980> called<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.489> meme

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this is to find what's called the meme

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.240 
this is to find what's called the meme
and<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> add<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.719> each<00:00:37.250> of

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and to do that we have to add up each of

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.130 
and to do that we have to add up each of
the<00:00:38.670> scores<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:40.350> add<00:00:40.879> up<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.329> numbers<00:00:43.730> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
the scores so add up the numbers and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:01:00.230 
the scores so add up the numbers and
then<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.260> divide<00:00:46.440> by<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.600> number<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:49.110> numbers

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.820 

so<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.440> Jack's<00:01:01.710> average

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.270 

he's<00:01:06.370> got<00:01:06.490> four<00:01:06.790> scores<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:08.200> we<00:01:08.320> do<00:01:08.440> five<00:01:08.770> plus

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
he's got four scores so we do five plus

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.410 
he's got four scores so we do five plus
six<00:01:09.610> plus<00:01:09.940> five<00:01:10.390> plus<00:01:10.930> eight<00:01:15.060> there<00:01:16.060> are<00:01:16.120> four

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
six plus five plus eight there are four

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.380 
six plus five plus eight there are four
scores<00:01:16.900> there<00:01:17.170> so<00:01:17.800> divided<00:01:18.570> by<00:01:19.680> 4<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.700> 5<00:01:22.000> plus<00:01:22.030> 6

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
scores there so divided by 4 so 5 plus 6

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.740 
scores there so divided by 4 so 5 plus 6
11<00:01:23.110> 16<00:01:24.070> 24<00:01:25.590> 24<00:01:26.590> /<00:01:27.550> form<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.710> is<00:01:29.740> six<00:01:30.750> so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
11 16 24 24 / form which is six so

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.200 
11 16 24 24 / form which is six so
Jack's<00:01:32.080> average<00:01:32.860> or<00:01:33.130> mean<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:34.140> six<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:37.000> let

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
Jack's average or mean is six now let

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.280 
Jack's average or mean is six now let
Simon<00:01:40.860> he's<00:01:41.860> got<00:01:42.070> 9<00:01:42.280> 35<00:01:42.940> and<00:01:43.180> five<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:44.110> we<00:01:44.140> do

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
Simon he's got 9 35 and five so we do

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.600 
Simon he's got 9 35 and five so we do
nine<00:01:44.560> plus<00:01:45.430> three<00:01:45.490> plus<00:01:46.120> five<00:01:46.780> plus<00:01:47.200> five

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
nine plus three plus five plus five

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120 
nine plus three plus five plus five
again<00:01:48.610> there<00:01:48.940> are<00:01:49.000> only<00:01:49.060> four<00:01:49.420> scores<00:01:49.780> there

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
again there are only four scores there

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.330 
again there are only four scores there
so<00:01:51.130> /<00:01:53.640> 49<00:01:54.640> plus<00:01:54.850> 3<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.300> 12<00:01:55.900> plus<00:01:56.740> 5<00:01:57.040> plus<00:01:57.070> 5<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.610> 22

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
so / 49 plus 3 is 12 plus 5 plus 5 is 22

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.070 
so / 49 plus 3 is 12 plus 5 plus 5 is 22
/<00:02:00.340> form<00:02:01.260> which<00:02:02.260> is<00:02:04.170> 5.5<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.670> Jack's<00:02:07.210> mean<00:02:07.690> is

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
/ form which is 5.5 so Jack's mean is

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.229 
/ form which is 5.5 so Jack's mean is
higher<00:02:08.440> than<00:02:08.649> signs<00:02:09.010> of<00:02:09.369> me<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.929> average

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
higher than signs of me so on average

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.990 
higher than signs of me so on average
using<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.330> mean<00:02:13.920> Jack<00:02:14.920> does<00:02:15.550> better

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.710 

now<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.370> second<00:02:22.730> example<00:02:22.850> we<00:02:23.450> have

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
now that in the second example we have

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.670 
now that in the second example we have
10<00:02:24.140> pupils<00:02:24.560> who<00:02:25.430> do<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.880> test<00:02:26.480> their<00:02:27.290> scores

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
10 pupils who do a test their scores

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.450 
10 pupils who do a test their scores
range<00:02:28.070> from<00:02:28.130> five<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:29.150> eight<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:31.160> shows

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
range from five to eight and this shows

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.660 
range from five to eight and this shows
that<00:02:31.790> three<00:02:32.570> people<00:02:32.600> got<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.500> score<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:34.010> 5-2

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that three people got a score of 5-2

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.500 
that three people got a score of 5-2
people<00:02:35.630> Scott<00:02:36.530> six<00:02:36.890> for<00:02:37.580> people<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.240> scroll

plus 4 plus 1 is 10 7/10 we then work

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.789 
plus 4 plus 1 is 10 7/10 we then work
out<00:03:20.180> each<00:03:20.480> part<00:03:20.959> separately<00:03:21.410> some<00:03:21.860> 35<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.520> 15

and then add it together 10 20 30 40

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.850 
and then add it together 10 20 30 40
4856<00:03:42.220> 5863<00:03:43.750> all<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.110> matter<00:03:45.260> by<00:03:45.380> 10<00:03:45.650> and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
4856 5863 all the matter by 10 and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.490 
4856 5863 all the matter by 10 and
divide<00:03:46.700> by<00:03:46.730> 10<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.630> just<00:03:47.840> get<00:03:48.760> 6.3<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
divide by 10 we just get 6.3 so the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.170 
divide by 10 we just get 6.3 so the
class<00:03:51.739> average<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.540> six<00:03:53.540> point<00:03:53.840> three<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:55.180> of

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
class average is six point three and of

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.819 
class average is six point three and of
course<00:03:56.209> if<00:03:56.630> we<00:03:56.840> turn<00:03:57.079> back<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.590> first

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
course if we turn back to the first

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.670 
course if we turn back to the first
example<00:03:58.340> if<00:03:58.519> these<00:03:59.150> two<00:03:59.480> pupils<00:03:59.840> were<00:04:00.230> part<00:04:00.530> of
