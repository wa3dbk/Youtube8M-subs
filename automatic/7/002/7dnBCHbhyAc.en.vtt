00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
fountain of healing i'm not sure what

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.250 
fountain of healing i'm not sure what
he's<00:00:47.730> doing<00:00:47.940> okay<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.450> he<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.989> he<00:00:49.140> had<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
he's doing okay now he there he had a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.430 
he's doing okay now he there he had a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
cell for his blade master so that makes

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.760 
cell for his blade master so that makes
more<00:00:52.559> sense<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:54.050> Sonic's<00:00:55.050> ancient<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> war<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
more sense now Sonic's ancient of war is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
more sense now Sonic's ancient of war is
going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> spot<00:00:56.219> grubby's<00:00:57.120> army<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
going to spot grubby's army and this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.549 
going to spot grubby's army and this
coming<00:00:58.410> down<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.770> his<00:00:59.399> side<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> map<00:01:00.559> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
coming down to his side of the map and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.990 
coming down to his side of the map and
so<00:01:01.710> grubby<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.219> making<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so grubby is making a little bit of a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.189 
so grubby is making a little bit of a
risky<00:01:03.270> move<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.600> opinion<00:01:03.809> by<00:01:03.960> creeping

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
risky move in my opinion by creeping

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
risky move in my opinion by creeping
this<00:01:04.350> camp<00:01:04.559> he<00:01:04.680> made<00:01:04.830> he<00:01:05.549> could<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:05.970> easily

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this camp he made he could very easily

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
this camp he made he could very easily
get<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> act<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:06.900> he<00:01:07.020> knows<00:01:07.170> he's<00:01:07.380> scouted

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
get to act here he knows he's scouted

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.020 
get to act here he knows he's scouted
i'm<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:07.950> sure<00:01:08.070> why<00:01:08.189> he's<00:01:08.310> doing<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.549> his

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
i'm not sure why he's doing this his

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
i'm not sure why he's doing this his
blade<00:01:09.299> master<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.659> quite<00:01:09.869> low<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> he<00:01:10.830> will

another 350 gold for that creeping and I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
another 350 gold for that creeping and I
don't<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:41.909> worth<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.420> him<00:01:42.509> his

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
don't think it was worth it for him his

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
um and if he gets a I would say that if

he gets a scroll of restoration that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.520 
he gets a scroll of restoration that
would<00:02:20.739> be<00:02:20.860> huge<00:02:21.489> in<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:21.910> game<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.260> mean

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
would be huge in this game the I mean

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.920 
would be huge in this game the I mean
that's<00:02:23.830> always<00:02:24.220> huge<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.840> would

that's always huge but that would

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.059 
that's always huge but that would
probably<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:26.290> enough<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.620> win<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.950> game

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
probably be enough to win in the game

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.220 
probably be enough to win in the game
right<00:02:27.220> away<00:02:27.930> stone<00:02:28.930> token<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.440> not<00:02:29.620> quite<00:02:29.800> uh

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
keep him in the game I think sonic

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.560 
keep him in the game I think sonic
probably<00:06:27.710> knows<00:06:27.890> where<00:06:28.070> this<00:06:28.160> shop<00:06:28.370> is<00:06:28.610> so

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
probably knows where this shop is so

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.880 
probably knows where this shop is so
we'll<00:06:29.720> see<00:06:29.840> Oh<00:06:29.870> grubby<00:06:30.260> actually<00:06:30.560> sending<00:06:30.770> out

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
we'll see Oh grubby actually sending out

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.200 
we'll see Oh grubby actually sending out
another<00:06:31.040> pee<00:06:31.280> on<00:06:31.400> maybe<00:06:31.550> he'll<00:06:31.790> set<00:06:31.910> up<00:06:31.940> a<00:06:32.060> main

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
another pee on maybe he'll set up a main

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.100 
another pee on maybe he'll set up a main
