00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.380
 Nail tutorial and then I found it on 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 Internet a super cool, but I 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.660
 I adapted it the way I did. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.970
 changes but it is in the newspaper areas 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.279
 that you are not there already 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 Sometimes some photos you follow 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.039
 In instagram they already gave interviews that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.380
 you do not follow me 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.180
 my idea stolen marcela channel I came 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.320
 make these nails for you because I 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.699
 I think it's a tip that has to be 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.560
 shared because it is such a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.899
 simple people know that people look 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.880
 Tell us how you did it but 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.559
 It's super easy to do and anyone who thinks thinks 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.899
 that is a complicated thing but it is very 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.879
 Simple I did with magazine that for me. 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.340
 not much more certain first time with 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.950
 newspaper and it was a bit light with 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.590
 physical magazine is written small arrow 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.840
 very perfect, you know, so I liked it 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
 very low and with magazine you do in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 your house that you had with you 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.940
 What do you want to do with the newspaper? Do you? 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.390
 want to do with magazines and can do 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.640
 also 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.039
 but I do my tip you do with 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.080
 magazine because it gives much more that's right 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.640
 well, that's it, stay with the video 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.530
 hope you like it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 So the people to start you will 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.570
 need alcohol 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 that something of the same team cleaning I 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 I put that amount of a pot 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.229
 need not be too precise also to 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.880
 an enamel I found the perfect sic for 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 make your newspaper nails 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.509
 then chose those incomes Brazil 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.610
 that you can choose any color that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.590
 Do not be too dark, too. 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.759
 You need to get it right so I got a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.640
 little santana that I have in this 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.400
 bowl of the toothpick to clean the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 or if you prefer too. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.460
 can be a swab is and will need 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.229
 Of course from a magazine or newspaper I 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.420
 I chose magazine I think with magazine 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 gives a lot more sex than the newspaper 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.189
 but if you prefer to continue 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.110
 You can also do it wherever you go. 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.970
 need scissors that will only 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.920
 serve to cut the pieces of 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.229
 Okay, the newspaper looks good. Let's go. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.909
 I started to tell you a piece of the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.979
 magazine of a story is written with 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.560
 these little letters then you can 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.970
 compare with your finger and come 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.970
 little ones then it will work 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.069
 I went to cut here and you can go thinking about 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 each finger at the time it is cut then 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.560
 When you big toe you make a 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.989
 little bigger 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.610
 The little finger is a little bit smaller for you. 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.030
 to know more or less for which he is 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.030
 each one 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.910
 okay I forgot to tell you but also 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.230
 will need an extra gloss top coat 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.130
 to spend at the end 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.019
 so now lets start, then let's go 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.810
 begin to apply on the lace enamel of the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.880
 brasil da risquet two layers in each 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.260
 one 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.530
 so I'll start by applying the first 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.590
 layer makes it very beautiful but it has 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.360
 this brightness so yesterday leaders then 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.360
 It was was pretty cool I like 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.420
 Now I'll wait to dry the first hand. 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.280
 to pass for the second time 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.130
 so the first layer has dried up 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.550
 pass the enamel for the second time 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.550
 my nails 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.350
 Then the second layer became 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.000
 so let's hope to dry and then I'll come back 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.920
 to talk to you 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.630
 the second layer and safe with these 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.000
 pretty old people 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.530
 So now that everything is right, the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.420
 people are going to see the coolest part only 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.710
 also the most complicated part then has 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.510
 be very careful 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.210
 so now that I've got the alcohol 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.370
 also will separate the small pieces of 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.620
 newspaper that I will use for each of his then 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.080
 I'm going to leave apart the biggest I 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.850
 cut, I'll leave pardon 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.150
 then the little one will be able to give and the rest 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.130
 is divided among these three of them is 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.690
 basically what you gonna do is you 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.000
 go get your finger 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.830
 You're going to wet him and dive naked 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.600
 because I already know which one does not have 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.750
 problem that will come to nothing 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.299
 so it 's just one to dive into alcohol early 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.270
 and when you pull you come and slam the 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.490
 little piece of magazine up there you 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.910
 waiting when Screen Yes seconds you 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.280
 comes with the Olympus on the other puts a 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.990
 Drop it on top and wait a little longer. 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.940
 another five seconds and strip 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.440
 I do not know if you understand, I'll do it. 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.250
 now for you to see there you go 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.470
 understand 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.760
 so come on, I'll look at mine here. 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:51.860
 Finger is only for a little while. 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:56.610
 Then we'll come with the newspaper and press b 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.500
 the magazine is always a 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.160
 I'll tell you what time it is. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.870
 in the finger and vapor sina this tip I do not 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.910
 I found no site I stayed 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.710
 researching how to do these nails and 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.620
 This tip was the same one I created because 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.760
 I thought it worked out better then you 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.390
 the letters are printed and ready 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.040
 on your fingernail, it's super cool, I guess 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.810
 important for you to do this 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.250
 get a drop on top because it does 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.380
 quite a difference 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.910
 Okay, I tried to make it work then. 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.419
 I did on all lines 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.919
 Good. So, we're going to give you a break. 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.200
 alcoholic drying 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.390
 look here it did not stain around then 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.510
 everything is all right now it just came with the 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.840
 played direct was using this extra 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.699
 brightness of the color 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.699
 I'll come with him then 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.919
 Okay, only a thin layer does not end up dying. 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.020
 then ok, let's go again next time 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.400
 tomorrow is just to recap once you 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.680
 You got it right. 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.300
 so I'm going to come here on alcohol to water 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.100
 my nail a little mec with the 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.290
 magazine you can make the attack on the 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:14.020
 also diagonal that looks super cute 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:17.580
 so come here diagonally and even 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.190
 you should also know with a 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.960
 Press a little more 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.780
 do not do it at a table somewhere 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.400
 because it can end up staining so it's 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.350
 alcohol staining 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.510
 so do it on the surface that you can 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.169
 dirty good 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.460
 then he won again with the swab 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:41.199
 to enjoy is wet already clean this 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.919
 the second finger remained 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.930
 like this 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:52.600
 we already come with extra brightness for 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:56.280
 Up to fix it, fine, now I'm going. 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.280
 do the same thing in theirs 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.680
 ae 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.590
 O 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.240
 so personal end result is this is 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.670
 important that you do not forget to 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.370
 pass the extra gloss on top coat by 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.370
 up later to stay tight and last 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.260
 A lot of time is gone and I think 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.480
 super cool result as well as being a 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.470
 line much more much more very easy 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.640
 to do 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.530
 so I think it 's worth you 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.570
 Trying to do at home does not 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.390
 ten minutes when you get practice 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.920
 get real fast 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.720
 So, personal, this was the video.
