00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.800 
how much I'm asking for this it's not
cheap<00:03:13.100> this<00:03:13.670> thing<00:03:13.910> took<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.180> while<00:03:14.480> and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
cheap this thing took a while and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.960 
cheap this thing took a while and
especially<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.710> burnout<00:03:16.040> time<00:03:16.310> limit<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:16.670> it

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
especially the burnout time limit so it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.790 
especially the burnout time limit so it
makes<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.270> little<00:03:17.390> better<00:03:17.690> than<00:03:17.870> most<00:03:18.020> 360s<00:03:18.710> you

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
makes a little better than most 360s you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.050 
makes a little better than most 360s you
have<00:03:18.950> even<00:03:19.280> better<00:03:19.490> than<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.670> new<00:03:19.850> one

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
have even better than the new one

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.850 
have even better than the new one
because<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.810> takes<00:03:20.990> up<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.260> three<00:03:21.290> days<00:03:21.500> of

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
because it takes up to three days of
