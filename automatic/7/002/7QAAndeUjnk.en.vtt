00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.980
 good people we are here with the rise the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.140
 new champion or I bring it a little bit 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 late but good I have had time in addition 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 Many people wanted to try it and needed 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.320
 people to try it and well here we are 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.320
 watching a little what 10 eta 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.030
 He is a champion that you already know is going 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.120
 destined to medium although it is viable 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.100
 playing in a little way 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.219
 and well here we are going to see how to play the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.219
 flute 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.590
 and it's a little animation this 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.590
 Dancing animation 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.000
 I decided 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.050
 and good that they do the skills 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.260
 passive gives you critics and gives you a shield 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.170
 that according to the flow you have the bar 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.720
 yellow you must manna is a bar 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.120
 yellow that is the flow is worth 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.200
 then the cv every two times you do the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.920
 cv in the third you can throw a tornado 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.970
 the dw is a shield like of wind that you 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.730
 protect from 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.300
 the last of basic attacks of others 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.910
 champions of everything almost everything 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.920
 wd 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.470
 that does have a pretty high cult of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.170
 20 seconds 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.240
 here we have in tornado I have seen it with the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.259
 when you use it twice 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.630
 e have seen this as no cd 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.480
 you can throw the several times that yes no 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.420
 to the same objective only to a goal 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.240
 once and that 's it and the last one has to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.240
 combine it with the look 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.659
 to see if I can throw environments has formed 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.500
 on time 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.769
 the combo is to make 2 cv and have the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.830
 tornado the crib and then throw all the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.900
 multi only serves with the tornado voucher 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.090
 or with the help of another champion that he 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 has in the air type more jokes or 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.510
 yoga 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.510
 far away pulling 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.670
 it is very look at the end like at the same 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.390
 target our city power but 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.390
 several without looking 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.609
 you can not create yourself because being 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.290
 like a little circle the view 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.879
 can not only be at the same 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.600
 I have the tornado, you are going to see the 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.330
 tornado great tornado 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.880
 now the violin is the last voucher of 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.310
 aunts again in the air and here nobody 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.790
 he has killed let's go 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.189
 good 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.719
 it's broken you're champion vows too 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.969
 one thing that I want to tell you about this 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.280
 champion is that you can reach a hundred 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.920
 hundred of critics with the infinite edge and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.750
 the spectral with those two objects can 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.730
 get one hundred percent critical or 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.900
 every basic attack that goals you get 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.510
 critical 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.560
 it's broken that I do not know if they're going to deny it or 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.860
 do not 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.560
 but it's broken the dw is also broken 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.880
 because you can 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.480
 as a style you can 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.670
 dodge the damage of the turrets looks 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.130
 the worst assets the damage of the bug 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.780
 You see, it does not do anything to me if it kills every 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:41.230
 time people are a bit because we say 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.390
 that yes the champion yasuo is very loose in 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.290
 the sense that if two uncles are you 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.930
 throw over you crush this crystal 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.640
 of the champion 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.550
 but let's look I'm going to do the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.710
 blue with this life better 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.150
 I'm doing with nothing with little life 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.150
 with 100 of life and such 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.500
 It's not very good and I only have the saber 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.500
 this life robbery 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.220
 it's broken well let's kill it like this a 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.170
 little bit more to see it with over 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.780
 then the champion is well 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.560
 I think they're going to leave it a little 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.180
 be clear about the damage or those of the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.570
 critics or leave it like that I do not know 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.030
 it's very good I like it 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.340
 is we're going to kill now he gave the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.670
 tornado but will not activate the multiverse 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.670
 why 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.020
 good 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.020
 I have the tornado again 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.410
 We are not going to throw away and you have seen the 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.330
 tornado I'm with hannah and tobacco has 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.040
 decided the last one also before 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.100
 finish the video this is going to be the last 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.600
 champion of this season and that a lot 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.820
 people say that the next one is going to be 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.180
 boxing and what do I do if it has something to do 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.180
 with 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.600
 because because as you know, I do without 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.810
 skills like wind say that 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:18.540
 it can be your enemy or your rival 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.540
 although it does not make much sense because he 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.040
 it does not make sense because it comes out in the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.960
 base buddhism commit 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.350
 then appears the next champion will be 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.160
 after this chaos and surely the 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.490
 next year 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.960
 and we're going to finish the video myself that I eat 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.420
 floor a little the champion let's do 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.710
 the last one we kill him how is broken 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.750
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.030
 video let's see how we're going to let 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.840
 here to look at the turret as you see it 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.060
 turret damage w is broken and good 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.080
 we see people 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.289
 let's see how he dies and 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.560
 in another world and nothing until another we 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.560
 we see
