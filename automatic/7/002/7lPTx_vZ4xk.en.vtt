 begins to discount in a beauty painting 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.029
 initially washing the car washed but 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.210
 there's a pole in the painting that I'm going to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.480
 remove this dust with final inspection 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.949
 the average is in a microfiber cloth 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.559
 premium dalton america 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.460
 the main removal is personal simplistic 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:52.050
 it's a light spray 2 people do not 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:54.539
 wide cloth is the removal of some 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.110
 difficulty because it is well contaminated 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.110
 painting see the cloth to the other side and 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:12.150
 the ultimate beauty finish now removed 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.460

 any non- smoking bag 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.320
 Do you have a problem, have you got a small bag? 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.110
 normal plastic you place the hand inside 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.520
 and pass over the surface you 're not 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:42.540
 pulled out means that the paint is 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:44.160
 contaminated into the sea on top of 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.170
 surface is that even hiring 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.880
 stays on top of the surface varnish 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.770
 contaminated 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.770
 the process of decontamination now 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.150
 abrasive 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.460
 I've removed seal here you're only 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.620
 may notice that the brasilia paste is in the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.649
 face that I'm going to show you 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.800
 the company also 11 brief manual ne 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:24.950
 but I'm explaining on video to you 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:27.830
 It's much better for you next. 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.629
 it is necessary for you to make many 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.360
 and many vehicles then you do not need 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.360
 take on the one for you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.010
 I'll try to keep her serve intact. 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:53.340
 because it is important to keep the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:55.110
 rest of the bar do not use this here 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.800
 The 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.800
 a piece of 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.989
 the rest here 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.230
 I confess and ldu again in the packaging 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.230
 original 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.110
 beauty 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.030
 now I need change there in my hand, I 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.920
 I will use the lubricant that the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.220
 burner lubricant is the same 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.480
 final inspection and what I'm going to do 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.250
 I will lubricate it gives to rifada 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.760
 lubricate it I'll give it to her 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.760
 my hand 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:52.780
 Come on, come on and press 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.910
 and and shaping her beauty in a mold 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.770
 here talk about my four 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.850
 and this is the method you use to 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.550
 facilitate a colloquium on the 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.670
 four fingers and here the insurance is bad for 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.320
 Tiny brunette with the big toe to the hour 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.420
 decontamination lock her fall in 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.060
 floor so this does not happen because 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.440
 she falls on the floor will get dirt 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.140
 Catch a pebble all but this one. 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.930
 pebble get caught here pebble run out 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.209
 You will not feel the more and the stone is 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.210
 you use cleimar on the surface will 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.190
 To redeem all the painting is personal now 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.410
 Let's start the process of contamination. 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.620
 is very simple is said died 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:36.400
 lubricant in henna paint that 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.750
 begins the process and will invent 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:44.680
 so no pressure is given to anyone 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.940
 applying and going feeling and surfaces 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.940
 it gets smoother 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.980
 hyacinth sliding much better 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.719
 Good people, we may not realize 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.159
 in this case it can not abrasive 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.650
 but all the dirt that was here 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.689
 on this surface was proposed brazil thÃ¡ 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.159
 and then in time I'll save 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.689
 from her now we will do everything 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.180
 vehicle in case 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:27.449
 we pick people fold her and keep 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.930
 the dirt on the inner side of the work she 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.599
 and fashion again in our fear, people 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.249
 hook up on it lubricates and continues 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.650
 process on any car 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:44.430
 and we continue the whole process 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:50.009
 I'm going to show you now 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.870
 already the difference of the result where they 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.610
 contaminate where they do not 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.599
 people realize that it will not pass 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.839
 far away, we feel that we have 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.979
 Happy that sand that had 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.289
 on the surface 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.240
 We do not feel any more, so I go. 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.879
 show me now with the plastic 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.879
 will be able to hear the difference 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.150
 it's the difference 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:38.030
 the difference really is glaring is and 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.400
 now we really need to remove this 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.030
 decontamination has long had people 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.220
 really mom in the public car happens 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:51.139
 so much so that this contamination fell to 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.240
 lack of brake is industrial pollution is 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.819
 listen to the mirror that is what is of snows 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.680
 You left the car in front of the 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.990
 neighbor's garage he painted with 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.659
 paint gun all over his gate 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.669
 that extinguished publication went to the 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.710
 and within the scope of your car you do not 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.830
 you need to send the local police the 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:13.729
 Brazil you remove all that that 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.590
 that dirt and that's it too 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.020
 leaves painting stronger then when the 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.629
 people get contaminated 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.280
 again bright always tells polycom 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:24.500
 act as if we are a city hall 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.940
 Also we say contaminates painting and 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.770
 then we go through a process of 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.560
 polishing 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.069
 so the staff is what it was worth and even the 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.069
 next video 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:45.340
 the staff liked this video so if 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.740
 I liked it here, it gives a jewel to 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.850
 us and inscribes upon beauty 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.850
 Thanks for the next video.
