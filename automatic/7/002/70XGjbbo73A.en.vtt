00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.120 

it<00:02:06.420> needs<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.840> slid<00:02:07.140> sideways<00:02:07.380> can't<00:02:07.950> just

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
it needs to be slid sideways can't just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.859 
it needs to be slid sideways can't just
be<00:02:08.250> snapped<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.789> you'll<00:02:08.970> break<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.450> flip

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
be snapped out you'll break that flip

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.860 
be snapped out you'll break that flip
off<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.819> you've<00:02:11.970> removed<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> clips

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
off so because you've removed the clips

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.080 
off so because you've removed the clips
and<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> bullets<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.250> gorilla<00:02:14.519> you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and the bullets and I'm the gorilla you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.880 
and the bullets and I'm the gorilla you
can<00:02:15.209> open<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.599> up<00:02:15.720> or<00:02:15.930> bend<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.290> forward<00:02:16.500> wide

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
can open it up or bend it forward wide

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.500 
can open it up or bend it forward wide
enough<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:18.290> slide<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> headlight<00:02:19.680> sideways

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
enough that slide the headlight sideways

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.990 
enough that slide the headlight sideways
and<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> will<00:02:21.930> come<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.290> pop<00:02:22.470> right<00:02:22.709> over

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
and then it will come and pop right over

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.910
