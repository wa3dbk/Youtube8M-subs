00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.640 
usually if you've had a Lexmark printer
where<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.300> currently<00:04:42.510> do<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.200> doing<00:04:43.470> that

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
where you currently do just doing that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.820 
where you currently do just doing that
and<00:04:43.890> restarting<00:04:44.340> your<00:04:44.370> computer<00:04:44.850> will<00:04:45.030> fix<00:04:45.240> it

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
and restarting your computer will fix it

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.200 
and restarting your computer will fix it
now<00:04:46.830> we've<00:04:47.010> had<00:04:47.160> a<00:04:47.190> couple<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.610> people<00:04:47.940> who

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
now we've had a couple of people who

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.820 
now we've had a couple of people who
found<00:04:48.420> another<00:04:48.750> solution<00:04:48.990> which<00:04:49.440> is<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.590> little

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
found another solution which is a little

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.340 
found another solution which is a little
unusual<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:51.030> think<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.810> solution<00:04:52.110> is

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
unusual and I think this solution is

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.350 
unusual and I think this solution is
specific<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.800> 32-bit<00:04:53.310> computers<00:04:53.970> but<00:04:54.150> I'm<00:04:54.240> not

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
specific to 32-bit computers but I'm not

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.910 
specific to 32-bit computers but I'm not
sure<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:54.900> can<00:04:55.050> give<00:04:55.170> it<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.320> shot<00:04:55.530> if<00:04:55.740> that

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
sure so you can give it a shot if that

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.860 
sure so you can give it a shot if that
doesn't<00:04:56.250> do<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.340> trick<00:04:56.460> for<00:04:56.670> you<00:04:56.880> if<00:04:57.690> you

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870

sometimes people have a problem running

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
the spool service because of this so if

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.150 
the spool service because of this so if
you<00:05:41.580> turn<00:05:41.790> this<00:05:41.940> on<00:05:42.180> go<00:05:42.990> to<00:05:43.050> add<00:05:43.290> and<00:05:43.680> it's

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
you turn this on go to add and it's

down here called spool SV so I'm just

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.280 
down here called spool SV so I'm just

going to choose spool SV hit open and

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.350 
going to choose spool SV hit open and
that's<00:05:55.440> going<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.680> add<00:05:55.860> it<00:05:56.010> to<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.220> list<00:05:56.400> in<00:05:56.669> my

that's going to add it to the list in my
case<00:05:57.600> it<00:05:57.780> won't<00:05:57.930> add<00:05:58.200> it<00:05:58.350> I'm<00:05:58.470> running<00:05:58.740> 64-bit

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
case it won't add it I'm running 64-bit

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.310 
case it won't add it I'm running 64-bit

the spooler so it won't help in my case

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.300 
the spooler so it won't help in my case
but<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.050> can<00:06:04.080> give<00:06:04.320> that<00:06:04.350> a<00:06:04.530> shot<00:06:04.860> if<00:06:05.040> the
