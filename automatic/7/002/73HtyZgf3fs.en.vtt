which we have now run in so what is all

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.950 
which we have now run in so what is all
about<00:00:43.620> trail<00:00:44.070> running<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.120> fascinating

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
about trail running it's a fascinating

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.639 
about trail running it's a fascinating
it's<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.670> interesting<00:00:48.300> very<00:00:48.930> pleasant

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it's very very interesting very pleasant

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.850 
it's very very interesting very pleasant
but<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.460> know<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> run<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.860> all

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
but if you know how to run there so all

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.439 
but if you know how to run there so all
premises<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.750> had<00:00:55.020> before<00:00:55.410> about<00:00:56.100> both

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
premises which we had before about both

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
premises which we had before about both
method<00:00:57.449> running<00:00:57.750> technique<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.440> still<00:00:58.890> there

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
method running technique is still there

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.010 
method running technique is still there
and<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> use<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> trail

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and we have to use them on a trail

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.070 
and we have to use them on a trail
running<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.699> some<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.989> bit

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
running but with some some little bit

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:31.020 
running but with some some little bit
adjustment

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:41.850 

that's<00:01:32.030> my<00:01:32.299> yeah

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
let's be can I just want to fill you in

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.930 
let's be can I just want to fill you in
on<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.270> little<00:01:46.510> secret<00:01:46.630> well<00:01:47.200> trail<00:01:47.470> running

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
on a little secret well trail running

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.460 
on a little secret well trail running
something<00:01:48.940> that<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.060> find<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.570> I<00:01:49.660> always<00:01:49.990> do<00:01:50.230> I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
something that I find that I always do I

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.380 
something that I find that I always do I
find<00:01:50.860> many<00:01:51.070> rocks<00:01:51.400> along<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.850> trails<00:01:52.120> when

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
find many rocks along the trails when

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.900 
find many rocks along the trails when
I'm<00:01:52.510> out<00:01:52.660> here<00:01:52.900> doing<00:01:53.020> my<00:01:53.440> runs<00:01:54.160> in<00:01:54.550> being

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
I'm out here doing my runs in being

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.930 
I'm out here doing my runs in being
instructed<00:01:55.210> by<00:01:55.570> Nicholas<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.370> find<00:01:57.790> is

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
instructed by Nicholas so what I find is

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.920 
instructed by Nicholas so what I find is
that<00:01:57.970> sometimes<00:01:58.540> um<00:01:59.550> my<00:02:00.550> landing<00:02:01.479> sometimes

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
that sometimes um my landing sometimes

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.230 
that sometimes um my landing sometimes
if<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.260> do<00:02:02.530> land<00:02:02.890> which<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.250> don't<00:02:03.310> let<00:02:03.910> dual

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
if you do land which I don't let dual

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.200 
if you do land which I don't let dual
and<00:02:04.450> overhead<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.020> body<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.030> you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
and overhead of the body and and and you

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.050 
and overhead of the body and and and you
are<00:02:07.390> going<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.810> step<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> rock<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
are going to step on a rock the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.580 
are going to step on a rock the
difference<00:02:10.420> between<00:02:10.570> landing<00:02:11.200> ahead<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.500> your

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
difference between landing ahead of your

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.750 
difference between landing ahead of your
body<00:02:11.800> or<00:02:12.600> underneath<00:02:13.600> your<00:02:14.020> GCM<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.920> could

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
body or underneath your GCM is could

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.690 
body or underneath your GCM is could
cost<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.600> sprained<00:02:17.500> ankle<00:02:17.680> reason<00:02:18.670> being

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
cost you a sprained ankle reason being

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.790 
cost you a sprained ankle reason being
is<00:02:19.240> if<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.750> land<00:02:19.959> ahead<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> body<00:02:20.590> you've

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
is if you land ahead of the body you've

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.890 
is if you land ahead of the body you've
got<00:02:20.980> more<00:02:21.220> time<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:22.090> your<00:02:22.239> body<00:02:22.420> has<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.660> go

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
got more time that your body has to go

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.930 
got more time that your body has to go
over<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.680> more<00:02:23.920> chance<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.340> rolling<00:02:24.610> it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
over that so more chance of rolling it

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.140 
over that so more chance of rolling it
and<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.390> longer<00:02:25.720> time<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.380> support<00:02:27.150> whereas

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
and a longer time of on support whereas

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150 
and a longer time of on support whereas
if<00:02:28.390> you're<00:02:28.480> learning<00:02:28.780> underneath<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.560> GCM

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
if you're learning underneath the GCM

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.010 
if you're learning underneath the GCM
then<00:02:30.640> all<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.970> have<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.270> do<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.540> quick<00:02:31.720> pick

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
then all you have to do is a quick pick

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.350 
then all you have to do is a quick pick
up<00:02:32.230> less<00:02:32.739> time<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.160> support<00:02:33.550> hence<00:02:33.880> less<00:02:34.120> time

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
up less time on support hence less time

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.630 
up less time on support hence less time
for<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.600> roll<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.110> sprain<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.070> got<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.520> keep

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
for a roll and a sprain so got to keep

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:47.390 
for a roll and a sprain so got to keep
it<00:02:36.790> moving<00:02:37.380> let's<00:02:38.380> go<00:02:38.530> guys

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.770 

hang<00:02:48.400> on<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.670> rock<00:02:48.790> like<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.350> god<00:02:50.350> bless<00:02:50.620> you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
hang on the rock like that god bless you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.370 
hang on the rock like that god bless you
not<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.050> pull<00:02:53.440> pull<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.390> get<00:02:55.660> over<00:02:56.110> right

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
not to pull pull and just get over right

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.830 
not to pull pull and just get over right
and<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:57.310> if<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.670> step<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.360> like<00:02:58.600> that

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
and then if you step on this like that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.450
