lead it looks really synthetic and it is
what<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.300> know<00:02:51.450> where<00:02:51.600> this

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
what it is so you all know where this

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.550 
what it is so you all know where this
review<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.200> going<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:53.340> looks<00:02:53.640> really<00:02:54.180> cheap<00:02:54.560> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
review is going it looks really cheap it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.280 
review is going it looks really cheap it
looks<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.280> plastic<00:02:58.730> so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
looks like plastic so

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.309 
looks like plastic so
you<00:03:01.860> can't<00:03:02.129> see<00:03:02.400> all<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.879> shine<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.930> really

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
you can't see all the shine it's really

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.030 
you can't see all the shine it's really
shiny<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:05.459> looks<00:03:05.790> really<00:03:06.360> plastic<00:03:07.040> really

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
shiny it looks really plastic really

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.720 
shiny it looks really plastic really
cheap<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:09.450> anyway<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.920> lace<00:03:11.099> doesn't<00:03:11.610> lie

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
cheap so anyway the lace doesn't lie

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.720 
cheap so anyway the lace doesn't lie
flat<00:03:12.379> so<00:03:13.379> I'm<00:03:13.560> thinking<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:13.920> manufacturer's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
flat so I'm thinking this manufacturer's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.789 
flat so I'm thinking this manufacturer's
defect<00:03:14.909> plus<00:03:15.840> when<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.140> put<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.409> on<00:03:16.530> your<00:03:16.680> head

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
defect plus when you put it on your head

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.830 
defect plus when you put it on your head
and<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:17.099> want<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> stretch<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.909> way<00:03:18.150> and

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
