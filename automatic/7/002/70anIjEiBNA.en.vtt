just<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.710> case<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:38.070> wondering<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.869> can

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
just in case you're wondering you can

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
just in case you're wondering you can
see<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:40.619> we're<00:01:40.890> doing<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.390> bent-over

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
see here now we're doing the bent-over

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.660 
see here now we're doing the bent-over
row<00:01:43.369> just<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.670> into<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> exercise<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
row just going into the exercise now I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.950 
row just going into the exercise now I
think<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.790> something<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.390> eighty<00:01:48.630> five

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
think we have something like eighty five

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.889 
think we have something like eighty five
kilograms<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> bar<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.780> felt<00:01:51.780> pretty

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
kilograms on the bar I felt pretty

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.749 
kilograms on the bar I felt pretty
confident<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.710> i<00:01:52.920> feel<00:01:53.159> i<00:01:53.369> feel<00:01:53.399> quite

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
confident with this i feel i feel quite

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.700 
confident with this i feel i feel quite
strong<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.479> particular<00:01:54.810> exercise<00:01:55.110> i

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
strong on this particular exercise i

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.160 
strong on this particular exercise i
probably<00:01:56.490> could<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.240> bending<00:01:57.840> over<00:01:58.110> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
probably could do with bending over a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.889 
probably could do with bending over a
little<00:01:58.350> bit<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:58.939> flavor<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> lot<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
little bit more flavor so it's a lot of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
little bit more flavor so it's a lot of
weight<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.350> i'm<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:01.950> short<00:02:02.189> amount<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
weight and i'm going for short amount of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.990 
weight and i'm going for short amount of
reps<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.829> believe<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> reps<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
reps so I believe the reps are going to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.540 
reps so I believe the reps are going to
look<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.299> little<00:02:06.509> bit<00:02:06.750> dirty<00:02:07.129> because<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.399> know

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
look a little bit dirty because you know

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
look a little bit dirty because you know
you<00:02:09.060> can't<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.569> great<00:02:10.319> form<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.800> things

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you can't have great form of things

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.610 
you can't have great form of things
this<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.210> do<00:02:12.570> what<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.960> go<00:02:13.080> heavy<00:02:13.350> I'm

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this if you do what to go heavy I'm

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.590 
this if you do what to go heavy I'm
really<00:02:13.770> pound<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.310> muscle<00:02:14.670> try<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
really pound the muscle try and get it

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.890 
really pound the muscle try and get it
to<00:02:15.690> grow<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.260> gain<00:02:16.470> some<00:02:16.530> strength<00:02:17.900> that's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
to grow and gain some strength that's
