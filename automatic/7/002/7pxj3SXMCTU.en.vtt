so like I said in GTA online you can

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.780 
so like I said in GTA online you can
actually<00:01:11.790> buy<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> pure<00:01:12.540> gold<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.790> 47,500

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
actually buy the pure gold for 47,500

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
actually buy the pure gold for 47,500
and<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.210> buy<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> brushed<00:01:15.840> gold<00:01:16.110> for

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and you can buy the brushed gold for

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
and you can buy the brushed gold for
forty<00:01:17.009> two<00:01:17.159> thousand<00:01:17.700> seven<00:01:18.210> hundred<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
forty two thousand seven hundred and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
forty two thousand seven hundred and
fifty<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> pure<00:01:20.130> gold<00:01:20.340> does<00:01:20.580> actually

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
fifty so the pure gold does actually

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
fifty so the pure gold does actually
cost<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.630> bit<00:01:21.810> more<00:01:21.960> almost<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.860> fifty

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
cost a little bit more almost up fifty

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.149 
cost a little bit more almost up fifty
thousand<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.150> color<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.680> opinion<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
thousand a color but in my opinion the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
thousand a color but in my opinion the
pure<00:01:26.369> gold<00:01:26.640> color<00:01:26.880> does<00:01:27.210> look<00:01:27.420> better<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
pure gold color does look better is it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.749 
pure gold color does look better is it
worth<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.409> money<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.890> definitely<00:01:29.640> don't

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
worth your money I definitely don't

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.700 
worth your money I definitely don't
think<00:01:29.909> any<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:30.659> two<00:01:30.960> paints<00:01:31.320> are<00:01:31.470> worth

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
think any of these two paints are worth

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.069 
think any of these two paints are worth
forty<00:01:32.579> seven<00:01:33.090> thousand<00:01:33.509> or<00:01:33.630> four<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.930> two

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
forty seven thousand or four to two

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.080 
forty seven thousand or four to two
thousand<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.950> believe<00:01:35.250> both<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.729> them<00:01:35.880> are

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
thousand and I believe both of them are

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.590 
thousand and I believe both of them are
also<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:37.049> unlocked<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.710> level<00:01:38.000> 100<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
all to be honest I think Rockstar could

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.500 
all to be honest I think Rockstar could
have<00:02:25.439> done<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.650> much<00:02:25.860> better<00:02:25.920> job<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.700> fact<00:02:27.150> me

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.890 
customized my own colors on the social
club<00:02:29.760> website<00:02:29.939> than<00:02:30.299> putting<00:02:30.510> them<00:02:30.629> into<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
club website than putting them into the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.780 
club website than putting them into the
game<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.950> could<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.280> done<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.489> much

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
game I think I could have done a much

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.420 
game I think I could have done a much
better<00:02:32.819> job<00:02:33.239> on<00:02:33.629> a<00:02:33.780> gold<00:02:34.110> paint<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.190> think

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
better job on a gold paint and I think

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
if you're having a gold paint it should

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.479 
if you're having a gold paint it should
be<00:02:36.690> bright<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.140> should<00:02:37.319> be<00:02:37.379> like<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.739> year<00:02:37.950> Call
