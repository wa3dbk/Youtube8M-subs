today's tutorial is going to cover the
genero<00:00:02.909> which<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> trick<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:03.929> was

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
genero which is a trick that was

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.630 
genero which is a trick that was
developed<00:00:04.529> by<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.799> beautiful<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.490> talented

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
developed by the beautiful and talented

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.629

we're<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> go<00:00:09.599> over<00:00:09.629> the<00:00:10.139> genero<00:00:10.589> is<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
we're going to go over the genero is a

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.039 
we're going to go over the genero is a
transition<00:00:11.370> from<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.670> brass<00:00:11.879> monkey<00:00:12.150> there<00:00:12.840> are

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
transition from a brass monkey there are

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.720 
transition from a brass monkey there are
other<00:00:13.289> entries<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:14.039> the<00:00:14.190> cross<00:00:14.369> ink<00:00:14.610> will

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
other entries like the cross ink will

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.580 
other entries like the cross ink will
release<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.420> they<00:00:15.539> do<00:00:15.599> tend<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.049> take<00:00:16.259> more

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
release but they do tend to take more

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.050 
release but they do tend to take more
flexibility<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.610> into<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> right

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
flexibility to get into the right

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.510 
flexibility to get into the right
position<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:19.349> you<00:00:19.470> haven't<00:00:19.680> seen<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.220> brass

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
position so if you haven't seen a brass

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.700 
position so if you haven't seen a brass
monkey<00:00:20.789> into<00:00:21.240> Janeiro<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
monkey into Janeiro this is what it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.580 
monkey into Janeiro this is what it
looks<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:29.360> success<00:00:30.360> in<00:00:30.540> a<00:00:30.630> Janeiro<00:00:31.020> depends

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
looks like success in a Janeiro depends

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.729 
looks like success in a Janeiro depends
on<00:00:31.680> three<00:00:31.980> critical<00:00:32.550> factors<00:00:33.300> let's<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.469> over

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
on three critical factors let's go over

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
on three critical factors let's go over
them<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.070> by<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.969> common<00:00:39.210> mistake<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
them one by one so one common mistake is

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.530 
them one by one so one common mistake is
to<00:00:39.930> set<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.350> top<00:00:40.559> arm<00:00:40.770> too<00:00:41.040> high<00:00:41.280> instead<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to set your top arm too high instead you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.600 
to set your top arm too high instead you
want<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:42.780> set<00:00:42.960> your<00:00:43.079> top<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.470> very<00:00:43.800> low<00:00:44.130> with

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
want to set your top on very low with

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.120 
want to set your top on very low with
the<00:00:44.730> bottom<00:00:45.000> arm<00:00:45.180> straight<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:46.530> enables<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
the bottom arm straight this enables the

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.830 
the bottom arm straight this enables the
bicep<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.790> top<00:00:48.000> arm<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.540> create<00:00:48.810> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
bicep of the top arm to create a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
bicep of the top arm to create a
horizontal<00:00:49.260> shelf<00:00:49.860> which<00:00:50.550> sticks<00:00:50.880> your<00:00:51.030> elbow

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
horizontal shelf which sticks your elbow

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.729 
horizontal shelf which sticks your elbow
out<00:00:51.450> further<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.140> gives<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.500> bigger

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
out further and gives you a bigger

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.010 
out further and gives you a bigger
target<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.340> rest<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.670> hip<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.810> other

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
target to rest your hip on the other

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
target to rest your hip on the other
tricky<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.070> make<00:00:56.250> sure<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.700> use

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
tricky bit is to make sure not to use

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
tricky bit is to make sure not to use
that<00:00:57.120> top<00:00:57.329> arm<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.720> carry<00:00:57.899> any<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.530> your

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
that top arm to carry any of your

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.530 
that top arm to carry any of your
bodyweight<00:00:59.130> until<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.880> hip<00:01:00.059> actually

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
bodyweight until your hip actually

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.750 
bodyweight until your hip actually
touches<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.920> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.579> doing

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
touches it you want to think about doing

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.939 
touches it you want to think about doing
a<00:01:02.970> one-handed<00:01:03.630> handstand<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.799> your

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
you use your top arm for grip as you

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.359 
you use your top arm for grip as you
slide<00:01:09.990> your<00:01:10.140> hips<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.590> you'll<00:01:10.979> lose<00:01:11.189> your
