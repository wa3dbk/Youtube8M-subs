00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 now she is not back 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.580
 tuesday what would we do without them? 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.799
 great federal government 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.130
 probably exactly what these 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.230
 The government does nothing 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.690
 since convenes after more than eight months last 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.000
 again the coalition committee and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.340
 The product of the same name is produced 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.769
 in an hour-long marathon session 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.449
 it has actually succeeded something too 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.769
 finish what I have three times 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 had decided 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.980
 the wonderful care allowance of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.790
 Professionals also herd premium or 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.149
 daycare away entertainment, 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.770
 Reward called at a time in the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.750
 to combat the debt crisis of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.760
 other countries are demanding savings programs 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.079
 be the radical cuts 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.940
 state benefits 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.489
 many affected by the financial 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.170
 cause abyss leads our government 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.629
 a completely new kind of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.579
 social benefits 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.760
 You get money for it when you are 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.590
 child not in a kita sends that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.020
 opens up completely new dimensions 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.239
 Social policy soon will be the first 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 ask how much you get if 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.900
 you do not even take your child to school 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.670
 sends or what is actually with 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.950
 For example, people never put them into an opera 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.750
 So go to a state-high 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.850
 subsidized benefit not in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.280
 they would not have to claim 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.619
 culture money gets so far premium 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000
 called there are finally so synonymous 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.310
 so called obstruct 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.259
 these are the farmers of the eu 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.970
 get bonuses for getting your land 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
 do not farm 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.299
 that is not a invention of mine now 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.670
 they really exist 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.490
 there it would be consistent if you 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.430
 people without a car do not drive a street 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 usage bonus paid extra 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.939
 I think that's funny 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 Care allowance in the media throughout 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.920
 called optional gift 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.380
 Who gives something or something to someone? 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 differently asked who pays for this 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.600
 Gift of the gifted then because we 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.149
 already with the tax revenues 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.860
 The new performance does not have to get along 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.780
 of course, paid with new debt 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.490
 and that is allowed to the gifted 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.310
 taxpayer then with interest and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.899
 repay interest 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.280
 Just imagine someone 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.890
 gives you a car for your birthday 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.520
 and in the glove compartment you will find the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.710
 running on her name 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.260
 The contract with which the car is financed 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.020
 Who is about such a gift 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.530
 Joy could claim for a brain 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.600
 not use premium but have the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.640
 brain does not use premium stands 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.310
 unfortunately only a very small im 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.070
 truest sense of the word selected 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.740
 number of fellow human beings and who speak 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.950
 also prefer diets 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.950
 till 9
