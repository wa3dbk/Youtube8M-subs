see i'm on the right side spawned or in
for<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.030> locust<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.560> very<00:00:16.800> first<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.279> hole

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
for the locust on the very first a hole

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
as you can see i could hit it from this

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.019 
as you can see i could hit it from this
pretty<00:00:19.680> much<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.010> right<00:00:20.310> outside<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.820> spawn

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
pretty much just right outside the spawn

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.759 
pretty much just right outside the spawn
now<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.689> second<00:00:22.080> nights<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.350> i<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> show

you guys for the very first a hole was
right<00:00:24.600> underneath<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.140> snipers<00:00:25.619> perch<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
right underneath the snipers perch and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310 
right underneath the snipers perch and
i'm<00:00:26.760> not<00:00:26.939> gonna<00:00:27.060> live<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.170> hole

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
i'm not gonna live for this first a hole

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.750 
i'm not gonna live for this first a hole
you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.590> pretty<00:00:28.800> much<00:00:28.920> tosin<00:00:29.429> aid<00:00:29.580> from

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you can pretty much tosin aid from

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.790 
you can pretty much tosin aid from
anywhere<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.570> as<00:00:30.869> long<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:31.199> you're<00:00:31.349> good<00:00:31.679> at

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
anywhere and as long as you're good at

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.200 
anywhere and as long as you're good at
guessing<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.489> pretty<00:00:32.669> much<00:00:32.759> hit<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> e

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
guessing you can pretty much hit the e

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
guessing you can pretty much hit the e
hole<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:33.719> these<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.020> very<00:00:34.050> safe<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.829> said

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
hole but these are very safe like I said

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.459 
hole but these are very safe like I said
the<00:00:35.670> they<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> lot<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> cover<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the they have a lot of cover and the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
the they have a lot of cover and the
third<00:00:37.800> spot<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.790> i'm<00:00:38.879> lining<00:00:39.059> up

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
third spot as you can see i'm lining up

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.240 
third spot as you can see i'm lining up
in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.110> middle<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.620> water<00:00:40.829> tower<00:00:41.070> i

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
in the very middle of that water tower i

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
in the very middle of that water tower i
think<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> water<00:00:41.969> tower<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:43.050> line<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> up

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
think it's a water tower but line it up

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.380 
think it's a water tower but line it up
right<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.399> throw<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
right there throw it right at the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
right there throw it right at the
generator<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.860> will<00:00:47.039> always<00:00:47.370> hit<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
generator and you will always hit it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.880 
generator and you will always hit it
okay<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.620> i<00:00:49.649> hit<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
okay so as you can see i hit the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
okay so as you can see i hit the
generator<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> fourth<00:00:51.180> spot<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
generator but the fourth spot on the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
generator but the fourth spot on the
very<00:00:52.680> second<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.190> hole<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> actually<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
very second a hole is actually going to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840 
very second a hole is actually going to
be<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.660> behind<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.050> wall<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:56.280> no

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
be right behind this wall and there's no

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.279 
be right behind this wall and there's no
way<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.059> them<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> actually<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.960> able<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.199> hit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
way for them to actually be able to hit

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660 
way for them to actually be able to hit
me<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.590> can't<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.520> to

the money but here is the fifth spot for
the<00:01:10.890> generator<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> left

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the generator actually it's on the left

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
the generator actually it's on the left
side<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.650> i'm<00:01:14.010> gonna<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.340> tossing<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.000> grenade

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
