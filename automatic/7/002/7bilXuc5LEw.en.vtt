00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hi his best go to 16 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.200
 we end up on the tower game 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.429
 France 2014 on my tour with her the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.219
 katusha in step 6 between arras and reims 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.219
 a step a priori for sprinters 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:28.230
 small video presentation with 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.210
 the arrival at reims and so I'm going 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 select christophe with the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 recovery in the first part is 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.480
 a gel to finish in a massive sprint if 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.570
 it ends like that and it's gone 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 for this start of the stage with jerseys 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.670
 greetings from christophe millet the new 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.360
 yellow jersey you focus on sylvain 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.710
 chavanel and you can even right 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 I display lennon with the key back 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.140
 actually madness here is chavanel 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.510
 but his beautiful yellow jersey I'm going 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.750
 ask me me alone in iz me 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.750
 protect 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 be particularly exposed to the wind and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.600
 we will do step like this takes a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.740
 happy escape from leaving there who 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.780
 coincide will open to intermediaries 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.780
 as usual on these flat steps 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.200
 two intermediate sprints approaching 7 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:37.050
 km be exact is one to the breakaway of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.860
 three riders and Sepulveda parta and 26 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.680
 may reindeer who still have five 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 minutes 50 ahead of his speed 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 really is not his major asset 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 he must rather rely on his abilities 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.430
 pressure roller to make the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.430
 difference 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.080
 we are now 5 km from this sprint 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.009
 intermediate we will see if the technique 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.110
 to try to take them by surprise 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.450
 the other sprinters works 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.580
 always courses all the school if all 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 already covered there that I 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.560
 more business up front by passing the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.560
 big plateau already 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.790
 2 km 5 years old victim being seen 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.530
 was two races 2 km 5 I think that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.489
 I'm going to attack from a turn with his 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.319
 parts to two kilometers I have a 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.319
 greipel teammates making the effort 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.719
 what does it say behind it says no 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.890
 big thing I think I have them in 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.390
 part of the fact we even have one who likes 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.579
 well, but I should 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.579
 even move to fourth place 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.569
 behind it was good to leave the ace 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:06.609
 priori good time it's technical 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.439
 leave at 2 km 5 pretty much surprising 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.319
 all sprinters work 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.480
 exactly as on of 2013 as well as 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.579
 I had indicated on a video 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.439
 former 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.709
 not too much challenge for the jersey 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:24.040
 green again this year I think with a 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.629
 reasonably fine arts sprinter 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.230
 just entered the zone of 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.419
 refueling 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.159
 I have to think about refueling everything 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.280
 the world here I select all the 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.040
 world my band his little jungle for the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.969
 fatigue and christophe also of course 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.810
 go there is it's gone we refuel 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:48.930
 you 're going to end up in the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.930
 final stage and evolved to river either 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.340
 15 kilometers from the finish 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:04:00.159
 christophe at the front of the pack and the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:06.090
 escaped 50 seconds in front of van someren 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:08.379
 especially and a delayed appollonio 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.879
 which must have had a technical problem 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:14.590
 could at 3:08 anyway we are going 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.320
 take care of trying to make a good this 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.099
 crime of the east christophe asca by my 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.350
 victory in the first stage on 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.570
 matti skis 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.770
 I saw once third time once 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.790
 fifth once third word that's 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.780
 that would be nice interesting 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.770
 to try to win a new 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.540
 stage victory 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.460
 I'll try to get by 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.510
 only because the issue requires 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.840
 someone to protect 30 seconds he has 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.140
 tendency to annoy me 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.170
 launched the run the sprinter's train has 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.260
 launched the sprint from the 10 km I 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.750
 already done so I was a little bad 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.150
 ranked g I had missed the podium I think 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.140
 that kind of stuff so here we will try 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.250
 to fend for himself with 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.570
 christophe perhaps will you take 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.140
 other sprinters in any case be 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.260
 in the very first places in 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:13.620
 the last few kilometers even be the 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.540
 better positioned for the sprint 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.520
 massive since the ars did all that 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.220
 more doubt we see the breakaways 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.480
 the second of front has already I do 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:30.600
 ta sela 7 km 9 now is the time to react 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:32.490
 we will take the big gear try 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.050
 to go back to already it's hard the road 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.050
 are relatively narrow 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.570
 it slows down it accelerates these irregulars 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.430
 6 km 5 I'm already starting to wonder if 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.110
 I do not have to wait too long to start 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.630
 forward since there I have trouble to 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.030
 go up but my big plateau is very 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.050
 good team that goes thoroughly 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.050
 so I asked him nothing at all 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.290
 go in big plateau we come to 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.370
 go back a little bit behind the 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.760
 different sprinter trains it's 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.260
 not bad 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.000
 at 3 km 9 be careful not to get bothered 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.470
 relay sprints that do not 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.240
 can more 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:21.910
 I'm going through a kid the 2 km 9 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.410
 I am in the road degenkolb who you 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:29.820
 like it's not going to be so good I take 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.820
 my refueling two kilometers 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.290
 here we go 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.060
 where they are far ahead they are far 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.590
 in front of and we come back to a small 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.330
 it's going to be too good for the 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:53.030
 victory I think though and not just 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:56.220
 behind that such damage some 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.310
 centimeters I missed to go from 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:03.500
 bank marcel kittel winner in front 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.500
 christophe so and third cavendish 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:31.250
 I think we're talking about the green jersey 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:33.289
 out of 7 on this step this is the case in 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.840
 any case always new case 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.849
 stage win in sprint for 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:42.530
 christophe even though he was beautiful 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:46.659
 places of honor he will meet for 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.659
 Step 7 on a next video
