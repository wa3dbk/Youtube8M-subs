in<00:00:00.359> this<00:00:00.599> tutorial<00:00:00.780> we're<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.380> go<00:00:01.469> over

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
in this tutorial we're going to go over

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.940 
in this tutorial we're going to go over
layers<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:03.290> you<00:00:04.290> know<00:00:04.410> some<00:00:04.620> simple

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
layers and you know some simple

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
layers and you know some simple
animation<00:00:06.500> I'm<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.980> describe<00:00:08.670> layers

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
animation I'm going to describe layers

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.509 
animation I'm going to describe layers
by<00:00:09.269> using<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.929> flash<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:10.950> recently<00:00:11.099> made

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
by using a flash I just recently made

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.129 
by using a flash I just recently made
it's<00:00:11.790> not<00:00:11.910> really<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.179> flash<00:00:12.450> animation<00:00:13.019> it's

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it's not really a flash animation it's

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.720 
it's not really a flash animation it's
more<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:13.349> like<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> thing<00:00:14.070> gifts<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
more just like a thing gifts and a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730 
more just like a thing gifts and a
moving-picture<00:00:15.210> really<00:00:15.780> I'll<00:00:16.379> should<00:00:16.619> give

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
moving-picture really I'll should give

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.490 
moving-picture really I'll should give
you<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> example<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.490> created<00:00:18.449> sorry<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> secret

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
you the example I created sorry a secret

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.019 
you the example I created sorry a secret
spot<00:00:19.830> from<00:00:20.820> Zelda<00:00:21.150> u<00:00:21.240> 0<00:00:21.270> 4<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.820> can't

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
spot from Zelda u 0 4 and you can't

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.740 
spot from Zelda u 0 4 and you can't
really<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:26.119> in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.300> end<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.599> looks

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
really see it but in the end it looks

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.410 
really see it but in the end it looks
like<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:29.220> allow<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> objects<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.210> going

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
like this and allow the objects we going

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.860 
like this and allow the objects we going
off<00:00:31.070> because<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.090> don't<00:00:33.270> need<00:00:33.450> anything

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
off because well you don't need anything

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
off because well you don't need anything
outside<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.829> white<00:00:35.130> screen<00:00:35.460> remember<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.719> i

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
outside the white screen remember if i

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
outside the white screen remember if i
push<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.070> it'll<00:00:38.480> make

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
push this I but right here it'll make

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.760 
push this I but right here it'll make
everything<00:00:39.719> invisible<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
everything invisible so I can see the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.840 
everything invisible so I can see the
screen<00:00:40.920> again<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:42.090> there's<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.540> screen<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
screen again and there's my screen and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.990 
screen again and there's my screen and
the<00:00:44.850> lock<00:00:45.090> button<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:46.640> makes<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the lock button actually makes it so you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.639 
the lock button actually makes it so you
can't<00:00:48.390> accidentally<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.410> screw

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
can't accidentally you know screw

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
can't accidentally you know screw
something<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> different<00:00:50.489> layer<00:00:50.719> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
something up on a different layer you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
something up on a different layer you
can<00:00:51.750> click<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> individual<00:00:52.770> locks<00:00:52.980> or<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
can click the individual locks or the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.029 
can click the individual locks or the
individual<00:00:53.760> objects<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:57.120> anyway<00:00:57.949> I'm<00:00:58.949> going

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
individual objects but anyway I'm going

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.299 
individual objects but anyway I'm going
to<00:00:59.129> talk<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.609> layers<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:01.309> layers

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to talk to you about layers now layers

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.950 
to talk to you about layers now layers
are<00:01:02.609> extremely<00:01:03.180> useful<00:01:03.359> i<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.780> say<00:01:03.930> that

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
are extremely useful i will say that

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.700 
are extremely useful i will say that
right<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.640> because<00:01:05.960> well<00:01:06.960> without<00:01:07.229> layers<00:01:07.500> i

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
right now because well without layers i

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.690 
right now because well without layers i
would<00:01:07.920> not<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.100> able<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> create<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
would not be able to create the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.429 
would not be able to create the
characters<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.479> L<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.110> even<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
characters that I do as L do or even the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.359 
characters that I do as L do or even the
Wilkos<00:01:10.710> animations<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> wilco<00:01:11.939> shorts

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
Wilkos animations like the wilco shorts

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
Wilkos animations like the wilco shorts
but<00:01:14.369> uh<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.360> explain<00:01:15.570> how<00:01:15.720> those

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
but uh I'm going to explain how those

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.499 
but uh I'm going to explain how those
work<00:01:16.310> you'll<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.390> are

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
work you'll see over here that there are

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.880 
work you'll see over here that there are
different<00:01:18.840> names<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.320> few<00:01:19.500> things<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
different names for a few things and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.350 
different names for a few things and
this<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.369> goes<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.240> too

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
this one goes off just because it's too

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
this one goes off just because it's too
long<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.500> says<00:01:22.799> light<00:01:23.040> beam<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.460> talking

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
long but it says light beam is talking

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380 
long but it says light beam is talking
about<00:01:24.030> these<00:01:24.659> beams<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
about these beams right here and this is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.450 
about these beams right here and this is
how<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> works<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.320> bottom<00:01:31.650> layer<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> one

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
how it works the bottom layer is the one

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.910 
how it works the bottom layer is the one
that<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.640> farthest<00:01:32.939> away<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.540> audience

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
that is farthest away from the audience

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.819 
that is farthest away from the audience
the<00:01:34.920> top<00:01:35.130> layer<00:01:35.479> oops<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.840> top<00:01:37.079> layer<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the top layer oops the top layer at the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.390 
the top layer oops the top layer at the
topmost<00:01:38.159> layer<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.320> case<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.009> would<00:01:41.189> be

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
topmost layer in this case it would be

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
topmost layer in this case it would be
I'm<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.390> trying<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.020> simple<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
I'm just trying to keep this simple so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.080 
I'm just trying to keep this simple so
it's<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.770> too<00:01:43.890> confusing<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.869> island<00:01:46.320> or

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
it's not too confusing the island or

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's not too confusing the island or
even<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:51.479> clear<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.409> the

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.200 
basically him got a full length and but
yeah<00:05:26.949> you<00:05:27.279> have<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.580> have<00:05:27.699> layers<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.120> create

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
yeah you have to have layers to create

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.589 
yeah you have to have layers to create
your<00:05:28.360> character<00:05:28.569> I<00:05:29.020> mean<00:05:29.440> drawing<00:05:29.770> just

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
your character I mean drawing just

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.999 
your character I mean drawing just
drawing<00:05:31.599> one<00:05:31.870> model<00:05:32.199> and<00:05:32.229> animating<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:32.800> that

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
drawing one model and animating it that

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.909 
drawing one model and animating it that
is<00:05:33.129> just<00:05:33.310> not<00:05:33.460> gonna<00:05:33.580> work<00:05:34.199> and<00:05:35.199> I<00:05:35.500> would<00:05:35.740> show

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
is just not gonna work and I would show

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.170 
is just not gonna work and I would show
you<00:05:35.949> how<00:05:36.129> I<00:05:36.190> animate<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.610> models<00:05:36.909> but<00:05:37.029> that

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
you how I animate the models but that

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.339 
you how I animate the models but that
would<00:05:37.300> probably<00:05:37.330> take<00:05:37.719> that<00:05:38.110> would<00:05:38.199> take

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
would probably take that would take

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:46.469 
would probably take that would take
forever<00:05:38.500> so<00:05:40.500> no<00:05:41.500> way<00:05:44.729> but<00:05:45.729> layers<00:05:46.180> are

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
forever so no way but layers are

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.079 
forever so no way but layers are
basically<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.229> know<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:48.789> make<00:05:48.909> it

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.089 
basically just you know to make it

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.119 
basically just you know to make it
easier<00:05:49.389> to<00:05:49.449> animate<00:05:49.839> because<00:05:50.229> without<00:05:50.770> layers

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
easier to animate because without layers

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:52.589 
easier to animate because without layers
this<00:05:51.490> would<00:05:51.639> be<00:05:51.729> and<00:05:51.879> this<00:05:52.419> would<00:05:52.569> be

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
this would be and this would be

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.920 
this would be and this would be
impossible<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:53.259> do<00:05:54.539> but<00:05:55.539> you<00:05:55.629> have<00:05:55.719> to<00:05:55.810> have<00:05:55.900> a

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
impossible to do but you have to have a

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.149 
impossible to do but you have to have a
layer<00:05:56.110> for<00:05:56.319> just<00:05:56.469> about<00:05:56.560> everything<00:05:56.830> at<00:05:57.099> least

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
layer for just about everything at least

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.610 
layer for just about everything at least
in<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.490> way<00:05:57.610> that<00:05:57.759> I<00:05:57.819> Oh<00:05:57.969> mate<00:05:58.289> for<00:05:59.289> Wilkos

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
in the way that I Oh mate for Wilkos

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.659 
in the way that I Oh mate for Wilkos
it's<00:05:59.800> a<00:05:59.830> little<00:06:00.009> bit<00:06:00.129> different<00:06:00.430> because<00:06:00.490> I'm

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
it's a little bit different because I'm

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:01.769 
it's a little bit different because I'm
constantly<00:06:00.789> doing<00:06:01.150> frame<00:06:01.599> by<00:06:01.750> frame

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
constantly doing frame by frame

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.510 
constantly doing frame by frame
animation<00:06:02.110> and<00:06:02.710> frame<00:06:02.889> by<00:06:03.039> frame<00:06:03.069> is<00:06:03.490> just

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
animation and frame by frame is just

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.369 
animation and frame by frame is just
like<00:06:03.849> you<00:06:03.969> know<00:06:04.060> one<00:06:04.449> picture<00:06:04.839> after<00:06:05.050> another

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
like you know one picture after another

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.360 
like you know one picture after another
to<00:06:05.620> animate<00:06:07.229> like<00:06:08.229> I<00:06:08.440> think<00:06:08.710> his<00:06:08.800> eyes<00:06:09.009> are

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
to animate like I think his eyes are

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.399 
to animate like I think his eyes are
animated<00:06:09.969> in<00:06:10.089> this<00:06:10.270> one<00:06:10.419> I<00:06:10.449> think<00:06:10.690> maybe<00:06:11.229> I'm

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
animated in this one I think maybe I'm

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.700 
animated in this one I think maybe I'm
wrong<00:06:11.589> I<00:06:11.860> guess<00:06:12.639> not<00:06:12.849> I<00:06:13.229> know<00:06:14.229> if<00:06:14.319> he<00:06:14.349> moves<00:06:14.500> or

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
wrong I guess not I know if he moves or

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.820 
wrong I guess not I know if he moves or
not<00:06:14.860> no<00:06:15.370> I<00:06:15.400> guess<00:06:15.669> not<00:06:16.349> we've<00:06:17.349> got<00:06:17.469> on<00:06:17.560> this<00:06:17.680> one

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
not no I guess not we've got on this one

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.269 
not no I guess not we've got on this one
do<00:06:18.279> them<00:06:18.460> this<00:06:18.520> one<00:06:19.589> yeah<00:06:20.589> I<00:06:20.620> think<00:06:20.710> it<00:06:20.919> yeah<00:06:21.159> he

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279 
do them this one yeah I think it yeah he

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.240 
do them this one yeah I think it yeah he
blinks<00:06:21.610> right<00:06:21.789> there<00:06:22.089> and<00:06:22.500> then<00:06:23.500> heat<00:06:23.740> will<00:06:24.009> ya

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
blinks right there and then heat will ya

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.480 
blinks right there and then heat will ya
this<00:06:25.029> is<00:06:25.150> another<00:06:25.330> thing<00:06:25.889> in<00:06:26.889> order<00:06:27.159> to<00:06:27.250> do<00:06:27.339> the

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
this is another thing in order to do the

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.829 
this is another thing in order to do the
cool<00:06:27.669> effects<00:06:27.969> that<00:06:28.120> I<00:06:28.180> use<00:06:28.389> to<00:06:28.419> make<00:06:28.719> their

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:28.839 
cool effects that I use to make their

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.300 
cool effects that I use to make their
heads<00:06:28.990> moving<00:06:29.379> stuff<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.830> have<00:06:30.069> to<00:06:30.099> have

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
heads moving stuff I have to have

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.260 
heads moving stuff I have to have
different<00:06:30.580> layers<00:06:30.699> for<00:06:30.909> different<00:06:31.149> body

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
different layers for different body

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.589 
different layers for different body
parts<00:06:32.009> so<00:06:33.009> like<00:06:33.219> you<00:06:33.550> know<00:06:33.580> say<00:06:34.180> I<00:06:34.209> have<00:06:34.479> his
