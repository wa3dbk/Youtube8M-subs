thing about this one was it started to

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.299 
thing about this one was it started to
get<00:00:40.460> really<00:00:40.699> stiff<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.329> hard<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.780> use<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.309> I

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
get really stiff and hard to use so I

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.090 
get really stiff and hard to use so I
went<00:00:44.179> to<00:00:44.359> a<00:00:44.390> hardware<00:00:44.690> store<00:00:44.839> and<00:00:45.469> I<00:00:45.710> talked<00:00:45.979> to

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
went to a hardware store and I talked to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.559 
went to a hardware store and I talked to
the<00:00:46.219> guy<00:00:46.339> about<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.729> different<00:00:47.030> kinds<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.359> yen

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:47.569

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:49.599 
the guy about the different kinds of yen
and<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:48.289> bought<00:00:48.559> another<00:00:48.589> one<00:00:48.979> just<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:49.489> it

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
and I bought another one just like it

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.219 
and I bought another one just like it
but<00:00:49.909> brand-new<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:50.569> I<00:00:50.600> thought<00:00:50.839> oh<00:00:51.019> well

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
but brand-new so I thought oh well

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.569 
but brand-new so I thought oh well
because<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:51.710> not<00:00:51.889> all<00:00:52.069> that's<00:00:52.249> brand<00:00:52.519> new

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
because it's not all that's brand new

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.700 
because it's not all that's brand new
it'll<00:00:52.789> be<00:00:52.879> easier<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.389> use<00:00:53.569> but<00:00:54.109> it<00:00:54.229> wasn't

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
it'll be easier to use but it wasn't

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.329 
it'll be easier to use but it wasn't
this<00:00:54.949> rubber<00:00:55.789> part<00:00:56.059> was<00:00:56.299> really<00:00:56.719> stiff<00:00:57.499> and<00:00:57.829> I

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
this rubber part was really stiff and I

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.430 
this rubber part was really stiff and I
brought<00:00:58.519> it<00:00:58.670> back<00:00:58.819> to<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.089> store<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.719> three

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
brought it back to the store and three

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.259 
brought it back to the store and three
men<00:01:00.679> who<00:01:00.889> were<00:01:00.920> there<00:01:01.249> said<00:01:01.459> oh<00:01:01.670> you're<00:01:01.909> right

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
men who were there said oh you're right

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.450 
men who were there said oh you're right
it's<00:01:03.170> really<00:01:03.499> stiff<00:01:03.769> it's<00:01:03.920> too<00:01:04.070> hard<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.339> use

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
it's really stiff it's too hard to use

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.969 
it's really stiff it's too hard to use
so<00:01:04.610> they<00:01:04.850> sold<00:01:05.120> me<00:01:05.239> this<00:01:05.420> one<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.409> this<00:01:06.619> one's<00:01:06.890> a

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
so they sold me this one so this one's a

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.070 
so they sold me this one so this one's a
little<00:01:07.130> more<00:01:07.369> pliable<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.420> I<00:01:08.479> suggest<00:01:08.990> that

some<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:52.909> them<00:01:53.060> are<00:01:53.210> wooden<00:01:53.540> but<00:01:53.990> just<00:01:54.230> to<00:01:54.380> make

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
some of them are wooden but just to make

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.800 
some of them are wooden but just to make
it<00:01:54.680> easier<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:55.520> my<00:01:55.940> hand<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:57.130> put<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.909> cloth<00:01:59.390> on

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
it easier on my hand I put this cloth on

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.640 
it easier on my hand I put this cloth on
the<00:02:00.590> end<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.940> flush<00:02:02.480> the<00:02:02.659> toilet<00:02:02.690> get<00:02:03.409> more

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
the end so you flush the toilet get more

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.030 
the end so you flush the toilet get more
water<00:02:03.920> in<00:02:04.220> there

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
water in there

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.400 
water in there
well<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.790> you're<00:02:05.910> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.120> go<00:02:06.210> down<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.080> but

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
well it's you're going to go down so but

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.560 
well it's you're going to go down so but
let's<00:02:07.590> say<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.830> was<00:02:07.980> backed<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.430> so<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:08.850> it's

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
let's say it was backed up so now it's

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.930 
let's say it was backed up so now it's
filling<00:02:10.320> up<00:02:10.440> filling<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.490> what<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.730> want

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
filling up filling up so what you want

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.870 
filling up filling up so what you want
to<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.750> plunger<00:02:13.520> around<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.700> edge

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
to do is get the plunger around the edge

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.720 
to do is get the plunger around the edge
and<00:02:14.910> I'm<00:02:15.840> using<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.350> cloth<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.890> top<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.520> and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and I'm using my cloth on top here and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.330 
and I'm using my cloth on top here and
I'm<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.330> push<00:02:18.570> down<00:02:18.980> okay<00:02:19.980> get

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
I'm just going to push down okay get

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.980 
I'm just going to push down okay get
some<00:02:20.550> suction<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:24.300> do<00:02:24.510> prefer<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
some suction and I really do prefer the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.830 
some suction and I really do prefer the
auger<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.520> sometimes<00:02:27.060> you'll<00:02:27.690> get

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
auger to this but sometimes you'll get

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.490 
auger to this but sometimes you'll get
the<00:02:27.990> auger<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.740> far<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.930> still<00:02:31.290> not

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the auger so far and then it's still not

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.350 
the auger so far and then it's still not
clear<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.490> just<00:02:32.700> give<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> few<00:02:33.300> good

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
clear and if you just give it a few good

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.160 
clear and if you just give it a few good
plunges<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> plunger<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:36.240> will<00:02:36.540> finish

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
plunges with the plunger it will finish

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.830 
plunges with the plunger it will finish
off<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.160> project<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:39.180> giving<00:02:39.540> everything

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
off the project of giving everything

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.530 
off the project of giving everything
through<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.950> idea<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.910> plunger

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
through so the idea is that this plunger

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.160 
through so the idea is that this plunger
you<00:02:42.720> want<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.500> have<00:02:43.710> some<00:02:43.980> suction<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.270> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
you want it to have some suction and so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.050 
you want it to have some suction and so
that's<00:02:46.410> why<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.800> suggest<00:02:47.430> getting<00:02:47.670> one<00:02:47.820> that's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that's why I suggest getting one that's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.670 
that's why I suggest getting one that's
more<00:02:48.330> pliable<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:52.320> thing<00:02:52.530> is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
more pliable like this and the thing is

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.940 
more pliable like this and the thing is
it<00:02:52.830> needs<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.400> water<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:55.050> toilet<00:02:55.680> in

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
it needs to have water in the toilet in

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.080 
it needs to have water in the toilet in
order<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.880> plunge<00:02:57.410> alright<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:59.700> few

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
order to plunge alright and a few

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.440 
order to plunge alright and a few
plunges<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:01.190> my<00:03:02.190> auger<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.910> being<00:03:03.240> my

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
plunges of that my auger of being my

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.990 
plunges of that my auger of being my
favorite<00:03:03.900> choice<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.550> you're<00:03:05.550> pretty<00:03:05.790> good

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
