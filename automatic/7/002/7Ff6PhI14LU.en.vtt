school<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.220> reputation<00:00:56.490> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
school I think the reputation of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.050 
school I think the reputation of
woodland<00:00:57.270> hills<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:58.310> probably<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.520> same<00:00:59.760> as

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
woodland hills is probably the same as

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.560 
woodland hills is probably the same as
mckeesport<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.230> they<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:02.130> that

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
mckeesport like they just think that

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.070 
mckeesport like they just think that
does<00:01:03.570> probably<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.220> by<00:01:05.689> perception<00:01:06.689> now

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
does probably get in by perception now

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
does probably get in by perception now
is<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:08.360> think<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> bad<00:01:09.840> rap<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:11.250> do

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
is I think we get a bad rap I really do

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
is I think we get a bad rap I really do
I<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.800> how<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> media

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I think it's because of how the media

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.900 
I think it's because of how the media
portrays<00:01:14.460> us<00:01:14.820> we're<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:16.230> as<00:01:16.620> bad<00:01:16.860> as

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
portrays us we're really not as bad as

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.930 
portrays us we're really not as bad as
