00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 we meet christoph maria herbst for 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.530
 db mobile in the cactus house of the botanical 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.660
 garden in berlin where he talks to us about 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.660
 his new movie stromberg talks 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.290
 It is the shooting at Stromberg 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.630
 always of a lot of good mood 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.460
 and a lot of fun that was with this 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.860
 company excursion ultimately different 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.650
 It's always an appointment 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.199
 and so and we also gather many 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.510
 because we always take each other 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.410
 again we are laughing 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.480
 distribute 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.309
 and then he does something again 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.890
 funny where you did not expect at all 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.120
 Did you throw yourself in the corner and 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.470
 but then at some point it is good because we 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.160
 want the stuff then synonymous if box 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.080
 get it and so on we just rehearse 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.540
 until it hangs us to the neck 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 and then turn things and then allowed 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.770
 just the viewer does not notice 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.119
 that's really not my world 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.799
 Business trips in the small are yes 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 colors already we know the colors 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.790
 I remind everyone from earlier on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.390
 I like it very much 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.770
 I would have been on a class trip 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.770
 I experienced my first kiss 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.290
 I'm damn missing so damn 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.070
 true to the motto of the way is 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.690
 the goal 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.300
 there is not exclusive 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.220
 because I come from a to b and 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.050
 then it is only important where I come from and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.940
 the b where then the job or whatever 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.700
 always takes place but the route 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.500
 is at least as important otherwise 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.310
 are the train rides actual 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.550
 Enjoy because it is so beautiful 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.490
 decelerates I think it's great 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.860
 somehow that one is there again time 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.770
 can take because you take them 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.420
 if you have it easy and one 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.050
 drive from, for example, Cologne 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.709
 Berlin 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.940
 It's really worth it in the laptop 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.470
 to open and a little bit too 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.010
 work or just watch a movie 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.830
 look 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.700
 I have it much more different 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.660
 train driver 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 that's great 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.390
 who laughs get no app is the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.930
 sounds like it is from laotse but it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.930
 is increased
