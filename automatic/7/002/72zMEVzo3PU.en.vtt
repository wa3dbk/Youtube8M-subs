00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
better in many ways and that's see the

is<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> result<00:00:48.059> doesn't<00:00:48.360> always<00:00:48.480> equate

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
is that a result doesn't always equate

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709 
is that a result doesn't always equate
to<00:00:48.899> performance<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:51.030> really<00:00:51.210> important

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

feeling better though heading into this
I<00:01:50.820> mean<00:01:50.939> we've<00:01:51.659> had<00:01:51.869> chances<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.740> that's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
I mean we've had chances you know that's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.319 
I mean we've had chances you know that's
not<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> problem

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
not the problem

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.630 
not the problem
we<00:01:55.320> need<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.560> start<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.979> need<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> finish<00:01:56.340> them

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
we need to start we need to finish them

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
we need to start we need to finish them
so<00:01:57.119> hopefully<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.780> heading<00:01:58.170> into<00:01:58.290> this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so hopefully you know heading into this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.980 
so hopefully you know heading into this
game<00:01:58.710> where<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.759> coming<00:02:00.570> off<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.960> loss

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
game where you know coming off of a loss

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.530 
game where you know coming off of a loss
obviously<00:02:01.920> our<00:02:02.820> team<00:02:03.030> picked<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.360> pretty

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
obviously our team picked that pretty

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.899 
obviously our team picked that pretty
hard<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.130> know<00:02:05.250> maybe<00:02:05.460> as

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
hard and I think that you know maybe as

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.399 
hard and I think that you know maybe as
of<00:02:06.420> right<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.020> best<00:02:07.229> thing<00:02:07.350> for

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
of right now that's the best thing for

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.070 
of right now that's the best thing for
us<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.239> figure

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
us so we can really just kind of figure

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.510 
us so we can really just kind of figure
out<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.649> what<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.039> need<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
out you know what we need to do as a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.460 
out you know what we need to do as a
team<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.120> come<00:02:12.300> together

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
team and come together

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.530 
team and come together
and<00:02:13.530> start<00:02:14.100> scoring<00:02:14.370> some<00:02:14.520> goals<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> winning

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and start scoring some goals and winning

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.920 
and start scoring some goals and winning
I<00:02:15.750> think<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.590> we've<00:02:17.250> had<00:02:17.490> two<00:02:17.930> solid

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
I think that we've had two solid

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.780 
I think that we've had two solid
defensive<00:02:19.410> games<00:02:19.710> obviously<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.520> haven't

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
defensive games obviously we haven't

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.760 
defensive games obviously we haven't
gotten<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.060> results<00:02:21.350> against<00:02:22.350> Japan<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.740> was

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
gotten the results against Japan it was

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.790 
gotten the results against Japan it was
a<00:02:22.890> set-piece<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.960> against<00:02:24.960> Sweden<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.680> was

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
a set-piece and against Sweden it was

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.890 
a set-piece and against Sweden it was
really<00:02:26.040> against<00:02:26.250> Toronto<00:02:26.610> play<00:02:26.850> both<00:02:27.630> great

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
really against Toronto play both great

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600 
really against Toronto play both great
opponents<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.740> really<00:02:29.070> felt<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
opponents but I really felt like the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.880 
opponents but I really felt like the
defense<00:02:29.970> did<00:02:30.300> well<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.470> midfield<00:02:31.650> in

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
defense did well and in the midfield in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.380 
defense did well and in the midfield in
the<00:02:31.950> forwards<00:02:32.250> obviously<00:02:32.580> team<00:02:32.850> defense<00:02:33.210> did

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the forwards obviously team defense did

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.540 
the forwards obviously team defense did
well<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.870> kind<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.380> stymie<00:02:34.800> any<00:02:34.950> real<00:02:35.160> attack

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
well to kind of stymie any real attack

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.550 
well to kind of stymie any real attack
and<00:02:35.910> any<00:02:36.360> chance<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.840> play<00:02:36.990> another<00:02:37.140> game<00:02:37.350> as<00:02:37.530> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and any chance to play another game as a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.770 
and any chance to play another game as a
chance<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.950> get<00:02:38.100> better<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.210> know<00:02:39.570> we

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that you know we've got tremendous

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.990 
good performance for our fans
I<00:02:55.260> think<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.340> know<00:02:56.459> obviously<00:02:56.850> we

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I think that you know obviously we

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.850 
I think that you know obviously we
didn't<00:02:57.300> get<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.660> results<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.230> really

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
didn't get the results that we really

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.140 
didn't get the results that we really
truly<00:02:59.100> wanted<00:02:59.459> out<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.760> first<00:02:59.970> two

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
truly wanted out of the first two

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.570 
truly wanted out of the first two
matches<00:03:00.570> but<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.410> little<00:03:02.310> bit<00:03:02.520> of

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
matches but I think a little bit of

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.370 
matches but I think a little bit of
adversity<00:03:03.030> I'll<00:03:03.360> be<00:03:03.510> good<00:03:03.750> for<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.230> group

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
adversity I'll be good for this group

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.590 
adversity I'll be good for this group

players we need to you know turn that

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.970
