today would I have for you guys is a new

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.830 
today would I have for you guys is a new
DLC<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:22.700> we<00:00:22.790> might<00:00:23.029> be<00:00:23.180> seeing<00:00:23.420> in<00:00:23.540> college

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
DLC that we might be seeing in college

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.780 
DLC that we might be seeing in college
in<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.050> advanced<00:00:24.320> warfare<00:00:24.710> relatively<00:00:25.430> soon

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
in the advanced warfare relatively soon

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.970 
in the advanced warfare relatively soon
and<00:00:26.090> I<00:00:26.750> would<00:00:26.900> assume<00:00:27.350> that<00:00:27.410> this<00:00:27.680> is<00:00:27.740> going<00:00:27.920> to

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
and I would assume that this is going to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.060 
and I would assume that this is going to
be<00:00:28.100> added<00:00:28.400> into<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.760> advanced<00:00:29.390> supply<00:00:29.750> drops

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
be added into the advanced supply drops

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.290 
be added into the advanced supply drops
drop<00:00:31.070> that<00:00:31.340> you<00:00:31.460> can<00:00:31.610> actually<00:00:31.789> get<00:00:32.059> from

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
drop that you can actually get from

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.299 
drop that you can actually get from
getting<00:00:32.450> advanced<00:00:32.930> supply<00:00:33.200> drops<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:33.800> there's

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
getting advanced supply drops so there's

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.950 
getting advanced supply drops so there's
a<00:00:34.400> guy<00:00:34.550> named<00:00:34.820> twinsen<00:00:35.390> he<00:00:35.570> was<00:00:35.690> playing<00:00:35.870> a

warfare when it comes to EXO suits like

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.179 
warfare when it comes to EXO suits like
I'd<00:01:35.030> really<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.600> see<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.170> turtle<00:01:36.799> when<00:01:37.070> we

saw the Eco XO but it wasn't really a
turtle<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.250> think<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.700> they<00:01:40.939> should<00:01:40.970> do<00:01:41.330> that

turtle I think that they should do that

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.810 
turtle I think that they should do that
for<00:01:41.900> sure<00:01:41.930> add<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:42.979> some<00:01:43.250> sort<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.580> like

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
type thing it doesn't necessarily have

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.830 
type thing it doesn't necessarily have
to<00:01:57.590> be<00:01:57.770> Superman<00:01:58.250> but<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.420> would<00:01:59.540> be<00:01:59.630> really

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
to be Superman but that would be really

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.080 
to be Superman but that would be really
cool<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.560> like<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.979> cape<00:02:01.220> goes<00:02:01.520> up<00:02:01.759> when<00:02:01.970> you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
cool and like the cape goes up when you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.840 
cool and like the cape goes up when you
like<00:02:02.299> glide<00:02:03.229> through<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.680> air<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.579> know

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
like glide through the air like you know

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.440 
like glide through the air like you know
boost<00:02:05.450> jumper<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.560> whatnot<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:08.209> think

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
boost jumper and whatnot and I think

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.639 
boost jumper and whatnot and I think
that<00:02:08.570> would<00:02:08.630> be<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:08.810> cool<00:02:09.079> guys<00:02:09.440> but

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that would be really cool guys but

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.650 
that would be really cool guys but
there's<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.190> many<00:02:10.399> possibilities<00:02:10.729> in

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
there's so many possibilities in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.420 
there's so many possibilities in
advanced<00:02:12.200> warfare<00:02:12.620> what<00:02:12.980> we're<00:02:13.130> going<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.400> be
