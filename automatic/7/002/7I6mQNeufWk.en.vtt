00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi everyone, how are you today's video? 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.339
 be super fast I want to talk to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.529
 about a product I have 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.240
 used and liked it a lot 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.800
 whenever I ask you what 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.410
 kind of video you want to have a channel 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.719
 You always ask me for video of resende. 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.300
 products and many people ask me 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 cosmetics store product reviews 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.519
 so I got this productive here 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.920
 recently and started to leave 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.349
 and this here is the mask of treatment of the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 incra 30 a thing pictures you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.980
 probably know that this more 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320
 calm is not released to new she 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 will be released to mad because she as 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.420
 has a silicone on what is the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.180
 income stayed but as you know I 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 I'm still younger than the crazy but still 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.219
 so I wash my hair with a shampoo 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.620
 without a fact at least once a month 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 so how do I wash my hair at least? 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.890
 once a month with the ground conscience 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.620
 fact that they can take away when the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.420
 Soluble silicone is for me not so much 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.399
 problem I test this product for 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.989
 Tell him what I think of him for you. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.609
 so I said here that it's a more expensive 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 super moisturizing for hair with 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.360
 big problems 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 The formula of the product has components 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.130
 moisturizers but it also has enough 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.619
 oil such as argan oil, oil of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.229
 avocado seed and she also has to 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.759
 it was used as you know japan 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.430
 will want to be viewed multiple times 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.860
 and has in the protein channel or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.420
 hydrolyzed in general which is the type of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 protein that our hair really 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.040
 can benefit from normal protein 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.509
 if it was not found it is too large 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.729
 our hair can not benefit 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.799
 The hydrolyzed protein is therefore a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 break a small piece so that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.540
 our hair really does have some 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.230
 benefit from this protein and it 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.510
 has protein 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.850
 performed right at the beginning 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.710
 the composition as well as I tried the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.630
 my hair recently I 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.210
 did not use any type of protein 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.340
 in my hair or hydrolyzed protein 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.260
 so I had no need but since 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.420
 that I painted the whole hair and did 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.820
 I think it's important that I 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.220
 has begun to use a type of 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.960
 hydrolyzed protein 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.670
 that I spend the day in the summer 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.170
 whole in the pool where inter on the beach 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.970
 How can you talk? I 'm from 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.550
 little number because I'm going to finish 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.560
 this video the correct beach and wanting 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.150
 not for the pool helps so the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.670
 damage the hair then that too 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.130
 this was the enthroned china also good 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.170
 in this type of occasion it also contains 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.530
 various other types of amino acid such as 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.760
 girl would be in the valley napoli on tv olina 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.690
 isoleucine and focus on the EHEC have 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.390
 product itself is super constant watches me 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.410
 I can toss it as soon as it does not go 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.040
 fall 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.320
 and she has the smell is the smell 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.970
 wonderful has full of chewing gum can 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.160
 be one of the reasons you do not like the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.959
 smell of 12 but I do not think I think 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.930
 that smell is very strong in the hair 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.240
 but I found it very tasty so 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.400
 close to two and very good and this but 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.270
 for us it yields much yields 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.280
 absurd 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.989
 I used it several times in order to 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.510
 Testing for you is my mother too. 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.040
 is using my mother has her hair 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 dyes blond hair is also because 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.180
 She has white hair so she has 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.980
 also used this most expensive yet 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.590
 You can see that it seems that people 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.630
 used to keep its two times at most I 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.430
 I used more times than this one 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.650
 A little bit gives more for now is the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.540
 enough said already feel that there is little 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.520
 amount will make a good effect on 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.770
 your hair you do not have to leave cause 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.959
 of the hair mask use half of that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.820
 pot to have a good application 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.980
 I think the product is distributed super 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.090
 well in the hair and it is very good goes to the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.220
 city ​​in the past 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.349
 I felt the rest hair the lady who 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.569
 is applying knows I liked it a lot 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.330
 of the result I think it gives a 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.840
 good moisturizing in hair yes despite 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.670
 be quite hydrolyzed oil and protein 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.129
 you feel that it seems that the advantage 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.769
 a life with the curls was the space 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.900
 They are much more well defined set 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.989
 with easier and hair stays 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.700
 super soft and super well orient a 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.769
 thing that I really like the products of 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.360
 shop in general is that they do not 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.519
 are tested on animals 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.410
 This is a very positive point that 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.660
 I told you this as well. 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.310
 product that is not led by the new 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.099
 I feel it is the locus doctors in general 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.049
 know how to use silicone insolubles 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.389
 You know my position in relation to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.430
 to insoluble tricolor I prefer not to 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.680
 use in my routine in my hair 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.419
 because my hair fits well without them 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.889
 but I do not think they are the villains 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.760
 that they will destroy your hair nor 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.260
 none of this 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.260
 I think they may be present 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.330
 in product but rather a moderate form 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.860
 What happens here often 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.050
 cosmetics companies do not want 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.820
 invest a lot of money on products and 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.560
 increase in quality and ingredients 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.260
 increased quality and simply 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.820
 make a mark that also painted only 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.740
 silicone in the composition 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.900
 so this mark in my opinion does not 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.030
 will have a good hair fiction but what 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.830
 the belt of cosmetics production is that 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.470
 they use the tricolors or insoluble 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.330
 like moderation for example this product 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.280
 is that he is not released pernambuco that 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.110
 he has silicone he did not see but he only has 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.639
 with the silicone has several other 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.410
 components that are very good for 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.090
 way then I think 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.090
 insoluble when well used 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.850
 used in moderation has no 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.770
 a negative point of this product in my 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.210
 opinion this packaging 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.870
 I do not know if you can see that 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.460
 it is all dirty around product and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.290
 How did I say how the product works? 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.300
 quite a bit of product 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.949
 that you are at your disposal could be 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.930
 practically an application of the product of 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.850
 Your hair I think this packaging 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.430
 she does not close very well you do not 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.080
 you can feel a click of it closing 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.880
 have another lesson product that is 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.190
 testing that it is a newer product that 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.570
 release is that I did not take it 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.700
 I had to show you 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.320
 the orientation of olive oil and not 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.850
 hesitations of the woman in the 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.040
 really have a donut you 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.500
 Do you feel like you're closing it from here? 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.139
 I find it difficult to have to close difficult 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:56.520
 transportable I travel a lot 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.950
 The packaging for me is not very good for 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.169
 other side of the size I think ideal I 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.150
 I think it's a great size for you to test the 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.250
 product as I said I get several 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.720
 applications from here then if you 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.060
 look at personal packaging is very 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.190
 I do not have time to buy 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.539
 been really small but she 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.970
 it's worth it because you will get it 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.680
 several times I received this product from 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.810
 shop outside colleague shop 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.340
