steps of doing the song and at the end
of<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.890> video<00:00:26.189> hopefully<00:00:26.519> you'll<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
song of your own so the first step is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.070 
song of your own so the first step is
thinking<00:00:30.090> about<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> work

thinking about what you have to work
with<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.769> could<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.219> amount<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
with this could be the amount of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.330 
with this could be the amount of
musicians<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.360> maybe<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.410> guitars<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
a bass player maybe a drummer and it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
a bass player maybe a drummer and it's
also<00:00:38.070> thinking<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.820> skill<00:00:39.059> level<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
also thinking about the skill level of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.119

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
to figure out because a lot of bands
just<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.969> everything<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.649> screw

so<00:01:35.610> we're<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.119> about<00:01:36.360> ready<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> start

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so we're just about ready to start

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
so we're just about ready to start
writing<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.530> riffs<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.130> before<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.850> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
writing some riffs but before we do this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
writing some riffs but before we do this
I<00:01:39.150> gotta<00:01:39.329> explain<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.259> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
I gotta explain that a little bit of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.770 
I gotta explain that a little bit of
music<00:01:40.439> theory<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.100> talking<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
music theory I was talking about this is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
music theory I was talking about this is
a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.259> called<00:01:43.500> scale<00:01:43.860> degrees<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a little bit called scale degrees that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.219 
a little bit called scale degrees that
you<00:01:44.460> probably<00:01:45.210> might<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:46.079> know

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you probably might know I don't know

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.620 
you probably might know I don't know
it's<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.700> simple<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.119> learn<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.479> gonna

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it's really simple to learn I'm gonna

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.870 
it's really simple to learn I'm gonna
explain<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.259> 30<00:01:49.590> seconds<00:01:50.070> when

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
explain it in like 30 seconds when

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.249 
explain it in like 30 seconds when
you're<00:01:51.000> playing<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> any<00:01:51.600> scale<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.229> have

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you're playing in any scale you have

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.550 
you're playing in any scale you have
some<00:01:52.950> degrees<00:01:53.810> when<00:01:54.810> you're<00:01:54.930> playing<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> C

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
some degrees when you're playing in a C

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:05.750 
some degrees when you're playing in a C
major<00:01:55.770> scale<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.430> 1<00:01:57.140> 2<00:01:58.140> 3<00:02:00.049> 4<00:02:02.119> 5<00:02:03.710> 6

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
major scale you have 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.400 
major scale you have 1 2 3 4 5 6
seven<00:02:06.800> then<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.920> goes<00:02:08.040> back<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.400> the<00:02:08.490> first<00:02:08.820> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
seven then it goes back to the first and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
seven then it goes back to the first and
then<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:10.980> at<00:02:11.100> sea<00:02:11.340> again<00:02:11.460> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
then because you're at sea again the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.570 
then because you're at sea again the
next<00:02:12.540> note<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.960> a<00:02:12.990> D<00:02:13.230> obviously<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:14.010> then

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
next note will be a D obviously and then

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.100 
next note will be a D obviously and then
you'll<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.850> another<00:02:15.060> second<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.870> keeps

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
you'll have another second it keeps

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.680 
you'll have another second it keeps
going<00:02:16.320> up<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.400> tower<00:02:18.360> afar

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
going up and up and up and up tower afar

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.750 
going up and up and up and up tower afar
you<00:02:18.720> want<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> good<00:02:20.580> thing<00:02:20.730> about

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
you want to go but the good thing about

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.390 
you want to go but the good thing about
this<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.480> transposes<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.710> any<00:02:22.980> key<00:02:23.280> you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
this is it transposes to any key you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.980 
this is it transposes to any key you
like<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.240> were<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> play<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.750> same

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
like so if you were to play that same

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.810 
like so if you were to play that same
progression<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.190> two<00:02:26.310> three<00:02:26.460> four<00:02:26.610> five

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
progression the one two three four five

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.610 
progression the one two three four five
six<00:02:27.000> seven<00:02:27.240> eight<00:02:27.540> which<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.410> major

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
six seven eight which is just a major

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:43.430 
six seven eight which is just a major
scale<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.190> say<00:02:29.640> f<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.330> still<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:43.200> also

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
scale and say f you still have this also

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.020 
scale and say f you still have this also
applies<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.890> minor<00:02:44.250> scale<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.850> if<00:02:44.910> you're

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
applies to minor scale so if you're

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:56.150 
applies to minor scale so if you're
playing<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.540> minor<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:46.140> example<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:56.010> have

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
playing in a minor for example you have

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.770 
playing in a minor for example you have
one<00:02:56.430> two<00:02:56.550> three<00:02:56.670> four<00:02:56.850> five<00:02:57.000> six<00:02:57.150> seven<00:02:57.630> eight

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.800 
one two three four five six seven eight
and<00:02:58.460> then<00:02:59.460> again<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.850> can<00:02:59.970> transpose<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.660> to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and then again you can transpose that to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.260 
and then again you can transpose that to
whatever<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:02.970> helpful

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
whatever you like this is really helpful

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.510 
whatever you like this is really helpful
because<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.870> say<00:03:04.110> play<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.380> one<00:03:04.770> one<00:03:05.100> four

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
because if I say play a one one four

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.550 
because if I say play a one one four
five<00:03:05.820> progression<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.870> automatically<00:03:07.440> know

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
five progression you automatically know

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:17.180 
five progression you automatically know
that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.070 

something<00:03:18.190> like<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.780> that's<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.900> name

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
something like that that's the name

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.640 
something like that that's the name
liner<00:03:20.320> if<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:20.950> wanted<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.310> play<00:03:21.490> any<00:03:22.350> one<00:03:23.350> four

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
liner if you wanted to play any one four

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.490 
liner if you wanted to play any one four
five<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.190> for<00:03:24.640> example<00:03:25.090> D<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.930> can<00:03:26.110> just<00:03:26.350> as

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
five and for example D you can just as

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.130 
five and for example D you can just as
easily<00:03:26.590> do<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.070> using<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.270> same<00:03:28.480> kind<00:03:29.020> of

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
easily do that using the same kind of

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.190 
easily do that using the same kind of
numbers<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.920> one<00:03:30.070> two<00:03:30.220> one<00:03:30.580> four<00:03:30.850> five<00:03:31.200> so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
numbers the one two one four five so

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.530 
numbers the one two one four five so
that's<00:03:32.320> really<00:03:32.620> easy<00:03:32.860> understand<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:33.850> if<00:03:34.300> you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
that's really easy understand and if you

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.940 
that's really easy understand and if you
don't<00:03:34.780> understand<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.530> can<00:03:35.680> probably

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
don't understand that you can probably

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.040 
don't understand that you can probably

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
now for this video I'm gonna use a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.140 
now for this video I'm gonna use a
program<00:04:27.410> called<00:04:27.440> guitar<00:04:28.100> pro<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.430> play<00:04:29.000> the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
program called guitar pro to play the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.970 
program called guitar pro to play the
backup<00:04:29.600> parts<00:04:29.960> or<00:04:30.140> maybe<00:04:30.380> even<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.770> lead

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
backup parts or maybe even the lead

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.220 
backup parts or maybe even the lead
parts<00:04:31.370> just<00:04:32.210> because<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:32.630> don't<00:04:32.810> have<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:32.990> band

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
parts just because I don't have a band

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.020 
parts just because I don't have a band
with<00:04:33.560> me<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.010> I'm<00:04:34.220> not<00:04:34.370> gonna<00:04:34.520> record<00:04:34.880> it

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.880 
with me and I'm not gonna record it
because<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.420> takes<00:04:35.690> way<00:04:36.050> too<00:04:36.080> long<00:04:36.380> for<00:04:36.620> a

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
because that takes way too long for a

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.090 
because that takes way too long for a
video<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.500> I'm<00:04:39.590> just<00:04:39.620> gonna<00:04:39.860> throw
