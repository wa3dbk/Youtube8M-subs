00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.020 
playing my mother how is this ever gonna
work<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.809> worked<00:00:40.559> out<00:00:40.739> quite<00:00:41.460> nicely<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
work but it worked out quite nicely and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
work but it worked out quite nicely and
and<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.079> became<00:00:43.320> such<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and I think it just became such a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
and I think it just became such a
natural<00:00:44.579> relationship<00:00:45.059> between<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.960> two<00:00:46.140> of

natural relationship between the two of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.650 
natural relationship between the two of
us<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.219> there's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> lot<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.270> element

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
us I think there's a lot of the element

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.689 
us I think there's a lot of the element
of<00:00:48.690> living<00:00:49.050> through<00:00:49.260> her<00:00:49.350> daughter<00:00:49.710> which<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699
