00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
like delicious fruit just out of reach

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.920 
like delicious fruit just out of reach
through<00:02:48.410> no<00:02:48.620> fault<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:49.010> my<00:02:49.190> own<00:02:49.660> style<00:02:50.660> for<00:02:50.870> the

switching<00:02:55.730> up<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.910> mechanics<00:02:56.360> like<00:02:56.540> using

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
switching up the mechanics like using

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.810 
switching up the mechanics like using
explosions<00:02:57.650> instead<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.160> continuous<00:02:58.610> beam

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
or adding underwater segments I guess

I'm<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.060> gonna<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.510> use<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:04.390> mouse<00:03:05.390> to

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
I'm just gonna have to use a mouse to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.260 
I'm just gonna have to use a mouse to
get<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.260> most<00:03:06.290> out<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:06.860> one<00:03:07.150> yeah<00:03:08.150> I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
get the most out of this one yeah I

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:18.360 
get the most out of this one yeah I
thought<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.450> was<00:03:08.600> done<00:03:08.840> with<00:03:08.900> those
