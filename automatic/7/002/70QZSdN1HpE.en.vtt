00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 yes we probably already noticed 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.090
 Match attax has come out extra and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.070
 of course I have the same for me directly 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.620
 Collection folder orders the starter pack 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.420
 do not say that starter pack he has as 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.820
 a collection folder third of course 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.730
 Collector magazine with playing field and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.039
 game rules four cards and one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.460
 exclusive limited card there is no 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.369
 Booster inside or a booster with 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.019
 a limited card but I have 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.110
 Seen this and I do not see that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.450
 after a booster unfortunately costs eight 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.829
 Euro 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.620
 but worth it anyway 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.030
 so we cut it open and then 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.390
 it starts immediately 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 that will be fun i am looking forward to each one 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.180
 times when the new series comes out one 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.629
 just discover so much new and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.550
 then unfortunately now for a long time where 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.739
 nothing came out is bundesliga crowe 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.059
 will be out soon but yes the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.170
 Last month is not so much 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.480
 came out and I really thought so 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.670
 is a great pity on tiles Canada 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.290
 not that much happened 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.320
 a collector magazine that makes me happy 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.229
 Naturally 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.049
 if only because collector occurs in it 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.799
 where a huge playing field and actually 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.290
 only in terms of me not really 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.640
 interest 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.579
 rules of play and so what behind in there 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 ok then the collection folder it is 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.439
 the 22 booklets for the collection folder 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.900
 you have to wrap up too 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.689
 that is not so exciting for you now 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 and there are also the cards fall away 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.479
 Here are the new cool five 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:54.060
 special cards match attax extra stand 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.070
 as limited edition cool unfortunately no 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.340
 booster which I somehow extremely pity 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.340
 find 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.850
 but that does not matter the cards are 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.170
 also a bit crooked anyway 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:19.140
 namely each pad kruse one 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:26.250
 reversed card costs ludwig as 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:29.340
 scorer and semper rio as rookie okay 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.600
 So there are new types of cards that was yes 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.000
 also already clear that's just match attax 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.480
 extra 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.110
 there are apparently scouts and rookies 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.910
 and maybe we learn too 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.640
 somewhere that is because everything is so 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.209
 there are scorer first and second 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.720
 Bundesliga 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.930
 cap cards duo cards matchwinner and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.940
 club 100 hat trick heroes then it works 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.450
 continue here 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:05.269
 there are new transfers and cadres 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.950
 extensions captains new and cookies 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.150
 what characterizes a rookie then can 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.410
 you write that I have no 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.390
 Imagine what distinguishes a groupie 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.019
 yes that was it with this video is a 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.280
 short video but that only for a short time 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.970
 to conceal the collection folder 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.340
 been 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.340
 nice until next time
