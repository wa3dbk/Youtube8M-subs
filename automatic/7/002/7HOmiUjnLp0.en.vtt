00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
we are and also here in Perth County a

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.220 
we are and also here in Perth County a
lot<00:00:28.129> of<00:00:28.250> rain<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:28.759> what<00:00:29.599> we're<00:00:29.750> gonna<00:00:29.899> do<00:00:30.079> today

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
lot of rain so what we're gonna do today

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.470 
lot of rain so what we're gonna do today
is<00:00:30.379> to<00:00:30.800> around<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:31.250> truck<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:31.759> use<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.119> the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
is to around the truck and use the the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.569 
is to around the truck and use the the
camera<00:00:32.719> as<00:00:32.989> our<00:00:33.170> tool<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:34.039> go<00:00:34.160> look<00:00:34.370> at<00:00:34.489> the

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
camera as our tool to go look at the

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.490 
camera as our tool to go look at the
sins<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.090> spring<00:00:35.420> let's<00:00:36.079> see<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:36.379> we<00:00:36.469> can

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
sins of the spring let's see what we can

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.350 
sins of the spring let's see what we can
learn<00:00:36.829> for<00:00:37.070> our<00:00:37.190> management<00:00:37.640> strategies<00:00:38.090> for

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
learn for our management strategies for

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.829 
learn for our management strategies for
next<00:00:38.570> year

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.049 

so<00:00:43.839> in<00:00:43.960> this<00:00:44.109> field<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.800> grower<00:00:45.039> use<00:00:45.699> a<00:00:45.730> roller

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
so in this field the grower use a roller

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.970 
so in this field the grower use a roller
Packer<00:00:46.420> which<00:00:47.079> is<00:00:47.230> normally<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:47.829> know<00:00:47.949> a

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
Packer which is normally you know a

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.950 
Packer which is normally you know a
fairly<00:00:48.370> good<00:00:48.640> idea<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:49.149> kind<00:00:49.329> of<00:00:49.390> firms<00:00:49.629> up<00:00:49.839> the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
fairly good idea it kind of firms up the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.770 
fairly good idea it kind of firms up the
seedbed<00:00:50.199> keeps<00:00:50.859> good<00:00:51.149> good<00:00:52.149> seed<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.659> soil

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
seedbed keeps good good seed to soil

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.920 
seedbed keeps good good seed to soil
contact<00:00:52.930> on<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.710> soybeans<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:55.390> in<00:00:55.479> this<00:00:55.629> case

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
contact on the soybeans but in this case

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.479 
contact on the soybeans but in this case
where<00:00:56.260> we've<00:00:56.440> had<00:00:56.620> heavy<00:00:56.890> rain<00:00:57.010> we've

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
where we've had heavy rain we've

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.329 
where we've had heavy rain we've
actually<00:00:57.940> caught<00:00:58.329> some<00:00:58.629> ponding<00:00:59.079> so<00:00:59.680> what

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
actually caught some ponding so what

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.029 
actually caught some ponding so what
happens<00:01:00.729> is<00:01:00.879> you<00:01:01.059> since<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:01.719> is<00:01:02.039> competitive

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
happens is you since it is competitive

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.160 
happens is you since it is competitive
soil<00:01:03.399> is<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.610> little<00:01:03.879> bit<00:01:04.000> compacted<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:04.989> don't

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
soil is a little bit compacted you don't

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.410 
soil is a little bit compacted you don't
get<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.470> good<00:01:05.590> water<00:01:05.950> infiltration<00:01:06.399> so<00:01:07.060> you

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
get the good water infiltration so you

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.940 
get the good water infiltration so you
don't<00:01:07.600> get<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:07.869> percolating<00:01:08.470> through<00:01:08.500> if

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
don't get it percolating through if

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.920 
don't get it percolating through if
you're<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.399> say<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.700> have<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.030> have<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.659> non

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
you're to say to have a have a non

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.929 
you're to say to have a have a non
packed<00:01:11.289> soil<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.250> can<00:01:12.399> actually<00:01:12.580> cause

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
packed soil and you can actually cause

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.490 
packed soil and you can actually cause
some<00:01:13.210> ponding<00:01:13.539> now<00:01:13.689> this<00:01:13.899> is<00:01:14.050> obviously<00:01:14.170> an

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
some ponding now this is obviously an

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.040 
some ponding now this is obviously an
extreme<00:01:14.860> condition<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:16.360> here<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:16.810> Perth

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
extreme condition because here in Perth

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.639 
extreme condition because here in Perth
County<00:01:17.289> we<00:01:18.039> have<00:01:18.280> had<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.550> lot<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:18.970> rain<00:01:19.649> but

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
County we have had a lot of rain but

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.919 
County we have had a lot of rain but
this<00:01:21.190> is<00:01:21.369> something<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:21.789> can<00:01:22.149> happen<00:01:22.630> if<00:01:22.750> you

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
this is something that can happen if you

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.020 
this is something that can happen if you
if<00:01:23.140> if<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.950> do<00:01:24.039> get<00:01:24.220> extreme<00:01:24.550> rains<00:01:24.759> after

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
if if you do get extreme rains after

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.330 
if if you do get extreme rains after
packing<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:26.140> next<00:01:26.440> thing<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.619> that<00:01:27.039> is<00:01:27.220> an

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
packing the next thing that that is an

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.100 
packing the next thing that that is an
issue<00:01:27.460> if<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:27.909> do<00:01:28.090> for<00:01:28.330> example<00:01:28.360> get<00:01:28.869> some

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
issue if we do for example get some

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.149 
issue if we do for example get some
extreme<00:01:29.610> hot<00:01:30.610> weather<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:32.259> can<00:01:32.500> obviously<00:01:32.920> get

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
extreme hot weather we can obviously get

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.639 
extreme hot weather we can obviously get
a<00:01:33.220> crust<00:01:33.580> on<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.119> soil<00:01:34.420> here<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:35.470> a

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
a crust on this this soil here is is a

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.850 
a crust on this this soil here is is a
clay<00:01:36.100> loam<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.940> is<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.090> little<00:01:37.390> finer<00:01:37.860> soil

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
clay loam so it is a little finer soil

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.279 
clay loam so it is a little finer soil
texture<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.700> what<00:01:40.090> happens<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.659> as<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.140> get

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
texture and what happens is as you get

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.859 
texture and what happens is as you get
the<00:01:41.500> rain<00:01:41.740> droplets<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.940> know<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.390> along

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
the rain droplets you know and along

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.050 
the rain droplets you know and along
with<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:44.229> fine<00:01:44.560> word<00:01:44.799> soil<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.490> kind<00:01:46.000> of

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
with that fine word soil it kind of

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.790 
with that fine word soil it kind of
explodes<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.750> soil<00:01:46.989> so<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.289> makes<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.619> even

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
explodes the soil so it makes the even

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100 
explodes the soil so it makes the even
finer<00:01:48.099> and<00:01:48.369> then<00:01:48.879> the<00:01:49.420> best<00:01:49.599> way<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.840> think<00:01:50.020> of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
finer and then the best way to think of

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.010 
finer and then the best way to think of
it<00:01:50.229> it's<00:01:50.440> just<00:01:50.470> like<00:01:50.830> putting<00:01:51.720> using<00:01:52.720> clay<00:01:52.959> so

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
it it's just like putting using clay so

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.529 
it it's just like putting using clay so
you<00:01:53.349> got<00:01:53.649> that<00:01:53.830> clay<00:01:54.160> it's<00:01:54.399> fine<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.060> then<00:01:55.420> you

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
you got that clay it's fine and then you

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.100 
you got that clay it's fine and then you
get<00:01:55.629> some<00:01:55.869> really<00:01:56.020> hot<00:01:56.700> hot<00:01:57.869> conditions<00:01:58.869> with

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
get some really hot hot conditions with

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.249 
get some really hot hot conditions with
wind<00:01:59.739> and<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:01.060> warm<00:02:01.300> sunlight<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.080> you

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
wind and really warm sunlight and you

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.499 
wind and really warm sunlight and you
can<00:02:02.379> actually<00:02:02.709> cause<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> crust<00:02:03.399> which<00:02:04.060> which

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
can actually cause a crust which which

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.180 
can actually cause a crust which which
makes<00:02:04.539> it<00:02:04.899> really<00:02:04.929> hard<00:02:05.289> for<00:02:05.349> the<00:02:05.560> soybeans<00:02:05.979> to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
makes it really hard for the soybeans to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.580 
makes it really hard for the soybeans to
come<00:02:06.489> out<00:02:06.610> as<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.849> as<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.840> meso<00:02:08.140> coddles

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
come out as the as the meso coddles

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.619 
come out as the as the meso coddles
trying<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.890> knuckle<00:02:09.129> out<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.759> soil<00:02:10.000> it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
trying to knuckle out of the soil it

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.150 
trying to knuckle out of the soil it
keeps<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.110> pushing<00:02:11.349> harder<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:11.890> harder<00:02:12.099> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
keeps on pushing harder and harder and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.520 
keeps on pushing harder and harder and
sometimes<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.760> actually<00:02:12.910> break<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
sometimes you can actually break the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.290 
sometimes you can actually break the
cotyledons<00:02:14.830> right<00:02:15.310> off<00:02:15.550> which<00:02:15.910> obviously

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
cotyledons right off which obviously

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.110 
cotyledons right off which obviously
kills<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> soybeans<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:18.970> is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
kills the soybeans so you know this is

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.940 
kills the soybeans so you know this is
one<00:02:19.300> thing<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:19.629> it's<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.650> certain

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
one thing that it's a certain

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.830 
one thing that it's a certain
circumstance<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:21.819> not<00:02:21.940> every<00:02:22.330> year<00:02:22.599> but

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
circumstance it's not every year but

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.050 
circumstance it's not every year but
something<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.590> did<00:02:23.800> happen<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.310> year<00:02:24.370> with

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
something that did happen this year with

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.780 
something that did happen this year with
all<00:02:25.180> their<00:02:25.360> heavy<00:02:25.540> rain<00:02:26.280> all<00:02:27.280> right<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.610> here's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
all their heavy rain all right so here's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.030 
all their heavy rain all right so here's
an<00:02:27.940> example<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.480> two<00:02:28.930> different<00:02:29.260> different

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
an example of two different different

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.430 
an example of two different different
soybeans<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.790> two<00:02:30.909> different<00:02:31.060> environments

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
soybeans in two different environments

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.619 
soybeans in two different environments
so<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.830> here<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.940> one<00:02:34.000> came<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:34.510> of

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
so this one here this one came out of

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.390 
so this one here this one came out of
the<00:02:34.690> soil<00:02:34.870> easily<00:02:35.500> as<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:35.950> see<00:02:36.159> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the soil easily as you can see the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.270 
the soil easily as you can see the
musical<00:02:37.209> here<00:02:37.599> isn't<00:02:38.290> swollen<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.830> came<00:02:39.040> up

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
musical here isn't swollen it came up

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.850 
musical here isn't swollen it came up
the<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.480> knuckled<00:02:40.959> here<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.440> actually<00:02:41.650> the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
the it knuckled here and actually the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.220 
the it knuckled here and actually the
cotyledons<00:02:42.159> are<00:02:42.459> turning<00:02:42.730> green<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.540> it

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
cotyledons are turning green so it it

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.440 
cotyledons are turning green so it it
hit<00:02:44.470> sunlight<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.909> soybean<00:02:46.209> was

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
hit sunlight so this soybean was

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.740 
hit sunlight so this soybean was
emerging<00:02:46.959> like<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.260> should<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.569> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
emerging like it should this one on the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.170 
emerging like it should this one on the
other<00:02:49.780> hand<00:02:50.200> has<00:02:50.560> had<00:02:50.739> some<00:02:50.950> trouble<00:02:51.099> as<00:02:51.519> you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
other hand has had some trouble as you

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.470 
other hand has had some trouble as you
can<00:02:52.329> see<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.749> music<00:02:53.109> Caudill<00:02:53.379> here<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.709> more

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
can see the music Caudill here is more

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.199 
can see the music Caudill here is more
:<00:02:54.900> then<00:02:55.319> he<00:02:55.530> than<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:57.090> actually

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
: then he than this one so it's actually

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.759 
: then he than this one so it's actually
put<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.720> had<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.019> push<00:02:58.230> through<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.590> dirt

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
put it had to push through the dirt

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920 
put it had to push through the dirt
harder<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.549> was<00:02:59.700> it<00:03:00.120> was<00:03:00.180> working<00:03:00.629> harder

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
harder so it was it was working harder

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.809 
harder so it was it was working harder
to<00:03:00.989> make<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.140> through<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:02.190> was<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.670> starting

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
to make it through it was just starting

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.880 
to make it through it was just starting
to<00:03:03.000> knuckle<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.959> as<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.319> see<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> knuckle

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
to knuckle so as you can see the knuckle

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.559 
to knuckle so as you can see the knuckle
here<00:03:05.010> was<00:03:05.190> starting<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.459> turn<00:03:05.640> green<00:03:06.000> because

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
here was starting to turn green because

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.619 
here was starting to turn green because
it<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:06.890> intercepting<00:03:07.890> sunlight<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
it was intercepting sunlight but the the

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.630 
it was intercepting sunlight but the the
cotyledon<00:03:10.170> was<00:03:10.349> still<00:03:10.860> yellow<00:03:11.129> so<00:03:11.310> as<00:03:11.459> and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
cotyledon was still yellow so as and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.850 
cotyledon was still yellow so as and
seen<00:03:11.819> sunlight<00:03:12.120> yet<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:13.500> beam<00:03:13.739> will

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
seen sunlight yet this beam will

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.229 
seen sunlight yet this beam will
probably<00:03:14.160> be<00:03:14.220> okay<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:15.000> shows<00:03:15.209> the

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
probably be okay but it just shows the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.630 
probably be okay but it just shows the
difference<00:03:15.720> between<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.200> two<00:03:16.379> on<00:03:16.709> how<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
difference between the two on how the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.850 
difference between the two on how the
the<00:03:18.090> beam<00:03:18.269> has<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.599> work<00:03:18.720> harder<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.650> make<00:03:19.830> it

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
the beam has to work harder to make it

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.030 
the beam has to work harder to make it
through<00:03:20.360> tougher<00:03:21.360> soil<00:03:21.540> conditions<00:03:22.049> well

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
through tougher soil conditions well

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.500 
through tougher soil conditions well
lady<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.250> give<00:03:23.370> kudos<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.849> quarry<00:03:24.090> did<00:03:24.360> we

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
lady to give kudos to the quarry did we

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.630 
lady to give kudos to the quarry did we
do<00:03:24.659> have<00:03:24.900> 30<00:03:25.110> percent<00:03:25.560> residue<00:03:25.980> cover<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.400> here

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
do have 30 percent residue cover on here

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.430 
do have 30 percent residue cover on here
so<00:03:26.940> definitely<00:03:27.629> didn't<00:03:27.840> overwork<00:03:28.200> it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
so definitely didn't overwork it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.660 
so definitely didn't overwork it
everything<00:03:28.829> looks<00:03:29.040> good<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.459> way

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
everything looks good that way

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.180 
everything looks good that way
unfortunately<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.810> biggest<00:03:30.959> issue<00:03:31.620> here<00:03:31.799> is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
unfortunately the biggest issue here is

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.160 
unfortunately the biggest issue here is
just<00:03:32.459> too<00:03:32.760> much<00:03:32.940> rain<00:03:33.239> we've<00:03:33.629> had<00:03:33.660> too<00:03:33.989> much

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
just too much rain we've had too much

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.289 
just too much rain we've had too much
rain<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.920> area<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.489> that's<00:03:35.670> causing<00:03:36.030> all

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
rain in this area and that's causing all

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.050 
rain in this area and that's causing all
this<00:03:36.450> pond<00:03:36.739> ponding<00:03:37.739> one<00:03:38.670> more<00:03:38.879> other

this pond ponding one more other
management<00:03:39.510> strategy<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.170> maybe<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.590> use<00:03:40.680> a

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
management strategy is maybe to use a

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.860 
management strategy is maybe to use a
crow<00:03:41.010> foot<00:03:41.220> Packer<00:03:41.519> instead<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.629> roller

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
crow foot Packer instead of a roller

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.979 
crow foot Packer instead of a roller
Packer<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:44.069> roller<00:03:44.280> Packer<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.239> you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
Packer the roller Packer is just you

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.300 
Packer the roller Packer is just you
know<00:03:46.109> firming<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.859> compacting<00:03:47.280> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
know firming up and compacting the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.740 
know firming up and compacting the
ground<00:03:47.519> which<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.150> know<00:03:48.269> like<00:03:48.599> I<00:03:48.690> said

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
ground which you know like I said

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.390 
ground which you know like I said
earlier<00:03:49.170> decreases<00:03:49.950> water<00:03:50.129> infiltration

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
earlier decreases water infiltration

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.009 
earlier decreases water infiltration
where<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:50.940> crow<00:03:51.120> foot<00:03:51.269> Packer<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.780> wouldn't

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
where the crow foot Packer you wouldn't

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.369 
where the crow foot Packer you wouldn't
have<00:03:52.109> that<00:03:52.290> issue

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.600 

so<00:03:57.379> we<00:03:57.470> just<00:03:57.620> got<00:03:57.799> out<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.010> truck<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.459> it

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
so we just got out of the truck to it

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.250 
so we just got out of the truck to it
check<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:59.030> stand<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.540> emergence<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
check the stand and emergence of the

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.530 
check the stand and emergence of the
this<00:04:00.560> cornfield<00:04:00.920> here<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.760> said<00:04:02.030> about<00:04:02.209> to

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
this cornfield here it said about to

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.530 
this cornfield here it said about to
leaf<00:04:02.840> as<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.950> can<00:04:04.099> see<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.760> has<00:04:04.970> had<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.269> little

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
leaf as you can see it has had a little

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.869 
leaf as you can see it has had a little
bit<00:04:05.690> of<00:04:05.720> frost<00:04:06.080> damage<00:04:06.430> which<00:04:07.430> isn't<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.730> big

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
bit of frost damage which isn't a big

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.789 
bit of frost damage which isn't a big
deal<00:04:08.090> because<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:09.140> leaf<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.530> growing

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
deal because that to leaf the growing

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.399 
deal because that to leaf the growing
point<00:04:10.099> is<00:04:10.310> still<00:04:10.519> below<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.849> ground<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:11.930> as

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
point is still below the ground so as

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.930 
point is still below the ground so as
long<00:04:12.560> as<00:04:12.620> we<00:04:12.920> got<00:04:13.040> some<00:04:13.220> hot<00:04:13.400> weather<00:04:13.549> which<00:04:13.909> is

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
long as we got some hot weather which is

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.330 
long as we got some hot weather which is
coming<00:04:14.360> up<00:04:14.510> here<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.930> should<00:04:15.140> easily<00:04:15.409> grow<00:04:16.160> up

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
coming up here it should easily grow up

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.520 
coming up here it should easily grow up
grow<00:04:16.549> out<00:04:16.729> of<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.900> corn<00:04:18.139> will<00:04:18.260> be<00:04:18.380> up

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
grow out of it and this corn will be up

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.909 
grow out of it and this corn will be up
and<00:04:18.709> ready<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.160> rock<00:04:19.370> again<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.500> stand<00:04:21.769> on

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
and ready to rock again the the stand on

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.030 
and ready to rock again the the stand on
this<00:04:22.100> this<00:04:22.400> field<00:04:22.669> is<00:04:22.820> pretty<00:04:22.970> good<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:24.560> was<00:04:24.770> it

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
this this field is pretty good it was it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.670 
this this field is pretty good it was it
was<00:04:25.130> about<00:04:25.220> six<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.699> a<00:04:25.790> half<00:04:25.850> inches<00:04:26.680> spacing

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
was about six and a half inches spacing

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.510 
was about six and a half inches spacing
which<00:04:27.889> is<00:04:28.100> right<00:04:28.880> about<00:04:29.260> 32<00:04:30.260> thousand<00:04:30.979> plants

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
which is right about 32 thousand plants

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.270 
which is right about 32 thousand plants
per<00:04:31.729> acre<00:04:31.810> tried<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.900> look<00:04:33.050> for<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:34.160> other

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
per acre tried to look for the other

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.189 
per acre tried to look for the other
thing<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.490> look<00:04:34.610> at<00:04:34.760> is<00:04:34.910> emergence<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.810> there

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
thing you look at is emergence and there

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.189 
thing you look at is emergence and there
there<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:37.100> little<00:04:37.729> bit<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:38.510> some<00:04:38.780> emerges

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
there is a little bit of as some emerges

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.689 
there is a little bit of as some emerges
issued<00:04:39.470> an<00:04:39.560> uneven<00:04:40.070> emergence<00:04:40.550> in<00:04:40.669> this<00:04:40.820> field

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
issued an uneven emergence in this field

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.400 
issued an uneven emergence in this field
so<00:04:43.699> now<00:04:43.850> is<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.030> great<00:04:44.150> great<00:04:44.720> opportunity<00:04:44.960> to

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
so now is a great great opportunity to

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.680 
so now is a great great opportunity to
to<00:04:45.889> look<00:04:46.010> at<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.250> importance<00:04:46.760> of<00:04:46.850> emergence

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
to look at the importance of emergence

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.020 
to look at the importance of emergence
and<00:04:47.960> what<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.380> can<00:04:48.560> mean<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.889> you<00:04:49.010> so<00:04:49.699> as<00:04:49.729> you

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and what that can mean to you so as you

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.820 
and what that can mean to you so as you
can<00:04:50.150> see<00:04:50.210> in<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.600> field<00:04:50.780> here<00:04:51.169> we<00:04:51.320> have<00:04:51.530> we

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
can see in the field here we have we

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.820 
can see in the field here we have we
have<00:04:51.949> two<00:04:52.130> leaf<00:04:52.340> corn<00:04:53.199> just<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.440> left<00:04:54.590> of

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
have two leaf corn just to the left of

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.340 
have two leaf corn just to the left of
this<00:04:54.919> corn<00:04:55.220> it<00:04:55.430> is<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.639> later<00:04:56.240> emergere<00:04:56.900> you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
this corn it is a later emergere you

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.689 
this corn it is a later emergere you
know<00:04:57.470> it's<00:04:57.650> just<00:04:57.800> kind<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.100> poking<00:04:58.580> through

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
know it's just kind of poking through

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.050 
know it's just kind of poking through
the<00:04:58.789> ground<00:04:59.090> and<00:05:00.080> so<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:01.280> you<00:05:01.520> can<00:05:01.760> lose<00:05:02.000> some

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
the ground and so you you can lose some

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.659 
the ground and so you you can lose some
yield<00:05:02.680> from<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:03.800> because<00:05:04.099> it<00:05:04.220> is<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.490> leave

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
yield from this because it is to leave

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.790 
yield from this because it is to leave
behind<00:05:04.849> so<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.270> great<00:05:05.660> way<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:06.020> check<00:05:06.530> this

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
behind so a great way to check this

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.860 
behind so a great way to check this
throughout<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.400> season<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:07.970> is<00:05:08.479> you<00:05:08.720> can

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
throughout the season is is you can

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.350 
throughout the season is is you can
stick<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.110> flag<00:05:09.410> in<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:09.680> right<00:05:09.830> now<00:05:09.889> so<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:11.090> idea

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
stick a flag in it right now so the idea

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.440 
stick a flag in it right now so the idea
is<00:05:11.539> just<00:05:11.720> take<00:05:11.840> a<00:05:11.870> flag<00:05:12.169> in<00:05:12.410> it<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.729> as<00:05:13.729> you<00:05:14.300> get

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
is just take a flag in it and as you get

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.540 
is just take a flag in it and as you get
to<00:05:14.570> harvest<00:05:14.960> time<00:05:15.110> go<00:05:15.380> back<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:15.919> look<00:05:16.280> at<00:05:16.430> that

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
to harvest time go back and look at that

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.360 
to harvest time go back and look at that
flag<00:05:16.940> there<00:05:17.539> chance<00:05:18.500> that<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.800> odds<00:05:18.950> are<00:05:19.220> is

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
flag there chance that the odds are is

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.320 
flag there chance that the odds are is
you're<00:05:19.550> probably<00:05:19.700> gonna<00:05:20.000> have<00:05:20.210> an

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
you're probably gonna have an

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.750 
you're probably gonna have an
unharvested<00:05:20.780> ear<00:05:21.470> either<00:05:21.860> you<00:05:22.130> won't<00:05:22.340> have<00:05:22.550> an

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
unharvested ear either you won't have an

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.420 
unharvested ear either you won't have an
ear<00:05:23.090> or<00:05:23.349> it'll<00:05:24.349> be<00:05:24.440> an<00:05:24.560> ear<00:05:24.770> that's<00:05:24.979> so<00:05:25.130> small

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
ear or it'll be an ear that's so small

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.560 
ear or it'll be an ear that's so small
that'll<00:05:25.820> just<00:05:25.940> go<00:05:26.090> right<00:05:26.240> through<00:05:26.300> the

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
that'll just go right through the

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.120 
that'll just go right through the
combine<00:05:28.599> so<00:05:29.599> in<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.720> situation<00:05:30.229> like<00:05:30.260> this<00:05:30.410> when

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
combine so in a situation like this when

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.219 
combine so in a situation like this when
you<00:05:31.220> have<00:05:31.250> a<00:05:31.910> corn<00:05:32.360> plant<00:05:32.539> that's<00:05:32.870> about<00:05:32.990> to

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
you have a corn plant that's about to

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.550 
you have a corn plant that's about to
leaf<00:05:33.440> behind<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:35.210> in<00:05:35.780> one<00:05:35.960> one<00:05:36.110> thousandth<00:05:36.530> of

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
leaf behind and in one one thousandth of

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.219 
leaf behind and in one one thousandth of
an<00:05:36.680> acre<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.039> if<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:37.729> count<00:05:38.060> off<00:05:38.360> if<00:05:38.810> you<00:05:39.020> pace

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
an acre so if you count off if you pace

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.500 
an acre so if you count off if you pace
off<00:05:39.470> seventeen<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.430> half<00:05:40.460> feet<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.120> you<00:05:41.360> do

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
off seventeen and a half feet and you do

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.080 
off seventeen and a half feet and you do
have<00:05:41.780> one<00:05:42.320> plant<00:05:43.220> that's<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:43.729> leave<00:05:43.910> behind

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
have one plant that's to leave behind

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.589 
have one plant that's to leave behind
that<00:05:44.539> can<00:05:45.410> cost<00:05:45.620> you<00:05:46.010> full<00:05:46.789> five<00:05:47.090> bushels

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
that can cost you full five bushels

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.110 
that can cost you full five bushels
roughly<00:05:48.139> it's<00:05:48.349> four<00:05:48.560> to<00:05:48.680> six<00:05:48.919> bushels<00:05:49.130> but<00:05:49.910> on

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
roughly it's four to six bushels but on

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.100 
roughly it's four to six bushels but on
average<00:05:50.510> five<00:05:50.750> bushels<00:05:51.229> per<00:05:52.099> acre<00:05:52.760> so<00:05:53.449> it's<00:05:54.080> a

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
average five bushels per acre so it's a

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.290 
average five bushels per acre so it's a
good<00:05:54.260> idea<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.590> go<00:05:54.710> out<00:05:54.740> flag<00:05:55.550> those<00:05:55.760> fields

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
good idea to go out flag those fields

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.000 
good idea to go out flag those fields
check<00:05:56.539> them<00:05:56.720> out<00:05:56.840> and<00:05:57.110> it'll<00:05:57.590> be<00:05:57.740> a<00:05:57.770> really

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
check them out and it'll be a really

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.790 
check them out and it'll be a really
neat<00:05:58.190> learning<00:05:58.550> opportunity<00:05:59.210> for<00:05:59.479> you<00:05:59.930> come

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
neat learning opportunity for you come

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.800 
neat learning opportunity for you come
harvest<00:06:01.070> time<00:06:01.280> to<00:06:01.610> see<00:06:01.789> what<00:06:02.120> those<00:06:02.270> ears<00:06:02.599> end

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
harvest time to see what those ears end

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.440 
harvest time to see what those ears end
up<00:06:02.900> looking<00:06:03.199> like<00:06:03.849> so<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:04.940> question<00:06:05.240> is<00:06:05.330> how

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
up looking like so the question is how

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.560 
up looking like so the question is how
do<00:06:05.510> you<00:06:05.570> fix<00:06:05.810> this<00:06:06.460> well<00:06:07.460> there's<00:06:07.909> three<00:06:08.210> easy

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
do you fix this well there's three easy

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.210 
do you fix this well there's three easy
ways<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:08.960> do<00:06:09.260> that

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
ways to do that

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.249 
ways to do that
first<00:06:10.849> you<00:06:11.060> er<00:06:11.090> cultivate<00:06:11.720> in<00:06:12.139> the

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
first you er cultivate in the

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:13.990 
first you er cultivate in the
cultivation<00:06:12.530> process<00:06:13.160> so<00:06:13.340> make<00:06:13.520> sure<00:06:13.550> you're

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
cultivation process so make sure you're

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.390 
cultivation process so make sure you're
cultivating<00:06:14.599> left<00:06:14.840> levelly<00:06:15.620> and<00:06:15.860> also

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
cultivating left levelly and also

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.490 
cultivating left levelly and also
keeping<00:06:16.849> a<00:06:16.910> firm<00:06:17.090> seed<00:06:17.389> bed<00:06:17.599> so<00:06:18.169> the<00:06:18.259> planter

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
keeping a firm seed bed so the planter

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.499 
keeping a firm seed bed so the planter
doesn't<00:06:18.800> drop<00:06:18.979> in<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:19.520> you're<00:06:19.970> also<00:06:20.150> keeping

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
doesn't drop in and you're also keeping

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.649 
doesn't drop in and you're also keeping
the<00:06:20.690> seeds<00:06:20.990> at<00:06:21.139> a<00:06:21.169> nice<00:06:21.440> even<00:06:21.740> depth<00:06:22.699> the<00:06:23.419> the

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659 
the seeds at a nice even depth the the

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:25.510 
the seeds at a nice even depth the the
third<00:06:23.810> part<00:06:24.139> is<00:06:24.259> is<00:06:24.440> making<00:06:24.770> sure<00:06:24.949> your<00:06:25.190> your

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
third part is is making sure your your

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.930 
third part is is making sure your your
corn<00:06:25.940> planters<00:06:26.330> in<00:06:26.569> good<00:06:27.310> maintenance<00:06:28.310> so

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
corn planters in good maintenance so

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.490 
corn planters in good maintenance so
making<00:06:29.389> sure<00:06:29.509> your<00:06:29.629> gauge<00:06:29.840> wheels<00:06:30.139> are<00:06:30.379> all

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
making sure your gauge wheels are all

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.399 
making sure your gauge wheels are all
even<00:06:30.889> making<00:06:31.190> sure<00:06:31.340> your<00:06:31.490> depths<00:06:31.879> are<00:06:32.090> are<00:06:32.960> all

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
even making sure your depths are are all

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.020 
even making sure your depths are are all
even<00:06:33.979> and<00:06:34.099> that<00:06:34.159> means<00:06:34.490> getting<00:06:34.729> it<00:06:34.879> out<00:06:34.940> of

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
even and that means getting it out of

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.610 
even and that means getting it out of
the<00:06:35.120> tractor<00:06:35.539> periodically<00:06:36.229> while<00:06:36.440> you're

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
the tractor periodically while you're

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.649 
the tractor periodically while you're
planning<00:06:37.039> to<00:06:37.190> make<00:06:37.639> sure<00:06:37.849> you<00:06:38.060> have<00:06:38.210> even

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
planning to make sure you have even

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.119 
planning to make sure you have even
depth<00:06:38.900> right<00:06:39.169> across<00:06:39.500> your<00:06:39.740> whole<00:06:39.830> corn

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
depth right across your whole corn

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.480 
depth right across your whole corn
planter

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.920 

as<00:06:45.490> you<00:06:45.669> can<00:06:45.789> see<00:06:46.000> in<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.300> in<00:06:46.419> the<00:06:46.539> pictures

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
as you can see in the in the pictures

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.990 
as you can see in the in the pictures
that<00:06:46.960> this<00:06:47.590> was<00:06:47.770> finally<00:06:48.160> fairly<00:06:48.789> finely

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
that this was finally fairly finely

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.809 
that this was finally fairly finely
worked<00:06:49.300> soil<00:06:49.990> bed<00:06:50.259> and<00:06:50.650> it<00:06:51.069> got<00:06:51.280> a<00:06:51.310> pretty

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
worked soil bed and it got a pretty

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.749 
worked soil bed and it got a pretty
heavy<00:06:52.030> downpour<00:06:52.720> so<00:06:53.050> what<00:06:53.740> happened<00:06:54.129> was<00:06:54.310> on

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 
heavy downpour so what happened was on

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.670 
heavy downpour so what happened was on
the<00:06:54.970> along<00:06:55.330> the<00:06:55.360> outside<00:06:55.629> of<00:06:55.870> the<00:06:56.020> field<00:06:56.259> that

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
the along the outside of the field that

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.649 
the along the outside of the field that
the<00:06:57.129> water<00:06:57.310> started<00:06:57.639> to<00:06:57.669> gain<00:06:57.909> momentum<00:06:58.090> and

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
the water started to gain momentum and

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.689 
the water started to gain momentum and
as<00:06:59.229> it<00:06:59.440> gained<00:06:59.590> momentum<00:06:59.740> it<00:07:00.250> started<00:07:00.550> to

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
as it gained momentum it started to

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.659 
as it gained momentum it started to
create<00:07:00.940> a<00:07:00.970> rill<00:07:01.360> in<00:07:02.169> the<00:07:02.409> soil<00:07:02.680> so<00:07:03.039> it<00:07:03.280> started

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669 
create a rill in the soil so it started

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:06.960 
create a rill in the soil so it started
driving<00:07:04.389> down<00:07:04.569> picking<00:07:05.349> up<00:07:05.500> soil<00:07:06.460> as<00:07:06.699> it<00:07:06.789> went

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
driving down picking up soil as it went

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.580 
driving down picking up soil as it went
down<00:07:07.090> the<00:07:07.330> field<00:07:07.539> and<00:07:07.750> kind<00:07:07.930> of<00:07:07.990> dispersed<00:07:08.349> it

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
down the field and kind of dispersed it

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.330 
down the field and kind of dispersed it
in<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:08.919> low<00:07:09.099> flat<00:07:09.490> area<00:07:09.909> of<00:07:10.000> the<00:07:10.120> field<00:07:10.360> I

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
in the low flat area of the field I

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.559 
in the low flat area of the field I
guess<00:07:12.340> the<00:07:12.490> question<00:07:12.639> asks<00:07:13.060> what<00:07:13.240> can<00:07:13.360> we<00:07:13.449> do

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:13.569 
guess the question asks what can we do

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:16.050 
guess the question asks what can we do
in<00:07:13.720> this<00:07:13.810> field<00:07:14.020> for<00:07:14.259> next<00:07:14.710> year<00:07:14.979> to<00:07:15.490> to

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
in this field for next year to to

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.580 
in this field for next year to to
prevent<00:07:16.389> this<00:07:16.539> from<00:07:16.599> happening<00:07:16.990> again<00:07:17.560> and

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
prevent this from happening again and

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.710 
prevent this from happening again and
and<00:07:17.919> one<00:07:18.460> thing<00:07:18.610> would<00:07:18.729> be<00:07:18.940> to<00:07:19.330> leave<00:07:19.479> a<00:07:19.509> little

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 
and one thing would be to leave a little

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.360 
and one thing would be to leave a little
bit<00:07:19.900> more<00:07:19.960> residue<00:07:20.530> and<00:07:20.710> not<00:07:20.830> work<00:07:21.039> it<00:07:21.220> it's

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
bit more residue and not work it it's

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.020 
bit more residue and not work it it's
fine<00:07:21.580> I<00:07:21.849> know<00:07:22.210> in<00:07:22.509> corn<00:07:22.840> we<00:07:23.259> do<00:07:23.409> like<00:07:23.650> to<00:07:23.680> have<00:07:23.949> a

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
fine I know in corn we do like to have a

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.059 
fine I know in corn we do like to have a
fine<00:07:25.030> and<00:07:25.300> firm<00:07:25.599> seed<00:07:25.960> bed<00:07:26.169> for<00:07:26.530> good<00:07:26.650> seed<00:07:26.949> to

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:27.069 
fine and firm seed bed for good seed to

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.659 
fine and firm seed bed for good seed to
soil<00:07:27.220> contact<00:07:27.840> but<00:07:28.840> on<00:07:29.250> fields<00:07:30.250> such<00:07:30.400> as<00:07:30.430> this

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:30.669 
soil contact but on fields such as this

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:32.730 
soil contact but on fields such as this
with<00:07:30.880> you<00:07:31.180> know<00:07:31.300> some<00:07:31.509> topography<00:07:32.169> where<00:07:32.470> you

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 
with you know some topography where you

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.890 
with you know some topography where you
have<00:07:32.860> a<00:07:32.919> higher<00:07:33.190> risk<00:07:33.490> of<00:07:33.759> erosion<00:07:34.389> it

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900 
have a higher risk of erosion it

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.719 
have a higher risk of erosion it
probably<00:07:35.590> would<00:07:35.740> be<00:07:35.889> a<00:07:35.919> good<00:07:36.130> idea<00:07:36.280> to<00:07:36.610> leave

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729 
probably would be a good idea to leave

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.809 
probably would be a good idea to leave
30%<00:07:37.419> residue<00:07:37.870> this<00:07:38.500> would<00:07:38.770> you<00:07:39.340> know<00:07:39.370> impede

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:39.819 
30% residue this would you know impede

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:41.939 
30% residue this would you know impede
the<00:07:40.120> velocity<00:07:40.719> the<00:07:40.840> the<00:07:41.349> momentum<00:07:41.770> of<00:07:41.860> the

the velocity the the momentum of the

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:44.309 
the velocity the the momentum of the
water<00:07:42.159> which<00:07:42.879> would<00:07:43.000> cause<00:07:43.270> less<00:07:43.300> erosion<00:07:43.719> and

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 
water which would cause less erosion and

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.800 
water which would cause less erosion and
what<00:07:45.129> you<00:07:45.250> can<00:07:45.520> do<00:07:45.759> as<00:07:45.909> a<00:07:45.940> management<00:07:46.389> thing<00:07:46.690> on

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810 
what you can do as a management thing on

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.870 
what you can do as a management thing on
your<00:07:46.960> corn<00:07:47.199> planner<00:07:47.500> if<00:07:47.830> you<00:07:48.159> are<00:07:48.310> using<00:07:48.550> a

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 
your corn planner if you are using a

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.020 
your corn planner if you are using a
heavier<00:07:49.180> residue<00:07:49.750> is<00:07:49.990> to<00:07:50.710> use<00:07:50.979> a<00:07:51.009> row<00:07:51.729> cleaner

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.030 
heavier residue is to use a row cleaner

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.300 
heavier residue is to use a row cleaner
on<00:07:52.270> there<00:07:52.479> it'll<00:07:52.659> clean<00:07:52.930> the<00:07:53.110> clean<00:07:54.009> away<00:07:54.159> the

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.310 
on there it'll clean the clean away the

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.730 
on there it'll clean the clean away the
the<00:07:54.819> residue<00:07:55.270> so<00:07:55.750> you<00:07:55.840> can<00:07:55.990> still<00:07:56.259> be<00:07:56.289> planning

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:56.740 
the residue so you can still be planning

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.950 
the residue so you can still be planning
into<00:07:56.919> a<00:07:56.949> good<00:07:57.190> seed<00:07:57.430> bed<00:07:57.699> and<00:07:57.969> you<00:07:58.630> won't<00:07:58.810> have

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 
into a good seed bed and you won't have

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.890 
into a good seed bed and you won't have
any<00:07:59.370> any<00:08:00.370> hair<00:08:00.580> pinning<00:08:00.940> it<00:08:01.120> in<00:08:01.330> the<00:08:01.509> friends
