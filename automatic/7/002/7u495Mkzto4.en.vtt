see right here you've got your power

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.240 
see right here you've got your power
level<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:17.340> you're<00:00:17.580> driving<00:00:17.759> down<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.150> road

you can select what power level that you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.749 
you can select what power level that you
wish<00:00:22.519> to<00:00:22.550> have<00:00:24.009> hitting<00:00:25.009> this<00:00:25.130> button<00:00:25.340> brings

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
wish to have hitting this button brings

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.060 
wish to have hitting this button brings
it<00:00:25.910> up<00:00:26.169> back<00:00:27.169> up<00:00:27.349> to<00:00:27.500> extreme

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.790 

now<00:00:30.579> the<00:00:30.640> gauge<00:00:31.029> that<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.390> see<00:00:31.660> right<00:00:31.839> here<00:00:32.259> is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
now the gauge that you see right here is

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.689 
now the gauge that you see right here is
injection<00:00:33.579> pressure

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
injection pressure

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.080 
injection pressure
so<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.179> you<00:00:36.420> rev<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.809> truck

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
so as you rev the truck

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.000 
so as you rev the truck
you<00:00:38.600> can<00:00:38.750> watch<00:00:38.930> your<00:00:39.170> rail<00:00:39.350> pressure<00:00:39.680> through

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
you can watch your rail pressure through

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.240 
you can watch your rail pressure through
the<00:00:40.040> factory<00:00:40.490> system<00:00:41.710> basically<00:00:42.710> what<00:00:43.070> this

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
the factory system basically what this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.020 
the factory system basically what this
does<00:00:43.310> just<00:00:44.650> comes<00:00:45.650> down<00:00:45.770> underneath<00:00:46.760> the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
does just comes down underneath the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.720 
does just comes down underneath the
dashboard<00:00:47.270> right<00:00:48.170> here<00:00:48.410> plugs<00:00:49.309> into<00:00:49.580> your

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
dashboard right here plugs into your

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.750 
dashboard right here plugs into your
obd2<00:00:50.270> port<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.110> pulls<00:00:52.070> all<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.460> your

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
obd2 port and pulls all of your

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.729 
obd2 port and pulls all of your
information<00:00:53.420> does<00:00:53.840> all<00:00:54.050> of<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.350> tuning

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
information does all of the tuning

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.229 
information does all of the tuning
everything<00:00:55.220> right<00:00:55.520> there<00:00:55.730> from<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.059> one

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
everything right there from that one

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.799 
everything right there from that one
port

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
port

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.520 
port
now<00:00:57.680> what<00:00:58.040> piggybacks<00:00:58.580> off<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.809> port<00:01:00.170> you

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
now what piggybacks off of this port you

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.979 
now what piggybacks off of this port you
can<00:01:00.620> see<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:00.920> one<00:01:01.129> cable<00:01:01.610> right<00:01:01.760> here<00:01:01.989> that

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
can see this one cable right here that

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.469 
can see this one cable right here that
goes<00:01:03.530> out<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.100> EGT<00:01:04.640> probe<00:01:04.940> that<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:05.239> drill

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
goes out to the EGT probe that you drill

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.200 
goes out to the EGT probe that you drill
and<00:01:05.600> tap<00:01:05.630> into<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> manifold<00:01:07.030> basically<00:01:08.030> you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
and tap into the manifold basically you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.940 
and tap into the manifold basically you
can<00:01:08.360> go<00:01:08.510> through<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.200> can<00:01:09.229> select<00:01:09.560> what

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
can go through and you can select what

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.389 
can go through and you can select what

cut the prices I'm sorry by going back
okay<00:01:49.260> and<00:01:49.830> now<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> scrolling<00:01:51.390> bar

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
okay and now this is a scrolling bar

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.260 
okay and now this is a scrolling bar
graph<00:01:51.870> right<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.520> patrick<00:01:54.120> has

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
graph right here see what patrick has

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.410 
graph right here see what patrick has
set<00:01:54.510> up<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.720> his<00:01:54.870> truck<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.260> ICP<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.300> what<00:01:57.300> it's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
set up on his truck is ICP and what it's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630 
set up on his truck is ICP and what it's
doing<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.020> bar<00:01:58.229> graphing<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.890> ICP<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.580> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
doing is it's bar graphing your ICP if I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.310 
doing is it's bar graphing your ICP if I
give<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.910> throttle<00:02:00.120> you<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.630> ramped<00:02:00.870> up<00:02:01.020> if

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
give it throttle you see it ramped up if

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
give it throttle you see it ramped up if
I<00:02:01.410> let<00:02:01.590> off<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> throttle<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.700> falls<00:02:03.000> back

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I let off the throttle it falls back

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.859 
I let off the throttle it falls back
down

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.740 

so<00:02:08.440> if<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.129> set<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:09.489> up<00:02:09.640> for<00:02:09.849> eg<00:02:10.179> T's<00:02:10.390> or

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
so if you set this up for eg T's or

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.780 
so if you set this up for eg T's or
boost<00:02:11.050> or<00:02:11.319> anything<00:02:11.620> else<00:02:11.800> you'll<00:02:12.550> have<00:02:12.610> a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
boost or anything else you'll have a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.390 
boost or anything else you'll have a
scrolling<00:02:13.330> graph<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:14.050> what's<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:15.310> it
