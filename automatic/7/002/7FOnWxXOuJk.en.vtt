00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.490
 good morning friends from before the one 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.110
 Uruguay is good here we are in the 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.910
 tomorrow it's eight thirty we have 23 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.590
 with four degrees of temperature 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.730
 ambient 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.619
 we have the cpu 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.849
 and doubt 32 degrees I just finished matching 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.270
 3 sea 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.270
 before 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.630
 keep in mind that I'm running 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.929
 without pepe or without physics so that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.989
 totally force the cpu the results 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.559
 that obtained are barbarians the king 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.129
 interest stays at 68 degrees 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.129
 maximum 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.559
 now let's sign it let's look at a 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.500
 little like this stage has not yet 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.960
 change the color look how nice 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.210
 I love all the hoses are of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.210
 pvc the feelings 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.350
 the fanes as you will see are totally at 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.500
 minimum is seen turning slowly 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.880
 Well what I want to show you is 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 first the options for them to do that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 I'm not telling you one thing is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.900
 uninhabited peru 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.570
 If I enabled this, use the graph and do not 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.810
 it does not make any sense and I'm 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.940
 running on all three cpu's so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 we will use again then according to the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.810
 second pass we would say 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.810
 and one after another 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.740
 here it goes 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.350
 everything he is doing here is 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.460
 doing processing with the cpu this are 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.460
 the three strongest 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.890
 I have seen that they use prime is 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.930
 correct respect the position but prime 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.860
 it's an old program is no longer used 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.450
 with these new processors apart 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.979
 all in string systems here we have 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.200
 had the experience of running eight 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.190
 prime hours and fail in a game like that 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.119
 that for me it does not run anymore 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.310
 important is this 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.450
 look here is running from the 418 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.480
 friends only with the cpu 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.489
 if it fails here blue screen video good 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.620
 you know this is the fastest 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.720
 can you find them I repeat is not 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.180
 no against used the prime but it is a 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 test that was done 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.770
 much earlier for the p 45 and all that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.920
 and I repeat, I've seen people spend 24 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.140
 prime hours and they pick up a game and they 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.660
 fails because because it is a program that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.680
 uses codes and suddenly the code 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.680
 it was added and good 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.760
 suddenly it gives them a stability and not 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 it's so good and I step 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.760
 the normal three are running 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.569
 sorry, it was out of focus 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.749
 and we have the galaxy 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.749
 we are studying the power of sonic 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.299
 and the racing tech drayton or triton 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.590
 very nice really 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.930
 the temperature as you see 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.930
 is stable inside the house 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.940
 I'm going to show you something that told you 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.769
 I have the balcony next to me so the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.440
 another day I had 32 degrees out there 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.250
 now and the same as here therefore the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.100
 temperatures are these 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.060
 the day I made the organism there was no 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.060
 a lot of fiery heat 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.900
 well there it is 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.900
 following the test 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.650
 is about to finish 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.650
 here what matters is not the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.400
 the result that must be lifted but 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.340
 observe in the reforms of the journey 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.879
 one thing that I liked and really the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.260
 I congratulate racing tech is the control of 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:17.500
 speed because we all become 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.500
 then with the pdm equal now vitamin 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.800
 and return to get the same 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.800
 temperatures 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.680
 maximum 28 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.690
 without dramas some 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.640
 good friends I will keep trying and you 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.640
 I keep counting like chao
