getting<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> next<00:00:31.500> part<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> did<00:00:32.880> was

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
getting to the next part what I did was

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.910 
getting to the next part what I did was
I<00:00:33.480> left<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.260> factory<00:00:36.290> flasher<00:00:37.290> relay<00:00:37.530> in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
I left the factory flasher relay in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.660 
I left the factory flasher relay in
there<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:40.050> did<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> 12<00:00:41.399> o'clock

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
there because I did use the 12 o'clock

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.869 
there because I did use the 12 o'clock
labs<00:00:41.940> fixed<00:00:42.480> rate<00:00:42.629> flasher<00:00:43.489> but<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.700> was<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
labs fixed rate flasher but it was a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.290 
labs fixed rate flasher but it was a
very<00:00:45.239> slow<00:00:45.539> flash<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.820> bit<00:00:47.940> slower

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
very slow flash it's a little bit slower

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.549 
very slow flash it's a little bit slower
than<00:00:48.649> what<00:00:49.649> factory<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:51.539> didn't<00:00:52.440> feel

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
than what factory is and I didn't feel

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.029 
than what factory is and I didn't feel
that<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.280> visible<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:55.320> would

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that it was very visible and I would

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.650 
that it was very visible and I would
just<00:00:56.190> worry<00:00:56.430> about<00:00:56.760> someone<00:00:57.149> cutting<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.629> off

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
just worry about someone cutting me off

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
just worry about someone cutting me off
because<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.140> weren't<00:00:58.350> touching<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.250> turn

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
because they weren't touching my turn

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.810 
because they weren't touching my turn
signals<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> anyways<00:01:01.770> here's<00:01:02.160> here's<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
signals so anyways here's here's the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.039 
signals so anyways here's here's the
flash<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.450> factory<00:01:06.450> relay<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
flash this is with the factory relay and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.899 
flash this is with the factory relay and
it's<00:01:07.680> fast<00:01:08.070> yeah

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it's fast yeah

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
it's fast yeah
but<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:11.510> think<00:01:12.510> Rabs<00:01:12.750> your<00:01:12.930> attention<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> lot

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
but I think Rabs your attention a lot

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.679 
but I think Rabs your attention a lot
more<00:01:13.770> than<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.790> slow<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.360> with

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
more than if it was going slow like with

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.310 
more than if it was going slow like with
the<00:01:15.869> fixed<00:01:16.770> rate<00:01:16.950> flash<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.170> anyways<00:01:19.170> we'll

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the fixed rate flash or so anyways we'll

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.050 
the fixed rate flash or so anyways we'll
do<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> quick<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.830> walk<00:01:20.040> around

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.240 

so<00:01:29.600> anyways<00:01:29.930> now<00:01:30.170> getting<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.740> install

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
so anyways now getting to the install

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.140 
so anyways now getting to the install
for<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:33.940> flashers

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
for the flashers

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.640 
for the flashers
I<00:01:36.460> ordered<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.640> brackets<00:01:38.140> they<00:01:39.140> will<00:01:39.470> mount

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
I ordered the brackets they will mount

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.859 
I ordered the brackets they will mount
up<00:01:39.860> here<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:41.500> actually<00:01:42.940> looked<00:01:43.940> back<00:01:44.210> with

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
up here I actually looked back with

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.170 
up here I actually looked back with
Mount<00:01:45.470> iam<00:01:45.680> in<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> factory<00:01:46.490> location<00:01:46.640> then

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
Mount iam in the factory location then

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.609 
Mount iam in the factory location then
up<00:01:47.360> here<00:01:49.330> they<00:01:50.330> look<00:01:50.540> they<00:01:51.050> look<00:01:51.200> pretty<00:01:51.380> good

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
up here they look they look pretty good

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.649 
up here they look they look pretty good
up<00:01:51.740> here<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.490> problem<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.090> have<00:01:53.119> wire

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
up here the problem is you have wire

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.510 
up here the problem is you have wire
that's<00:01:54.110> gonna<00:01:54.290> be<00:01:54.440> running<00:01:54.770> through<00:01:55.369> there

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
that's gonna be running through there

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.310 
that's gonna be running through there
and<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.700> don't<00:01:55.790> want<00:01:56.090> any<00:01:56.450> extra<00:01:56.600> wires<00:01:56.960> being

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
and I don't want any extra wires being

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.010 
and I don't want any extra wires being
visible<00:01:58.060> plus<00:01:59.060> then<00:01:59.570> you'll<00:01:59.720> have<00:01:59.810> this

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
visible plus then you'll have this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.370 
visible plus then you'll have this
bracket<00:02:00.590> with<00:02:00.680> empty<00:02:01.009> hole<00:02:01.220> there<00:02:01.700> just<00:02:02.420> which

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
bracket with empty hole there just which

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.020 
bracket with empty hole there just which
I<00:02:03.649> don't<00:02:03.830> know<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.070> didn't<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:04.789> either

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
I don't know I didn't like that either

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.080 
I don't know I didn't like that either
so<00:02:05.979> basically<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.070> just<00:02:07.340> use<00:02:07.460> an<00:02:07.610> extra<00:02:07.880> washer

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
so basically I just use an extra washer

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.699 
so basically I just use an extra washer
right<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.530> inside<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:11.600> mount<00:02:12.530> it

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
right here on the inside and mount it

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.650 
right here on the inside and mount it
right<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:12.980> factory<00:02:13.340> location<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.390> way<00:02:14.630> I

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
right in the factory location that way I

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.800 
right in the factory location that way I
can<00:02:15.080> use<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:17.300> know<00:02:17.420> make<00:02:17.600> sure<00:02:17.630> that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
can use the you know make sure that

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.750 
can use the you know make sure that
there's<00:02:18.080> no<00:02:18.200> extra<00:02:18.410> wires<00:02:18.709> hanging<00:02:19.370> around

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
there's no extra wires hanging around

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.680 
there's no extra wires hanging around
and<00:02:20.000> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.750> look<00:02:20.959> up<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.350> here<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:23.480> see

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
and if you can look up in here you see

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.210 
and if you can look up in here you see
the<00:02:23.840> grommet<00:02:24.290> there<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.590> runs<00:02:24.769> through<00:02:25.040> so

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
the grommet there that runs through so

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.490 
the grommet there that runs through so
you're<00:02:25.340> gonna<00:02:25.489> access<00:02:26.060> all<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.269> or<00:02:26.870> you're

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
you're gonna access all that or you're

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.740 
you're gonna access all that or you're
gonna<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.769> able<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.980> use<00:02:28.160> reuse<00:02:28.730> all<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.150> not

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
gonna be able to use reuse all that not

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.540 
gonna be able to use reuse all that not
have<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.019> worry<00:02:30.200> about<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.890> know<00:02:31.010> chafing

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
have to worry about you know chafing

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.600 
have to worry about you know chafing
wires<00:02:31.790> or<00:02:32.090> anything<00:02:32.239> like<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.310> I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
wires or anything like that so and I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.090 
wires or anything like that so and I
still<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.329> looks<00:02:35.360> pretty<00:02:35.890> pretty<00:02:36.890> good

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
still think it looks pretty pretty good

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.460 
still think it looks pretty pretty good
where<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:37.579> at<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.989> that's<00:02:39.110> gonna<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:39.380> up

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
where it's at so but that's gonna be up

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.850 
where it's at so but that's gonna be up
to<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.739> if<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.790> want<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.090> mount<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:42.079> or

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
to you if you want to mount up here or

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.830 
to you if you want to mount up here or
not<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.600> whatever

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
not it's whatever

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.039 
not it's whatever
anyways<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.370> also<00:02:46.910> also<00:02:47.480> I'm<00:02:47.570> going<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.810> show

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
anyways so also also I'm going to show

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.289 
anyways so also also I'm going to show
you<00:02:48.190> what<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.600> integrated<00:02:52.030> brake<00:02:53.030> pulse

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
you what the integrated brake pulse

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.720 
you what the integrated brake pulse
module<00:02:53.860> upgrade<00:02:54.860> looks<00:02:55.070> like<00:02:55.250> for<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.489> 12

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
module upgrade looks like for the 12

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.569 
module upgrade looks like for the 12
o'clock<00:02:55.880> labs<00:02:56.180> now<00:02:56.890> what<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> actually<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.400> is

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
o'clock labs now what it actually is is

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.120 
o'clock labs now what it actually is is
it<00:02:58.910> replaces<00:02:59.090> your<00:02:59.540> whole<00:02:59.930> your<00:03:00.650> whole<00:03:00.709> board

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
it replaces your whole your whole board

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.680 
it replaces your whole your whole board
here<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.959> see<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:04.329> let<00:03:05.329> me<00:03:05.359> let<00:03:05.660> it

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
here you can see on this let me let it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.880 
here you can see on this let me let it
focus<00:03:05.989> here<00:03:06.850> see<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.970> corrosion<00:03:08.239> there

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
focus here see the corrosion there

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.780 
focus here see the corrosion there
there's<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.010> little<00:03:10.130> bit<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.340> corrosion<00:03:10.579> on

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
there's a little bit of corrosion on

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.370 
there's a little bit of corrosion on
there<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:12.200> DRC<00:03:12.470> taillight<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.549> not

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
there of the DRC taillight is not

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.310 
there of the DRC taillight is not
waterproof<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.810> DRC<00:03:17.810> board<00:03:18.079> is<00:03:18.170> not

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
waterproof the DRC board is not

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.090 
waterproof the DRC board is not
waterproof

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
waterproof

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.509 
waterproof
so<00:03:19.850> there's<00:03:20.060> corrosion<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.690> there<00:03:21.250> plus<00:03:22.250> just

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
so there's corrosion in there plus just

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.509 
so there's corrosion in there plus just
the<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.209> way<00:03:23.299> it's<00:03:23.510> designed<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.950> doesn't

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
the the way it's designed it doesn't

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.170 
the the way it's designed it doesn't
it's<00:03:26.030> not<00:03:26.090> really<00:03:26.390> made<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.630> eliminate

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
it's not really made to eliminate

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.490 
it's not really made to eliminate
moisture<00:03:29.180> from<00:03:29.570> getting<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.170> what<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.350> did

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
moisture from getting in so what I did

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.729 
moisture from getting in so what I did
with<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.549> with<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.060> board<00:03:32.299> was<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.900> put<00:03:33.530> some

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
with the with the board was I put some

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.130 
with the with the board was I put some
dielectric<00:03:34.250> grease<00:03:34.340> inside<00:03:35.120> where<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.959> wire

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
dielectric grease inside where the wire

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.780 
dielectric grease inside where the wire
goes<00:03:36.440> in

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.800 

basically<00:03:39.790> prevent<00:03:40.120> some<00:03:40.330> moisture<00:03:40.659> from

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
basically prevent some moisture from

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.339 
basically prevent some moisture from
getting<00:03:41.080> in<00:03:41.230> plus<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:42.099> 12<00:03:42.340> o'clock<00:03:42.519> Labs

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
getting in plus the 12 o'clock Labs

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.199 
getting in plus the 12 o'clock Labs
board<00:03:44.349> is<00:03:44.950> waterproof<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:46.049> supposedly<00:03:47.049> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
board is waterproof and supposedly the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.740 
board is waterproof and supposedly the
LEDs<00:03:49.209> are<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> little<00:03:49.629> bit<00:03:49.900> brighter<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.750> I'll

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
LEDs are a little bit brighter so I'll

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.380 
LEDs are a little bit brighter so I'll
show<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.080> what<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.379> looks<00:03:53.560> like<00:03:53.769> now<00:03:54.360> when<00:03:55.360> I

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
show you what it looks like now when I

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.059 
show you what it looks like now when I
did<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.110> break<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:58.060> real<00:03:58.299> simple<00:03:58.569> to<00:03:59.069> to

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
did the break and it's real simple to to

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.149 
did the break and it's real simple to to
turn<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.640> flash<00:04:01.540> on<00:04:01.840> or<00:04:02.079> off<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.709> if<00:04:02.829> you<00:04:02.950> want

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
turn the flash on or off so if you want

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.500 
turn the flash on or off so if you want
to<00:04:03.250> just<00:04:03.450> not<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.900> that's<00:04:05.290> fine<00:04:05.590> but

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
to just not have this that's fine but

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.729 
to just not have this that's fine but
that's<00:04:07.510> what<00:04:07.659> a<00:04:07.690> flash<00:04:07.959> looks<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.440> when<00:04:08.590> you

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
that's what a flash looks like when you

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:17.879 
that's what a flash looks like when you
hit<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.819> brake<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:12.040> like<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:16.889> so

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
hit the brake so I like it and so

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.189 
hit the brake so I like it and so
anyways<00:04:18.669> if<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:19.030> any<00:04:19.180> questions<00:04:19.959> about

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
anyways if you have any questions about

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.689 
anyways if you have any questions about
the<00:04:20.289> installation<00:04:20.910> good<00:04:22.020> let<00:04:23.020> me<00:04:23.110> know<00:04:23.699> like

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
the installation good let me know like

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.129 
the installation good let me know like
you<00:04:24.820> said<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.919> would<00:04:27.430> personally<00:04:28.060> go<00:04:28.930> with

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
you said the I would personally go with

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.529 
you said the I would personally go with
the<00:04:29.410> stock<00:04:30.220> flasher<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.060> not<00:04:31.210> get<00:04:31.419> the

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
the stock flasher and not get the

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.830 
the stock flasher and not get the
fixed-rate<00:04:31.960> flasher<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:33.479> tried<00:04:34.479> making<00:04:34.630> a

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
fixed-rate flasher I tried making a

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.320 
fixed-rate flasher I tried making a
video<00:04:35.110> before<00:04:35.500> with<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.340> fixed-rate<00:04:36.820> flasher

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
video before with the fixed-rate flasher

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.490 
video before with the fixed-rate flasher
and<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:38.530> just<00:04:39.400> basically<00:04:39.539> messed<00:04:40.539> up<00:04:40.780> on<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.199> I

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
and I just basically messed up on and I

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.129 
and I just basically messed up on and I
don't<00:04:41.770> feel<00:04:42.010> like<00:04:42.190> taking<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.729> plastic<00:04:43.690> piece

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
don't feel like taking the plastic piece

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.560 
don't feel like taking the plastic piece
off<00:04:44.380> cause<00:04:44.860> your<00:04:45.099> relays<00:04:45.400> right<00:04:45.639> in<00:04:45.789> here<00:04:46.030> real

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
off cause your relays right in here real

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.560 
off cause your relays right in here real
easy<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.840> get<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.110> but<00:04:48.300> I've<00:04:49.300> had<00:04:49.539> enough

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
easy to get to but I've had enough

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.000 
easy to get to but I've had enough
wiring<00:04:50.289> for<00:04:50.470> one<00:04:50.590> day<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.039> I'm<00:04:52.030> done<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:53.010> there

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
wiring for one day and I'm done so there

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:03.170 
wiring for one day and I'm done so there
it<00:04:54.130> is<00:04:54.220> again<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:56.400> it's<00:04:57.400> your<00:04:57.550> flash<00:04:58.830> and<00:05:00.120> I
