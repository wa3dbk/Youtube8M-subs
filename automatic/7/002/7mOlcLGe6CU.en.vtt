on it I know that was one of our

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.360

lucky were similar people and we kind of

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:21.810 
lucky were similar people and we kind of
have<00:01:20.740> learned<00:01:21.009> we've<00:01:21.189> been<00:01:21.310> together<00:01:21.399> for<00:01:21.670> so

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.190 
have learned we've been together for so
long<00:01:21.850> I<00:01:22.270> think<00:01:22.479> eight<00:01:22.659> years<00:01:22.960> or<00:01:23.049> something

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
long I think eight years or something

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200 
long I think eight years or something
like<00:01:23.289> that<00:01:23.380> oh<00:01:23.710> wow<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.549> we<00:01:24.700> struck<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> balance

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
like that oh wow and we struck a balance

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.359 
like that oh wow and we struck a balance
we<00:01:25.570> figured<00:01:25.840> out<00:01:25.990> like<00:01:26.259> when<00:01:26.920> one<00:01:27.070> of<00:01:27.159> us<00:01:27.250> is

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
we figured out like when one of us is

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.679 
we figured out like when one of us is
going<00:01:27.549> crazy<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.090> other<00:01:28.210> person<00:01:28.359> can

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
going crazy and the other person can

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.179 
going crazy and the other person can
keep<00:01:28.810> him<00:01:28.929> grounded<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.500> vice<00:01:29.619> versa<00:01:29.859> the

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
keep him grounded and vice versa the

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.849 
keep him grounded and vice versa the
balance<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.880> I'm<00:01:31.119> always<00:01:31.420> wrong<00:01:31.719> and<00:01:32.109> she
