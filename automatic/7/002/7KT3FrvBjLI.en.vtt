00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:10.610
 So next is it 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.180
 I think that it has introduced a rare both 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.120
 First of all 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:22.070
 When playing a few buses, use this closed hi-hat to beat the rhythm 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:26.039
 It is to you who can not buy a close hat 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.130
 So I stretched high of this high-hat normal 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.500
 As a representative, this technique is 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.880
 It is said that the tower of the healer and hi-hat closed 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.240
 a with heels 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.590
 Step on the foot pedal 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.590
 Let's do it 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:01:01.660
 t 4 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:01:01.660
 t 4 tj 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:14.690
 I would like to try the opposite answer heel such as the current heel plan etc. 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:20.090
 This is to play the hi-hat with the heel with the toe on the bass drum 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.840
 Wow foot closed hi-hat bass drum even while play is also possible 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.840
 Let's do it by the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 tg 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.649
ãƒ¼

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.000
 Next time while playing the bus 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:47.520
 If you want to open and close the hi-hat, keep playing with your feet 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.520
 Let's try to open closed by Te 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:08.920
 bit beef 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.130
 Four 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.160
 Next I want to play 2 bus 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.220
 For you who want to step on the twin pedal but can not buy it 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.970
 A revolutionary idea it one of the pedal 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.350
 Say to play 2 bus 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.350
 Let's do it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:57.120
 e 7 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:57.580
 pou dou dou 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:19.500
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:19.500
