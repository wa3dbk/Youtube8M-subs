00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.670
 for a tutorial to know how to put 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.240
 music on his minecraft knowledge 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.939
 so it works for the servers crack 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 so the emirate however the description 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.350
 for a start we will be interested in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.849
 custom music that we will put in the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.170
 guide of his server bakhit so a 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.170
 once we put it on we will light it and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.210
 after we will be interested in audio customers 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 that everyone must have for 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.899
 able to listen to music and on the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.600
 server 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.670
 because we will create a new folder 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.690
 they are given as a so wants 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 double click on it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.559
 but for some it does not suffer as 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.780
 this or do right click open with java 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.150
 so after badly set in minecraft 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 name web is your pseudo month its 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.860
 single principals so savary p on va 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.770
 put the ip and payload server on 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.090
 leave like this jamie does not touch 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.710
 not the device then we will not 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 save directly aure valley 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 music and we will do agde and we will 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 go get the music we 're going 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.909
 adjust on his server every time I 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.049
 am lost lyautey music 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.360
 finally it depends you told you I 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.180
 thought the wii you be that three 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.799
 musics or it's a number of gigabytes 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.840
 limited but I think we can fall 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:58.320
 on a track for here to be able to a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.030
 little cheated so i can say so we 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.189
 click on it we will synchronize and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.650
 we go back in general and we do 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.690
 save 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.140
 so then as I can not 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.580
 submitted with camtasia minecraft as soon as we 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.860
 will be from a server we will do connects 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.290
 so we end up we find ourselves all 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.540
 right away in the game to know the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.870
 commands to do so here it is again 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.260
 on minecraft showed the commodos of the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.060
 plugin so I call back to listen to the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.080
 music everyone must have audio 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.440
 clients on his pc configured with his 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.740
 his nickname and his ip the ip batteries the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.360
 server so to start to place 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:55.440
 boxing boxing as I call it does this 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.209
 lhc she this box and not boxing 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.209
 beating his full m than three 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.120
 imagine that wants to remove boxing 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.840
 m because when you put three we will 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.470
 to put it elsewhere effect this lhc of them 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:32.170
 boks finally air not the name of boxing 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:35.290
 so I specify the game on version 1.5.2 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.630
 and I still have not encountered any bugs 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.250
 so here I hope this tutorial you 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.520

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.140

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.140

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.020
