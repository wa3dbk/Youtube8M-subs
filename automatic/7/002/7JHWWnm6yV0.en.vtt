00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.840
 and who I am 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.369
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 review of de is character this time 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
 olivier giroud a as always I ask you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.840
 sorry for not having recorded 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.610
 the statistics inside the game was me 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.110
 happened the truth usually happens to me and as 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.050
 always good then pulling a little bit of 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.390
 I know we like football but good 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.370
 I always walk with a lot of haste 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.040
 doing the reviews and others and good 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.199
 I forgot there is how you see highlight a little 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 the strength highlight a bit the 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.269
 completion and especially those two 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 dodge stars a little bad there 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.690
 As usual I leave the link 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 in the description of the best page 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.410
 currency is the cheapest and apart 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.510
 to be reliable 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.879
 I leave a discount code in the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.949
 description to get them even more 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.170
 cheap let's talk about help and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.960
 head head moment is great not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.179
 is a player who understands a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.039
 fifa tad will know he plays cyrus no 

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:10.440
 is a slow game receives the ball of 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.330
 he holds it very well and if he 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.130
 turn has the goal in front usually 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 finish very well as you see there from 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.349
 far away is also a player that I think that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.340
 deserves more love as I say there at the end 

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:21.899
 of the review I think that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 everyone throws back that 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.250
 have 65 rhythm and have two 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.869
 dribble stars and that's why he's going to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.319
 have a high skill score because 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.759
 fix then is skillful with the ball to 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.619
 me someone who has five stars of 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.020
 Dodge like for example to me 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.659
 personally it happens to me with bernard and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.909
 with someone else and then I do not know that I do not know 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.039
 happens to get forgiveness performance 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.530
 to his ability he will have a low grade 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.659
 however giraud who is so skilled 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.640
 as you can see there is another time although this does not 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.770
 ended in goal with the ball having two 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.509
 It makes the grade higher and for 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.819
 that has an even higher note than 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.219
 20 that makes it a better good player 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.619
 no but it has a higher note because 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.750
 because he deserves it and still we saw how 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.719
 I say the rhythm 65 of rhythm the truth that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.759
 you do not notice it so much I would put a 75 and 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.950
 then the chemistry also very high since 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.040
 it's French the genius definition the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.110
 head the same but said try that 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.370
 the truth is that it is quite good and nothing 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.840
 more see you in the next video that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.519
 be authors character as always 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.519
 I hope you liked it goodbye
