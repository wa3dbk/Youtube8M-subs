00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello dear viewers today with 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.370
 the final series and I'm happy 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.589
 present an awesome mechanism this 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.480
 a battery that consumes its own 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.090
 own energy thanks to some 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.009
 external stimuli and so can 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.020
 express she has a charge indicator 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.650
 power check by analogy in Rostov 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.689
 a thing is a golden stripe 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.350
 there is a screen that lives and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.260
 the energy of the case of switching on 8 turn on then 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.170
 there is a screen on and it works at 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.399
 least, and in theory should wait for the energy 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 look here ola faces to rise and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.440
 The division is removed, that is, we wait while 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.120
 well, you see 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.879
 designs pretty extensive 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.350
 scale that is it can 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.149
 use them either there anyway things 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.950
 like a gun there or something else 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.900
 that is, any 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.780
 action that requires q3 dammed 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 wow effect like an atom 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.170
 what a chic thing waiting for some 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.790
 while spending a number greater than the body 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.380
 there is essentially here a piston pro slides 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.300
 and nothing moves so complicated 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.430
 Cool agree for a long time the court and surrendered 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.990
 look pretty done there 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.820
 interesting device is quite interesting 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.380
 the design is based on the very 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.020
 the counter that shot in the previous 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.070
 series link on screen counter on 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.990
 d-trigger ah look spent synergy 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.390
 look spent ap I mean no 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.160
 battery cabbage screen stopped its 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.470
 work i.e. the screen doesn't work anymore 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.960
 just give buy buy throw out well 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.350
 agree cool let's look 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.110
 inside 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.300
 here we are very dark and not a damn 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.940
 let's see i try you don't need 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.100
 improved visibility 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.350
 it means that the counter is the same 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.270
 yes that is a little bit modified yes 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.030
 there under construction no matter this one 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.110
 most counter sertolovo 89 up to how 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.369
 I remember yes yes she herself and that is what 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.440
 brighter you could see better 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.360
 the counter is slightly modified because 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.160
 he has on the findings before the signal point 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.440
 there are additional memory cells 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.090
 this is not involved one of 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.100
 cells involved in vain did you break 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.200
 so let it be under 11 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.510
 constructs these to pistons at a time 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.930
 4 pistons activated immediately ie 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.040
 quite interesting pretty fast 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.690
 show again in more detail how he 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.110
 works by default if construction 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.330
 reset and and reset now that is 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.490
 The way the charge will be charged is 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.420
 signal on the year plus contact 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.250
 batteries 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.530
 that is, it will fall here 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.740
 here it goes goes goes here go here here 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.990
 he is going to the tap 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.510
 quite an interesting construction here 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.010
 by the way on give it works pretty brute 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.010
 interesting design based on 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.260
 devourers 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.540
 energy how do i express that is 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.709
 Estonian signal lock standards 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.490
 plus there are a few of your own 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.850
 trinkets 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.650
 plus inverter in total 10 costs 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.930
 blocker plus that's such a crap plus 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.590
 the inverter should not be a signal here 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.110
 there is a signal does not pass if the signal 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.840
 passes that is burning energy starts 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.630
 waste that is cut the screen to you 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 better understand that let's say a signal here 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.320
 goes that is he goes to go here 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.300
 down that is all done by the builders 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.730
 real terminal meeting contact then 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.820
 have tried visual extreme 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.840
 put it all here it goes here 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.420
 where is he here he goes here goes here 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.780
 coming here coming here coming to 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.209
 I made a device for impulses 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.820
 little time then there is pretty fast 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.010
 power consumption if you put that and 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.510
 Peter and additional to you energy 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.110
 will rule is spent just swore 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.299
 natural so long yes that is 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.470
 apologize for that is 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.850
 long will be long shorter works 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.920
 battery will be all good you have won 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.670
 if to help 7 out of 5 seconds one 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.750
 division 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.310
 I counted the batteries specifically as here 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.519
 rather complicated construction or 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.860
 I just don't know when you face 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.290
 In general, everything is standard, that is, in fact 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.330
 every time interval this crap 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.740
 sends a signal using a generator 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.690
 short pulses of the very one 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.790
 yesterday showed today while you look at 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.960
 previous series and of itself and 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.960
 thanks to this all this works 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.910
 crap trigger pulse generator 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.580
 the signal goes to the decimal counter 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.969
 remind all the same memory checks and 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.789
 respectively hang out and pistons 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.989
 that is, if by the way I will show more 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.879
 something let's say a signal 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:59.059
 the signal disappears and there is no more like this 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:02.869
 do if no signal here not here 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:04.129
 signal before disappearing the output signal 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.229
 positive contact 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.029
 that is, well, by default, from the test in 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.309
 the very last the very last division 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:12.889
 there is because the reset that is, if 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:16.099
 energy ran out means signal up 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.479
 there is no battery 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.309
 recharge rechargeable button 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.079
 Iâ€™m going to highlight a dress 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:24.319
 specifically because I'm going to 

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:26.679
 file can get up at. schematic on 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:30.349
 youtube link bytope now 

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:31.549
 Naturally display consumables that is 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.409
 devices that consume energy 

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:34.159
 can i just have a simple light bulb 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.189
 absolutely important 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:40.999
 that is, the output of consumables here is 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:42.409
 Here in this block there is a fishing rod 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.039
 or should you feed this brine 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.629
 consumables 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.099
 that is, the device itself 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.129
 allows batteries to work there 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.649
 is here on this stone block 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.529
 and here it is pulse blockers it all 

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:56.119
 I hope the battery itself 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.969
 device like that more or three 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:00.050
 tutorial rather just a demonstration 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.689
 possible this so to speak there that 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.069
 the most typical counter in general to all 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.869
 thanks for watching download 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.439
 insert your servers have fun 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.439
 until
