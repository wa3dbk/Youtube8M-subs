00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.919
 well this the running of the machine 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:14.130
 shredder the bruce nox brand 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:18.439
 here is not a part of the engine and has 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.939
 to be placed here observes the mayor 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:28.220
 already without head and without the viscera 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.220
 agility of the process is quite large 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.489
 a machine where you can make 60 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.350
 feet per minute a well- trained person 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:51.730
 standardized fish 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:56.290
 here we have a machine display where 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:04.960
 Do you watch her work? 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:10.479
 the machine is moved to water dry good did 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:15.680

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:20.660
 its bottom where it is considered 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.650
 the waste there pick up a carcass for the 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:30.160
 people take a look please let there be 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.479
 fairly good harness hunting 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.420
 network touch well 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.420
 the rib to the column 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:47.690
 enjoyed settings here already out the fillet 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.970
 see how quickly and 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.930
 makes this is the filet given by the machine is 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.320
 That 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.229
 out here the two bands can put 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.460
 one for us there please 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.460
 watch the exit 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.860
 I can forget that was 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 I see the exchange already starting to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.480
 put the fish there we go 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 ae 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.240
 down I only do this 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.970
 very good use 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.750
 then this is the operation of the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.750
 machine 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:08.019
 take a look here in Brazil at 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.769
 plenary one for safety 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.930
 turn off our machine launched here 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:20.579
 There is the command, right? 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.579
 then this is the system inside the machine 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.290
 this is a very large unit in the 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.750
 process subject of Islamic regulation 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.730
 system of organization and also to 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.910
 clean the green water blades with 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:52.000
 water safety controls is 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.030
 This is a machine of the brand blue inox 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.269
 a conservative majority in the spot market 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.239
 excellent perfect conservation one 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.989
 machine that we are not using 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:12.160
 due to our high capacity here and 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:16.000
 also our other machine but the 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.489
 machine very good yield then it is 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.720
 this is one facing the entrance of the fish 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.850
 also structure here so I do not think 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.229
 what are we going to do 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.229
 he's only here at the entrance 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:38.879
 Do not leave it there, this is it. 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.879
 The perfect way is this.
