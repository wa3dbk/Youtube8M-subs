00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.299
 hello today we are going to elaborate an extract 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.250
 natural homemade vanilla for it 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.920
 We're going to need two vanilla pods 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.080
 and a high alcoholic drink 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.080
 graduation like vodka can be 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.880
 our homemade vanilla extract 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.170
 We're going to need a cutting board 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.540
 a sharp knife a funnel and a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.879
 glass bottle as dark as possible 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.160
 I've got this violet color and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.860
 it has to be very important with a 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.800
 hermetic closing you can observe that 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.140
 this bottle has the typical closure with 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.970
 the pressure cap this may be worth 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.250
 it does not matter the size because what 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.440
 we want is to make enough extract from 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.949
 vanilla so that we do not miss a 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.949
 good season 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.790
 Now with the help of a good knife 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.159
 sharp and the kitchen table we are going to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.960
 open the vanilla pods but not the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.940
 we want to go down completely simply 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.550
 we want the seeds of vanilla 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.220
 be well exposed 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.580
 for this we are going to print some cuts 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.100
 longitudinal along the pod and 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 let's go with the help of the knife go 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 opening the pod little by little 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.900
 once we have the cracked pods 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.670
 and with the seeds exposed we are going to 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.400
 insert them into the bottle that we have 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.520
 prepared to prepare the extract of 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.520
 vanilla 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.270
 and finally with the help of a small 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.430
 funnel like the one you see on the screen 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.100
 we are going to pour the content of the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.380
 bottle of vodka in our bottle with 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.360
 the vanilla pods is very important 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.660
 that vodka completely covers the pods 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.660
 vanilla 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.960
 and finally it remains to label our 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.760
 bottle and put the date on it 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.400
 we put for the first time the pods of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.800
 vanilla in maceration with alcohol is 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.870
 very important to know this date put 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.880
 that needs at least three 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.460
 months in maceration and from then on 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.460
 all the time you put is better 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.710
 still now we put it on August 10 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.240
 August to have a good extract of 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.240
 vanilla from here to Christmas 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.720
 with respect to the conservation of 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.640
 our homemade vanilla extract what 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.040
 what we have to know is that there is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.160
 keep it in this dark bottle in a 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.590
 cool place dry and away from light 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.170
 that is to say we can put it inside 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.390
 of a cupboard in our kitchen in the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.280
 background and save it there for three or 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.480
 four months until we can return 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.000
 to use 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.010
 remember that the longer you are in 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.830
 Vanillas submerged in alcohol 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.110
 stronger and more intense will be the taste 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.180
 of the vanilla extract obtained by 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.760
 you can keep it for three 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.780
 months or more to get a good taste 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.129
 vanilla 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.410
 once you have the vanilla 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.230
 elaborated and are already satisfied with the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.150
 flavor obtained you can change it to other 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.110
 smaller bottles and distribute 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.110
 between your friends 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.070
 On the other hand, if you want to continue maintaining 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.590
 your vanilla inside the bottle 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.140
 original you can continue using the es 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.880
 say once elaborated go taking the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.820
 spoons that you need to 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.010
 your recipes and so that the level of 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.230
 liquid is never below the level 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.930
 of the vanilla pods remember 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.910
 as long as the amount of liquid that 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.970
 take it out you have to add it again 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.040
 in vodka and keep macerating that how much 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.530
 the longer the vanilla is inside the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.360
 better and more intense alcohol will be the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.360
 flavor of the vanilla extract obtained 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.840
 The main difference between 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.569
 vanilla that we can buy in a 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.060
 shop and the homemade one is 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.130
 the color the taste is practically going to be 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.280
 indistinguishable after a period of 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.720
 big time the color that the 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.160
 vanilla that we buy in 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.350
 stores will be quite darker 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.030
 because the cold procedures to the 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.340
 that submit them and the liquor with which 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.290
 elaborate is darker than the vodka that 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.970
 the only one is really transparent 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.340
 difference will be that our vanilla 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.980
 homemade will have a little more color 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.540
 pale but the taste is going to be 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.540
 completely the same
