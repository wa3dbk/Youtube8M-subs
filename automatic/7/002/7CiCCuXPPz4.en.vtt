00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.730
 and this is unique to see that no 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.020
 was dead 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.750
 and we bring you the latest news about 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.690
 partner mission with rpm networks and 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:30.180
 it stops being this morning 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.180
 I just received another email 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.700
 is just in case there is a new one 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.190
 mail 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.190
 at 8 24 in the morning 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.800
 in which they are not indicating the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.260
 Next step to move forward in this 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.420
 partner 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.910
 and what they start to do is send a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.310
 email to a certain address in 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:00.290
 which I said authorizing 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:03.560
 let's say the union of my channel to the network of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:09.220
 rpm which is the one I 'm requesting 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:12.950
 partner and said that unfortunately 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.440
 that would get answer in more or less 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.420
 three weeks and here it says 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:26.689
 and where is it here 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.970
 and says three weeks well I guess that 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.470
 we will have answers from them in three 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.090
 weeks and not today as I thought 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.110
 but there is also good news 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.420
 because in this e-mail 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.150
 in here 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.550
 there is an attachment there you can see 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.150
 the the activity symbol next to iu 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.150
 okay 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.560
 I do not think I can show file I do not know 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.760
 I 'm not sure but I'll tell you I had 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.760
 that file that file 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.430
 have you say 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.719
 of user and a password to use in 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.929
 a music page and that user and 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:12.019
 password is let's say 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.019
 good is going to all the members of 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.799
 rpm network so I think this already 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.799
 It is telling me what 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.910
 let's say you are a partner with them 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.890
 and in this good document rather with 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.020
 that username and password can I 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.870
 use music and sound effects 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.740
 of that page legally in my videos 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.690
 without having copyright problems 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.980
 as long as I give credit to them 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.840
 obviously in the description of the video 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.360
 so I think it's good news 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.010
 for both me and you 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.709
 subscribers 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.160
 and well then we'll see in three weeks 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.690
 what answers us 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.180
 then I guess that's all for 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.360
 this moment if some other 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.190
 the novelty will also know 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.420
 initially arrived in a way together with 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.960
 only that I do not know here comes and comes here 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.200
 efe 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.530
 and well now yes that's all from part of 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.770
 nico and me what 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.530
 hehe 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.900
 and well now it is already all that our 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.390
 0-2 the ethnic 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.390
