00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
 very cross 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.600
 Welcome to the live here I bring you 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.820
 another video this time to tell us how 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.790
 do well a slime farm samil 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.740
 24-25 made one is one of my dear ones 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.240
 subscribers and wanted to show me the and 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.820
 well let's go see the I'm going to 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.800
 say a couple of little things more than 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.199
 they could add on the farm that he has 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 built and good a lot of people have 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.260
 been asking how to get out 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.540
 find them slam draw somehow 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.879
 an area where they can reappear and how 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.309
 find them easily and I'll tell you 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.379
 the idea that is admired manufactured is 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.390
 pretty good the only thing that adding a 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.729
 couple of details that has made a 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.290
 digging down to the top of the 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.790
 map the maximum depth that are those 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.230
 blocks that are unbreakable as they are 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.390
 you know 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.700
 and what is the idea to go down to that 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.540
 depth and make a huge room very 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.660
 well lit how are you going to see here what 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.640
 we see vale is a very very large room he 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.560
 He told me that he has achieved 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.950
 20 disgusting balls of which 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.930
 loose the slams for this room is worth and 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.979
 well right now you can not see any 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.990
 slams because he just collected the well 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.580
 that did not come out but in a room 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.710
 these characteristics or rather 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.380
 wide underground to a good 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.590
 depth if they would come in lines of 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 very easy way the only thing that the only 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.780
 I see this room for 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.550
 permear is samir lines good to look at 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.130
 there's even a diamond out there that only 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.470
 was saying to samir the only fault 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.399
 what this farm has in this case is the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.080
 wash 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.030
 If the slides get into the lava 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.310
 they die directly and they do not leave us those 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.070
 balls that they usually leave and that's what 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.630
 we need to make the pistons 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.300
 sticky in the future so the only thing 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.819
 What I would recommend is to cover the areas 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.860
 There is lava so that the slams do not get 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.720
 over there and good I hope 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.300
 this video or has already left things 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.800
 a little clearer like if you liked it and 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.720
 his for more videos you know and we 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.650
 we will see in upcoming videos so nothing 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.650
 a greeting and see you later
