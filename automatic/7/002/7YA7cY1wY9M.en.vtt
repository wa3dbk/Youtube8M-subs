00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.970 
the pinnacle and worth to fuck its
pinnacle<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.230> at<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:14.440> point<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.950> know

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
pinnacle you know at this point you know

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.380 
pinnacle you know at this point you know
it's<00:02:15.220> kinda<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.610> internet<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.090> almost

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's kinda like the internet is almost

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.509 
it's kinda like the internet is almost
like<00:02:16.599> if<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.799> know<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.099> kind<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.340> got

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
like if the you know and I kind of got

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.949 
like if the you know and I kind of got
the<00:02:18.610> spoke<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:18.940> somebody<00:02:19.120> else<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.629> I<00:02:19.660> think

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
the spoke to somebody else but I think

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.650 
the spoke to somebody else but I think
it's<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.110> great<00:02:20.140> analogy<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:21.489> like<00:02:21.849> if<00:02:22.360> there

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
it's a great analogy it's like if there

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.470 
it's a great analogy it's like if there
were<00:02:22.750> cars<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.230> could<00:02:23.379> never<00:02:23.890> fly<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.790> there

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
were cars that could never fly and there

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.910 
were cars that could never fly and there
were<00:02:25.540> no<00:02:25.569> stoplights<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.440> those<00:02:26.620> stop<00:02:26.890> signs

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
were no stoplights and those stop signs

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.069 
were no stoplights and those stop signs
and<00:02:27.370> no<00:02:27.489> street<00:02:27.790> signs<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.420> everybody<00:02:28.840> was

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
and no street signs and everybody was

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.199 
and no street signs and everybody was
just<00:02:29.349> driving<00:02:29.829> and<00:02:30.160> flying<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.670> air<00:02:30.700> it's

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
just driving and flying in the air it's

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.610 
just driving and flying in the air it's
kind<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.540> what<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> internet<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.230> so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
kind of like what the internet is so

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.870 
kind of like what the internet is so
when<00:02:32.769> something<00:02:32.980> gets<00:02:33.190> out<00:02:33.430> there<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.760> know

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
when something gets out there you know

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.500 
when something gets out there you know
it's<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.209> all<00:02:34.870> over<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.440> place<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.920> um<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
it's just all over the place and um you

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.160 
it's just all over the place and um you
know<00:02:37.739> your<00:02:38.739> government<00:02:39.630> cyberspace<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:41.019> know

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
know your government cyberspace you know

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.780 
know your government cyberspace you know
so<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.410> was<00:02:41.530> really<00:02:41.650> kind<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:41.980> hard<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.280> stop<00:02:42.610> for

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so I was really kind of hard to stop for

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.759 
so I was really kind of hard to stop for
something<00:02:42.970> once<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.360> leaks<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:44.440> know<00:02:44.560> but<00:02:44.680> at
