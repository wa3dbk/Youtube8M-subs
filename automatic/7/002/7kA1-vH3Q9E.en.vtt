00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
anytime you build a race car out of a

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
brand-new road car that hasn't even been

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.229 
brand-new road car that hasn't even been
to<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.559> marketplace<00:01:02.890> yet<00:01:03.309> there<00:01:04.000> are<00:01:04.030> some

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
to the marketplace yet there are some

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.450 
to the marketplace yet there are some
challenges<00:01:04.950> they<00:01:05.950> wanted<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.340> really

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
challenges they wanted to really

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.820 
challenges they wanted to really
integrate<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.600> racecar<00:01:08.140> with<00:01:08.710> the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
integrate the racecar with the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.620 
integrate the racecar with the
production<00:01:09.280> car<00:01:09.430> from<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.909> beginning<00:01:10.240> so<00:01:10.479> we

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
production car from the beginning so we

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.850 
production car from the beginning so we
have<00:01:10.750> numerous<00:01:10.930> conversations<00:01:11.290> back<00:01:11.830> and

in<00:01:16.360> California<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.860> what<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.159> car<00:01:18.369> needed

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
in California really what the car needed

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.490 
in California really what the car needed
to<00:01:18.789> be<00:01:18.940> what<00:01:19.119> class<00:01:19.479> what<00:01:19.869> components<00:01:20.440> were

they<00:01:42.740> built<00:01:42.950> these<00:01:43.100> cars<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:44.179> months

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900

they built these cars in months
where<00:01:45.260> some<00:01:45.440> people<00:01:45.740> taking<00:01:45.950> over<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> year<00:01:46.850> to

where some people taking over a year to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.490 
where some people taking over a year to
develop<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.510> I<00:01:47.659> think<00:01:47.960> that's<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.350> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
what else we have to work on when we

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.070 
what else we have to work on when we
came<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:39.310> with<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.489> rxa<00:03:39.910> our<00:03:40.480> first<00:03:40.750> year<00:03:40.959> we

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
came here with the rxa our first year we

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.170 
came here with the rxa our first year we
had<00:03:41.200> an<00:03:41.319> issue<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.770> over<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.670> second<00:03:43.000> year

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
had an issue and over the second year

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.670 
had an issue and over the second year
we're<00:03:43.360> pretty<00:03:43.630> competitive<00:03:43.959> about<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.470> third

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
we're pretty competitive about the third

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.620 
we're pretty competitive about the third
year<00:03:44.920> we<00:03:45.040> won<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.250> event<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:46.090> usually<00:03:46.450> takes

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
year we won the event so usually takes

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.180 
year we won the event so usually takes
three<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.959> four<00:03:47.170> years<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.500> figure<00:03:47.770> out<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> new

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
three to four years to figure out a new

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.089 
three to four years to figure out a new
car<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:48.940> we're<00:03:49.300> right<00:03:49.480> on<00:03:49.510> plan
