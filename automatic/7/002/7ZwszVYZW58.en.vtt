00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
film techniques that I had never used

into the shot over and over again I

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.799 
into the shot over and over again I
change<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.820> coloring<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.420> each<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.690> the

each a distinct look
I<00:00:44.000> used<00:00:45.000> three<00:00:45.270> separate<00:00:45.809> methods<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.379> capture

I used three separate methods to capture
the<00:00:46.860> movement<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> flying<00:00:47.730> ships<00:00:48.230> first<00:00:49.230> I

the movement of the flying ships first I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
the movement of the flying ships first I

tried moving the camera up and down to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
tried moving the camera up and down to
give<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> illusion<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.809> ships<00:00:58.050> were

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
give the illusion that the ships were

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
give the illusion that the ships were
moving<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> third<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.850> mounted<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> ships<00:01:00.960> on

moving and third I mounted the ships on

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
moving and third I mounted the ships on
a<00:01:01.230> green<00:01:01.559> base<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.670> moved<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
a green base and just moved them in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.590 
a green base and just moved them in
front<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> camera<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.199> hands<00:01:05.600> who

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
video this last method proved quite
effective<00:01:14.549> allowing<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> give<00:01:15.659> their

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
more often than not I found that this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
more often than not I found that this
live-action<00:01:24.330> movement<00:01:24.750> ended<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.229> working

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
live-action movement ended up working

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.039 
live-action movement ended up working

a final touch that really gave these

a final touch that really gave these

camera this atmospheric perspective

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.240 
camera this atmospheric perspective
really<00:01:51.750> sold<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> illusion<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> distance<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
really sold the illusion of distance and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190 
really sold the illusion of distance and
also<00:01:53.939> helped<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.180> cover<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.659> any<00:01:54.869> sloppy

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
also helped to cover up any sloppy

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.520 
also helped to cover up any sloppy
compositing<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.130> shots<00:01:56.399> might<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.729> had

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
compositing that my shots might have had

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.130
