actually<00:01:09.650> reads<00:01:09.950> me<00:01:10.070> very<00:01:10.310> pretty<00:01:10.549> very

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790

nicely<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.479> starts<00:01:11.810> with<00:01:11.930> two<00:01:12.200> things<00:01:12.500> that

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
nicely and starts with two things that

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.760 
nicely and starts with two things that
work<00:01:12.920> perfectly<00:01:13.430> against<00:01:13.729> my<00:01:13.880> two<00:01:13.939> things<00:01:14.770> so

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
work perfectly against my two things so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.270 
work perfectly against my two things so
i'll<00:01:15.829> talk<00:01:15.950> with<00:01:15.979> excadrill<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.759> and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
i'll talk with excadrill and and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.819 
i'll talk with excadrill and and
gyarados<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.229> immediately<00:01:21.229> off<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> bat<00:01:21.649> I'm

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
gyarados so immediately off the bat I'm

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.620 
gyarados so immediately off the bat I'm
thinking<00:01:22.159> I<00:01:22.369> have<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:22.820> protect<00:01:23.030> with<00:01:23.299> Heatran

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
thinking I have to protect with Heatran

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.029 
thinking I have to protect with Heatran
because<00:01:23.899> he's<00:01:24.049> probably<00:01:24.229> gonna<00:01:24.409> double<00:01:24.829> Tech

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
because he's probably gonna double Tech

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.599 
because he's probably gonna double Tech
my<00:01:25.219> heat<00:01:25.850> ran<00:01:26.060> with<00:01:26.270> gr<00:01:26.539> dose<00:01:26.749> and<00:01:27.429> extra<00:01:28.429> drill

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
my heat ran with gr dose and extra drill

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.690 
my heat ran with gr dose and extra drill
and<00:01:28.789> here<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:29.689> was<00:01:29.749> thinking<00:01:29.840> maybe<00:01:30.140> he<00:01:30.409> would

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
and here I was thinking maybe he would

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.120 
and here I was thinking maybe he would
go<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.909> rockslide<00:01:32.320> for<00:01:33.320> some<00:01:33.560> reason<00:01:33.890> and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
go for a rockslide for some reason and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.560 
go for a rockslide for some reason and
try<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.460> just<00:01:34.579> do<00:01:34.999> some<00:01:35.149> extra<00:01:35.359> damage

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
try to just do some extra damage

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.880 
try to just do some extra damage
breaking<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.079> balloon<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.469> possibly

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
breaking the balloon and possibly

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.219 
breaking the balloon and possibly
killing<00:01:37.159> with<00:01:37.340> waterfall<00:01:37.789> but<00:01:38.359> he<00:01:38.719> decides<00:01:39.020> to

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
killing with waterfall but he decides to

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.989 
killing with waterfall but he decides to
just<00:01:39.439> protect<00:01:39.799> with<00:01:40.009> excadrill<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.729> that

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
just protect with excadrill and that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.539 
just protect with excadrill and that
reveals<00:01:41.299> my<00:01:41.450> counter<00:01:41.899> which<00:01:42.399> really<00:01:43.399> stinks

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
reveals my counter which really stinks

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.489 
reveals my counter which really stinks
because<00:01:43.969> that's<00:01:44.299> basically<00:01:44.390> my<00:01:44.749> trick<00:01:45.170> with

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
because that's basically my trick with

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
turns and i'm looking for a rockslide

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:02.409 
turns and i'm looking for a rockslide
now<00:02:58.250> hitting<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.650> ER<00:03:00.650> dose<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:01.269> it's<00:03:02.269> going

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
now hitting the ER dose and it's going

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.849 
now hitting the ER dose and it's going
to<00:03:02.510> take<00:03:02.599> it<00:03:02.719> out<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:02.989> I'm<00:03:03.349> gonna<00:03:03.439> go<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.799> an

to take it out and I'm gonna go for an

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.770 
to take it out and I'm gonna go for an
earth<00:03:04.040> power<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.969> basically<00:03:05.359> just<00:03:05.480> because

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
earth power it's basically just because

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.339 
earth power it's basically just because
I<00:03:05.900> have<00:03:06.169> to<00:03:06.199> and<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:08.510> basically<00:03:08.959> the

scenario that happens brings out
ferrothorn<00:03:11.780> which<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.109> great<00:03:12.349> now<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.799> go

for<00:05:20.229> some<00:05:20.380> reason<00:05:20.650> I<00:05:20.710> was<00:05:20.860> not<00:05:21.010> expecting

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
for some reason I was not expecting

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.420 
for some reason I was not expecting
protect<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:23.710> really<00:05:23.979> threw<00:05:24.280> me<00:05:24.310> off

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
protect and that really threw me off

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.250 
protect and that really threw me off
which<00:05:25.000> is<00:05:25.510> kind<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.260> a<00:05:26.380> big<00:05:26.590> deal<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:28.140> so<00:05:29.140> I'm

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
which is kind of a big deal and so I'm

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.050 
which is kind of a big deal and so I'm
just<00:05:29.440> now<00:05:29.590> going<00:05:29.740> to<00:05:29.860> double<00:05:30.310> attack<00:05:30.520> because

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.490 
just now going to double attack because
I<00:05:31.180> mindlessly<00:05:31.690> thought<00:05:31.960> okay<00:05:32.229> he<00:05:32.380> doesn't

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.280 
I mindlessly thought okay he doesn't
have<00:05:32.740> protect<00:05:33.070> what<00:05:33.720> derpy<00:05:34.720> is<00:05:34.840> leach<00:05:35.050> see

now<00:05:58.379> I<00:05:58.680> should<00:05:59.340> have<00:05:59.430> set<00:05:59.639> up<00:05:59.759> a<00:05:59.879> sub<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:00.300> turn

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
now I should have set up a sub this turn

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.689

if<00:06:00.689> I<00:06:00.750> set<00:06:00.990> up<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.169> sub<00:06:01.409> this<00:06:01.560> turn<00:06:01.770> I<00:06:02.069> would<00:06:02.610> have

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
if I set up a sub this turn I would have

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.270 
if I set up a sub this turn I would have
won<00:06:02.849> the<00:06:02.879> game<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.560> because<00:06:04.560> i<00:06:04.740> did<00:06:04.949> not<00:06:04.979> set
