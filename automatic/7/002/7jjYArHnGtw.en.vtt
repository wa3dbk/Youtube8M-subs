in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> simulator<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:19.780> we'll<00:02:19.959> just<00:02:19.989> use<00:02:20.319> this

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
in the simulator but we'll just use this

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.559

and<00:02:23.459> I'll<00:02:24.459> show<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.880> wallpaper<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.540> a
