um<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:19.199> course<00:05:19.350> I<00:05:19.800> think<00:05:19.919> I've<00:05:20.130> said<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:20.760> a

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
um of course I think I've said this in a

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.240 
um of course I think I've said this in a
different<00:05:21.120> video<00:05:21.210> but<00:05:21.949> when<00:05:22.949> you're<00:05:23.040> drying

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
different video but when you're drying

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.219 
different video but when you're drying
or<00:05:23.400> listicle<00:05:23.790> II<00:05:23.850> like<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.060> smile<00:05:24.660> is<00:05:24.960> not<00:05:25.199> a

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
or listicle II like a smile is not a

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.400 
or listicle II like a smile is not a
u-shape<00:05:25.919> it's<00:05:26.760> really<00:05:27.240> more<00:05:27.479> of<00:05:27.630> like<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:28.020> flat

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
u-shape it's really more of like a flat

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.300 
u-shape it's really more of like a flat
line<00:05:28.910> of<00:05:29.910> kind<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.210> upturned<00:05:30.660> corners

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
line of kind of upturned corners

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.030 
line of kind of upturned corners
so<00:05:32.850> in<00:05:32.970> this<00:05:33.080> cartoonish<00:05:34.080> style<00:05:34.410> I've

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
so in this cartoonish style I've

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.430 
so in this cartoonish style I've
definitely<00:05:35.660> brought<00:05:36.660> up<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.960> corners<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.320> lot

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
definitely brought up the corners a lot

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.000 
definitely brought up the corners a lot
more<00:05:37.650> than<00:05:37.800> you<00:05:37.919> would<00:05:37.949> realistically<00:05:38.490> but

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
more than you would realistically but

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.230 
more than you would realistically but
well<00:05:41.010> if<00:05:41.070> you're<00:05:41.400> drawing<00:05:41.580> more<00:05:41.760> stylized

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
well if you're drawing more stylized

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.320 
well if you're drawing more stylized
like<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:42.720> emphasize<00:05:43.199> points<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:45.090> get<00:05:45.240> the

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
like you emphasize points to to get the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.120 
like you emphasize points to to get the
emotion<00:05:45.660> across<00:05:45.840> so<00:05:46.590> I'm<00:05:46.650> going<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.860> zoom<00:05:47.010> out

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
emotion across so I'm going to zoom out

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.060 
emotion across so I'm going to zoom out
a<00:05:47.190> little<00:05:47.280> bit<00:05:47.490> and<00:05:47.790> we<00:05:47.880> can<00:05:47.910> see<00:05:48.410> in<00:05:49.410> just

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
a little bit and we can see in just

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.029 
a little bit and we can see in just
these<00:05:50.190> four<00:05:50.460> different<00:05:50.610> expressions<00:05:52.039> they're
