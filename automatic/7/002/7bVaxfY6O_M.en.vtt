00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.040
 the truth is I'm very happy for the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.990
 people who have been playing the cup 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.369
 because you know is sometimes a tournament that 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.230
 it's good especially for people who 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.580
 out there does not have is not having good 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.830
 participation because they are 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.360
 doing a good job deservedly 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.220
 is in a final they have done excellent 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 games and well that's what that reflects and 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.360
 with players that suddenly appear in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.400
 the league and they have good pace and they have 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 good very good presence we have 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.560
 parties that face very difficult very 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 complicated outlets complicated equipment 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.350
 that are very well in the league that are 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.840
 playing very well 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.609
 and we good have to go week 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.320
 after a week trying to find the 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.930
 better results I think we're 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.820
 much in debt the us as a team 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.489
 with the prisons we are quite not 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.070
 this does not pay well the winch all not 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.619
 ends still so I think saving us the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.330
 people have had a lot of endurance with this 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.760
 team has passed very difficult winches 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.390
 He says has 34 tournaments do not know what not 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.940
 qualifies a group 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.950
 we are all with hope we have now 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.450
 a good team and little by little we are 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.240
 trying to 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.520
 to return and that chivas begins 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.229
 work fine I think that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.000
 I always say it's not times sometimes 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.320
 of football sometimes from institutions 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.570
 that was of good times and moments 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.820
 bad but always say you have to try 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.520
 to do the best possible thing something was achieved 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.100
 very important it was long not 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.560
 I needed a final but good now 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.469
 you have to concentrate on the party of 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.179
 Sunday to play late but as 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.979
 you say now with a team of first 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.840
 division with chivas is something totally 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.759
 different and good to work us and 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.549
 mentalize ourselves for that to be able to be 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.140
 and we are in the final but hey ago 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.270
 missing the most important thing is that it is 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.670
 winning the tour is an important victory 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.760
 and it served us to let us give you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.010
 three more points but good 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.420
 we have to keep adding but if not 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.620
 we are back where we are not 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.020
 It's no use winning the match 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.350
 happened if things do not go well 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.410
 we are thinking of continuing to add to 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.480
 get away from there have very matches 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.070
 important as well as because 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.390
 subject to the decline they are already less 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.860
 matches as well as rivals 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.500
 If a good seal is coming around me 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.500
 that is the best way and face them 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 Y
