personally I'm a PlayStation guy because

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.730 
personally I'm a PlayStation guy because
I<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:22.199> raised<00:00:22.529> playing<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.340> ps1<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.750> ps2

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I was raised playing the ps1 and the ps2

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.089 
I was raised playing the ps1 and the ps2
and<00:00:26.060> that's<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.019> grew<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and that's just what I grew up on and I

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.040 
and that's just what I grew up on and I
should<00:00:29.130> say<00:00:29.519> about<00:00:30.300> both<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> these

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
should say about both of these

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.740 
should say about both of these
controllers<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.009> looks<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:32.759> tightened

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
controllers it looks like they tightened

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.040 
controllers it looks like they tightened
up<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> controls<00:00:34.559> made<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> more<00:00:35.219> responsive

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
up the controls made it more responsive

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.740 
up the controls made it more responsive
less<00:00:37.050> lag<00:00:37.440> more<00:00:38.340> responsive<00:00:39.180> tighter

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
less lag more responsive tighter

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.350 
less lag more responsive tighter
controls<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.910> want

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
controls I think that's what we all want

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.090 
controls I think that's what we all want
and<00:00:42.450> especially<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.440> first-person

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and especially with first-person

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.510 
and especially with first-person
shooters<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.450> new<00:00:46.399> Dual<00:00:47.399> Shock

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330 
shooters with the new Dual Shock
controller<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.629> analog<00:00:49.050> sticks<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.649> divots

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
controller the analog sticks have divots

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.170 
controller the analog sticks have divots
in<00:00:50.460> them<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:50.879> are<00:00:51.180> gonna<00:00:51.449> help<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:52.379> long

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
in them which are gonna help for long

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.450 
in them which are gonna help for long
precision<00:00:54.320> sniping<00:00:55.320> accuracy<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> comes

to first-person shooters and just make

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
to first-person shooters and just make
the<00:00:58.710> controls<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.399> little<00:00:59.699> bit<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.690> tighter

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the controls a little bit more tighter

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.280 
the controls a little bit more tighter
there's<00:01:01.530> no<00:01:01.680> longer<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.340> dead<00:01:02.969> zone<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
there's no longer that dead zone on the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.450 
there's no longer that dead zone on the
ps3<00:01:05.270> dome<00:01:06.270> analog<00:01:06.840> sticks<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.500> both<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
ps3 dome analog sticks so both of the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
ps3 dome analog sticks so both of the
controllers<00:01:09.000> look<00:01:09.210> sick<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:10.080> thing<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.500> will

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
controllers look sick one thing I will

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.640 
controllers look sick one thing I will
say<00:01:10.799> about<00:01:11.720> PlayStation<00:01:12.720> controllers<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
say about PlayStation controllers is

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.830 
say about PlayStation controllers is
when<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> controller<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.360> want<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
when I think of a controller I want it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
when I think of a controller I want it
to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.500> part<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> want<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:18.000> be

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to be a part of me I want to be

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
to be a part of me I want to be
controlling<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.930> character<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.310> mind

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
controlling the character with my mind

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.960 
controlling the character with my mind
not<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.600> hands<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
not really my hands and I think the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.050 
not really my hands and I think the
PlayStation<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.990> better<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.060> because

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
PlayStation is better for that because

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.780 
PlayStation is better for that because
if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.900> body<00:01:28.290> it's

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
if you think of your body it's

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.810 
if you think of your body it's
symmetrical<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> same<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.869> both<00:01:30.930> sides

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
symmetrical it's the same on both sides

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
symmetrical it's the same on both sides
so<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> PlayStation<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> buttons<00:01:34.380> are<00:01:34.710> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
so as a PlayStation the buttons are in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
so as a PlayStation the buttons are in
the<00:01:35.130> same<00:01:35.340> location<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.210> analogs<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.409> in

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the same location that analogs are in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
the same location that analogs are in
the<00:01:37.710> same<00:01:37.920> location<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> when<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.240> comes<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the same location and when it comes to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
the same location and when it comes to
the<00:01:39.630> Xbox<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.740> analog<00:01:41.280> sticks<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:41.970> the

suggestion<00:02:10.259> why<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.190> make<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.640> small<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:13.190> medium

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
suggestion why not make a small a medium

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.050 
suggestion why not make a small a medium
and<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.970> large<00:02:15.300> size<00:02:15.840> controller<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:17.340> medium

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and a large size controller this medium

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.520 
and a large size controller this medium
won't<00:02:18.239> be<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.510> regular<00:02:18.690> controller<00:02:19.290> right

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
won't be the regular controller right

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.130 
won't be the regular controller right
now<00:02:19.590> small<00:02:20.580> will<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:20.940> for<00:02:21.180> younger<00:02:21.510> people<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
now small will be for younger people and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.949 
now small will be for younger people and
large<00:02:22.890> could<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.459> like<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> hundred<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.540> twenty

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
large could be like a hundred and twenty

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.860 
large could be like a hundred and twenty
five<00:02:25.080> percent<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.950> medium<00:02:26.340> size<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.940> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
five percent of the medium size and I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.229 
five percent of the medium size and I
think<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.350> will<00:02:28.500> make<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.980> lot<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.790> people

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
think that will make a lot of people

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.920 
think that will make a lot of people
happy

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.920 
happy
so<00:02:31.230> moving<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.860> oh<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.459> should<00:02:33.090> say<00:02:33.120> about<00:02:33.750> the

ps4 controller it has a little speaker
in<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.810> think<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.320> had<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.860> cool
