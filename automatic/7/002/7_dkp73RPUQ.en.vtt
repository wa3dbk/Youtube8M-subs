00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
tone Armour and place it manually the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820 
tone Armour and place it manually the
platter<00:01:25.630> will<00:01:25.810> start<00:01:26.050> spitting<00:01:26.290> out<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.530> sound

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
platter will start spitting out a sound

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.320 
platter will start spitting out a sound
to<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:30.280> through<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.550> rest<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.910> song<00:01:31.150> I
