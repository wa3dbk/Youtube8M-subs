00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.020
 one 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:17.330
 very good I propose an exercise for 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 go loosing them in the pick and we're going to 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.720
 do on three chords in the minor 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.720
 i 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.040
 if we take for example let's work 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.040
 2 is everything 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.450
 the o2 and the fourth if we are in the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.450
 smaller for example we do this 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.040
 what I do 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:53.300
 in this case it consists of movement cava 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.300
 and between movement each position is worth 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.370
 one 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.370
 once we put the chord back to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.989
 your natural or main position 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.130
 we repeat two alpha which ends 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.469
 exercise 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.009
 the exercise followed and very slowly 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.009
 would be 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 i 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.070
 the younger man we would do the same 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.070
 these two fingers and we would do 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.909
 it's the same mechanics 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.590
 good to me we would do 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.590
 2000 where two is worth but we find 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.180
 all right 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.240
 then we have the smallest and always the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.240
 same mechanics 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.870
 revealed 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.780
 I would go through the majority again and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.780
 right now 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.450
 miami 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.180
 well this is the shooting site that 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.550
 it happened to me one day I mean I have not 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.460
 seen make a site 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.200
 good are are these exercises serve 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:30.140
 to then apply them to flamenco in 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.570
 flamenco stick in falsetas in songs 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.640
 therefore the exercise has to be 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.100
 work to be prepared and could 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.010
 know what I'm talking about but 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.410
 tell you that one day I do not know if I had the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.700
 conversation was not seeing something and I 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.700
 I realized that I started doing that 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.920
 and good and that the interesting and well be 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:01.390
 what could a class do explaining 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.790
 these movements I hope you like them and 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.730
 What is true is that they can already 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.370
 be this agreement may be others 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.930
 we will always always apply 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.780
 one way or another therefore always 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.750
 he's going to teach you something, I know that the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.269
 short video but we're going to stop 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.410
 here is worth a hug and thanks for 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.410
 your interest in our monitoring 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.410
 Thank you
