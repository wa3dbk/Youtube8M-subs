00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.950

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.160
 Although cheap meat from the medium against 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.920
 really horny butcher meat 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 we will synchronize that today 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.859
 We are offsetting the fry synchronously 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.350
 and of course that's it 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.000
 Taste the color test and then 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.789
 I could myself a picture of it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.370
 do what is really better for you 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:36.600
 So have fun so everything 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.320
 is really fair, I have something 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.690

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.579
 on the left is that butcher meat 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.230
 We'll throw both on the scales 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 then we will see that both 250 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 gram weighs 250 grams talk, the lies 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.770
 meat and here is the butcher meat 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.780
 I do not know if I can recognize it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.619
 I hope the woman is already hot 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.560
 that will be both next to each other 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.610
 then laid is sizzling 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 then we'll have a look at the end of the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.850
 winner is then we push that 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 first meat the villages first time that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.900
 song meat followed by the butcher 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.900
 meat 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.240
 Wow 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.500
 So here you can see the first one 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.420
 small difference that butcher meat 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 is already crunchy women of the same 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.580
 The time will be that of nigl 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.740
 I would almost go for it 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.619
 I'm natural 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.090
 not the pros for it but how 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.440
 said we are not done yet 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 you just once himself an image after 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.269
 if you ask now why do I 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.489
 love me such a hard job now 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.530
 maybe meat butcher 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.420
 there is always one on the hand 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.510
 thing one better than the making of 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.349
 others and I do not want to be the one 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.110
 worse than others 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.330
 I try as much quality as possible 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.849
 to put everything what I like my body 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.620
 Does a lot of meat consumption on the day is up 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.480
 any case not the best scenario for 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.879
 the body is exactly the albert bridge 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.110
 other supplements one should 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.660
 make sure that quality is 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.069
 yes, and that's why I am 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.640
 just gone away 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.370
 from this mass consumption of cheap 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.500
 meat but also tries a lot more 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.090
 to attach importance to quality 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.579
 the reasons for it as you see the same 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.349
 to say in advance that of the cheap 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.900
 there is not much meat left 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.579
 like a real meat and there 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.920
 are times from 500 grams of meat times 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.630
 just 400 what the really good 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.200
 maybe not happening so i think so 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.220
 we'll be done so slowly now 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.239
 the ultimate proof that butcher 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.080
 meat in any case the better 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:24.450
 Variant is so have here 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.780

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:36.600
 the juice still out and here the dear 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.560

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.670
 I will cut the time apart 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:48.300
 This is tender as butter love 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:53.700

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:56.720
 totally fibrous here you can again 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.720
 take a closer look 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.550
 So I do not know if you misjudge but 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.820
 this is deep juicy there runs the 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.490
 juice still out here if it is 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:17.480
 meat you can see it's just total 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.670
 phase away it is dry from tess 2 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.330
 is of course the level what is 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.330
 left over 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:32.390

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.390

 from 200 grams to 250 grams we have 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:05.600
 there are still 200 left that means we 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.850
 I had a loss of meat, I'll tell you 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.370

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.250

 We have a weight loss of 100 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.030

 Weight loss of 50 grams 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.880

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.870
 the fibrous meat sweetheart from 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.530

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.710
 you really want to have it 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.020
 Thoughts do not really matter 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.850
 wanted to grab butcher meat 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.290
 Quality is far better by nature 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.290
 time and more 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.000
 but in the end you just have 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.170
 more of that 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.610
 that does not mean we every day 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.010

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.250
