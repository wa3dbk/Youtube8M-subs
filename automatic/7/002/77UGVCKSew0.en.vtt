it's<00:01:05.780> like<00:01:05.990> 1520<00:01:06.980> degrees<00:01:07.150> it's<00:01:08.150> not<00:01:08.300> going<00:01:08.510> to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
it's like 1520 degrees it's not going to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.120 
it's like 1520 degrees it's not going to
do<00:01:08.690> much<00:01:08.870> good<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.590> going<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.010> get

do much good to it going to get
contraction<00:01:10.730> in<00:01:10.850> certain<00:01:11.210> areas<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.810> if<00:01:11.900> you

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
contraction in certain areas and if you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.900 
contraction in certain areas and if you
crack<00:01:12.230> it<00:01:14.470> usually<00:01:15.470> an<00:01:15.860> oil<00:01:16.220> change<00:01:16.580> takes

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
crack it usually an oil change takes

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.020 
crack it usually an oil change takes
about<00:01:17.150> three<00:01:17.479> hours<00:01:17.510> from<00:01:17.990> car<00:01:18.380> driving<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.160> to

about three hours from car driving in to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.750 
about three hours from car driving in to
cool<00:01:20.270> down<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:21.020> do<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.260> safely<00:01:24.340> well<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.490> let

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
cool down and to do it safely well I let

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.280 
cool down and to do it safely well I let
it<00:01:25.880> cool<00:01:26.030> down<00:01:26.090> enough<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:26.810> drain<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.260> oil

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
it cool down enough that I drain the oil

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.790 
it cool down enough that I drain the oil
and<00:01:27.920> change<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.490> filter<00:01:29.590> once<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.740> oil

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
and change the filter once the oil

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.700 
and change the filter once the oil
finished<00:01:31.700> draining<00:01:32.180> either<00:01:32.570> put<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.560> little

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
finished draining either put a little

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.280 
finished draining either put a little
bit<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:33.950> engine<00:01:34.400> oil<00:01:34.490> flush<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:35.119> there<00:01:35.300> /<00:01:36.110> it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290

all through and break up any in
some<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.060> then<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.090> poured<00:01:41.509> a<00:01:41.570> bit<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.840> fresh

bad<00:02:00.409> oil<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.070> trap<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:02.030> was<00:02:02.390> suiting<00:02:02.750> up<00:02:02.870> it<00:02:03.050> did

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.940 

yeah<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.940> horrible<00:02:08.479> but<00:02:08.660> well<00:02:09.470> needed

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
yeah so horrible but well needed

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.060 
yeah so horrible but well needed
changing<00:02:10.399> probably<00:02:11.560> five<00:02:12.560> hundred<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.040> a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
changing probably five hundred to a

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.449 
changing probably five hundred to a
thousand<00:02:13.430> days<00:02:13.580> ago<00:02:17.350> no<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.799> oil<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.100> filters

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
thousand days ago no the oil and filters

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.620 
thousand days ago no the oil and filters
changed<00:02:19.489> on<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.660> not<00:02:21.500> much<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.830> really<00:02:22.070> show

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
changed on it so not much to really show

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:42.970 
changed on it so not much to really show
started

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.830 

well<00:02:43.980> still<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> little<00:02:44.610> whiny<00:02:44.970> from<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.569> cams

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
well still a little whiny from the cams

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.690 
well still a little whiny from the cams
but<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.440> heaps<00:02:46.769> better<00:02:46.920> than<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.340> used<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.640> be

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
but it's heaps better than it used to be

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.369 
but it's heaps better than it used to be
your<00:02:48.150> seniors<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.629> sound<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.019> rattle

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
your seniors to sound like a rattle

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.339 
your seniors to sound like a rattle
attractor<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.150> much<00:02:52.080> better<00:02:52.349> now<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> always

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
attractor so much better now so always

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.050 
attractor so much better now so always
good<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.650> change<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.069> oil<00:02:56.099> before<00:02:56.519> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
good to change the oil before it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.270 
good to change the oil before it
your<00:02:57.269> engine<00:03:00.349> now<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.410> other<00:03:01.650> thing<00:03:01.769> this<00:03:02.010> car

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
your engine now the other thing this car

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.449 
your engine now the other thing this car
was<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.640> for<00:03:02.940> was<00:03:03.560> intermittent<00:03:04.560> battery

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
was in for was intermittent battery

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.650 
was in for was intermittent battery
light<00:03:05.700> coming<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:08.090> most<00:03:09.090> people<00:03:09.390> think<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
light coming on most people think the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.440 
light coming on most people think the
battery<00:03:10.019> light<00:03:10.170> means<00:03:10.410> bad<00:03:10.769> battery<00:03:11.450> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
battery light means bad battery the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.870 
battery light means bad battery the
battery<00:03:12.629> light<00:03:13.110> actually<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:14.010> your<00:03:14.489> charge

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
battery light actually is your charge

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.660 
battery light actually is your charge
light<00:03:15.299> from<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.630> alternator<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:17.489> that

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
light from the alternator so if that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.580 
light from the alternator so if that
comes<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.360> generally<00:03:19.080> means<00:03:19.230> you've<00:03:19.440> got

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
comes on that generally means you've got

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.800 
comes on that generally means you've got
a<00:03:19.620> faulty<00:03:20.069> alternator<00:03:20.400> or<00:03:20.940> something<00:03:21.660> wrong

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
a faulty alternator or something wrong

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.410 
a faulty alternator or something wrong
with<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.989> charge<00:03:22.260> system<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:23.640> has<00:03:23.730> nothing<00:03:24.150> to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
with the charge system it has nothing to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.490 
with the charge system it has nothing to
do<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.750> battery<00:03:25.110> itself<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:28.470> I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
do with the battery itself so this one I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.259 
do with the battery itself so this one I
have<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:28.890> seen<00:03:29.160> come<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.579> when<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.880> shouldn't

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
have not seen come on when it shouldn't

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.990 
have not seen come on when it shouldn't
come<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.680> I've<00:03:31.829> just<00:03:32.010> told<00:03:32.220> them<00:03:32.430> let<00:03:32.819> it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
come on so I've just told them let it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.089 
come on so I've just told them let it
get<00:03:33.180> worse<00:03:33.450> because<00:03:34.380> if<00:03:34.590> they<00:03:34.739> said<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.010> just

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
get worse because if they said it just

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.830 
get worse because if they said it just
comes<00:03:35.340> on<00:03:35.519> every<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.180> again<00:03:36.209> for<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.630> few

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
comes on every now and again for a few

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.380 
comes on every now and again for a few
seconds<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.349> goes<00:03:37.560> away<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.329> probably

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
seconds and goes away so it's probably

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.559 
seconds and goes away so it's probably
faulty<00:03:39.900> regulator<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:40.799> bad<00:03:40.980> brushes

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.099 

but<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.409> does<00:03:44.590> everything<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.129> should<00:03:45.159> do

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
but it does everything it should do

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.989 
but it does everything it should do
aircon<00:03:47.109> on<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.409> con<00:03:47.859> off<00:03:48.010> headlights<00:03:48.700> on

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:48.999 
aircon on a con off headlights on

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.739 
aircon on a con off headlights on
headlights<00:03:49.389> off<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.870> can't<00:03:50.650> get<00:03:50.829> it<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.040> do<00:03:51.189> it

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:51.749 
headlights off I can't get it to do it

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.030 
headlights off I can't get it to do it
but<00:03:52.749> it<00:03:52.930> only<00:03:53.049> seems<00:03:53.379> to<00:03:53.469> do<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.739> in<00:03:53.829> heavy

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
but it only seems to do it in heavy

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.869 
but it only seems to do it in heavy
traffic<00:03:54.689> so<00:03:55.689> it's<00:03:55.840> probably<00:03:55.900> heat-related<00:03:56.879> so

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
traffic so it's probably heat-related so

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.190 
traffic so it's probably heat-related so
coming<00:03:58.090> into<00:03:58.239> summer<00:03:58.569> I'd<00:03:58.780> probably<00:03:58.930> start

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
coming into summer I'd probably start

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.940 
coming into summer I'd probably start
doing<00:03:59.469> it<00:03:59.560> more<00:03:59.709> then<00:04:00.129> I'll<00:04:00.310> be<00:04:00.459> able<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.849> okay

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
doing it more then I'll be able to okay

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.280 
doing it more then I'll be able to okay
definitely<00:04:02.950> old<00:04:03.099> neighbor<00:04:03.340> or<00:04:03.639> regulator<00:04:04.290> and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
definitely old neighbor or regulator and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.740 
definitely old neighbor or regulator and
repair<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.010> but<00:04:07.000> until<00:04:07.120> then<00:04:07.420> there's<00:04:07.629> no

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
repair it but until then there's no

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.050 
repair it but until then there's no
point<00:04:07.959> really<00:04:08.170> wasting<00:04:08.650> time<00:04:08.829> a<00:04:11.939> little<00:04:12.939> bit

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
point really wasting time a little bit

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.750 
point really wasting time a little bit
more<00:04:13.209> on<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.480> camry<00:04:13.959> up<00:04:14.829> for<00:04:15.069> a<00:04:15.099> test<00:04:15.340> drive<00:04:15.430> it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
more on the camry up for a test drive it

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.969 
more on the camry up for a test drive it
for<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:16.630> while<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.840> noticed<00:04:17.349> it<00:04:17.470> was<00:04:17.500> idling<00:04:17.889> a

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
for a while I noticed it was idling a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.789 
for a while I noticed it was idling a
little<00:04:18.250> bit<00:04:18.370> slow<00:04:18.669> for<00:04:18.699> me<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.299> here<00:04:19.799> so

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
little bit slow for me in here so

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.499 
little bit slow for me in here so
question<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.430> owner<00:04:21.579> a<00:04:21.699> little<00:04:22.000> more<00:04:22.180> about

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:22.509 
question the owner a little more about

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.270 
question the owner a little more about
when<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> charge<00:04:22.990> light<00:04:23.139> was<00:04:23.500> coming<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:23.919> like

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
when the charge light was coming on like

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.860 
when the charge light was coming on like
if<00:04:24.430> their<00:04:24.580> foot<00:04:24.789> was<00:04:24.940> on<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.090> gas<00:04:25.360> pedal<00:04:25.389> or

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
if their foot was on the gas pedal or

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.659 
if their foot was on the gas pedal or
not<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.680> know<00:04:26.710> if<00:04:26.949> they'll<00:04:27.130> facing<00:04:27.460> up<00:04:27.580> a

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
not and you know if they'll facing up a

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.870 
not and you know if they'll facing up a
hill<00:04:27.910> down<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.270> hill<00:04:28.419> and<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:30.310> answer<00:04:30.759> was

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
hill down the hill and the answer was

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.050 
hill down the hill and the answer was
foot<00:04:31.240> not<00:04:31.479> on<00:04:31.690> gas<00:04:31.930> pedal<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.699> usually<00:04:33.699> in<00:04:34.030> a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
foot not on gas pedal and usually in a

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.540 
foot not on gas pedal and usually in a
certain<00:04:34.389> spot<00:04:34.660> it<00:04:34.990> happens<00:04:35.440> near<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:35.949> hill<00:04:36.340> and

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
certain spot it happens near a hill and

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.360 
certain spot it happens near a hill and
some<00:04:36.880> lights<00:04:37.440> so<00:04:38.440> I'm<00:04:38.650> thinking<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:39.160> might<00:04:39.190> be

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
some lights so I'm thinking it might be

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.430 
some lights so I'm thinking it might be
even<00:04:39.699> Idol<00:04:40.210> related<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.169> might<00:04:41.320> be

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
even Idol related and it might be

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.740 
even Idol related and it might be
getting<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.740> bit<00:04:41.889> slow<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.580> charge<00:04:43.270> like<00:04:43.509> could

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
getting a bit slow and charge like could

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.260 
getting a bit slow and charge like could
be<00:04:43.870> coming<00:04:44.199> on<00:04:44.320> from<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.729> i'll<00:04:45.849> have<00:04:46.120> to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
be coming on from that so i'll have to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.439 
be coming on from that so i'll have to
check<00:04:46.449> out<00:04:46.660> throttle<00:04:47.139> body<00:04:47.349> and<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.940> may<00:04:49.389> be

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
check out throttle body and it may be

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.070 
check out throttle body and it may be
set<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.870> idle<00:04:50.169> just<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.409> bit<00:04:50.650> faster<00:04:51.900> if<00:04:52.900> the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
set the idle just a bit faster if the

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.719 
set the idle just a bit faster if the
throttle<00:04:53.409> body<00:04:53.440> is<00:04:53.770> not<00:04:54.039> already<00:04:54.460> been

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
throttle body is not already been

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.899 
throttle body is not already been
cleaned<00:04:55.889> but<00:04:56.889> it<00:04:57.009> could<00:04:57.099> be<00:04:57.220> something<00:04:57.430> stupid

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
cleaned but it could be something stupid

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:59.790 
cleaned but it could be something stupid
like<00:04:58.030> that<00:04:58.090> not<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.720> alternator<00:04:58.930> but<00:04:59.530> just

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
like that not the alternator but just

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.790 
like that not the alternator but just
slowly<00:05:00.550> scheidel<00:05:01.169> that's<00:05:02.169> why<00:05:02.320> i<00:05:02.380> said<00:05:02.440> to

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
slowly scheidel that's why i said to

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.249 
slowly scheidel that's why i said to
them<00:05:02.979> I<00:05:03.159> don't<00:05:03.729> want<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:04.539> know<00:05:04.690> just<00:05:05.020> say

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
them I don't want to you know just say

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.140 
them I don't want to you know just say
it's<00:05:05.409> the<00:05:05.530> alternator<00:05:05.740> yet<00:05:06.159> until<00:05:06.639> we<00:05:06.699> work<00:05:06.970> it

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
it's the alternator yet until we work it

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.570 
it's the alternator yet until we work it
right<00:05:07.180> now
