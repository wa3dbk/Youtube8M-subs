00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.110
 real shift in 2004 and the appearance of

 loading their weapons to go to the ground 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.020
 battle with this shooter at first 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.760
 person the xbox 360 will still have to 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.790
 wait months for this to arrive 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.070
 Title 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.320
 the game has little or no 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.510
 story to know it should follow 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.460
 the rum adventures and a team of 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.500
 mercenaries that seeks revenge on the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.810
 who destroyed their colony while 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.330
 you play this campaign mode some 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.130
 objects will be granted letters you will 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.170
 play the ones before a mission after 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.720
 look for the rule of the game some 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.300
 will hurt your opponents and others 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.489
 will provide reinforcements to your team 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.010
 the missions will be very varied and you can 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.900
 play all game modes from 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.330
 all against all to capture the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.430
 flag one against one or in throw no 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.520
 two captures the flag with the vehicle 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.320
 all against all in team destroy the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.570
 enemy nucleus or war mode or duel 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.250
 but what there is no doubt is a real 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.920
 tournament 3 is done 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.020
 exclusively to play online since 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.960
 playing against bots can be a 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.300
 little boring at the end of time to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.790
 it can perform a quick game or 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.890
 join an already created one you can even 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.840
 organize your own with the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.820
 parameters that you want as the number of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.670
 opponents or the objective score and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.770
 time limit and to go to war that 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.430
 better than customizing your character as 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.110
 the arms torso glasses mask helmet or 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.360
 boots among other elements 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.570
 there is even an option to mutate 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.850
 You can choose between 25 characters 13 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.820
 weapons some very similar to those that already 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.770
 we saw in a real turn in 2004 and 16 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.380
 vehicles between land and flying 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.660
 the vehicles have been divided in two 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.480
 parts the upson vehicles and the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.980
 black vehicles 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.380
 yes with weapons and armed vehicles 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.180
 even the teeth does not have enough in 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.400
 each of the maps will have split 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.070
 ammo armor like vests helmets 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.830
 and muslera 2 and above all health for 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.540
 recover, there are also the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.340
 enhancers to provide you 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.709
 special abilities for combat 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.140
 for example it may be invisible and 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.600
 vulnerable jump higher or have more 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.850
 infatuated breastplate you thought little to 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.100
 make things easier there 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.830
 the deployable devices that are a 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.930
 offensive or defensive team such as mines 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.010
 of electromagnetic pulse a generator 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.989
 of shield or a trap with spiders robots 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.120
 in this shooter the elements in 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.610
 screen like the chronometer weapons or 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.140
 armor are very well positioned 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.290
 to not lose yourself when you want 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.840
 consult some feature 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.730
 this version for playstation 3 does not have 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.040
 have no envy to the version 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.140
 of pc since apart from playing with the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.060
 command you can use a keyboard and a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.099
 mouse although it seems to go less 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.099
 fast moving than other games 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.700
 the greatest asset of this game is the editor 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.740
 of mods or maps that can share 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.240
 all platforms although you can not 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.240
 play online among them 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.470
 graphically, the scenarios are excellent 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.440
 they are tremendously burdened with 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.810
 structures and graphic effects this what 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.660
 demonstrates all the broad scenarios and 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.640
 the effects of snow or sun plus the 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.980
 characters and weapons are full of 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.110
 details and even more tired of 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.330
 framerate and is that the unreal engine 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.330
 Engine 3 to prove its power 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.760
 a real turnan / has a magnificent 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.349
 soundtrack and sound effects even 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.349
 the voices are dubbed into Castilian 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.370
 if you want a frenetic shooter a real 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.370
 tournament 3 awaits you in stores
