00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
they go in tubes like that very simple

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:08.250 
they go in tubes like that very simple
you<00:02:57.470> get<00:02:58.160> two<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.400> those<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:59.590> flat<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:01.069> buy<00:03:01.660> 1a<00:03:04.329> a

around I'll show you the cannon
extremely<00:04:11.850> simple<00:04:12.270> like<00:04:12.510> most<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.810> my<00:04:12.840> weapons

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
extremely simple like most of my weapons

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.550 
extremely simple like most of my weapons
because<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.430> don't<00:04:14.700> want<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.690> saw<00:04:16.260> bits

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
because I don't want to like saw bits

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.610 
because I don't want to like saw bits
off<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.980> mess<00:04:17.160> around<00:04:17.190> with<00:04:17.669> them<00:04:19.070> ok<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.340> get

rifle like that add a can on it and
another<00:04:28.050> camp<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.620> see-through<00:04:29.040> piece<00:04:29.250> or

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
another camp and a see-through piece or

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.990 
another camp and a see-through piece or
you<00:04:29.669> could<00:04:29.850> have<00:04:30.200> yellow<00:04:31.200> or<00:04:31.560> green<00:04:32.250> or<00:04:32.610> red<00:04:32.669> or

you could have yellow or green or red or

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.780 
you could have yellow or green or red or
anything<00:04:33.770> ok<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:35.100> makes<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.580> really

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
anything ok and that makes a really

anything ok and that makes a really
effective<00:04:36.060> cannon<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:38.190> little

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
effective cannon and you just a little

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.700 
effective cannon and you just a little
hole<00:04:39.300> in<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.479> wall<00:04:39.570> there<00:04:40.020> where<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.410> slides

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
hole in the wall there where it slides

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.360 
hole in the wall there where it slides
through<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:42.290> then<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.740> guy<00:04:43.890> just<00:04:43.919> sits<00:04:44.280> there

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
through and then the guy just sits there

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.710 
through and then the guy just sits there
and<00:04:44.669> arms<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:46.220> also<00:04:47.220> at<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.790> front<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.270> my<00:04:48.450> base

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
and arms it also at the front of my base

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.000 
and arms it also at the front of my base
I<00:04:49.080> have<00:04:49.710> built<00:04:50.070> em<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:52.430> gate<00:04:53.430> inside<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.390> wall

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
I have built em a gate inside the wall

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.870 
I have built em a gate inside the wall
which<00:04:56.010> is<00:04:56.400> why<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.180> comm<00:04:57.810> tower<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.500> there

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
which is why the comm tower is there

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.960 
which is why the comm tower is there
it's<00:04:59.880> a<00:05:00.030> bit<00:05:00.240> sticky<00:05:00.930> because<00:05:01.530> it's<00:05:01.970> like

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
it's a bit sticky because it's like

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.240 
it's a bit sticky because it's like
doesn't<00:05:03.810> work<00:05:04.169> as<00:05:04.380> well<00:05:04.410> as<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.680> hoped<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:05.100> would

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
doesn't work as well as I hoped it would

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.230 
doesn't work as well as I hoped it would
because<00:05:06.150> like<00:05:06.419> a<00:05:07.370> flat<00:05:08.370> broke<00:05:08.550> scraping<00:05:09.150> at

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
because like a flat broke scraping at

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.730 
because like a flat broke scraping at
the<00:05:09.390> flat<00:05:09.600> broke<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.260> very<00:05:10.440> hard<00:05:10.650> to

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
the flat broke and it's very hard to

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.130 
the flat broke and it's very hard to
open<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.370> close<00:05:11.570> so<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.630> don't<00:05:12.810> use<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.110> much

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
open and close so I don't use it much

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.510 
open and close so I don't use it much
but<00:05:13.650> it's<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.580> really<00:05:14.760> good<00:05:14.880> way<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.750> doing<00:05:16.050> it

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
but it's a really good way of doing it

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.629 
but it's a really good way of doing it
they've<00:05:17.520> having<00:05:17.910> a<00:05:18.000> decent

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
they've having a decent

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:27.489 
they've having a decent
in<00:05:20.439> addition<00:05:21.439> a<00:05:22.599> gate<00:05:24.069> so<00:05:25.069> and<00:05:26.379> i'll<00:05:27.379> have

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:27.499 
in addition a gate so and i'll have

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:31.420 
in addition a gate so and i'll have
another<00:05:27.919> video<00:05:28.159> by<00:05:28.939> next<00:05:29.240> time<00:05:29.449> and<00:05:30.430> that

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
another video by next time and that

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.059 
another video by next time and that
shows<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:32.029> interior<00:05:32.509> of<00:05:32.539> a<00:05:32.659> base<00:05:32.870> better<00:05:33.379> more

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
shows the interior of a base better more

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.980 
shows the interior of a base better more
description<00:05:34.610> so<00:05:35.210> just<00:05:35.479> build<00:05:35.749> stuff<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.949> and

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
description so just build stuff so and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.319 
description so just build stuff so and
