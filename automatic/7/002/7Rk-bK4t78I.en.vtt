 you will see that you will see them on these screens 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.470
 because they are really wonderful if 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.960
 girls you are interested to see what 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.200
 realizes clear below the channel 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.600
 buena vista as many of you already maybe 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.439
 I know I have the tattoo at 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 eyebrows 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.170
 but as you can see from here it is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.620
 there is a veil almost gone 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.080
 pigment remained this because it did not 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.120
 I said it more is something I have to 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.690
 do it again within the year but ok in the 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.820
 meanwhile I do it this way that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.640
 I'm going to show you I didn't apply 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.409
 nothing in the sense that I have the base but not 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.979
 powdered it because I eyebrows it 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.260
 and I always do them before I have 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.140
 buffered the base with powder and way 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.930
 that has the pigment the pencil or 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.580
 anyway the eyeshadow has something 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.900
 in sticky quotes on which 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.939
 fixate first thing takes a 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.659
 checker that I don't like this here is 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:59.799
 a of collistar and I go under a 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.479
 illuminate the arch after which I take 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.939
 the pencil you are using right now 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.640
 using the browser manga and I take it 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.119
 brush and comb the sheets all towards 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.739
 the top with a pencil always well 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.430
 pointy I practically escaped to 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.469
 outline 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.230
 in the part under the eyebrow why 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:23.400
 the part that I like best defined 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.400
 therefore with small light strokes 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.299
 start to define below and do the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.299
 codeine 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.030
 after doing this comb down 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 all the eyebrows I see where I have to 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.190
 going to fill this eye shadow as it is 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.620
 a duo I made are two eye shadows 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.620
 of mac this was lane these charcoal 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.110
 drown I practically use only the most 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.320
 clear charcoal brown you used is 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.210
 what suits you in accordance with 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.070
 your carnal hair color 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.820
 young as anything else there are many kits 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:15.780
 type I do not know catherine I believe to be 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:22.620
 sure these kits make these e 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:25.010
 I go very lightly to color mine 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.010
 eyebrows 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.730
 once this procedure is done 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.910
 I comb my eyebrows up 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.020
 hairs that there are at least go 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.480
 to cover the missing seats and to the 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.230
 use darker eye shadow end for 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.040
 give a little more simulation type intensity 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.040
 of the aforementioned 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.090
 b 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:37.270
 to fix the eyebrows I use 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:40.669
 a normal lacquer and a pipe cleaner 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.199
 takes advantage of a lacquer on the brush and then 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.320
 comb the eyebrows in place 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.550
 so this is my method on how 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.320
 I make ad and eyebrows 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.320
