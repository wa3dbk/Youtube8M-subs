problem I see is that players they try

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.869 
problem I see is that players they try
to<00:00:40.829> receive<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.399> ball<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.789> they're

to receive this ball and they're

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
to receive this ball and they're

thinking you know what I want to get the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
thinking you know what I want to get the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
ball back down in play in the court and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.610 
ball back down in play in the court and
so<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.370> angle<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.870> severe<00:00:49.289> going

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so that the the angle is so severe going

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.559 
so that the the angle is so severe going
down<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.030> makes<00:00:51.269> it<00:00:51.420> over

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
down that it that if it makes it over

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.619 
down that it that if it makes it over
the<00:00:51.719> net<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.460> frequently<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.670> does<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.179> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the net which frequently it does not is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.869 
the net which frequently it does not is
the<00:00:55.140> bounce<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.100> eats<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> pace

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the bounce just kind of eats up the pace

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.250 
the bounce just kind of eats up the pace
and<00:00:57.179> the<00:00:57.300> ball<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.690> sits<00:00:57.899> over<00:00:58.050> there

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
between the service line and the base

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.550

to<00:01:58.830> hit<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.130> ball<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.820> not<00:01:59.940> panicking<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
to hit the ball you're not panicking and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.850 
to hit the ball you're not panicking and
trying<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.900> ration<00:02:01.200> shot<00:02:01.410> well<00:02:01.650> there's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
trying to ration shot well there's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.050 
trying to ration shot well there's
there's<00:02:02.070> there's<00:02:02.370> a<00:02:02.490> good<00:02:02.640> tip<00:02:02.820> right<00:02:03.030> there

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
there's there's a good tip right there

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240 
there's there's a good tip right there
because<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:04.320> ball<00:02:04.530> gets<00:02:04.800> fluffed<00:02:05.100> up

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
because that ball gets fluffed up

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190 
because that ball gets fluffed up
especially<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.910> doubles<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.660> everyone<00:02:07.020> just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
especially in doubles and everyone just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.809 
especially in doubles and everyone just
starts<00:02:07.470> panicking<00:02:07.950> they<00:02:08.129> can't<00:02:08.369> breathe<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
starts panicking they can't breathe this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.089 
starts panicking they can't breathe this
they're<00:02:09.289> hyperventilating<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.409> they<00:02:10.830> rush

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
they're hyperventilating and they rush

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.100 
they're hyperventilating and they rush
to<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.370> way<00:02:11.760> way<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.390> front<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.959> you're

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to get way way out in front so you're

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.740 
to get way way out in front so you're
saying<00:02:13.440> relax<00:02:14.310> take<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.879> time<00:02:15.120> let<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.450> ball

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
saying relax take your time let the ball

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.360 
saying relax take your time let the ball
get<00:02:15.959> into<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.409> really<00:02:16.800> good<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:19.130> say<00:02:20.130> not

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
get into this really good you say not

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.760 
get into this really good you say not
balls<00:02:20.970> which<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.480> masses<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.050> paste<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.590> them

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
balls which have masses of paste on them

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.790 
balls which have masses of paste on them
but<00:02:23.550> there<00:02:23.819> are<00:02:24.020> outside

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
but there are outside

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.770 
but there are outside
you're<00:02:25.950> comfortable<00:02:26.670> strikezone<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
you're comfortable strikezone right and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
you're comfortable strikezone right and
and<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:28.770> also<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.160> recognize<00:02:29.850> well<00:02:30.060> there's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and but also you recognize well there's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.520 
and but also you recognize well there's
something<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.660> do<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.050> right<00:02:31.350> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
something I can do with this right and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.770 
something I can do with this right and
so<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.800> result<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.220> end<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.580> trying<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.090> rush

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
so as a result you end up trying to rush

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.330 
so as a result you end up trying to rush
the<00:02:33.930> shot<00:02:34.080> okay<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.680> really<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.100> need<00:02:35.220> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
the shot okay and really you need to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.540 
the shot okay and really you need to
create<00:02:35.670> time<00:02:36.320> for<00:02:37.320> yourself<00:02:37.410> your<00:02:38.220> opponent

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
create time for yourself your opponent

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.770 
create time for yourself your opponent
can't<00:02:38.700> hit<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> ball<00:02:39.060> until<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.420> fit<00:02:39.630> it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
can't hit the ball until you fit it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.990 
can't hit the ball until you fit it
that's<00:02:40.050> right<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.620> need<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.800> need<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:41.970> a

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that's right you need to need to have a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.390 
that's right you need to need to have a
little<00:02:42.270> bit<00:02:42.360> more<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.690> sort<00:02:43.230> of

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
little bit more of that sort of

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.790 
little bit more of that sort of
philosophy<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.730> think<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
philosophy on it I think and and and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.740 
philosophy on it I think and and and
practice<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.130> way<00:02:47.310> okay<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:48.660> about

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
practice it that way okay what about

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.230 
practice it that way okay what about
swing<00:02:49.470> path<00:02:50.010> where<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.940> swing

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
swing path where do you like that swing

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.610 
swing path where do you like that swing
path<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.720> go<00:02:51.840> primarily<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:54.930> we're<00:02:55.230> depending

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
path to go primarily if we're depending

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.410 
path to go primarily if we're depending
where<00:02:55.740> you're<00:02:55.830> hitting<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.130> ball<00:02:56.250> from<00:02:56.580> okay

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
where you're hitting the ball from okay

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.600 
where you're hitting the ball from okay
say<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.810> we're<00:02:57.960> playing<00:02:58.200> from<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:59.250> inside

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
say that we're playing from just inside

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.230 
say that we're playing from just inside
service<00:03:00.300> service<00:03:00.570> library<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.230> say<00:03:01.350> okay<00:03:02.240> my

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
service service library and say okay my

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.940 
service service library and say okay my
racket<00:03:03.660> head<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.320> think<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.590> terms<00:03:04.620> of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
racket head I like to think in terms of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.310 
racket head I like to think in terms of
trying<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.340> draw<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> line<00:03:06.140> through<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
trying to draw a line through the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.050 
trying to draw a line through the
hitting<00:03:07.500> zone<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.550> point<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:08.970> I'm

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
hitting zone to the point that I'm

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.690 
hitting zone to the point that I'm
trying<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.360> hit<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> ball<00:03:09.750> okay<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.950> instead

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
trying to hit the ball okay so instead

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.970 
trying to hit the ball okay so instead
of<00:03:11.910> coming<00:03:12.180> coming<00:03:13.080> down<00:03:13.260> off<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.560> shot<00:03:13.770> too

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
of coming coming down off the shot too

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.950 
of coming coming down off the shot too
much<00:03:14.220> right<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:14.790> almost<00:03:15.120> working<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.720> stroke

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
much right I'm almost working a stroke

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.740 
much right I'm almost working a stroke
which<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.770> almost<00:03:16.920> parallel<00:03:17.580> to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
which is it can be almost parallel to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.060 
which is it can be almost parallel to
the<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.470> course<00:03:19.680> okay<00:03:20.130> okay<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.440> think

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
the to the course okay okay and I think

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.680 
the to the course okay okay and I think
that<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.310> helps<00:03:23.490> in<00:03:23.850> many<00:03:23.970> respects<00:03:24.390> because

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
that that helps in many respects because

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.640 
that that helps in many respects because
if<00:03:24.810> you're<00:03:24.930> allowing<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.230> ball<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.380> come<00:03:25.530> in

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
if you're allowing the ball to come in

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.040 
if you're allowing the ball to come in
off<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.980> side<00:03:26.160> more<00:03:26.400> right<00:03:26.930> then<00:03:27.930> from

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
off to the side more right then from

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.990 
off to the side more right then from
that<00:03:28.200> point<00:03:28.470> you're<00:03:28.650> able<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.040> hold<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> ball

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
that point you're able to hold the ball

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.370 
that point you're able to hold the ball
on<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.209> strings<00:03:30.510> for<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.840> slightly<00:03:31.110> longer

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
on the strings for a slightly longer

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.750 
on the strings for a slightly longer
ayleid<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.830> time<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.280> only<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.550> little

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
ayleid of time if you only have a little

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.000 
ayleid of time if you only have a little
more<00:03:32.880> control<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.470> also<00:03:34.650> think<00:03:34.950> that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
more control on it and I also think that

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.470 
more control on it and I also think that
it<00:03:35.190> helps<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.020> sensation<00:03:37.350> of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
it helps to to have that sensation of

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.000 
it helps to to have that sensation of
trying<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.540> give<00:03:39.660> yourself<00:03:39.989> some<00:03:40.230> space<00:03:40.680> an

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
trying to give yourself some space an

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.979 
trying to give yourself some space an
hour<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.970> you're<00:03:42.060> not<00:03:42.180> too<00:03:42.360> tight<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.840> net

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
hour so you're not too tight to the net

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.190 
hour so you're not too tight to the net
with<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.320> right<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.520> I<00:03:45.300> think<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.570> primarily

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
with it right and I think the primarily

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.660 
with it right and I think the primarily
this<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.650> type<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.860> ball<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.459> most

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
this is the type of ball that most

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.250 
this is the type of ball that most
people<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> difficulty<00:03:48.570> with<00:03:48.690> us<00:03:48.810> it's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
people have the difficulty with us it's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.900 
people have the difficulty with us it's
more<00:03:49.320> in<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.800> zone<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.340> their<00:03:50.520> turn<00:03:50.670> their

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
more in this zone in their turn their

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.130 
more in this zone in their turn their
right<00:03:51.120> if<00:03:51.239> you're<00:03:51.360> getting<00:03:51.570> in<00:03:51.690> really<00:03:51.840> tight

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
right if you're getting in really tight

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.020 
right if you're getting in really tight
to<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.470> net<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.950> playing<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.670> ball<00:03:53.850> then

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
to the net and playing this ball then

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.340 
to the net and playing this ball then
you<00:03:54.150> might<00:03:54.330> get<00:03:54.510> away<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.930> get<00:03:55.020> away<00:03:55.080> with

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
you might get away you can get away with

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.699 
you might get away you can get away with
your<00:03:55.440> angles<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.100> maybe<00:03:57.410> pushing<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.590> ball

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
your angles and maybe pushing the ball

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.199 
your angles and maybe pushing the ball
off<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.100> side<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.580> no<00:03:59.730> such<00:03:59.940> things<00:04:00.120> but

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
off to the side and no such things but

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.210 
off to the side and no such things but
from<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:00.540> area<00:04:00.959> well<00:04:01.709> maybe<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
from this area well maybe the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.949 
from this area well maybe the
misconception<00:04:02.970> here<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
misconception here is that for the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.410 
misconception here is that for the
misperception<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.520> you've<00:04:05.940> got<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.239> put

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
misperception is that you've got to put

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.960 
misperception is that you've got to put
away<00:04:06.600> opportunity<00:04:07.290> from<00:04:07.530> back<00:04:07.770> in<00:04:08.010> here<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:08.940> I

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
away opportunity from back in here but I

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.699 
away opportunity from back in here but I
mean<00:04:09.209> as<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.750> stand<00:04:10.050> here<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.410> mean<00:04:10.590> I

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
mean as you and I stand here I mean I

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.620 
mean as you and I stand here I mean I
can<00:04:10.890> really<00:04:11.070> sort<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.370> see<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:12.330> know<00:04:12.420> maybe

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
can really sort of see you know maybe

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.199 
can really sort of see you know maybe
six<00:04:13.290> inches<00:04:13.680> above<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.280> top<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.760> net<00:04:15.000> is

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
six inches above the top of the net is

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.380 
six inches above the top of the net is
is<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.500> baseline<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.669> we<00:04:17.850> don't<00:04:18.120> really

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
is is the baseline so we don't really

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.720 
is is the baseline so we don't really
have<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> lot<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.200> space<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.709> work<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.190> you

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
have a lot of space to work in and you

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.159 
have a lot of space to work in and you
know<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.000> always<00:04:21.150> try<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.390> feel<00:04:21.600> on<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.959> high

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
know I always try to feel on this high
