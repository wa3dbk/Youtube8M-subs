using something small like this all I

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.119 
using something small like this all I
wanted<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.820> heat<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.570> cup<00:00:52.440> maybe<00:00:53.010> a

little<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.790> water<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> didn't<00:00:55.500> need

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
little more of water so I didn't need

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410 
little more of water so I didn't need
anything<00:00:55.920> big<00:00:56.370> plus<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.879> would<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.149> fit<00:00:57.329> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
anything big plus it would just fit in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.610 
anything big plus it would just fit in
there<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.690> still<00:00:57.899> give<00:00:58.050> me<00:00:58.200> room<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:59.520> use

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
there and still give me room to use

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.440 
there and still give me room to use
other<00:01:01.620> things<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.219> espot<00:01:02.700> or<00:01:02.820> whatever<00:01:03.120> and

other things like espot or whatever and

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
other things like espot or whatever and
that<00:01:03.510> helps<00:01:04.350> having<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.769> wire<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that helps having the wire if I use the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390 
that helps having the wire if I use the
can<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> pot

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
flames come out and up the sides and

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.310 
flames come out and up the sides and
most<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> bottom<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.180> covered<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.720> with

the bottom of the cup so I didn't want
something<00:01:24.510> that<00:01:24.780> big<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:26.119> mean<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> could<00:01:27.299> use

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
again it's almost the same size as this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.550 
again it's almost the same size as this
small<00:01:33.360> cup<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:35.490> could<00:01:36.330> use<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:39.560> carbon

double wall be careful with that all

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.890 
double wall be careful with that all
right<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:16.950> we'll<00:03:17.340> try<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:17.690> vertical<00:03:18.690> wick

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
right so we'll try this vertical wick

right so we'll try this vertical wick
stove<00:03:20.209> going<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.299> go<00:03:21.419> again<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.079> one

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
stove going to go again with the one

can get it all into the burner without
slopping<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> everywhere<00:03:35.959> now<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.290> don't<00:03:38.160> know

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
slopping it everywhere now I don't know

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.110 
slopping it everywhere now I don't know
how<00:03:40.650> fast<00:03:40.980> our<00:03:41.250> long<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.579> will<00:03:41.699> burn<00:03:41.910> will

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
how fast our long this will burn will

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.539 
how fast our long this will burn will
have<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.329> try<00:03:42.569> this<00:03:42.629> here<00:03:43.049> but<00:03:43.919> there's<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.280> lot

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
have to try this here but there's a lot

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.479 
have to try this here but there's a lot
more<00:03:44.579> space<00:03:45.540> there<00:03:45.900> if<00:03:46.829> you<00:03:47.010> wanted<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.340> put

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
more space there if you wanted to put

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.580 
more space there if you wanted to put
more<00:03:47.699> alcohol<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.449> I'm<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.290> putting<00:03:49.470> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
more alcohol in I'm just putting the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.289 
more alcohol in I'm just putting the
same<00:03:49.829> amount<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.220> alcohol<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.819> had<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.209> the

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
same amount of alcohol I had on the

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.530 
same amount of alcohol I had on the
first<00:03:51.569> test<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.609> have<00:03:53.609> one<00:03:53.849> cup<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.209> water

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.530 

setting<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.660> 60<00:03:58.109> degrees

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.350 

let's<00:04:04.540> light<00:04:04.900> this<00:04:09.270> there<00:04:10.270> you<00:04:10.390> can<00:04:10.420> see<00:04:10.570> it

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
let's light this there you can see it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.220 
let's light this there you can see it
put<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.480> cup<00:04:13.720> on<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:15.900> let's<00:04:16.900> see<00:04:17.050> where<00:04:17.170> this

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
put the cup on and let's see where this

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:34.100 
put the cup on and let's see where this
goes

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.640 

then<00:04:35.110> we<00:04:35.260> have<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.410> 10<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:37.240> 11<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.970> 12<00:04:40.500> we<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.620> a

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
then we have to 10 to 11 to 12 we have a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.380 
then we have to 10 to 11 to 12 we have a
rolling<00:04:41.980> boil<00:04:43.560> that<00:04:44.560> look<00:04:45.490> like<00:04:45.640> four<00:04:46.060> minutes

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
rolling boil that look like four minutes

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.660 
rolling boil that look like four minutes
and<00:04:46.830> let's<00:04:47.830> say<00:04:48.040> 15<00:04:48.700> seconds<00:04:50.430> let's<00:04:51.430> see<00:04:51.550> how

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
and let's say 15 seconds let's see how

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:58.320 
and let's say 15 seconds let's see how
long<00:04:51.850> this<00:04:52.000> will<00:04:52.150> burn<00:04:56.520> okay<00:04:57.520> let's<00:04:57.790> say<00:04:57.970> five

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
long this will burn okay let's say five

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.840 
long this will burn okay let's say five
minutes<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.050> 10<00:04:59.320> seconds<00:04:59.860> for<00:05:00.100> run<00:05:00.280> out<00:05:00.430> five

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
minutes and 10 seconds for run out five

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:12.360 
minutes and 10 seconds for run out five
minutes<00:05:01.060> ten<00:05:01.510> seconds<00:05:07.890> well<00:05:08.890> obviously<00:05:11.370> this

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
minutes ten seconds well obviously this

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.510 
minutes ten seconds well obviously this
is<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.120> better<00:05:13.480> burner<00:05:15.660> than<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:17.140> one<00:05:17.490> with<00:05:18.490> the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
is a better burner than the one with the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.260 
is a better burner than the one with the
fiberglass<00:05:19.800> gaskets<00:05:20.800> stuff<00:05:20.920> stuffed<00:05:21.430> in<00:05:21.580> it

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.200 

basically<00:05:25.270> this<00:05:25.570> is<00:05:25.750> just<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.940> that's<00:05:27.940> still

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
basically this is just a that's still

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.860 
basically this is just a that's still
burning<00:05:31.470> that's<00:05:32.470> why<00:05:32.620> we're<00:05:32.890> closed

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
burning that's why we're closed

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.470 
burning that's why we're closed
basically<00:05:34.870> it's<00:05:35.020> just<00:05:35.140> a<00:05:35.470> tealight<00:05:36.250> 10<00:05:36.640> you

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
basically it's just a tealight 10 you

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.660 
basically it's just a tealight 10 you
took<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.720> wax<00:05:38.050> out<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.940> piece<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:42.070> muffler

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
took the wax out a piece of the muffler

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.890 
took the wax out a piece of the muffler
exhaust<00:05:45.510> wrap<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:48.850> is<00:05:49.030> just<00:05:49.300> fiberglass

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.600 
thing just a piece of that curled up
inside<00:05:55.990> here<00:05:56.440> so<00:05:56.620> that<00:05:56.770> it's<00:05:56.890> pushing<00:05:57.100> against

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
inside here so that it's pushing against

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.640 
inside here so that it's pushing against
the<00:05:57.730> outer<00:05:57.910> wall<00:05:58.300> or<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.960> inner<00:05:59.110> wall<00:05:59.410> of<00:05:59.440> the

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
the outer wall or the inner wall of the

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.730 
the outer wall or the inner wall of the
tin<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:01.060> that's<00:06:01.810> all<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:01.990> is<00:06:02.170> i<00:06:02.380> mean<00:06:02.530> i<00:06:02.590> don't

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
tin and that's all it is i mean i don't

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.720

think<00:06:02.890> you<00:06:02.980> get<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.190> get<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.550> simpler<00:06:04.120> burner<00:06:05.730> and

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
think you get a get a simpler burner and

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.520 
think you get a get a simpler burner and
I'm<00:06:06.850> rather<00:06:07.060> surprised<00:06:07.600> that<00:06:07.900> that<00:06:07.930> did<00:06:08.290> much

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
I'm rather surprised that that did much

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.080 
I'm rather surprised that that did much
better<00:06:08.560> than<00:06:09.010> the<00:06:09.160> other<00:06:09.280> one<00:06:10.770> so<00:06:11.880> in<00:06:12.880> this

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
better than the other one so in this

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.050 
better than the other one so in this
test<00:06:13.590> one<00:06:14.590> cup<00:06:14.800> of<00:06:14.890> water<00:06:15.130> starting<00:06:15.580> at<00:06:15.670> 60

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
test one cup of water starting at 60

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.350 
test one cup of water starting at 60
degrees<00:06:16.090> room<00:06:16.930> temperature<00:06:17.470> 60<00:06:17.920> degrees<00:06:18.360> for

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
degrees room temperature 60 degrees for

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.650 
degrees room temperature 60 degrees for
fifty<00:06:19.750> four<00:06:19.930> percent<00:06:19.960> humidity<00:06:21.300> brought<00:06:22.300> one

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
fifty four percent humidity brought one

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.870 
fifty four percent humidity brought one
cup<00:06:22.870> of<00:06:23.020> water<00:06:23.260> to<00:06:23.530> boil<00:06:23.830> in<00:06:24.130> four<00:06:24.430> minutes<00:06:24.640> and

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
cup of water to boil in four minutes and

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.140 
cup of water to boil in four minutes and
15<00:06:25.240> seconds<00:06:25.750> and<00:06:25.990> then<00:06:26.080> ran<00:06:26.350> out<00:06:26.590> in<00:06:27.150> five

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
15 seconds and then ran out in five

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.960 
15 seconds and then ran out in five
minutes<00:06:28.450> and<00:06:28.720> 10<00:06:28.900> seconds<00:06:29.400> using<00:06:30.400> one

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
minutes and 10 seconds using one

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.300 
minutes and 10 seconds using one
tablespoon<00:06:32.550> just<00:06:33.550> one<00:06:33.760> tablespoon<00:06:34.450> of

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
tablespoon just one tablespoon of

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.670 
tablespoon just one tablespoon of
denatured<00:06:36.310> alcohol

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.260 

so<00:06:39.680> I<00:06:39.710> think<00:06:39.980> this<00:06:40.340> might<00:06:40.400> just<00:06:40.610> be<00:06:40.880> a<00:06:41.000> pretty

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
so I think this might just be a pretty

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.530 
so I think this might just be a pretty
good<00:06:41.360> little<00:06:41.630> kit<00:06:41.960> to<00:06:42.710> use<00:06:42.950> in<00:06:43.220> mine<00:06:43.430> in<00:06:44.270> my

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
good little kit to use in mine in my

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.130 
good little kit to use in mine in my
