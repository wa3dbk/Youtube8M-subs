00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
this McLeod home it comes to where if

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.560 
this McLeod home it comes to where if
you<00:04:23.790> separated<00:04:24.790> gently<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.270> can<00:04:25.420> actually

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
you separated gently you can actually

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.700 
you separated gently you can actually
get<00:04:26.050> individual<00:04:28.050> clumps<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.260> just<00:04:29.440> pull<00:04:29.680> one

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
get individual clumps so I just pull one

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.790 
get individual clumps so I just pull one
clump<00:04:30.130> off<00:04:31.110> definitely<00:04:32.110> hard<00:04:32.290> for<00:04:32.440> me<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.650> work

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
clump off definitely hard for me to work

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.520 
clump off definitely hard for me to work
with<00:04:32.980> because<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.370> work<00:04:33.960> work<00:04:34.960> with<00:04:35.140> my<00:04:35.290> hands

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
and I got a lot of calluses so I better

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.670 
and I got a lot of calluses so I better
clean<00:04:39.550> them<00:04:39.670> up<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:39.970> pumice<00:04:40.420> stone<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:41.560> all

long<00:04:48.810> I'm<00:04:49.810> going<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.080> use<00:04:50.200> two<00:04:50.440> 1<00:04:50.650> inch<00:04:50.860> pieces

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.790 

and<00:04:55.840> when<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:56.260> tie<00:04:56.590> them<00:04:56.740> in<00:04:56.919> I<00:04:57.070> compress<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.820> I

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
and when I tie them in I compress it I

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.730 
and when I tie them in I compress it I
pinch<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.919> real<00:05:00.160> tight<00:05:00.430> because<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:02.470> want<00:05:02.650> to

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
pinch it real tight because I want to

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.409 
pinch it real tight because I want to
try<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:02.919> get<00:05:03.100> that<00:05:03.250> material<00:05:03.430> as<00:05:03.880> close<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.330> the

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
try to get that material as close to the

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.210 
try to get that material as close to the
hook<00:05:04.570> as<00:05:04.750> possible<00:05:05.400> one<00:05:06.630> wrap<00:05:08.040> second<00:05:09.040> wrap

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
hook as possible one wrap second wrap

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.530 
hook as possible one wrap second wrap
and<00:05:09.460> then<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.640> just<00:05:09.820> spent<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:10.180> right<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.450> the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
and then I just spent it right to the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.370 
and then I just spent it right to the
bottom<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.080> then<00:05:11.260> I<00:05:11.350> pull<00:05:11.620> down<00:05:11.830> that<00:05:13.380> second

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
bottom and then I pull down that second

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.080 
bottom and then I pull down that second
one<00:05:14.470> just<00:05:15.250> pinch<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:15.730> real<00:05:15.970> tight<00:05:17.850> pull<00:05:18.850> down

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
one just pinch it real tight pull down

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.270 
one just pinch it real tight pull down
on<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:20.490> snake<00:05:21.490> it<00:05:21.669> through<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:23.620> second<00:05:24.070> turn

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
on it snake it through that second turn

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.510 
on it snake it through that second turn
you<00:05:24.460> bring<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.760> in<00:05:24.910> front<00:05:25.270> of<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:26.040> of<00:05:27.040> the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
you bring it in front of the of the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.370 
you bring it in front of the of the
bottom<00:05:28.680> clump<00:05:33.000> really<00:05:34.000> need<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:34.360> get<00:05:34.990> too<00:05:35.229> many

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
bottom clump really need to get too many

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.380 
bottom clump really need to get too many
wraps<00:05:35.680> going<00:05:36.130> there<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:39.430> then<00:05:39.610> half<00:05:39.910> hitch<00:05:40.180> it

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
wraps going there and then half hitch it

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.909 
wraps going there and then half hitch it
or<00:05:40.600> whip<00:05:40.780> finish<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.260> whatever<00:05:41.440> you<00:05:41.650> want<00:05:41.770> to

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
or whip finish it whatever you want to

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.940 
or whip finish it whatever you want to
do<00:05:42.720> and<00:05:43.720> then<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.960> guess<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.320> important<00:05:44.770> thing

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
do and then I guess the important thing

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.500 
do and then I guess the important thing
is<00:05:45.130> is<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:45.760> want<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.030> make<00:05:46.150> sure<00:05:46.330> that

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
is is that you want to make sure that

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.000 
is is that you want to make sure that
you<00:05:46.630> separate<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.229> two<00:05:47.380> piles<00:05:47.680> but

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
you separate the two piles but

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.110 
you separate the two piles but
everything<00:05:48.400> that<00:05:48.520> was<00:05:48.610> tight<00:05:48.790> in<00:05:48.910> on<00:05:49.030> the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
everything that was tight in on the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.490 
everything that was tight in on the
bottom<00:05:49.450> stays<00:05:49.690> on<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.020> bottom<00:05:52.260> slightly<00:05:53.260> pull

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
bottom stays on the bottom slightly pull

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.800 
bottom stays on the bottom slightly pull
down<00:05:53.710> on<00:05:53.919> it<00:05:54.210> give<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.390> cut

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
down on it give it a cut

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:04.460 
down on it give it a cut
pull<00:05:57.810> up<00:05:57.930> on<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.170> tap<00:06:00.650> give<00:06:01.650> it<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:01.830> cut<00:06:03.470> that's

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
pull up on the tap give it a cut that's

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.710 
pull up on the tap give it a cut that's
it
