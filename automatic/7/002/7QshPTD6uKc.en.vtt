00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.990
 It was here, people are saying, what are you talking about? 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 - welcome everyone to another video 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.360
 and do not wonder if you already 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.840
 gave this video on canal around 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.360
 23 hours one o'clock in the morning is the galley 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.579
 youtube ended up preaching a piece and 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.290
 I decided to take the video off the air for two 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.989
 reasons first because you released the video 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.450
 at the wrong time and the second reason is 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.940
 because I recorded this video let's not say 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.240
 half johnson over there baghdad 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.680
 The content of the video is cool what I 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.780
 I wanted to bring it to you, it's cool, but the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 comment was not very cool by 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.020
 The less I believe 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.610
 despite the video at the moment I 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.560
 deletei I think I deleted the video at 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.150
 that 56 o'clock in the morning I woke up 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.910
 dawn and went there to take a look at 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.250
 watching the video was almost 800 for 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.380
 900 likes then thank you very much to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.030
 All those guys that left their like 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.920
 please, who made the point 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.189
 video do not forget daniel too 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.990
 help in the evaluation and dissemination of 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.509
 this video especially the channel 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.670
 so let's stop explanations of 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.619
 Let's start talking about the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.329
 really matter that I wanted to be 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.789
 with you will address in this video 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.319
 first point is that I was 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.659
 playing in paris with some friends 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.819
 subscribers who accompany me guys I 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.139
 has added on psn and even the galera 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.819
 while not recently for us 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:31.499
 play open soon 45 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.990
 We ended up playing this game here. 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.329
 from black ops we set up a part 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.709
 managed to get the host and this made the whole 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.299
 difference we managed to play 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.549
 Way too quiet connection was in the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.530
 maximum for everyone and entered other 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.689
 Brazilians also in the room played against 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.609
 we were not very cool 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.100
 the point that I really would like to 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.529
 highlight in this gameplay here with you is 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.659
 about the black book galera o black 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.609
 black ops is very good and I'm not going to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.179
 controversial issue because the 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:02.520
 galley playing know of the power of the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.439
 strike blackbird is very strong and it is 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.509
 one of the strongest districts of black 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.030
 Oops, he does not kill you. 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.979
 you do not have the advantage of using it 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.170
 in their favor to kill the enemies in the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.900
 case denied the attack docs you call the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.420
 games go there and crau behind the guys 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.120
 end up dying and killing everyone 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.040
 not the black bird shows everyone me 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.890
 kills in real time 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.020
 This is his great advantage and the great 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.760
 advantage of the black bird is that besides 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.860
 show everyone in real time in the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.810
 for you also shows that the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.690
 his face teammates this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.420
 makes all the difference in this match here 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.090
 How were we playing in Paris? 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.190
 This eventually changed the course 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.900
 this game because some friends 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.760
 were with blackburn I was also 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.830
 with black and look at the big 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.800
 disadvantage that opponents have 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.110
 are clearly highlighted in the mini 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.940
 map showing the point that they 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.980
 They are to where they are facing 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.900
 where are they going then a tremendous 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.030
 disadvantage and if you take a team that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.280
 is in pariquera in our case here 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.319
 ends up complicating even more for the team 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.720
 opponent making it much easier for those who are 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.910
 playing in the team since if some 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.580
 teammates are 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.340
 using blackbird just the first 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.410
 call that consequently the others 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.540
 You 'll be able to call the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.430
 blackburn too and then you can have 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.130
 practically always a strike in the air 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.560
 I won here can identify 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.070
 everybody and show name bush in time 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.930
 real 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.640
 this becomes very difficult for the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.500
 team and even so I 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.209
 I consider blackbird one of the districts 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.579
 black ops 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.489
 and for those who do not know he'll be in the 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.950
 black ops 2 but also with another name o 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.019
 name of this district will be called 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.489
 orbital vsat only before talking about 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.650
 hospital site would like to speak with 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.510
 you referring to the advance and saw that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.670
 has in module for 3 that is a kind of 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.920
 black book just that much more black fact 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 it does not have to say let's install 50 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.350
 percent of the power they need to 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.660
 able to visualize the opponents since the 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.579
 black board active the moment you 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.230
 active it appears automatically 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.910
 appears in real time all 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.910
 opponents at least position everything 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.870
 and iiv in module 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.299
 was 3 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.700
 it does not appear in real time it goes 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.630
 giving yesterday's ID does not kill me 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.400
 and with that the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.530
 positioning of opponents 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.580
 and you can also fool the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.860
 opponent lives 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.020
 depending on the combination of why you 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.260
 already using black ops 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.050
 you can not have no way to get immune 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.870
 is the one that strike and the range of options 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.340
 You will have the orbital vsat I do not 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.870
 I still know how it will work but 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.240
 I know it will work as a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.890
 species of blackbird or of advance and vi 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.570
 I do not know if it will work in time 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.580
 real will show all the opponents in 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.190
 real time on the mini map I hope 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.460
 I do not want it to be a 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.100
 kind of advanced had we say until 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.720
 you were using a 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.200
 port for example are Augustine who 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.230
 shane or murder because I left 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.080
 world where you live in the black ops two 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.080
 I hope not because the leaves immune to 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.270
 orbisat, but he is much more 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.950
 fado that black bird then going 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.630
 giving what is going on 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.670
 identification of the mini map you are going 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.350
 appearing to appear your position but 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.760
 which does not show in real time 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.790
 I think it would look really cool to stay 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.700
 It would be fair if it would continue to be a 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.260
 High power strike score of a high power 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.960
 You can hardly do more though 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.690
 with a very great precision perhaps he 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.160
 can stay for 30 40 50 seconds I do not 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.930
 I'm sure but I think 50 thousand 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.490
 fine guys let's slow down 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.830
 30 and 31 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.020
 I think it would be much fairer and 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.540
 I think I 'd end up leaving the game. 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.170
 more balanced and I do not know that you 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.630
 find 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.750
 Leave a comment to see what you 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.490
 really think they're expecting what's going to be the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.590
 orbital and website I hope it is a 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.750
 cyst in a trick escort has now changed in 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.700
 Extreme school make you usually talk 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.620
 Teip schools, well, people are half 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.750
 tense but gradually I'll try 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.820
 able to speak wheat scores 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.470
 leave a comment you think 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.440
 actually it should work the same 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:12.260
 black ops blackbird type one 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.180
 kind of engine craving for three 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.550
 but that he could not leave where he did not 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.630
 Could not even the harbor leave and give you 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.370
 do not kill me 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.220
 I let it see what you guys really 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.350
 Find it and people please 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.210
 leave the file x if you already 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.430
 let your like in that first video 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.470
 that you eventually removed, also let 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.670
 help makes all the difference so much 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.500
 in video evaluation 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.690
 especially the growth of the canal 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.760
 this is giving motivation to us 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.530
 always keep bringing new and new 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.970
 videos for you 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.950
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.990
 video I'm talking again 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.030
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.300
 Thank you so much, I'm very happy there. 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.800
 with the path the channel is taking and 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.870
 I'm going to stop here because I'm already 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.610
 too thanks and thank you 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.230
 Thank you. Thank you. See you at 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.230
 Next video
