00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.860
 hello today the bixby lady of 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.610
 robert robert who is a luthier 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.350
 french so the bixby lady we can see 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.279
 what a mythical guitar 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.759
 it is inspired but we can see that the 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.170
 treatment was completely 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.150
 personalized so good we already have the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.000
 binding on the handle that is very beautiful 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.610
 I really like sun species 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.250
 birth like that a little shot on the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.100
 orange and we will find at once 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.309
 on the body and on the handle it's very 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.230
 well done and it gives a little accents 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.440
 great dog on this guitar just like 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.730
 strap ties also and 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.030
 then this big bih which is absolutely 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.750
 fabulous we notice that there is the table 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.600
 was dug to receive it 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.700
 it's really very pretty it's very 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.420
 bagnols I really like this 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.140
 treatment 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.189
 and then we also notice that the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.170
 simple acute is enshrined in the big 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.060
 well says so are the pickups are some 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.180
 quines manas is a brand this is a 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.329
 very good brand of micro and so we have 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.040
 just a volume and a selector 3 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.810
 positions I think it's great 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.579
 nice when it's simple so there we 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.189
 can not do better 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:38.450
 you notice the pickguard a bit 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.570
 op a good is that a fifties side 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.939
 sixties very very nice so here we go 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.909
 listen to her she sounds really very very 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.609
 well we also note 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.829
 a good complement to bisbilles these are 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.369
 these mechanics that must be 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:57.429
 grover I think about blocking and who 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.890
 allow to use the good bixby 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.780
 obviously it's not a river so we 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.909
 will not do the chitterlings with but we 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.140
 can use it without the guitar getting 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.939
 disagree and it's really very good 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.379
 we will listen to the pickups one after 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.379
 the other already serious microphone 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.140
 but 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140
 2 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.330
 and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 so we note that there is a lot of 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.010
 attack so that's a p-type microphone 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.450
 90 there is a lot of attack a lot of 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.880
 depth a lot of heat a lot 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.069
 roundness is really nice 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.069
 so there the two pickups together 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.680
 and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.710
 then there on this position 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.370
 intermediate we notice micro acute 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.320
 add shine it's very 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.620
 nice too and stone the microphone sharp 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.270
 all alone so he has he has a good 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.610
 potato but what's interesting is 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.610
 that he is not only aggressive 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.460
 no no 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.460
 e 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.770
 he 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.970
 wen tremolos we make another 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.970
 idea 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.710
 m 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.710
 or 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.750
 but 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.750
 but 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.400
 Yes 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 and 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.020
 and 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.430
 but 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.570
 on that I greet you well
