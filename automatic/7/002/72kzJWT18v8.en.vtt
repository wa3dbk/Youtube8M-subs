I'm really delighted with the dances I
mean<00:00:01.770> I've<00:00:01.860> got<00:00:01.979> seven<00:00:02.639> new<00:00:02.730> dancers<00:00:03.060> in<00:00:03.149> the

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
mean I've got seven new dancers in the

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.840

that kind of acclimatization to the way
of<00:00:07.890> working<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.550> such<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> challenge<00:00:09.679> but<00:00:10.679> what

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
of working is such a challenge but what

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.230 
of working is such a challenge but what
we're<00:00:11.130> working<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.550> we're<00:00:11.670> really<00:00:11.820> working<00:00:12.030> in

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
we're working on we're really working in

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.230 
we're working on we're really working in
a<00:00:12.300> very<00:00:12.450> methodical<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.080> detailed<00:00:13.440> way<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
a very methodical and detailed way and

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.000 
a very methodical and detailed way and
I'm<00:00:15.240> finding<00:00:15.870> some<00:00:15.960> interesting<00:00:16.139> solutions

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
I'm finding some interesting solutions

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.400 
I'm finding some interesting solutions
to<00:00:17.190> problems<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.390> now<00:00:18.660> I've<00:00:18.750> got<00:00:18.930> I've

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to problems and I know now I've got I've

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.950 
to problems and I know now I've got I've
got<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> lot<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.210> decisions<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.420> make<00:00:21.630> over<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
got a lot of decisions to make over the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
got a lot of decisions to make over the
next<00:00:22.140> six<00:00:22.439> weeks<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.980> how<00:00:23.130> things<00:00:23.400> are

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
next six weeks about how things are

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400 
next six weeks about how things are
structured<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.060> where<00:00:24.180> things<00:00:24.449> go<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.350> do

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
structured and where things go but I do

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.170 
structured and where things go but I do
feel<00:00:25.650> I've<00:00:25.800> got<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> content<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.060> be

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
feel I've got a lot of content to be

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.519 
feel I've got a lot of content to be
working<00:00:27.539> with<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.840> that's<00:00:27.990> quite<00:00:28.199> exciting

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
working with so that's quite exciting

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
working with so that's quite exciting
thinking<00:00:29.519> about<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.179> specific<00:00:30.720> themes<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
thinking about the specific themes of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.330 
thinking about the specific themes of
entity<00:00:31.470> we've<00:00:31.650> been<00:00:31.800> thinking<00:00:32.040> about<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
entity we've been thinking about that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.069 
entity we've been thinking about that
for<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.940> half<00:00:33.000> years<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.630> it's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
for about two and a half years and it's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.690 
for about two and a half years and it's
come<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.160> work<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.370> we've

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
come out of some of the work that we've

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.100 
come out of some of the work that we've
been<00:00:35.730> doing<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> cognitive<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.960> neuro

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
been doing with the cognitive and neuro

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
been doing with the cognitive and neuro
scientists<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
scientists about what is the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.639 
scientists about what is the
relationship<00:00:39.750> between<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.230> brain<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
relationship between the brain and the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.180 
relationship between the brain and the
body<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.250> does<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.550> work<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.210> it's

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
body and how does that work and it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
body and how does that work and it's
just<00:00:44.190> keeping<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.760> fascination<00:00:45.270> with

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
just keeping that fascination with

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.690 
just keeping that fascination with
science<00:00:46.590> embedded<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> way<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.579> which

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
science embedded into the way in which

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.790 
science embedded into the way in which
we<00:00:47.850> work<00:00:48.030> choreographically<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.050> once<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
we work choreographically I once got a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.900 
we work choreographically I once got a
piece<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.070> advice<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:50.730> famous

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
piece of advice from a very famous

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.130 
piece of advice from a very famous
choreographer<00:00:51.239> who<00:00:51.570> said<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> should<00:00:51.989> work

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
choreographer who said you should work

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
choreographer who said you should work
with<00:00:52.289> music<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.399> I've<00:00:53.520> never

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
with music you don't like but I've never

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
with music you don't like but I've never
really<00:00:54.149> had<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.719> compulsion<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.190> make<00:00:56.370> when

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
really had that compulsion to make when

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
really had that compulsion to make when
I'm<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.149> into<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> music<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
I'm not really into the music so it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.139 
I'm not really into the music so it
takes<00:00:58.980> me<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> long<00:00:59.340> time<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.850> find

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
takes me a long time to really find

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360 
takes me a long time to really find
music<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:01.199> find<00:01:01.410> stimulating

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
music that I really find stimulating

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
music that I really find stimulating
with<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.390> piece<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> diptych<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.409> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
with this piece it's a diptych so it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.039 
with this piece it's a diptych so it's
two<00:01:04.739> pieces<00:01:05.510> essentially<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
two pieces essentially that kind of

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
two pieces essentially that kind of
share<00:01:07.500> some<00:01:08.360> parameters<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.540> share<00:01:09.810> some

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
share some parameters they share some

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.580 
share some parameters they share some
form<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.700> felt<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.270> music<00:01:12.659> should<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.170> yes

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
form and I felt the music should be yes

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.100 
form and I felt the music should be yes
contrasting<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:14.670> also<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> something

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
contrasting would also have a something

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.780 
contrasting would also have a something
that<00:01:16.229> connects<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:16.979> live<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that connects them I think we live in a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.460 
that connects them I think we live in a
world<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.420> full<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.720> contrasts<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
world which is full of contrasts so I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
world which is full of contrasts so I
think<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> make<00:01:20.040> contrast<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.790> very<00:01:20.970> easy<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
think to make contrast it's very easy I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
think to make contrast it's very easy I
think<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.530> find<00:01:22.799> things<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.310> similar

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
think to find things that are similar

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.270 
think to find things that are similar
and<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.600> work<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:24.990> similarity<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.979> draw

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and really work with similarity to draw

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.730 
and really work with similarity to draw
out<00:01:26.580> certain<00:01:26.970> strands<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.170> much<00:01:28.350> more<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
out certain strands is much more of a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.050 
out certain strands is much more of a
kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> sophisticated<00:01:29.340> approach<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
kind of a sophisticated approach to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.310 
kind of a sophisticated approach to
working<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.750> I've<00:01:30.810> tried<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.259> with

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
working and I've tried to do that with

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.390 
working and I've tried to do that with
me<00:01:31.560> using<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> major

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
me using one of the major

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.980

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to absorb influences and those

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.749

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.580 
and well I see that that's the time I
know<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.810> shouldn't<00:03:01.050> be<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.410> piece

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
know that that shouldn't be in the piece

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.890 
know that that shouldn't be in the piece
that's<00:03:01.980> something<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.910> recognize<00:03:03.630> as

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
that's something that I recognize as

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.050 
that's something that I recognize as
something<00:03:04.320> from<00:03:04.739> somewhere<00:03:05.130> else<00:03:05.340> when<00:03:05.970> you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
something from somewhere else when you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.460 
something from somewhere else when you
collaborate<00:03:06.330> with<00:03:06.600> someone<00:03:07.050> whether<00:03:07.230> that's

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
collaborate with someone whether that's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.050 
collaborate with someone whether that's
a<00:03:07.560> composer<00:03:07.980> or<00:03:08.340> whether<00:03:08.489> that's<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.790> visual

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
a composer or whether that's a visual

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.970 
a composer or whether that's a visual
artist<00:03:09.390> or<00:03:09.600> in<00:03:09.690> my<00:03:09.810> case<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.350> scientist

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
artist or in my case it was a scientist

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.210 
artist or in my case it was a scientist
what<00:03:11.760> you're<00:03:11.910> looking<00:03:12.209> for<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:13.500> different

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
what you're looking for is a different

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.890 
what you're looking for is a different
way<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.489> perceiving<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.360> world<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.870> different

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
way of perceiving the world a different

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.680 
way of perceiving the world a different
way<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:17.100> thinking<00:03:17.190> about<00:03:17.970> something<00:03:18.269> and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
way of thinking about something and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.810 
way of thinking about something and
people<00:03:19.560> who<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.739> different<00:03:19.920> knowledge<00:03:20.310> sets

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
people who have different knowledge sets

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.910 
people who have different knowledge sets
have<00:03:21.390> different<00:03:21.750> types<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.230> information<00:03:22.470> that

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
have different types of information that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.160 
have different types of information that
they<00:03:23.010> can<00:03:23.070> share<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.840> guess

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
they can share with you and so I guess

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.590 
they can share with you and so I guess
what's<00:03:25.799> fascinating<00:03:26.730> me<00:03:26.880> about<00:03:27.120> working<00:03:27.450> with

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
what's fascinating me about working with

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.479 
what's fascinating me about working with
cognitive<00:03:27.989> science<00:03:28.410> or<00:03:28.530> neuroscientists<00:03:29.370> is

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
cognitive science or neuroscientists is

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.820 
cognitive science or neuroscientists is
the<00:03:30.090> thinking<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.750> they<00:03:30.870> bring<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.200> bear<00:03:31.560> and

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
the thinking that they bring to bear and

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.410 
the thinking that they bring to bear and
what<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.070> is<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.280> you're<00:03:32.400> doing<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.970> how

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
what it is that you're doing and how

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.270 
what it is that you're doing and how
that<00:03:33.630> thinking<00:03:34.110> might<00:03:34.290> change<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:35.010> way<00:03:35.130> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
that thinking might change the way in

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.880 
that thinking might change the way in
which<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.790> make<00:03:36.480> choreography<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.769> very

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
which I make choreography so it's very

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.979 
which I make choreography so it's very
very<00:03:38.130> collaborative<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.910> in<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.600> way<00:03:39.660> but

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
very collaborative in in that way but

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.289 
very collaborative in in that way but
it's<00:03:40.110> very<00:03:40.290> much<00:03:40.620> about<00:03:40.860> shifting<00:03:41.760> thinking

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
it's very much about shifting thinking

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.479 
it's very much about shifting thinking
and<00:03:42.450> using<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.989> different<00:03:43.440> filter<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:44.220> see<00:03:44.370> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
and using a different filter to see the

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.090 
and using a different filter to see the
body<00:03:44.670> in<00:03:44.850> I'm<00:03:45.810> gonna<00:03:45.959> guess<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.739> title

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
body in I'm gonna guess this this title

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.860 
body in I'm gonna guess this this title
entity<00:03:47.459> out<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.850> wanted<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.420> make<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.600> piece<00:03:48.810> that

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
entity out I wanted to make a piece that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.610 
entity out I wanted to make a piece that
was<00:03:49.140> very<00:03:49.320> much<00:03:49.530> about<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.400> other<00:03:50.430> something

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
was very much about the other something

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.039 
was very much about the other something
kind<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:52.680> external<00:03:53.489> something<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.299> felt<00:03:54.780> as

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
kind of external something that felt as

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.870 
kind of external something that felt as
though<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.350> had<00:03:55.560> its<00:03:55.739> own<00:03:55.860> grammar<00:03:56.400> its<00:03:56.700> own

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
though it had its own grammar its own

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.380 
though it had its own grammar its own
syntax<00:03:57.269> its<00:03:57.930> own<00:03:58.340> sense<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.459> identity<00:03:59.610> and

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
syntax its own sense of identity and

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.630 
syntax its own sense of identity and
that<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.959> wasn't<00:04:01.200> loaded<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:01.920> something<00:04:02.370> that

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
that it wasn't loaded in something that

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.400 
that it wasn't loaded in something that
we<00:04:02.760> understand<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.570> can<00:04:03.690> concretely<00:04:04.019> say

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
we understand and can concretely say

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.920 
we understand and can concretely say
this<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:05.060> another<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.329> know<00:04:06.390> something<00:04:06.750> very

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
this is another you know something very

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.289 
this is another you know something very
very<00:04:07.049> specific<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.519> guess<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.850> idea<00:04:09.209> of

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
very specific so I guess this idea of

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.289 
very specific so I guess this idea of
entity<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.230> something<00:04:10.560> which<00:04:10.950> is

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
entity that it's something which is

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.819 
entity that it's something which is
something<00:04:12.299> other<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.930> unfamiliar<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.799> us

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
something other that is unfamiliar to us

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.460 
something other that is unfamiliar to us
but<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.820> has<00:04:15.030> references<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.780> things<00:04:16.049> maybe

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
but that has references of things maybe

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.740 
but that has references of things maybe
from<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.859> past<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.400> have<00:04:17.519> informed<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.239> one

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
from the past that have informed it one

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.839 
from the past that have informed it one
of<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.930> things<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.320> really<00:04:20.280> find

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
of the things that I really find

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.659 
of the things that I really find
exciting<00:04:21.180> about<00:04:21.359> working<00:04:21.810> with<00:04:21.930> dances<00:04:22.349> is

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
exciting about working with dances is

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.920 
exciting about working with dances is
collaborating

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
collaborating

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.680 
collaborating
in<00:04:24.320> authoring<00:04:25.009> language<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.759> to<00:04:26.300> do<00:04:26.449> that<00:04:26.630> I

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
in authoring language and to do that I

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.909 
in authoring language and to do that I
have<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.050> one<00:04:27.169> get<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.410> know<00:04:27.530> them<00:04:27.680> very<00:04:27.710> well

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
have to one get to know them very well

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.439 
have to one get to know them very well
they<00:04:28.250> have<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.520> get<00:04:28.639> to<00:04:28.759> know<00:04:28.790> me<00:04:29.060> very<00:04:29.240> well

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
they have to get to know me very well

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.600 
they have to get to know me very well
and<00:04:29.600> we<00:04:29.720> have<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.990> share<00:04:30.199> similar<00:04:30.800> processes

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
and we have to share similar processes

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.120 
and we have to share similar processes
by<00:04:31.910> which<00:04:31.940> we<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.479> mind<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:33.139> new<00:04:33.680> physical

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
by which we can mind that new physical

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.379 
by which we can mind that new physical
language<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.729> I<00:04:34.820> guess<00:04:34.940> that's<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.300> thing

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
language and I guess that's the thing

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.029 
language and I guess that's the thing
that<00:04:35.570> takes<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.020> time<00:04:36.229> I<00:04:36.440> think<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.740> just<00:04:36.919> want

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
that takes the time I think I just want

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.560 
that takes the time I think I just want
the<00:04:37.100> dancers<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.490> be<00:04:37.610> able<00:04:37.759> to<00:04:37.970> perform<00:04:38.300> really

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
the dancers to be able to perform really

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.659 
the dancers to be able to perform really
