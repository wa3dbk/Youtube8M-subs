00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
somewhat blend and make swirls this is a

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.420 
somewhat blend and make swirls this is a
go<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.900> I<00:00:32.140> put<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.500> base<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:33.070> now<00:00:33.250> I'm<00:00:33.400> just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
go so I put the base and now I'm just

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.560 
go so I put the base and now I'm just
using<00:00:33.790> strawberry<00:00:34.480> milk<00:00:34.720> by<00:00:35.710> NYX<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
using strawberry milk by NYX and you

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.910 
using strawberry milk by NYX and you
could<00:00:37.690> actually<00:00:37.780> skip<00:00:38.019> this<00:00:38.440> step<00:00:38.680> but<00:00:38.860> I

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
could actually skip this step but I

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.460 
could actually skip this step but I
wanted<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.430> use<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:40.390> I<00:00:40.420> blended<00:00:41.080> this<00:00:41.199> out

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
wanted to use it so I blended this out

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.530 
wanted to use it so I blended this out
really<00:00:41.949> well<00:00:42.309> because<00:00:42.670> if<00:00:42.970> you<00:00:43.089> don't<00:00:43.239> it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
really well because if you don't it

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.619 
really well because if you don't it
really<00:00:43.570> weak<00:00:44.260> creases<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:46.120> just<00:00:46.330> use<00:00:46.479> my

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
really weak creases and I just use my

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.119 
really weak creases and I just use my

that's what I use and just getting the

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.890 
that's what I use and just getting the
right<00:01:05.680> consistency<00:01:06.490> is<00:01:06.670> kind<00:01:06.970> of<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.690> hard

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
right consistency is kind of the hard

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.980 
right consistency is kind of the hard
part<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.290> guess<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:09.550> you<00:01:10.360> want<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:10.630> kind<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.930> this

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
part I guess so you want it kind of this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.310 
part I guess so you want it kind of this
like<00:01:11.230> I<00:01:11.440> guess<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:13.300> don't<00:01:13.450> know<00:01:13.630> chunky<00:01:14.080> soup

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
consistency and I'm just applying it

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.830

and I'm just gonna apply it right here I
don't<00:04:58.400> know<00:04:58.550> why<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:59.060> put<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.389> there<00:04:59.630> but<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.110> just

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
don't know why I put it there but I just

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.610 
don't know why I put it there but I just
like<00:05:00.919> it<00:05:01.190> there<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:02.210> that's<00:05:02.900> why<00:05:03.169> I'm<00:05:03.320> applying

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
like it there so that's why I'm applying

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.170 
like it there so that's why I'm applying
it<00:05:03.919> I<00:05:04.130> don't<00:05:04.340> know<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:04.490> just<00:05:04.520> kind<00:05:04.760> of<00:05:04.849> gives<00:05:05.060> it

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
it I don't know it just kind of gives it

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.659 
it I don't know it just kind of gives it
like<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.389> shimmery<00:05:05.930> essence<00:05:06.410> under<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.460> eyes

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
like a shimmery essence under the eyes

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.150 
like a shimmery essence under the eyes
it<00:05:08.180> gives<00:05:08.450> it<00:05:08.599> kind<00:05:08.990> of<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.200> fairy<00:05:10.070> vibe<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.789> guess

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
it gives it kind of a fairy vibe I guess

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.070 
it gives it kind of a fairy vibe I guess
and<00:05:13.160> yeah<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.970> helps<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.300> kind<00:05:14.419> of<00:05:14.539> blend<00:05:14.780> out

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
and yeah it helps to kind of blend out

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.150 
and yeah it helps to kind of blend out
this<00:05:15.380> harsh<00:05:15.770> purple<00:05:16.310> line<00:05:16.490> under<00:05:16.849> here<00:05:17.180> and
