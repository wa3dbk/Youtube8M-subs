00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.859
 and coal 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.210
 this is a railway like the ones 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.240
 in alone 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.550
 all day locomotives bid on 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.420
 up and down carrying the passengers 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.869
 Where do they want to go? 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.760
 this is a steam locomotive this 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.490
 locomotive looks a bit like yes 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.140
 it's called steam locomotive because the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 steam is what drives it 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.270
 the locomotives do better by heating 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.270
 water with very intense fire 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.120
 this fire is made with burning coal 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.030
 here is a mountain of coal 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.720
 ready for the locomotive that needs it 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.820
 the coal is black and comes in pieces 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.820
 big 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:20.040
 when the coal is burned carefully in 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.040
 the kettle gets very very hot 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.130
 the steam locomotive needs to maintain 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.770
 its fire burning all day to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.770
 doing it needs a lot of steam 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.659
 in the morning the stoker palais a 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.659
 coal in the boiler of the locomotive 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.790
 when you fight enough coal what 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.790
 light very carefully 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.610
 soon as the water warms 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.390
 enough to steam and boost 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.390
 the locomotive 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.110
 the stoker must add more coal to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.709
 keep the fire burning is a job 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.709
 very hard 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.410
 the locomotive carries the coal in a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.410
 Special box behind your cabin 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.110
 every morning the special box is 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.110
 filled with a lot of carbon 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.580
 when the special box is full 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.620
 driver and the stoker can be 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.350
 sure that you have enough coal 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.960
 for the whole day and they can always 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.720
 do a lot of steam 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.210
 with a lot of coal to make a lot of steam 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.760
 the locomotive can recycle by the 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.130
 guides all day leading to the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.310
 passengers from station to station in good 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.310
 weather 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.220
 look at that dense white vapor the coal is 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.670
 a very important part of the way 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.670
 railway
