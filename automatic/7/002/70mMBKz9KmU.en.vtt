mesh<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.810> ideas<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.920> worked<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
mesh of ideas but it really worked and I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.980 
mesh of ideas but it really worked and I
think<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.090> thing<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.329> surprised<00:01:45.720> me<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
think the thing that surprised me the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.830 
think the thing that surprised me the
most<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:46.619> how<00:01:47.340> effortless<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> was<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
most was how effortless it was to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
most was how effortless it was to
maneuver<00:01:49.439> around<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.740> city<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:51.060> as

maneuver around the city that's about as

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.429 
maneuver around the city that's about as
what<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> prop<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> problem<00:01:52.170> could<00:01:52.320> have

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
what the prop the problem could have

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
what the prop the problem could have
been<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:52.799> if<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.250> too<00:01:53.460> difficult<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
been as if it was too difficult to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.850 
been as if it was too difficult to
maneuver<00:01:54.299> around<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.750> too<00:01:54.899> easy<00:01:55.110> just

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
maneuver around or too easy just

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.959

to<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.790> fun<00:02:22.000> which<00:02:22.209> is<00:02:22.360> exactly<00:02:22.510> what<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
to have fun which is exactly what you

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.050 
to have fun which is exactly what you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
want from that sort of script is it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.089 
want from that sort of script is it
wrong<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.930> for<00:02:26.080> things<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.290> building<00:02:27.040> up

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
wrong to you for things like building up

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.890

fighting<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.890> traversal<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:31.120> seems<00:02:31.269> like<00:02:31.299> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
fighting and traversal it seems like the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.150 
fighting and traversal it seems like the
kind<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.660> game<00:02:31.780> would<00:02:32.049> want<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.829> encourage

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
kind of game would want to encourage

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.819 
kind of game would want to encourage
that<00:02:33.280> much<00:02:33.579> yes<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.510> more<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.049> fight<00:02:35.799> the

that much yes so the more you fight the

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.100 
that much yes so the more you fight the
more<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.310> use<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:37.030> environment<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> bigger

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
more you use the environment the bigger

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.740 
more you use the environment the bigger
basic<00:02:38.650> your<00:02:38.860> upgrades<00:02:39.400> get<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.360> gives<00:02:40.569> you

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750

into the pants which basically amplify

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.270 
into the pants which basically amplify
your<00:02:43.239> ability<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.110> kill<00:02:44.319> everything<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:45.160> as

encouraged to just play around and get

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.660 
encouraged to just play around and get
to<00:02:50.380> grips<00:02:50.590> because<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:50.890> never<00:02:51.010> punishes<00:02:51.430> you
