00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.229
 hello friends in response to the mail by 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.109
 facebook they sent us asking 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.170
 on the seed 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.030
 of how to collect it and what was the 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.539
 process to be able to take out the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.419
 seed and here I make you this video is 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:23.740
 very easy the only problem is very easy 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.380
 is that it takes quite a long time 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.700
 time if we could say that for 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.219
 to be able to take out your four grams of seed 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.079
 you are going to take approximately three to 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.170
 four hours 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.600
 and we have our stevia plant 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.640
 in our plant stevia is going to start 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.820
 sprout your seed 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.220
 the time is depends on the conditions 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.879
 of the climate that you have your city 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.590
 us at approximately 3 months 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.489
 to make the cut 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.670
 we return to have the seed 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.190
 but hey look one of the advantages is 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.280
 that by having your stevia plant you can 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.460
 be collecting fresh seed what 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.340
 does this mean that your seed is going to 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.340
 be another you will harvest at the time 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.649
 and you can plant it at the moment that the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.289
 harvest can not put to germinate 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.479
 here I have some seed 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.750
 Now we are taking seeds for a 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.000
 request that they made us in Puebla as 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.980
 you can see it 's seed completely 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.740
 cool 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.710
 seeds freshly collected from our 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.830
 plant and the process as the process is 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.610
 very easy that what you do 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.610
 text 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.929
 only pulls 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.590
 here you can see it fresh 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.679
 and well, you're collecting all 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.149
 our plant all our stevia that 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.670
 we manage that the variety 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.180
 Native the Creole variety is going to give us 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.960
 a good quality seed 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.420
 there are other varieties of the variety 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.900
 pretty the 1 and the 2 is also the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:21.350
 variety 3 the percentage of germination 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.660
 of that seed is 40 to 30% 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.060
 the germination percentage of the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.250
 stevia rebaudiana bertoni variety 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.670
 Native or Creole is between an 85 to a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.430
 95% 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.080
 What does this mean that the Creole 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.470
 will give a large percentage of 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.900
 germination and it will give us enough 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.790
 little plants 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.340
