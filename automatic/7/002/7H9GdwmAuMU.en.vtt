00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
those two there is a difference between

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.999 
those two there is a difference between
regular<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> decaf<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.409> decaf<00:01:43.409> obviously

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
regular and decaf so decaf obviously

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.310 
regular and decaf so decaf obviously
doesn't<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.399> caffeine<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.049> want

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
doesn't have caffeine in it but you want

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
doesn't have caffeine in it but you want
to<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> high<00:01:46.950> quality<00:01:47.299> decaffeinated

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to have a high quality decaffeinated

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
to have a high quality decaffeinated
coffee<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.140> myth<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.439> decaf<00:01:50.070> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
coffee it's a myth that decaf is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
coffee it's a myth that decaf is
healthier<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.210> than<00:01:51.240> regular<00:01:51.689> because

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
healthier for you than regular because

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.620 
healthier for you than regular because
they<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.220> many<00:01:53.700> different<00:01:54.180> chemical

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
they use so many different chemical

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050 
they use so many different chemical
solvents<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.649> force<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.219> caffeine<00:01:56.640> out<00:01:56.850> of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
solvents to force the caffeine out of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
solvents to force the caffeine out of
the<00:01:57.210> bean<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.320> drink<00:01:58.619> decaf<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> want

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the bean so if you drink decaf you want

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.760 
the bean so if you drink decaf you want
to<00:01:59.369> look<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.640> Swiss<00:01:59.969> water<00:02:00.390> process<00:02:01.229> Swiss

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to look for Swiss water process Swiss

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
to look for Swiss water process Swiss
water<00:02:02.070> process<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.060> fair<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.420> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
water process and that's fair for you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.630 
water process and that's fair for you
less<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.350> better<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.040> find<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.490> some

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
less is better you can find it in some

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
less is better you can find it in some
coffee<00:02:05.939> shops<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:07.170> way<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.500> use<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
coffee shops and that way they use a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
coffee shops and that way they use a
filter<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.789> naturally<00:02:09.300> decaffeinated

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
filter and it's naturally decaffeinated

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.540 
filter and it's naturally decaffeinated
what<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.289> expresso<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> know<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.459> we've

because<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.420> drink<00:02:17.719> coffee<00:02:18.049> within<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
because if you drink coffee within the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.770 
because if you drink coffee within the
first<00:02:18.920> 15<00:02:19.370> minutes<00:02:19.579> of<00:02:19.790> brewing<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.269> it's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
first 15 minutes of brewing it it's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.720 
first 15 minutes of brewing it it's
actually<00:02:21.170> alkaline-forming<00:02:21.769> which<00:02:22.459> means

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
actually alkaline-forming which means

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.149 
actually alkaline-forming which means
less<00:02:23.450> inflammation<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.469> don't<00:02:24.620> get<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.829> acid

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
less inflammation you don't get the acid

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.920 
less inflammation you don't get the acid
reflux<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:25.700> don't<00:02:25.939> get<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.180> stomach<00:02:26.629> you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
reflux you don't get the stomach you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.330 
reflux you don't get the stomach you
know<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> lot<00:02:27.379> of<00:02:27.409> people<00:02:27.620> get<00:02:27.739> stomach<00:02:28.069> pains

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
know a lot of people get stomach pains

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.890 
know a lot of people get stomach pains
from<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.670> inflammation<00:02:28.939> yeah<00:02:29.209> yeah<00:02:29.480> yeah<00:02:29.659> and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
from the inflammation yeah yeah yeah and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.809 
from the inflammation yeah yeah yeah and
so<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.409> drink<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.769> within<00:02:30.889> the<00:02:31.069> 15<00:02:31.459> minutes

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
so if you drink it within the 15 minutes

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.610 
so if you drink it within the 15 minutes
it's<00:02:32.030> much<00:02:32.239> healthier<00:02:32.420> for<00:02:32.629> you<00:02:32.870> okay<00:02:33.319> every

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
minute after that 15 minutes it gets

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.509 
minute after that 15 minutes it gets
more<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.629> more<00:02:35.810> acidic<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.889> those<00:02:37.129> of<00:02:37.159> you
