also my teammates are pushing a little
further<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.860> capturing<00:02:10.670> Zone<00:02:11.060> B<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:15.110> is

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
further and capturing Zone B that is

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.979 
further and capturing Zone B that is
correct<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.850> point<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.330> battle<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
correct at that point in the battle the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.080 
correct at that point in the battle the
attackers<00:02:18.680> were<00:02:18.920> controlling<00:02:19.280> two-thirds<00:02:19.940> of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
attackers were controlling two-thirds of
the<00:02:20.209> battlefield<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.050> around<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.680> time<00:02:22.010> I

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
the battlefield so around that time I

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.040 
the battlefield so around that time I
decide<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:22.880> my<00:02:23.120> services<00:02:23.600> could<00:02:23.810> probably

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
decide that my services could probably

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.650 
decide that my services could probably
be<00:02:24.290> used<00:02:24.500> elsewhere<00:02:25.269> thankfully<00:02:26.269> Lady<00:02:26.480> Anne
