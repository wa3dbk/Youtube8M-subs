notice there's a boundary in here it's a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.810 
notice there's a boundary in here it's a
warm<00:00:33.660> front<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.950> warm<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.309> juicy<00:00:35.489> to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.650 
surface winds and the thing you notice
is<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.059> boundary<00:01:03.510> it's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
is right in here there's a boundary it's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.450 
is right in here there's a boundary it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
a warm front wings to the north or

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.280 
a warm front wings to the north or
northeast<00:01:05.850> dew<00:01:06.150> points<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> 40s<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
northeast dew points are in the 40s and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
northeast dew points are in the 40s and
50s<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> south<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.970> winds<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.330> from

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
50s to the south the winds are from

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
50s to the south the winds are from
right<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> south<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.189> dew

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
right out of the south and the dew

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
right out of the south and the dew
points<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> 60s<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.540> near<00:01:12.570> 70<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
points are in the 60s to near 70 in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.740 
points are in the 60s to near 70 in
parts<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> Midlands<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> South<00:01:15.060> Carolina

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
parts of the Midlands of South Carolina

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.440 
parts of the Midlands of South Carolina
so<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> instability<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.360> at

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so we've got a lot of instability and at

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.700 
so we've got a lot of instability and at
least<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> low<00:01:19.080> levels<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
least at the low levels of the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
least at the low levels of the
atmosphere<00:01:19.740> we've<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.909> wind<00:01:21.479> shear<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> wind

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
atmosphere we've got wind shear the wind

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
atmosphere we've got wind shear the wind
changing<00:01:22.590> direction<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> lowest<00:01:23.549> levels

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
changing direction in the lowest levels

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
changing direction in the lowest levels
what<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.390> don't<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.650> far<00:01:25.860> today

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
what we don't really have so far today

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
what we don't really have so far today
is<00:01:26.340> deep<00:01:26.640> layer<00:01:26.939> share<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> mean<00:01:27.689> like

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is deep layer share what I mean like

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200 
is deep layer share what I mean like
that<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.320> shear<00:01:28.979> from<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> ground<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that is a shear from the ground to a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.140 
that is a shear from the ground to a
loft<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.869> basically<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.439> I'm<00:01:31.560> looking<00:01:31.860> for

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
loft and basically what I'm looking for

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
loft and basically what I'm looking for
for<00:01:33.150> deep<00:01:33.450> shear<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.770> much<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> wings

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
for deep shear is how much do the wings

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
for deep shear is how much do the wings
change<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.150> height<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.560> do

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
change with height and you can see we do

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
change with height and you can see we do
have<00:01:37.770> some<00:01:38.369> especially<00:01:38.880> along<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> warm

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
have some especially along the warm

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
have some especially along the warm
front<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:41.640> consider

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
front but it's not what I would consider

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
front but it's not what I would consider
really<00:01:42.210> strong<00:01:43.049> shear<00:01:43.500> its<00:01:43.710> directional

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
really strong shear its directional

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
really strong shear its directional
shear<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> lot<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.780> wind

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
shear but we don't have a lot of wind

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.819 
shear but we don't have a lot of wind
shear<00:01:46.380> per<00:01:47.250> se<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.579> later<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.240> afternoon

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
shear per se but later this afternoon

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.230 
shear per se but later this afternoon
and<00:01:49.829> into<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> afternoon<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.790> evening<00:01:50.909> hours

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and into the afternoon and evening hours

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
and into the afternoon and evening hours
if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.049> look<00:01:52.200> care<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.619> them<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.799> turn<00:01:52.979> off

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
if you look care for them and turn off

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.069 
if you look care for them and turn off
the<00:01:53.310> there's<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.060> strong<00:01:54.390> southwest

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the there's really strong southwest

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.630 
the there's really strong southwest

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
winds back to the west this is it about

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.569 
winds back to the west this is it about
700<00:01:57.420> millibars<00:01:58.100> which<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> mid<00:01:59.549> and

wind shear is going to move in here and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.149 
wind shear is going to move in here and
could<00:02:03.509> give<00:02:03.689> us<00:02:03.780> organize<00:02:04.259> cells<00:02:04.799> or

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
could give us organize cells or

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.700 
could give us organize cells or
thunderstorms<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.180> call<00:02:06.390> them<00:02:06.570> now<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.560> don't

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
expect widespread thunderstorm

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.999 
expect widespread thunderstorm
development<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:10.140> afternoon<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> ones

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
development this afternoon but the ones

development this afternoon but the ones
that<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.280> develop<00:02:11.459> could<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.090> soo

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that do develop could be soo

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.420 
that do develop could be soo

rotating<00:02:14.970> thunderstorm<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.990> don't<00:02:16.200> all

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
rotating thunderstorm they don't all

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.710 
rotating thunderstorm they don't all
produce<00:02:16.830> tornadoes<00:02:17.190> but<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.120> they

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
produce tornadoes but they can they

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.270 
produce tornadoes but they can they
often<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.170> produce<00:02:19.319> some<00:02:19.590> big-time<00:02:19.950> hail

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
often can produce some big-time hail

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.740 
often can produce some big-time hail
because<00:02:20.670> when<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> rotating

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
because when you get a rotating

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.809 
because when you get a rotating
thunderstorm<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> screw

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
thunderstorm going up it's like a screw

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.630 
thunderstorm going up it's like a screw
counterclockwise<00:02:24.120> spin<00:02:25.020> drives<00:02:25.739> air<00:02:26.069> high<00:02:26.430> up

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
counterclockwise spin drives air high up

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.339 
counterclockwise spin drives air high up
into<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> atmosphere<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.690> gives<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
into the atmosphere and gives you the

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.440 
into the atmosphere and gives you the
potential<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:28.950> some<00:02:29.220> hail<00:02:29.459> when<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.180> look<00:02:30.330> at

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
potential for some hail when we look at

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
potential for some hail when we look at
some<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.720> other<00:02:30.750> parameters<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.800> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
some of the other parameters this is the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.550 
some of the other parameters this is the
tornado<00:02:32.340> ingredient<00:02:33.200> parameter<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
tornado ingredient parameter I like to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.949 
tornado ingredient parameter I like to
look<00:02:34.680> at<00:02:34.920> from<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.790> schref<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.569> short-range

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
look at from the schref the short-range

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.059 
look at from the schref the short-range
ensemble<00:02:37.650> forecast<00:02:38.130> from<00:02:38.760> spc<00:02:39.239> and

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
ensemble forecast from spc and

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.870 
ensemble forecast from spc and
essentially<00:02:41.069> what<00:02:41.100> you're<00:02:41.280> looking<00:02:41.580> for<00:02:41.790> is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
essentially what you're looking for is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.420 
essentially what you're looking for is
anything<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.360> red<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:43.190> significant<00:02:44.190> chance

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
anything in red is a significant chance

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.130 
anything in red is a significant chance
of<00:02:44.700> some<00:02:45.030> tornadoes<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.019> little

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
of some tornadoes you can see a little

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.290 
of some tornadoes you can see a little
five<00:02:46.440> percent<00:02:46.920> probability<00:02:47.280> pops<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:48.090> by<00:02:48.239> two

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
five percent probability pops up by two

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.050 
five percent probability pops up by two
o'clock<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.560> afternoon<00:02:49.769> but<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:50.910> go

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
o'clock this afternoon but as we go

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.330 
o'clock this afternoon but as we go
towards<00:02:51.299> five<00:02:51.720> o'clock<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.410> jumps<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.799> fifteen

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
towards five o'clock it jumps to fifteen

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.550 
towards five o'clock it jumps to fifteen
percent<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:55.080> into<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> evening

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
percent and then we go into the evening

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.800 
percent and then we go into the evening
hours<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.220> can<00:02:56.370> see<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:57.000> fifteen<00:02:57.480> percent

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
hours you can see the fifteen percent

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.660 
hours you can see the fifteen percent
kind<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.170> lingering<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.340> really

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
kind of lingering here and it's really

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.059 
kind of lingering here and it's really
along<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.239> warm<00:03:00.510> front<00:03:00.750> as<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.560> go<00:03:01.709> into<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
along that warm front as we go into the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.250 
along that warm front as we go into the
afternoon<00:03:02.100> hours<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.060> right<00:03:03.299> there<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.780> think

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
afternoon hours so right there I think

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.050 
afternoon hours so right there I think
after<00:03:04.410> five<00:03:04.980> o'clock<00:03:05.190> I'm<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.000> be

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
after five o'clock I'm going to be

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.210 
after five o'clock I'm going to be
watching<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.720> visible<00:03:07.560> satellite<00:03:07.739> image

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
watching the visible satellite image

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.030 
watching the visible satellite image
down<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.700> here<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.660> see<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:09.989> we<00:03:10.140> see<00:03:10.319> developing

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
down in here to see if we see developing
