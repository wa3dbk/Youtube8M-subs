00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
a product so that you can decide for

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.630

is going to be called the iPhone 5s

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179 
is going to be called the iPhone 5s
experiment<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.720> many<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.560> most<00:01:41.009> of

experiment as many of you know most of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190 
experiment as many of you know most of
my<00:01:41.280> reviews<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.820> based<00:01:41.850> around<00:01:42.240> Android<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
my reviews are based around Android and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960 
my reviews are based around Android and
that's<00:01:43.560> primarily<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> found

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that's primarily because I have found

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
that's primarily because I have found
Android<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.689> very<00:01:45.930> very<00:01:46.140> useful

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
Android to be very very useful

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.380 
Android to be very very useful

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
among all the other products but that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.969 
among all the other products but that
doesn't<00:01:48.689> mean<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.079> haven't<00:01:49.350> used<00:01:49.710> or

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
doesn't mean that I haven't used or

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
doesn't mean that I haven't used or
don't<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.490> Apple<00:01:50.970> products<00:01:51.390> actually<00:01:51.570> my

since the beginning
last<00:01:59.159> year<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> stood<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.820> line<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.360> iPhone

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
last year I stood in line for the iPhone

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.020 
last year I stood in line for the iPhone
5<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.680> year<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> was<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.280> debating

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
5 and this year I was really debating

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.580 
5 and this year I was really debating
whether<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.329> wanted<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.840> look<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.200> guy<00:02:04.409> or

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
whether I wanted to look at this guy or

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
whether I wanted to look at this guy or
not<00:02:04.619> because<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.640> similar<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
not because it is so similar to the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.839 
not because it is so similar to the
iPhone<00:02:06.780> 5<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:07.920> messing<00:02:08.160> around<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
iPhone 5 but I was messing around on a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.059 
iPhone 5 but I was messing around on a
TNT's<00:02:09.420> website<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.140> somehow<00:02:10.349> ordered<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
TNT's website and somehow ordered the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.190 
TNT's website and somehow ordered the
phone<00:02:11.280> around<00:02:11.640> 5:00<00:02:12.060> p.m.<00:02:12.090> wherever

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
phone around 5:00 p.m. wherever

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900 
phone around 5:00 p.m. wherever
had<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.620> wait<00:02:13.739> until<00:02:13.890> midnight<00:02:14.430> pretty<00:02:14.790> much

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
had to wait until midnight pretty much

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.850 
had to wait until midnight pretty much
right<00:02:15.239> for<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.629> website<00:02:15.810> went<00:02:16.319> down<00:02:16.620> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
right for the website went down you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.369 
right for the website went down you
could<00:02:17.040> order<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.580> phone<00:02:18.000> early<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.170> came

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
could order a phone early so it came

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.229 
could order a phone early so it came
yesterday<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.280> didn't<00:02:20.550> have<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.819> deal<00:02:21.000> with

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
yesterday and I didn't have to deal with

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.509 
yesterday and I didn't have to deal with
any<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.750> nonsense<00:02:22.260> waiting<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.010> line<00:02:23.190> so

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
any of that nonsense waiting in line so

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.670 
any of that nonsense waiting in line so
that<00:02:24.030> was<00:02:24.180> good<00:02:24.360> karma<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.019> figured<00:02:25.470> I

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that was good karma so I figured I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
that was good karma so I figured I
should<00:02:25.890> probably<00:02:26.280> put<00:02:26.819> some<00:02:26.970> effort<00:02:27.269> into

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
should probably put some effort into

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.259 
should probably put some effort into
this<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.349> why<00:02:28.560> did<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.830> stop<00:02:29.160> using<00:02:29.640> iPhone<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.239> a

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
this so why did I stop using iPhone as a

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.080 
this so why did I stop using iPhone as a
primary<00:02:30.750> phone<00:02:31.050> well<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.769> had<00:02:32.190> used<00:02:32.430> iPhone<00:02:32.880> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
primary phone well I had used iPhone and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
primary phone well I had used iPhone and
swore<00:02:33.360> by<00:02:33.540> iPhone<00:02:33.989> since<00:02:34.349> pretty<00:02:34.500> much<00:02:34.590> high

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
swore by iPhone since pretty much high

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
swore by iPhone since pretty much high
school<00:02:35.220> into<00:02:35.550> college<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:36.630> when<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> got

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
school into college but then when I got

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.660 
school into college but then when I got
around<00:02:37.349> my<00:02:37.500> junior<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.099> senior<00:02:38.430> year<00:02:38.640> of

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
around my junior and senior year of

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.370 
around my junior and senior year of
college<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.269> realized<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:39.989> were<00:02:40.110> some

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
college I realized that there were some

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.559 
college I realized that there were some
things<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:40.980> couldn't<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:41.940> very<00:02:42.239> well<00:02:42.299> with

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
things that I couldn't do very well with

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.720 
things that I couldn't do very well with
an<00:02:42.690> iPhone<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.470> that's<00:02:43.830> when<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.459> went

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
an iPhone and that's when I really went

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.820 
an iPhone and that's when I really went
over<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.269> Android<00:02:45.780> have<00:02:46.019> pretty<00:02:46.230> much<00:02:46.440> stayed

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
over to Android have pretty much stayed

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.309 
over to Android have pretty much stayed
there<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.549> since<00:02:47.819> iOS<00:02:48.060> 7<00:02:48.630> has<00:02:48.780> been<00:02:48.810> released
