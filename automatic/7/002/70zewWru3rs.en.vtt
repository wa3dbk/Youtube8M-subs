00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.019
 good day dear friends swami liebert 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.650
 us today i will tell you about such a wild 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.860
 sewer and machines as claim 153 or 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.110
 people cannon gull struck me this 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.150
 the apparatus is here than playing the second and 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.140
 third rank this little by planchik 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.170
 distributes in the soup to all whom will meet the cobra 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.289
 spitphery hulk it and especially frederick 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.270
 but just chopped into salad well let's 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.070
 Already go to the very analysis 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:40.399
 and 153 n is the premium aircraft of the second 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.160
 rank plays against all the hodgepodge second 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.399
 third tier dignity given 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.949
 the apparatus are as follows 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:52.149
 firstly seagull as in itself plans it 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.329
 plane with incredible speed of turn 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:59.059
 secondly the distinguishing feature of this 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.920
 aircraft is the presence of something not 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:08.240
 strange 2 slags shooting through the screw with 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.240
 ammunition in 300 shells well and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.540
 third enemies do not feel threatened in us and 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.850
 quietly substituted under attack and 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.610
 punish fat ki 45 on small 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.060
 seagulls are pretty nice which way 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.060
 don't look 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.299
 imperfections are typical of biplanes this 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.890
 low speed strength and dynamics 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.470
 say we suffer from it somehow 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.990
 I can not yet on a seagull should not 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.210
 burzum play and enter clean turns 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.970
 where we reveal ourselves to the fullest 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.759
 the program 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.340
 let's go to combat use of the aircraft 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.740
 so let's start with the truisms nabi 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.100
 plans need to use maneuverable 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.100
 the battle 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.570
 step 1 we collect 1 and a half kilometers 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.270
 heights step 2 provoke an attack on ourselves 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.270
 or rush into an existing one 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.640
 air combat counterattack the rebellion of the worlds and 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.770
 everything in this spirit do not forget 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.990
 gazing at six since seagull 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.600
 quickly lose energy and need 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.780
 control the situation without giving the enemy 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.080
 chances of an attack just don't be scared 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.560
 quite simply saw a run gone under 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.880
 the enemy 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.710
 he broke the wings step 3 destroy those 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.200
 opponents who are in 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.810
 disadvantage for example 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.680
 fighters without energy stormtroopers and so 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.080
 further well if some stupid spitfire 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.210
 decide with you power and live also 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.630
 write him in the shield step 4 put on 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:53.030
 fuck enemies and get out of battle without 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.790
 damage profit 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.030
 rush into a battle demolish enemies on 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.450
 your hellish chariot and fly away for 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.230
 ammunition with regard to the recommendations 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.750
 then they are the following 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:13.120
 First, I advise you to insert a universal 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.890
 or ground tape on the guns in the second 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.320
 primary goals for us are light 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.020
 enemy fighters 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.060
 Well, in the third being in a fight you need 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.540
 constantly look around and not give 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.400
 to the enemy 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.280
 a chance to hook your thin trim on 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.050
 this guide has come to an end 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.020
