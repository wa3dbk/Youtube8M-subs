00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.989
 according to a television reporter from máó with in australia his team signed 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.609
 with idc for seven minutes on Saturday night in the eastern region of 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.570
 sabotage the new zealand 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.429
 On December 21, 1978 the pilots of the New Zealand cargo plane 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.569
 I maintain and that says gene will observe a strange luminous phenomenon on top of the 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:35.010
 sea ​​near sao country lan in new zealand 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.110
 the objects were also picked up by the traffic control radar 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.740
 Washington Aerial 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.740
 and the reports reached the local media ten days later on the 31st 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.660
 December producers in the foot channel of australia sent the journalist 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.040
 account infoca here with a camera team to try to find these 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.220
 same UFOs in the same flight path and it was achieved by the controllers of 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.280
 air traffic recorded strange irregularities on his radar 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.150
 this is what the reporter Culkin Fogarty said when he followed up on 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.220
 flight of an airplane that reported body start the previous month 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.320
 we love we are in the radar room at the airport of the country pig 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.610
 it's close to one and 45 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.780
 uu and in the next twenty minutes we will try to take off in the long yes 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.390
 for me to follow up on the route we took a few minutes before 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.270
 saved what we just heard from the welinton radar because there's still 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.950
 targets in the calculation area so this time we hope to get a better 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 filming compared to the last time 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.160
 The case of New Zealand is of considerable importance in history 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.260
 of ufology due to the rest of the information that was available later 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.700
 we have the own filming and tapes recorded by infobae account if 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.610
 well aircraft and very important is that we have the tape recorded by the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.130
 air traffic control center these minister a history of 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.000
 sighting minute by minute 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.750
 glory we are about three minutes out of the country jets and to starboard we can 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.500
 see two very bright lights one brighter than the other 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.560
 it looks like a very very bright star and just below and another one that is not so 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.640
 sparkly 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.240
 just before midnight play here is transported by the cargo driver 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.749
 from New Zealand well it is high 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.739
 At the beginning of the flight no event is presented then at 2 and 5 of the 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.519
 tomorrow by bart and the crew of uss essex years of objects going towards 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.409
 them from the right side of the aircraft fogarty turns on his camera and starts to 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.519
 to film 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.510
 those two lights seemed to be traveling with us are still in 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.480
 the left wing rotates the brightest is still on 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.680
 the other and moved a little bit ahead of the other 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.020
 it is extremely bright brighter than any star in the sky 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.829
 the ground radar observed these objects and the control tower confirms 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:47.609
 the view 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.479
 I painted the conversation 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.639
 what follows is the actual audio of this rare and well-documented event 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.739
 strong pose that shows at 11 or 5 kilometers thanks there is no 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.849
 contact still 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.849
 just to the left of nine o'clock about three kilometers 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.730
 the captain statute 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.599
 r account that the object or target or was initially in front of him then 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.940
 He traveled at incredible speed and passed it on the left side 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.940
 quickly dea the plane to the left to make eye contact 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.439
 on the ground in welinton air traffic radios a message 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.959
 chilling for the captain 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.099
 they pick up another white on their left side and that is that they are getting close to the plane 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.310
 the white is at twelve o'clock at 5 km 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.909
 thanks to the picked up has a flashing light 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.980
 bitter now I'm looking to the right of the aircraft and we have a 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.379
 object confirmed by the vueling radar 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.159
 has been following us for a while it's about six kilometers and 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.639
 It looks like a star of David but suddenly emits a bright light and a 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.809
 defeat 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.819
 the captain is all is able to get close enough to determine 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.109
 that the object is a set of bright blue lights 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.359
 that twinkled a high speed 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.359
 to his astonishment the object had grown larger 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.499
 it was an interesting radar event where the object or some object approached 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.959
 so much to the aircraft that to try to wellington I found that the image of 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.800
 white on the radar of the aircraft had doubled its size still white 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.889
 strong just training with you 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.889
 white has doubled its size 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.149
 the object of double size continued to appear on the screens of the 

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.889
 radars for 36 seconds and then returned to normal size 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.950
 his delusion was right there this is the object that apparently was traveling 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.409
 next to the in a crypt was picked up on the radar of the aircraft the doctor 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.360
 guzmán road 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.520
 received a 16-millimeter copy of the UFO's filming in al Qosi 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.290
 directly from the television network of australia in 1979 meanwhile 4th anyone 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.360
 this complete and unedited statement had never been available to 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.820
 nobody before according to experts these images are the most evidence 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.090
 frightening and exhaustive UFO beds captured on a film 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.480
 this is the famous new zealand filming obtained the night of the 31st 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.800
 December 1978 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.909
 the cameraman was sitting in the seat between the pilot and the co-pilot 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.889
 the image according to life because he was wearing the camera on his shoulder they saw 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.729
 a light to his right and the light as time passed has been intense 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.389
 and that it was pursued had several forms this is the flickering light that you have to 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.270
 go down change it frame by frame to see what happened when it happens of a 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.180
 very bright white a gloomy orange of that image go aside and then 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.180
 the blow to the camera a bit to put it back in the center 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.090
 the other white man who has been following us was joined by others 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.009
 now we are at the point where we have three objects not identified to our 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:54.800
 right 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.119
 Following 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.300
 one of them has probably followed us for about 10 minutes 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.699
 I hope we've seen enough for tonight 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.669
 and for the rest of our journey back to my daughter there will be no 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:10.490
 event 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.490
 I think I've had enough UFOs for tonight 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.190
 He added that this way of acting alone 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.180
 Monday January 1, 1979 I am a voltor against whoever wishes it bs good 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.389
 nights
