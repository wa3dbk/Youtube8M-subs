00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.120
 You can either have an apple id 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.810
 In this video I show you the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 Operation on an iphone it works 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.039
 however just as well with an ipad or 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.350
 use an ipod touch in this case 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.060
 i an iphone 5 it with ios 7 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.670
 However, this works synonymous with devices 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.730
 with an older version of ios such as 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.530
 ios 5 or ios 6 first you have to do that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.480
 Open app store on your device 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 Here then type in the selection bar on 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.649
 bottom of screen on top charts 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.040

 tap on install 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.879
 you want to sign up with an apple id 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 or want to create a new apple id 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.809

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.520
 it is very important that we do this 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.840
 window about the download one for free 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.820
