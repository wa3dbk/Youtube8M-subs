that's obviously not Jade firecracker

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.999 
that's obviously not Jade firecracker
and<00:01:47.159> that's<00:01:47.310> igniter<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.619> maybe<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and that's igniter so maybe that's the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
and that's igniter so maybe that's the
signal<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.520> signifier<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.360> part<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
signal for a signifier that this part of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
signal for a signifier that this part of
the<00:01:51.840> website<00:01:52.049> isn't<00:01:52.560> ready<00:01:52.710> yet<00:01:53.960> publix<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the website isn't ready yet publix it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
the website isn't ready yet publix it
seems<00:01:55.619> maybe<00:01:55.920> there's<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.280> mistake<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.700> terms

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
seems maybe there's a mistake in terms

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
seems maybe there's a mistake in terms
of<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.930> publishing<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.310> information

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
watch this have interesting to see

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.440 
watch this have interesting to see
whether<00:02:18.890> we've<00:02:19.130> gotten<00:02:19.489> charges<00:02:19.849> as<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> star

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450

whether we've gotten charges as a star
strike<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.959> her<00:02:21.170> magic<00:02:21.890> moment<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.520> this

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
strike see her magic moment I think this

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.490 
strike see her magic moment I think this
is<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.360> light<00:02:23.569> core<00:02:23.780> video<00:02:24.020> for<00:02:24.319> star

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
is just the light core video for star

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.229 
is just the light core video for star
strike<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.040> not<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.310> enchanted<00:02:25.849> version

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
strike so it's not the enchanted version

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.270 
strike so it's not the enchanted version
what<00:02:26.569> we're<00:02:26.720> seeing<00:02:26.900> here<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:28.040> same

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
what we're seeing here is just the same

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.729 
what we're seeing here is just the same
as<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.670> normal<00:02:29.510> normal<00:02:29.989> star<00:02:30.319> strike<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:30.709> I

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
as a normal normal star strike but I

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.870 
as a normal normal star strike but I
should<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:31.010> there<00:02:31.160> will<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.370> separate

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
should think there will be a separate

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.090 
should think there will be a separate
magic<00:02:32.209> moment<00:02:32.540> video<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.530> they<00:02:33.620> will<00:02:33.739> upload

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
magic moment video that they will upload

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.070 
magic moment video that they will upload
into<00:02:34.640> course<00:02:34.940> when<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.420> figure<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.720> released

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
into course when that figure is released

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.500 
into course when that figure is released
and<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.800> think<00:02:37.010> later<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.640> year<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.120> here

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and we think later in the year so here

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.199 
and we think later in the year so here
we<00:02:38.569> are<00:02:38.600> on<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.110> bumble<00:02:39.530> blast<00:02:39.970> section<00:02:40.970> of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
again here if you pop down to the jolly

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.559 
again here if you pop down to the jolly

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
and so there is a figure though I

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.949 
and so there is a figure though I
presume<00:02:50.120> will<00:02:50.269> be<00:02:50.360> coming<00:02:50.630> out<00:02:50.720> near

presume will be coming out near
Christmas<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:52.310> seems<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.060> be<00:02:53.150> part<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.480> a

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
Christmas and seems to be part of a

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
Christmas and seems to be part of a
range<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.959> these<00:02:54.049> figures<00:02:54.290> who<00:02:54.380> are<00:02:54.440> looking

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
range of these figures who are looking

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.289 
range of these figures who are looking
out<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.069> video<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.760> will<00:02:55.850> be<00:02:55.910> coming

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
out in this video that will be coming

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.759 
out in this video that will be coming
through<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.870> seasons<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.200> really<00:02:57.410> like<00:02:57.620> that

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
through the seasons I really like that

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.170 
through the seasons I really like that
whether<00:02:58.040> they're<00:02:58.280> tying<00:02:58.580> these<00:02:58.850> different

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
whether they're tying these different

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.320 
whether they're tying these different
characters<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.950> different<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:02.090> different

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
characters to different to different

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.940 
characters to different to different
times<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.110> year<00:03:03.319> rather<00:03:03.560> than<00:03:03.709> just

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
times of the year rather than just

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.199 
times of the year rather than just
releasing<00:03:04.280> them<00:03:04.370> in<00:03:04.489> an<00:03:04.610> arbitrary<00:03:04.940> fashion

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
releasing them in an arbitrary fashion

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.900 
releasing them in an arbitrary fashion
having<00:03:06.170> them<00:03:06.290> sort<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.680> tied<00:03:06.950> in<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.580> different

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
variants coming through the year it's

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.880 
variants coming through the year it's
themed<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.080> they've<00:03:12.290> got<00:03:12.410> information<00:03:12.560> about

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
themed so they've got information about

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.140 
themed so they've got information about
them<00:03:13.130> that's<00:03:13.280> gonna<00:03:13.400> be<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.549> long<00:03:13.790> time<00:03:13.970> before

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
them that's gonna be a long time before

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.910 
them that's gonna be a long time before
we<00:03:14.269> see<00:03:14.299> those<00:03:14.569> in<00:03:14.750> stores<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.560> looks<00:03:15.799> like

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
we see those in stores and it looks like

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.680 
we see those in stores and it looks like
maybe<00:03:16.160> they<00:03:16.400> aren't<00:03:17.060> quite<00:03:17.150> ready<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.570> be

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
maybe they aren't quite ready to be

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.670
