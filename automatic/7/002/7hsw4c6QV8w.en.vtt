00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.159 
on to that I wonder how Cisco can allow
us<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.280> edit<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:09.849> proxies<00:04:10.419> and<00:04:10.599> then<00:04:10.719> send<00:04:11.019> our

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
us to edit on proxies and then send our

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.869 
us to edit on proxies and then send our
information<00:04:11.709> back<00:04:11.949> to<00:04:11.979> the<00:04:12.220> station<00:04:12.459> over

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
information back to the station over

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.939
