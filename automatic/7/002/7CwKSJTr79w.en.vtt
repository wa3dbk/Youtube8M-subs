00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello to you all 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.510
 inspiration in this video I want to do 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 see how to make a tattoo with 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.370
 the theme this time of harry potter and in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.199
 detail you will see that we will do the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.199
 symbol of the gifts of death 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.330
 therefore we need a mascara of 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.750
 those liquids like this then we need 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 dust as if it were the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.390
 talcum powder and lacquer if you already have it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.980
 saw did not make another video with the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 summit where I was instead that time 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.960
 it was a butterfly but now I'll show you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.620
 something different first of all 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.620
 so I leave by doing 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.399
 a triangle you see the nib and a lot 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
 end I have to take just a little 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.180
 color but not too much 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.170
 so as I said I do on 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 this on my wrist in my left hand 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.759
 and I leave by doing the triangle which is the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.830
 outside of the symbol and gifts of the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.030
 death 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.710
 if you have a little symbol in mind 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.710
 which is that of Lord Voldemort 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.210
 be careful that the three sides of the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.619
 triangle are the same and the same 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.619
 length then 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.440
 here it is 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.980
 then 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.490
 there is the circle in the middle 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.250
 let it dry a little bit and finally 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.200
 there is the last piece that is what 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.000
 colleague let's say the top of the triangle 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.049
 passing in a half circle 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.049
 this way you see 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.200
 here we are 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.080
 and now we let it all dry 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.209
 well 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.060
 here is this has been dried now 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.270
 put some talcum powder to dry 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.270
 still good and spal but a little bit 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:20.030
 once the part in the toilet is removed 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:22.069
 fourth then with the lac you see in 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.709
 this way and let it dry well 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.400
 I recommend you always with the lacquer 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.709
 at a safe distance and if you can 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.579
 written there to the side remove the part in 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.319
 excess I hope this video is there 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.930

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.280
