 HOBBIT Unexpected Journey 

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:10.284
 My dear Frodo. 

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:13.341
 He once told me ... 

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:16.397
 ... asked me if I told you all. 

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:19.912
 I sincerely tell you what I told you was true. 

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:23.260
 I may not have told you all. 

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:24.761
 Bilbo Baggins. 

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:28.775
 I'm on a journey and I'm looking for a companionship. 

00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:31.417
 I can't just get up and go to an unknown remote land. 

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:34.174
 - Get out of my baggy baggins! - Wait me! 

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:37.029
 Bilbo! I have some friends I'd like to introduce you to: 

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:39.241
 Fili, Kili, Fin ... 

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:41.697
 ... Glóin, Dwalin, Balin ... 

00:00:41.698 --> 00:00:43.402
 ... Bifur, Bofur, Bombur ... 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.471
 ... Dori, Nori, Ori ... 

00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:49.823
 ... and the leader of these comrades, Thorin Oaken. 

00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:57.906
 # Cold smoky mountains behind 

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:07.394
 # Deep dungeons and old caves 

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:17.235
 # The pines roar in high altitudes 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.985
 # Wind blows the wind at night 

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:35.547
 The fire is red, the flares 

00:01:35.994 --> 00:01:42.042
 # Trees shine like torches 

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.333
 - I can't reassure your well-being. - All right. 

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:48.272
 I don't take responsibility for your faith. 

00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:06.548
 When you get back to your village, you have a few stories to tell. 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.441
 Can you promise to be back? 

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:10.592
 Can not give. 

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:14.134
 You will not be the same person. 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.018
 HOBBIT Unexpected Journey 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.391
 My name is Bilbo Baggins. 

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:24.117
 Bagginsis ... What is Bagginsis? 

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:26.131
 My precious ... 

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:29.132
