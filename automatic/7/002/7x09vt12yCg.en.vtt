00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello how cute I am to feel good 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.900
 today 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.519
 I want to tell you my opinion about 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.130
 a hair coloring that I found 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:22.460
 I have a little gray hair in this part 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.840
 and in this part of my hair my hair is 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.789
 naturally coffee but when trying to 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.879
 cover gray hair 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.559
 I've been using more dyes 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:37.340
 dark 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.730
 because normally when I paint my hair 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.309
 either with a temporary dye of those 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.430
 that fall with shampoo or a dye 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.830
 permanent encounter that justly 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.140
 after 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.490
 apply the dye and wash my hair in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.370
 instead of having a gray patch 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.010
 white I have a patch 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.210
 orange hair 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.630
 reddish orange then well 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.720
 I treated a lot of products 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.800
 sometimes some of them covered 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.960
 the gray patch well during the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.360
 first two or three days and then with 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.540
 the hair washes began to 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.640
 appear that orange reddish color 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.450
 but I said good I've tried a lot 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.119
 dyes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.430
 I have to live with this truth until 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.000
 that a friend told me about this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 product that is called age you live on and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.909
 Virtual ex is a product that tells you 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.520
 that fights the five without signs of 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.539
 hair that is aging really 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.329
 then either because we use 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.689
 many dryer many chemicals 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.049
 or iron things like that the hair is going 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.799
 mistreating and it is representing those 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.289
 signs of aging such as 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.569
 brittle hair brittle hair 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:16.210
 hair like stiff lifeless truth 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:21.310
 so I decided to treat it 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.940
 and the truth is that I was amazed 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.060
 the dye completely covered all the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.390
 the gray hair that had all the gray hair 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.480
 they were completely covered not 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.410
 there were patches of reddish hair or 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.650
 orange was totally covered the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.420
 true hair then for me it was a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.450
 great surprise wait for a few 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.269
 two weeks of washing my hair and 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.220
 I'll be combing it and everything to see if 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.180
 there was some difference to see if it 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.980
 the dye began to fall as it had 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.130
 experienced with other dyes and which 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.840
 it was my surprise that the dye is not 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.540
 exactly the same 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.660
 obviously the hair is growing true and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.560
 it starts to look like a little bit of canada and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.840
 where we had it but the dye that is 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.019
 Adhered to the hair follows exactly 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.430
 the same then for me it was a great 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:27.099
 surprise and I loved the product is not 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.459
 It does not have such a strong smell like 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:34.540
 other products is soft to my hair 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.239
 It left the hair soft and silky with shine 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.349
 The truth is that I am very happy 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.900
 with this product and I recommend it from 0 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.049
 to 10 110 the product that has best 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.930
 worked for me I totally give it 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.930
 a 10 to this product explained 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.209
 I bought this product in a store 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.510
 where they sell equipment and materials for 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.689
 beauty salons 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.209
 so I do not know if they sell it in another 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.069
 but that's where I've been 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.530

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.019

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:20.310
