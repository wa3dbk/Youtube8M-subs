00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
doesn't justice to the Halo franchise um

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.510 
doesn't justice to the Halo franchise um
if<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.469> guys<00:00:34.620> didn't<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.370> love

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
if you guys didn't know I really love

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
if you guys didn't know I really love
the<00:00:35.610> snipers<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.210> automatically<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> went<00:00:37.469> for

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the snipers so automatically I went for

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.060 
the snipers so automatically I went for
the<00:00:37.649> sniper<00:00:37.940> um<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.750> thought<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.829> they<00:00:41.010> were

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the sniper um I thought that they were

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.260 
the sniper um I thought that they were
coming<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.460> live<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:41.940> didn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
coming up to live but they didn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.610 
coming up to live but they didn't
because<00:00:42.450> usually<00:00:42.780> when<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.379> sniper

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
because usually when you go for sniper

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.160 
because usually when you go for sniper
in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> beginning<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> game<00:00:44.870> they<00:00:45.870> throw

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
in the beginning of the game they throw

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.709 
in the beginning of the game they throw
grenades<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:46.829> run<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.270> was

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.020 
uh I would have to say the grenades are
pretty<00:02:36.410> effective<00:02:36.860> in<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.040> game<00:02:37.250> they're

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
pretty effective in this game they're

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.390 
pretty effective in this game they're
mostly<00:02:38.810> your<00:02:38.990> life<00:02:39.200> savers<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.130> tight

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
mostly your life savers in like a tight

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.340 
mostly your life savers in like a tight
situation<00:02:40.550> if<00:02:41.090> you're<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.930> shields

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
situation if you're like have shields

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.780 
situation if you're like have shields
and<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.650> up<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.800> guy<00:02:42.950> against<00:02:43.220> like<00:02:43.460> full

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and you go up a guy against like full

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.580 
and you go up a guy against like full
shields<00:02:44.000> using<00:02:44.510> grenades<00:02:44.630> would<00:02:45.020> be<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.350> is

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
shields using grenades would be like is

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.330 
shields using grenades would be like is
huge<00:02:46.400> if<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.820> place<00:02:47.060> grenades<00:02:47.570> perfectly

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
huge if you place grenades perfectly

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.130 
huge if you place grenades perfectly
it's<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.520> depend<00:02:49.850> on<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.570> factor<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.080> you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
it's in depend on the factor that you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.630 
it's in depend on the factor that you
don't<00:02:51.590> win<00:02:51.710> or<00:02:51.800> lose<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.530> see<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.920> things

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
don't win or lose and you see the things

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.360 
don't win or lose and you see the things
I<00:02:55.820> don't<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.060> about<00:02:56.150> halo<00:02:56.570> reach<00:02:57.220> let's<00:02:58.220> see

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
I don't like about halo reach let's see

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.060 
I don't like about halo reach let's see
here<00:02:58.610> oh<00:02:58.790> yeah<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> sniper<00:02:59.780> rifle<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.710> recoil

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
here oh yeah the sniper rifle the recoil

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.250 
here oh yeah the sniper rifle the recoil
the<00:03:01.490> little<00:03:01.760> radical<00:03:02.090> goes<00:03:02.510> big<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.960> don't<00:03:03.170> like

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the little radical goes big I don't like

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.070 
the little radical goes big I don't like
that<00:03:03.320> it's<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.370> once<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.390> shoot<00:03:05.540> once<00:03:05.780> it's

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
that it's a once you shoot once it's

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.510 
that it's a once you shoot once it's
kind<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.260> either<00:03:06.620> wait<00:03:06.770> until<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> radical

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
kind of either wait until it the radical

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.040 
kind of either wait until it the radical
get<00:03:07.670> smaller<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.180> then<00:03:08.360> shoot<00:03:08.540> again<00:03:08.750> you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
get smaller and then shoot again you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.470 
get smaller and then shoot again you
can't<00:03:09.260> really<00:03:09.350> do<00:03:09.500> a<00:03:09.530> rapid<00:03:09.800> shot<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.910> can<00:03:11.120> but

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
can't really do a rapid shot you can but

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.190 
can't really do a rapid shot you can but
it's<00:03:11.660> really<00:03:11.840> inaccurate<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.510> sniper

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
it's really inaccurate and but a sniper

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.860 
it's really inaccurate and but a sniper
I<00:03:15.320> would<00:03:15.500> say<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:16.420> pretty<00:03:17.420> cool<00:03:17.600> still

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
I would say is a pretty cool still

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.310 
I would say is a pretty cool still
though<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:19.459> pistol<00:03:19.850> another<00:03:20.120> hand<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.600> lot

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
though the pistol another hand a lot

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.920 
though the pistol another hand a lot
better<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:22.610> can<00:03:22.820> just<00:03:22.970> use<00:03:23.060> pistols<00:03:23.570> half<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
better you can just use pistols half the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.080 
better you can just use pistols half the
time<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.190> destroy<00:03:25.190> them<00:03:25.340> tryst<00:03:25.880> or<00:03:26.030> people

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
time and destroy them tryst or people

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.470 
time and destroy them tryst or people
the<00:03:29.090> AMR<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.340> kind<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.430> weak<00:03:31.640> added<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.300> say

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
the AMR is a kind of weak added to say

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.410 
the AMR is a kind of weak added to say
um<00:03:33.190> people<00:03:34.190> are<00:03:34.280> saying<00:03:34.489> no<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:35.060> not<00:03:35.239> wake

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
um people are saying no it's not wake

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.090 
um people are saying no it's not wake
you<00:03:35.600> just<00:03:35.810> gotta<00:03:35.959> wait<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.320> know<00:03:36.440> wait<00:03:36.770> shots

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
you just gotta wait you know wait shots

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.910 
you just gotta wait you know wait shots
Oh<00:03:37.370> in<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.090> air<00:03:38.209> beat<00:03:38.570> him<00:03:38.660> down<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:39.650> got<00:03:39.830> to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
Oh in the air beat him down you got to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.800 
Oh in the air beat him down you got to
wait<00:03:40.040> for<00:03:40.070> your<00:03:40.459> shots<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.970> know<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.150> your

wait for your shots you know to your

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.770 
wait for your shots you know to your
radical<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.290> go<00:03:42.410> down<00:03:42.560> again<00:03:42.800> well<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.780> don't

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
radical to go down again well I don't

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.050 
radical to go down again well I don't
like<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.550> don't<00:03:46.550> want<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.760> wait<00:03:46.940> when

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
like that I don't want to wait when

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.370 
like that I don't want to wait when
you're<00:03:47.239> somebody's<00:03:47.690> running<00:03:47.870> at<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.230> or

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
something you want to have you know fast

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.520 
something you want to have you know fast

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
shots you know that are accurate but

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.350 
shots you know that are accurate but
it's<00:03:55.370> alright<00:03:55.670> though<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:55.850> like<00:03:56.120> kind<00:03:56.270> of<00:03:56.300> like

yeah if you're going with up of opponent
that<00:04:08.900> has<00:04:09.050> a<00:04:09.080> mr<00:04:09.530> if<00:04:09.740> you're<00:04:10.550> really<00:04:10.940> good<00:04:11.210> at

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
that has a mr if you're really good at

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.090 
that has a mr if you're really good at
using<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:12.470> know<00:04:13.450> like<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.570> radical<00:04:15.010> do<00:04:16.010> you

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
using you know like the radical do you

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.979 
using you know like the radical do you
like<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.370> know<00:04:16.459> view<00:04:16.730> don't<00:04:17.060> shoot<00:04:17.570> real<00:04:17.750> fast

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
like you know view don't shoot real fast
