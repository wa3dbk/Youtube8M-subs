00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.610
 we are doing a test 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.029
 in the video and the duration 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.330
 in my house 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.089
 what do you think of them? 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.510
 this is the entrance to the house 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.699
 the map comes out like me 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 It is very close here to the river front 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.489
 wooded 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.489
 I find that it is good 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.650
 who has a little passion 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.320
 we're 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.350
 I got a little video 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.440
 as it loads the entire contour 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.040
 It is generated 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.110
 this little house but good 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.160
 it's like at the beginning when I cook bros 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.680
 a space where there is still a pool of 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.930
 water in the background there is a crockery that you 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.020
 you get in and appear in the escape 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.020
 emergency 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.500
 inside the house 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.490
 from the bedroom 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.490
 well extensive 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.200
 a fire wine box box that what 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.510
 I found good novelty 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.140
 here on this side we have some mannequins 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.370
 that are made with 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.070
 Roman armor that here is the 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.960
 another light 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.150
 perspective weapons 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.650
 well they are pretty good armor not the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 better but very nice 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.220
 the capes this of these monkeys came 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.710
 with a layer and that layer I put it here 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.850
 to my character 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.330
 that is right here and impeccable to be 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.330
 here with him 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.060
 she liked already had very nice 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.370
 and I still do not want to remove it even in 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.879
 a better story 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.879
 after 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.740
 in this case 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.019
 mannequins 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.450
 Here exhibitors to give more real 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.450
 equal walls for a shield and weapons 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.840
 and I'm filling them with advocates 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.910
 hard templars I here I have 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.670
 put other pieces for them 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.340
 because the armor came only 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.140
 the black background which is a mode 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.870
 as well 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.530
 Templar white armor 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.530
 of the elves 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.770
 and on this side 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.629
 collect 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.140
 the books you have to have a library 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.140
 all because the truth 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.840
 up here to save 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.400
 we move when it is always 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.720
 I'm running, I'm doing all radio 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.100
 in this place by dry 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.550
 so you can see they have 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.310
 everything here 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.819
 but 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.480
 repairs to create armors 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.319
 get rid of the weapons 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.610
 to melt metal 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.920
 in huge amount of 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.519
 of chests to keep in order if 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.930
 they want the minerals 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.930

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.990
 a capacity of 20 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.730
 9000 gold that's pretty good 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.470
 usually one whenever I do 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.460
 things else when it goes among the others and 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.680
 you have to be looking from one side to another 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.080
 several sellers here there are more chests 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.110
 a huge amount of chests like 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.010
 can see 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.010

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.110
 the map I realized that there is a part 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.110
 I had not discovered 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.529
 how do you treat yourself safely 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.280
 a hidden place 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.280
 for those players who 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:57.890
 night there is a small sanctuary 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.890
