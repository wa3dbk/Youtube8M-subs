 Then I will introduce the model of cheap video camera g 2 to introduce this time 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.760

 It means that recording is possible with full high definition of 5 million pixels 1080 pixels 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.110
 It looks like it has a waterproof function up to 10m deep 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.890
 Well then I would like to open it 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.670

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.860
 After usb cable 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.860
 It is the foundation to attach the rear camera and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.090
