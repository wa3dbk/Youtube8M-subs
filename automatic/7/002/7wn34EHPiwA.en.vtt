00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.299
 we present you the new tomtom rider 400 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.769
 the gps of the dutch brand thought 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.119
 for engine the first thing we see 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.430
 different from the previous 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.560
 model is the size of the screen that 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.750
 happens to be 4.3 inches in format 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.149
 larger panoramic easier to read 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.099
 and easier to handle is also more 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.480
 Slim and more comfortable to transport your 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.880
 construction as the previous 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.860
 model is very robust designed for 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.900
 resist long trips to the interpreter in 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.550
 the lower part of the gps we are 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.680
 two trap doors where we will find the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.540
 microsd card slot and the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.640
 microusb connection with which we can 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.380
 connect it to the computer or load it into your 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 back we see the anchor for the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.530
 specific support of the handlebar and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.270
 contacts through which 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.610
 will charge once it is installed in our 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.110
 motorcycle the power button as always 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.150
 is located at the top of the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.980
 gps but let's leave the parties more 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.350
 techniques and we go to see your installation 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.510
 in operation in the tomtom box 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.670
 rider 400 we will find what is necessary 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 to install the gps on almost any 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.799
 motorcycle market 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 You will have different accessories for 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.400
 more or less thin handlebars 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.810
 the first thing is to mount the support with the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.770
 screws included and allen key 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.750
 also included in the pack 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.219
 the ball joint can be assembled from the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.140
 start or wait to have installed the 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.759
 handlebar mount to mount the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.530
 handlebar support in our case 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.079
 we have used rubber that exerts pressure 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.210
 on the same handlebar the threads on the 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.189
 tube the enclosures with the metal umh 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 which includes the pac and screws it together 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.270
 with the base of the kneecap 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.640
 Y 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.770
 to be able to lend it, you will need a 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.520
 key not included as with hands 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.520
 it is totally impossible 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.590
 once tight, I checked that 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.420
 does not move the support we will put the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.640
 trims to cover and protect the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.410
 water threads the following in the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.900
 Thread the support on the kneecap and 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.920
 face it does your driving position 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.660
 make sure it's tight 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.310
 you will see that there is a cable that comes out of the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.720
 support this cable is what you have to 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.280
 connect to the motorcycle battery 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.110
 we have not installed it at 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.700
 treat yourself a test gps that we had 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.010
 to return but the advisable thing is 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.420
 install it so you make sure that the gps 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.710
 it does not run out of battery during its 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.660
 journey 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.370
 now we just need to clear your gps to 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.840
 support and finish adjusting it so that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.840
 the visibility is perfect 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.640
 as you can see the gps is very good 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.140
 integrated and nothing bothers the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.819
 driving to vision from the point of 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.980
 pilotage 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.329
 now that we have it installed we are going 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.470
 to try it on the bike which is what 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.240
 we are interested 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.770
 just like the previous version the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.360
 screen is ready to be used with 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.100
 gloves something fundamental for the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.630
 bikers when creating our 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.640
 route we will have several options 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.560
 typical that have the car gps and 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.050
 others specific for bikers that 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.090
 Include a round trip route 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.130
 with more or less curves route by port 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.600
 of mountain or flat and a super 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.090
 interesting that is the one that we are going to try 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.740
 now that is the vibrant route this 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.420
 option creates a route with the road 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.760
 with more curves that you have you stay where 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.100
 you are and of the place that Tuesday we are going to see 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.690
 that also before this route and 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.040
 we have marked the route but before 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.690
 we have to get to the roads 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.459
 twist for it we will go pro 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.930
 fast and we will take advantage to explain 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.730
 more features 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.739
 to start commenting that this version 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.810
 includes maps of europe and notice of 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.250
 life-time upgradeable fixed radars 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.780
 It has bluetooth with which 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.310
 we can receive the instructions of 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.810
 audio through our communicator 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.540
 Bluetooth or receive and answer calls 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.370
 of your mobile the design as we have 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.989
 commented previously is thought 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.909
 to be able to withstand the inclemencies that 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.370
 we find ourselves fortunately during 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.319
 the test made us a splendid sun 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.909
 during the test we were able to check 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.950
 that the screen looks perfectly 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.569
 even in conditions of a lot of sun that does not 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.360
 they bother nothing at the time of circulating and 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.129
 which is very useful another of the novelties is 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.319
 the possibility of putting our gps in 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.849
 horizontal or vertical will depend a bit 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.629
 how it is on your bike that your 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.340
 preferences 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.680
 be it as a new option that 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.440
 will please more than one other of the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.690
 features that this gps contains is 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.370
 the possibility to record your route you can 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.590
 go on roads you did not know 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.970
 record it and then memorize this route 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.470
 to do it again in any 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.959
 moment it's time to go back to the office 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.760
 we mark the route again this time more 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.380
 quiet and fast roads although that 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.180
 yes we are in the mountains and you have to go down 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.789
 from her by a series of curves a 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.289
 real pity that a note we can 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.449
 buy a specific support with the 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.669
 which you can use your raid 400 in the 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.389
 dashboard of your car 2 in a car and 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.389
 motorcycle who gives more
