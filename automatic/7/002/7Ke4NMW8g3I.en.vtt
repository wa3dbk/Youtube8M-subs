a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> inspiration<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.310> had<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> clear

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
a lot of inspiration so I had a clear

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.990 
a lot of inspiration so I had a clear
image<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> wanted<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:22.920> new<00:01:23.159> personal

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
style to look like and then I basically

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.420 
style to look like and then I basically
grid<00:01:27.250> or<00:01:27.520> put<00:01:27.880> away<00:01:28.050> everything<00:01:29.050> that<00:01:29.430> didn't

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
grid or put away everything that didn't

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.670

maybe<00:01:56.800> pile<00:01:57.310> until<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:58.030> know<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.840> have<00:01:59.050> made

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
the right decisions and I feel like the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.820 
the right decisions and I feel like the
only<00:02:01.330> thing<00:02:01.660> that's<00:02:01.869> actually<00:02:02.289> holding<00:02:02.470> me

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
only thing that's actually holding me

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.550 
only thing that's actually holding me
back<00:02:03.039> is<00:02:03.509> knowing<00:02:04.509> what<00:02:04.930> everything<00:02:05.410> has

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
back is knowing what everything has

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.230 
back is knowing what everything has
caused<00:02:05.890> me<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.399> how<00:02:06.580> much<00:02:06.820> I'll<00:02:07.030> actually

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
caused me and how much I'll actually

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.229 
caused me and how much I'll actually
lose<00:02:07.810> by<00:02:08.140> throwing<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.739> away<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.580> by<00:02:09.789> thinking

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
lose by throwing it away but by thinking

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.150 
lose by throwing it away but by thinking
like<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.570> I've<00:02:10.869> only<00:02:11.200> actually<00:02:11.560> gave<00:02:11.920> myself

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
like that I've only actually gave myself

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.180 
like that I've only actually gave myself
a<00:02:12.489> big<00:02:12.910> disfavor<00:02:13.750> because<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:14.769> not<00:02:14.890> only

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190
