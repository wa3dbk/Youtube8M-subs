 the city of levis offered the title of this law the situation is bigger 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.599
 that me is to monitor it is situations that are all 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.369
 stakeholders themselves 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:11.539
 our milky way 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.099
 the last time I take the metro is not everyone knew 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.269
 already and his water tower 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.220

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.160
 white laurent 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.570
 who makes the quality of the debate like everyone else 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.360
 when people have a little lose weight the only arrival you have a little bit of 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.360
 currency you give you do not give the beam 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.710
 the mail 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.990
 donges 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 everyone is waiting for the people I 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.980
 everyone goes up the blog 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 at the moment it will do but by 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.620
 like ridicule in the agglo 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 I pay him 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.250
 he said that 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.250
 already I'm not saying hello 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.570

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.050
 here 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.050
 to what tends the left arm of the tiber tour 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.030
 by the way tonight if you knew all kinds 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.520
 it arranged times a day 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.230
 for us what we did 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 so i think henry yet left to succeed 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.930
 while the job has apparently chosen to send its say 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 quickly yet I am convinced 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.880
 the evening is going around the world body no this record concluded 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 therefore available 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.550
 in 10% 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.540
 to say the same 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 gentleman 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.100
 crescendo like it does not do that that I see it sometimes we did it 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.719
 Syria 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.799
 arrival at the end of the month at the earliest 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.079
 either the story is already working in progress 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.289
 couach yachts 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.499
 this type of decision you do not want to compare me to him 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.029
 the study conducted by the animation team 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:34.029
 see 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.029
 even worse 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.489
 m 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.739
 for the time being 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.079
 highlight of the evening 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.449
 if m 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:55.189
 Washington 12 - Bordeaux do not need that for that 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.179
 his first intention 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.179
 why did he declare 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.050
 partially censoring his return on the stock market during the trial 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.010
 the society 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.129
 it means keeping players short of time for this 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.859
 Why 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.929
 Why 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.119
 for the considerable weight 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.519
 gone to play the draw
