know bears animals all the wildlife
what's<00:03:04.610> gonna<00:03:04.790> happen<00:03:05.209> if<00:03:05.390> this<00:03:05.750> happens<00:03:06.170> you

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
what's gonna happen if this happens you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.470 
what's gonna happen if this happens you
know<00:03:06.950> I'm<00:03:07.400> not<00:03:07.550> too<00:03:07.730> worried<00:03:08.030> about<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.239> lot<00:03:08.420> of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
know I'm not too worried about a lot of

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.320 
know I'm not too worried about a lot of
those<00:03:08.660> challenges<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.530> think<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:11.030> greatest

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
those challenges I think the greatest

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.470 
those challenges I think the greatest
challenge<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.680> trail<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.269> that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
challenge of this trail is to have that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.949 
challenge of this trail is to have that
longevity<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:16.549> know<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.819> mental<00:03:17.269> aptitude

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
longevity you know the mental aptitude

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.039 
longevity you know the mental aptitude
to<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.680> able<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:19.599> struggle<00:03:20.599> through<00:03:20.629> the<00:03:20.840> hard

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
to be able to struggle through the hard

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.470 
to be able to struggle through the hard
times<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:22.250> need<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.730> enjoy<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.299> great

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
times and you need to enjoy the great

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.870 
times and you need to enjoy the great
times<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.080> realize<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.250> they're<00:03:25.400> there<00:03:25.580> I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
times and realize that they're there I

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.970 
times and realize that they're there I
think<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.329> big<00:03:26.540> challenge<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.380> going<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.799> be

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
think a big challenge is going to be

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.580 
think a big challenge is going to be
that<00:03:28.819> soreness<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.569> you<00:03:29.959> wake<00:03:30.140> up<00:03:30.170> with

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that soreness that you wake up with

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.960 
that soreness that you wake up with
every<00:03:30.920> day<00:03:31.069> you're<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:31.400> staying<00:03:31.700> healthy

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
every day you're not staying healthy

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.729 
every day you're not staying healthy
through<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.510> trail<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.930> pretty<00:03:33.500> difficult

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
through the trail is pretty difficult

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.460 
through the trail is pretty difficult
sometimes<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.730> me<00:03:35.390> even<00:03:35.599> in<00:03:35.720> training<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.260> had<00:03:36.290> a

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
sometimes I me even in training I had a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.819 
sometimes I me even in training I had a
minor<00:03:37.220> injury<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.989> know<00:03:39.110> just<00:03:39.349> training<00:03:39.680> I

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
minor injury you know just training I

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.539 
minor injury you know just training I
having<00:03:40.459> those<00:03:40.610> creature<00:03:41.090> comforts<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:42.470> life

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
having those creature comforts of life

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.670 
having those creature comforts of life
getting<00:03:43.549> used<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.970> sleeping<00:03:44.120> outside<00:03:44.680> of

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
getting used to sleeping outside of

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.520 
getting used to sleeping outside of
County<00:03:46.099> a<00:03:46.160> big<00:03:46.340> challenge<00:03:46.549> to

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.650 

I<00:03:52.640> think<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.730> trail<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.330> make<00:03:54.480> me<00:03:54.630> a

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
I think the trail is going to make me a

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.170 
I think the trail is going to make me a
more<00:03:54.870> disciplined<00:03:55.080> person<00:03:55.700> more<00:03:56.700> than<00:03:56.730> likely

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
more disciplined person more than likely

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.150 
more disciplined person more than likely
make<00:03:57.600> me<00:03:57.810> more<00:03:57.959> patient<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.680> trials<00:03:59.010> might

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
make me more patient the trials might

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.020 
make me more patient the trials might
have<00:03:59.370> changed<00:03:59.550> my<00:03:59.819> life<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.480> think<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:02.220> making

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
have changed my life I think and making

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.620 
have changed my life I think and making
me<00:04:03.470> more<00:04:04.470> instinctual<00:04:05.100> as<00:04:05.430> person<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.450> not

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
me more instinctual as person to not

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.500 
me more instinctual as person to not
worry<00:04:06.959> as<00:04:07.200> much<00:04:07.670> enjoy<00:04:08.670> life<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.150> bit

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
worry as much enjoy life a little bit

worry as much enjoy life a little bit
more<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.290> not<00:04:10.470> be<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.739> serious<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.489> time

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
more and not be as serious all the time

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.790 
more and not be as serious all the time
I'm<00:04:13.000> probably<00:04:13.240> a<00:04:13.480> lot<00:04:13.690> healthier<00:04:13.990> when<00:04:14.710> i'm

I'm probably a lot healthier when i'm
done<00:04:14.980> with<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.190> trail<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.760> think<00:04:16.000> overall<00:04:16.299> it's
