supposedly this game had a very long

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
development cycle but I really fail to

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.250 
development cycle but I really fail to
see<00:05:27.950> why<00:05:28.180> sure<00:05:29.180> most<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:29.810> was<00:05:29.990> probably

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
see why sure most of that was probably

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.080 
see why sure most of that was probably
spent<00:05:30.680> developing<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.340> actual<00:05:31.640> engine<00:05:32.000> the

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.689 
main game recycles content and makes you
go<00:06:15.900> back<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.110> places<00:06:16.620> many<00:06:16.860> many<00:06:17.070> times<00:06:17.370> and
