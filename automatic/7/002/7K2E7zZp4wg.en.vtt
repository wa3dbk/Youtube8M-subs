talk about each individual piece because

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.190 
talk about each individual piece because
that<00:00:39.850> took<00:00:40.240> forever<00:00:40.390> because<00:00:40.750> I<00:00:40.840> just<00:00:41.020> did

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
that took forever because I just did

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.060 
that took forever because I just did
that<00:00:41.380> video<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.570> was<00:00:43.870> like<00:00:44.110> seven<00:00:44.890> minutes

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
that video and it was like seven minutes

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.680 
that video and it was like seven minutes
long<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:45.610> I<00:00:45.730> really<00:00:46.120> don't<00:00:46.180> want<00:00:46.360> it<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.510> take

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
long so I really don't want it to take

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.010 
long so I really don't want it to take
that<00:00:46.840> much<00:00:47.020> time<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.850> when<00:00:49.480> I<00:00:49.510> see<00:00:49.750> Katie

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020
