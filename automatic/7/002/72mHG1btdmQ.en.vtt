00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.080
 shape animation shape animation this view 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.630
 computer animation which 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.780
 is to automatically generate 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 frames by reshaping 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.539
 object we note that the form animation is not 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.590
 applicable to characters 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.099
 as well as grouped object 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.019
 consider the transformation example 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.170
 circle star being in the first frame 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:40.520
 single layer with the tool 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:44.239
 oval draw circle selected 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.239
 appropriate fill 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:01.790
 select 24 frames and convert it to 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:06.790
 key with filling f6 being 2 what 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:10.280
 there frames remove the picture and in its place 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.450
 create a star drawing with 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.540
 tool options polygon 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:23.950
 setting the value of star number of vertices 5 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.950
 change color 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.770
 on red 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.500
 select the intermediate frame 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.880
 and on the property panel, select the twin form 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.430
 light green backlight and arrow from 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.640
 first frame twenty-fourth 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.409
 says intermediate frames 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.190
 generated that is our animation 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.480
 forms passed successfully 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.100
 let's review the phase sequence 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 animations moving the frame pointer along 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.040
 time scale notice what happens 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.269
 smooth change only form but 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.110
 colors let's test the animation which 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.110
 enter 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.160
 can add multiple frames by pressing 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.380
 f5 keys 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.850
 bring the number of cats to 40 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.850
 test the animation
