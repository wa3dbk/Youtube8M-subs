of<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.130> quick<00:04:50.370> shifter<00:04:50.550> right<00:04:50.940> now<00:04:51.090> for<00:04:51.270> you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
of the quick shifter right now for you

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.590 
of the quick shifter right now for you
guys<00:04:51.980> alright<00:04:52.980> so<00:04:53.820> I'm<00:04:53.970> in<00:04:54.000> first<00:04:54.420> gear

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
guys alright so I'm in first gear

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.290 
guys alright so I'm in first gear
rolling<00:04:55.020> right<00:04:55.310> in<00:04:56.310> low<00:04:56.580> rpms<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.150> can

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
rolling right in low rpms you can

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.760 
rolling right in low rpms you can
actually<00:04:57.450> shift<00:04:57.870> from<00:04:58.080> first<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.440> second

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
actually shift from first to second

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.830 
actually shift from first to second
using<00:04:58.920> the<00:04:59.130> quick<00:04:59.310> shifter<00:04:59.460> there<00:05:00.390> we<00:05:00.510> go

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
using the quick shifter there we go

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.290 
using the quick shifter there we go
and<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.980> handle<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.490> clutch<00:05:02.820> accelerator

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
and the handle of the clutch accelerator

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.429 
and the handle of the clutch accelerator
pin<00:05:04.020> now<00:05:04.340> second<00:05:05.340> gear<00:05:05.520> third

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:07.439 
pin now second gear third

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.240 
pin now second gear third
for<00:05:08.179> fish<00:05:09.409> and<00:05:10.409> six

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
for fish and six

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.290 
for fish and six
it's<00:05:12.760> as<00:05:12.910> simple<00:05:13.060> as<00:05:13.330> that

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
it's as simple as that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.510 
it's as simple as that
and<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.930> doesn't<00:05:16.110> matter<00:05:16.380> what<00:05:16.620> RPM<00:05:17.039> you<00:05:17.250> are

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
and it doesn't matter what RPM you are

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.420 
and it doesn't matter what RPM you are
you<00:05:19.030> could<00:05:19.270> be<00:05:19.419> like<00:05:19.569> absolutely<00:05:19.780> cruising

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.470 

second<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.360> know<00:05:24.510> right<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:25.380> I'm<00:05:26.160> at<00:05:26.480> 5,000

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
second you know right and I'm at 5,000

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.540 
second you know right and I'm at 5,000
rpm<00:05:27.780> still<00:05:28.320> shifting<00:05:29.120> 4000<00:05:30.120> still<00:05:30.660> shifting

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
rpm still shifting 4000 still shifting

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.740 
rpm still shifting 4000 still shifting
still<00:05:32.550> 4,000<00:05:33.090> shifting<00:05:33.480> tianhao<00:05:34.370> shifting

still 4,000 shifting tianhao shifting

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.600 
still 4,000 shifting tianhao shifting
see<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:37.320> generally<00:05:37.950> make<00:05:38.100> any<00:05:38.250> difference

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
see you generally make any difference

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.840 
see you generally make any difference
because<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.840> pizzazz<00:05:40.170> quick<00:05:40.410> shifter<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:41.010> not

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
because the pizzazz quick shifter is not

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.320 
because the pizzazz quick shifter is not
rpm<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.510> it<00:05:43.440> is<00:05:43.830> based<00:05:44.220> on<00:05:44.610> engine<00:05:45.120> cutoff

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
rpm this it is based on engine cutoff

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.510 
rpm this it is based on engine cutoff
time<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:45.960> basically<00:05:46.080> when<00:05:46.650> you<00:05:46.890> get<00:05:47.220> a<00:05:47.280> quick

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
time so basically when you get a quick

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.090 
time so basically when you get a quick
shifter<00:05:47.880> you<00:05:48.210> need<00:05:48.390> to<00:05:48.510> program<00:05:48.890> what<00:05:49.890> needs

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
shifter you need to program what needs

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.380 
shifter you need to program what needs
to<00:05:50.190> be<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.430> engine<00:05:50.700> cutoff<00:05:50.910> time<00:05:51.210> between

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
to be the engine cutoff time between

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.310 
to be the engine cutoff time between
each<00:05:51.750> shift<00:05:53.120> so<00:05:54.120> when<00:05:54.570> you<00:05:54.660> prime<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.140> quick

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
each shift so when you prime the quick

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.350 
each shift so when you prime the quick
shifter<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.800> has<00:05:55.950> a<00:05:55.980> sensor<00:05:56.340> inside<00:05:56.520> which<00:05:57.210> you

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
shifter it has a sensor inside which you

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.950 
shifter it has a sensor inside which you
know<00:05:57.480> that<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:57.900> is<00:05:58.380> about<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.920> be<00:05:59.040> shifted

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
know that it is about to be shifted

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960 
know that it is about to be shifted
and<00:06:01.080> that's<00:06:01.620> when<00:06:02.009> it<00:06:02.130> cuts<00:06:02.370> off<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.580> engine

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
and that's when it cuts off the engine

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.420 
and that's when it cuts off the engine
for<00:06:03.180> like<00:06:03.360> 50<00:06:03.750> m/s<00:06:04.020> for<00:06:04.500> EMS<00:06:04.860> know

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
for like 50 m/s for EMS know

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.119 
for like 50 m/s for EMS know
milliseconds<00:06:06.270> at<00:06:06.360> a<00:06:06.389> time

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.350 

and<00:06:09.249> yep<00:06:10.179> that's<00:06:10.779> what<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.529> then<00:06:12.360> balancing

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
and yep that's what and then balancing

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.180 
and yep that's what and then balancing
it<00:06:13.959> shifts

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.890 

sometimes<00:06:18.190> you<00:06:18.610> can<00:06:18.940> end<00:06:19.240> up<00:06:19.360> getting<00:06:19.419> miss

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
sometimes you can end up getting miss

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.249 
sometimes you can end up getting miss
shifts<00:06:20.409> but<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:22.060> only<00:06:22.509> depends<00:06:22.960> on<00:06:23.050> how

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.259 
shifts but that only depends on how

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.390 
shifts but that only depends on how
loose<00:06:23.590> your<00:06:23.830> chain<00:06:24.069> is<00:06:24.430> or<00:06:25.949> how<00:06:26.949> loose<00:06:27.190> your

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
loose your chain is or how loose your

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.270 
loose your chain is or how loose your
clutch<00:06:27.639> is<00:06:27.960> if<00:06:28.960> these<00:06:29.440> two<00:06:29.680> settings<00:06:29.919> are<00:06:30.250> a

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
clutch is if these two settings are a

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.029 
clutch is if these two settings are a
little<00:06:30.550> bit<00:06:30.789> off<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.539> can<00:06:31.990> get<00:06:32.289> my<00:06:32.560> shifts<00:06:32.919> in

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
little bit off you can get my shifts in

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.879 
little bit off you can get my shifts in
the<00:06:33.159> dollar<00:06:33.400> gears<00:06:33.840> but<00:06:34.840> from<00:06:35.379> second<00:06:35.860> to

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
the dollar gears but from second to

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.619 
the dollar gears but from second to
fourth<00:06:36.220> or<00:06:36.490> second<00:06:36.759> to<00:06:36.879> fifth<00:06:37.030> it's<00:06:37.270> for<00:06:37.599> a

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:37.629 
fourth or second to fifth it's for a

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:42.510 
fourth or second to fifth it's for a
smoother<00:06:37.930> 8:56<00:06:38.710> some<00:06:38.949> time<00:06:39.159> can<00:06:39.370> be<00:06:39.490> realistic

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.500 

if<00:06:42.789> that<00:06:43.270> it's<00:06:43.569> it's<00:06:44.130> intricately

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
if that it's it's intricately
