00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
part of the cube so that's very very

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.559 
part of the cube so that's very very
interesting<00:02:59.780> here<00:03:00.970> I'm<00:03:01.970> not<00:03:02.209> going<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.450> try

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
interesting here I'm not going to try

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.880 
interesting here I'm not going to try
and<00:03:02.660> speed<00:03:03.050> solve<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.440> right<00:03:03.470> now<00:03:03.830> because<00:03:04.640> I

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
and speed solve it right now because I

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.470 
and speed solve it right now because I
don't<00:03:06.890> know<00:03:07.010> I'm<00:03:07.190> just<00:03:07.250> not<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.150> mood<00:03:08.180> to
