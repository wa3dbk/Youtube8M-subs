00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
traditional screen printing there's

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.790 
traditional screen printing there's
fabrics<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:08.910> are<00:00:09.269> sold<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.349> purpose

for them and they're kind of these

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.090 
for them and they're kind of these
special<00:00:18.960> fabrics<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.560> used<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:19.859> screen

special fabrics that are used for screen
printing<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.609> know<00:00:20.699> they're<00:00:20.910> either<00:00:21.060> silk<00:00:21.449> or

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
printing you know they're either silk or

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.179 
printing you know they're either silk or
synthetic<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.410> there's<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.130> different

ones<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:24.170> for<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.260> method<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
ones you can get for this method you

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.320 
ones you can get for this method you
don't<00:00:26.010> really<00:00:26.130> even<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.240> those

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
don't really even need to look for those

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060 
don't really even need to look for those
fabrics<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.199> know<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.830> fabric

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
fabrics you know you can go to a fabric

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.689 
fabrics you know you can go to a fabric
store

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
store

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.250 
store
and<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> look<00:00:30.599> around<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.080> see

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
and just kind of look around and see

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.580 
and just kind of look around and see
what<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:32.450> there<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.320> almost

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
what they have there are you will almost

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.990 
what they have there are you will almost
certainly<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.219> able<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> find<00:00:35.670> several

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
certainly be able to find several

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.790 
certainly be able to find several
fabrics<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> fabric<00:00:37.170> store<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.649> use

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
fabrics in a fabric store you can use

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.190 
fabrics in a fabric store you can use
for<00:00:37.980> screen<00:00:38.250> printing<00:00:38.510> now<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> properties

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
for screen printing now the properties

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.549 
for screen printing now the properties
you<00:00:40.410> want<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:41.000> first<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.379> want

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you want are first of all you you want

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
you want are first of all you you want
it<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.070> thin<00:00:44.550> okay<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> want

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it to be pretty thin okay and you want

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690 
it to be pretty thin okay and you want
it<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.260> fairly<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.980> mean<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.550> this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it to be fairly I mean you can see this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
it to be fairly I mean you can see this
is<00:00:47.850> sort<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.180> almost<00:00:48.739> transparent

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
is sort of like almost transparent

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.490 
is sort of like almost transparent
almost<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.460> mean<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.050> mean<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> think

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
almost I mean you know I mean I think

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.810 
almost I mean you know I mean I think
sort<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> see-through<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> that's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
sort of see-through it and that's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600 
sort of see-through it and that's
because<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.539> woven<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> fairly<00:00:56.309> thin

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
because it's woven out of fairly thin

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.560 
because it's woven out of fairly thin
threads<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.500> look<00:00:58.710> closely<00:00:59.570> there's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
threads and if I look closely there's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.299 
threads and if I look closely there's
actually<00:01:01.109> some<00:01:01.320> spacing<00:01:01.890> between<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
actually some spacing between the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.039 
actually some spacing between the
threads<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> mean<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
threads right and what I mean by that is

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
threads right and what I mean by that is
if<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.589> look<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> fabric<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.909> know<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
if you look at a fabric like you know a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.780 
if you look at a fabric like you know a
cotton<00:01:06.630> knit<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.320> my<00:01:07.470> t-shirts<00:01:07.890> made<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
cotton knit like my t-shirts made of you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.969 
cotton knit like my t-shirts made of you
can't<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.320> holes<00:01:10.530> in

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
can't really see through the holes in

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
can't really see through the holes in
the<00:01:11.250> threads<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.939> more<00:01:12.540> than<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> mean<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the threads and more than that I mean it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
the threads and more than that I mean it
has<00:01:13.439> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> complex<00:01:14.220> knit<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.060> it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
has kind of a complex knit to it so it's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
has kind of a complex knit to it so it's
not<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.360> built<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> way<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.290> fabric<00:01:16.979> like

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
not really built that way a fabric like

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.880 
not really built that way a fabric like
this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.509> very<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.320> simple

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this is really just a very very simple

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.450 
this is really just a very very simple
you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.790> kind<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> grid<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.810> threads<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.590> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you know kind of grid of threads and you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.160 
you know kind of grid of threads and you
can<00:01:23.640> there's<00:01:23.970> holes<00:01:24.270> between<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.900> okay<00:01:25.380> so

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
can there's holes between them okay so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.240 
can there's holes between them okay so
so<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> basically<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.159> you're

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so that's kind of basically what you're

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
so that's kind of basically what you're
looking<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.360> size<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> holes<00:01:31.350> in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
looking for now the size of the holes in

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.609 
looking for now the size of the holes in
the<00:01:31.860> fabric<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> determine<00:01:33.619> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the fabric are going to determine the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.370 
the fabric are going to determine the
detail<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:35.909> image<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.259> if

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
detail that you get in your image so if

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
detail that you get in your image so if
you<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:37.950> small<00:01:38.460> holes

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759

of larger holes in it you get a much

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.030 
of larger holes in it you get a much
kind<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> rougher<00:01:45.299> image<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.979> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
maybe like the hems of dresses and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.660 
maybe like the hems of dresses and
skirts<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.950> what<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.070> would<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.370> look<00:02:29.550> around

and find something it kind of doesn't

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.980 
and find something it kind of doesn't
matter<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.790> color<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.540> mean<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> like

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
matter what color it is I mean I like

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.600 
matter what color it is I mean I like
white<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.830> easier<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.130> trace<00:02:35.430> your

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
white because it's easier to trace your

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.010 
white because it's easier to trace your
image<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.180> probably<00:02:36.450> want<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.630> get<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.780> light

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
image you probably want to get a light

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.479 
image you probably want to get a light
color<00:02:37.350> because<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.100> you're<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.400> be

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
color because if you're going to be

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.059 
color because if you're going to be
tracing<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:38.940> image<00:02:39.180> onto<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.620> that's

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
tracing your image onto it but so that's

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.580 
tracing your image onto it but so that's
your<00:02:41.280> fabric
