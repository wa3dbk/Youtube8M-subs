00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.740
 hey guys like you guys are extremely busy 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.120
 become on the fibo I have now 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.770
 no more buck to hang it I 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.940
 go outside cologne has really cool 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.470
 course sports I will not be there 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 The German champion is training alone 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.660
 in powerlifting novels and comes with 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.070
 to be there 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.570
 I'll do some parcours tricks 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.480
 Show and we make small power package 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.850
 So be curious who wins therefore 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.050
 could do yes you are not romano 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.280
 So here at the stairs make now 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.660
 maybe first choice after first 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.250
 Exercise there we will be a few 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.170
 different jumps make the stairs 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.520
 up and down, yes, that will too 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.990
 at the same time we are the first challenge 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.820
 Let's see who finished this first of us 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.280
 So if the first exercise with once 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.290
 both legs closed as imagine 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.950
 and high jump distance loose and always 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.270
 a level only two the same with 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.430
 one leg in the next round is then 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.490
 always four step control technology, the stage 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.830
 1 2 the adopted okay stays that way and so 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.830
 only further 2 1 0 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:10.630
 and now in iran won on a leg 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.980
 because I'm the most demanding so at the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.150
 I finished my first exercise in Romano 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.319
 but that was a bit too 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.950
 Mean that was only on the 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.630
 endurance 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.130
 you're a specialist because of that 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.630
 Let's do the second exercise right now 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.630
 there you have better maps in any case 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.920
 probably only now when testing 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.110
 already noticed that it is quite nice here 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.490
 on the arms on the old to do that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.950
 make the little force challenge now 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.530
 against the combination with the over 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.300
 go back and hang the whole thing 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.540
 whenever I manage again also do so 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.540
 often the sheep and 321 pressure 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.870
 what right power in the arm I have 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.370
 say no easier had what 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.300
 Developers made up for my coffee 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.300
 as much as today there 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.650
 we are now doing the third challenge 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.410
 so we go to the wall beautiful the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.410
 fingertips above the poor through 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.410
 let hang and with the legs to the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.430
 wall and so hang loudly and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.040
 try to keep the tension so that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.040
 my feet are not on the floor of 321 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.010
 really 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.980
 Although we would have kept this for a long time 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.190
 or I do not have anything yet 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.190
 told 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.139
 so you've never done very nicely finished 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.639
 at the last exercises we come now 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.110
 to the last to fourth exercises i hope 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.789
 I can even make up for it 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.710
 we are lining up here because the dealer 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.720
 not long enough to really swing and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.460
 try it out of power as far as 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.840
 possible to pull over the front 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.990
 rather with the cat's jump from 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.470
 here we have to go ahead 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.470
 farthest comes 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.800
 not bad so I again 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.910
 balanced at the last competition 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.710
 again a little honor my 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.000
 Defend presses you see 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.620
 really what is behind it but 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.660
 Huge fun with you today 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.800
 first kracher opponents have been me 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.910
 brought to my limits 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.410
 that's why there is a draw 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.430
 if you have more videos 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.990
 wanted to see him and also a video 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.790
 what we did together is possible too 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.960
 I have linked his channel and still 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.310
 in the description if you have more 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.810
 to see the topic jump the borders 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.490
 want to click here on the playlist 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.330
 otherwise have fun while exercising and 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.330
 See you next time
