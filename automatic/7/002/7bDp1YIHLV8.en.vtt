Greece had been allowed to default on
loans<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.390> would<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.630> created<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:58.019> global

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
loans you would have created a global

loans you would have created a global
catastrophe<00:03:58.440> much<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.580> financial

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
catastrophe much like the financial

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.880 
catastrophe much like the financial
system<00:04:00.209> if<00:04:00.480> they<00:04:00.630> hadn't<00:04:00.870> bailed<00:04:01.019> out<00:04:01.230> you

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
system if they hadn't bailed out you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.310 
system if they hadn't bailed out you
know<00:04:01.980> all<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.580> those<00:04:03.360> financial<00:04:03.959> players<00:04:04.140> in

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
know all the those financial players in

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.680 
know all the those financial players in
the<00:04:04.410> US<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.370> by<00:04:05.580> bailing<00:04:05.970> out<00:04:06.060> one<00:04:06.330> what<00:04:06.570> you're

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
the US so by bailing out one what you're

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.000 
the US so by bailing out one what you're
doing<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.019> you're<00:04:07.050> securing<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.709> fact<00:04:07.920> that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
doing is you're securing the fact that

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.320 
doing is you're securing the fact that
you're<00:04:08.160> not<00:04:08.280> going<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.550> go<00:04:08.610> into<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.850> tailspin

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
you're not going to go into a tailspin

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.360 
you're not going to go into a tailspin
if<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.930> economy's<00:04:10.440> had<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.010> global

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
if the economy's had of the global

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.150 
if the economy's had of the global
global<00:04:11.970> setting<00:04:12.480> going<00:04:12.959> into<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.170> tailspin<00:04:13.709> you

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
global setting going into a tailspin you

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.159 
global setting going into a tailspin you
would<00:04:14.340> have<00:04:14.459> seen<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.790> major<00:04:15.299> reduction<00:04:15.630> in

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
would have seen a major reduction in

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.740 
would have seen a major reduction in
demand<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:17.070> oil<00:04:17.250> for<00:04:17.910> instance<00:04:18.239> for<00:04:18.600> all

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
demand for oil for instance for all

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.690 
demand for oil for instance for all
these<00:04:18.959> commodities<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.530> steel<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.340> so

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
these commodities like steel and so

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.219 
these commodities like steel and so
forth<00:04:20.910> because<00:04:21.030> again<00:04:21.330> all<00:04:21.570> those<00:04:21.630> countries

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
forth because again all those countries

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.210 
forth because again all those countries
