00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
loaded up so it's 16 degrees rolled so I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.570 
loaded up so it's 16 degrees rolled so I
don't<00:02:25.500> even<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:25.740> what<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:25.890> means<00:02:26.040> like

don't even know what that means like
what's<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> point<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.600> no<00:02:27.750> return<00:02:27.980> 35<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.310> 40

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
what's the point of no return 35 to 40

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.540 
what's the point of no return 35 to 40
you<00:02:29.819> know<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> had<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.690> at<00:02:31.130> this<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.310> really

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
you know what I had it at this is really

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.090 
you know what I had it at this is really
work<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.270> wyd<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.989> zero<00:02:34.350> would<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.620> perfectly

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
work so wyd so zero would be perfectly

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.820 
work so wyd so zero would be perfectly
flat<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.600> start<00:02:36.840> going<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.560> you'd

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
flat and then you start going so you'd

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.920 
flat and then you start going so you'd
be<00:02:37.920> level<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.209> I'm<00:02:39.330> three<00:02:39.600> degrees

be level and then so I'm three degrees

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.640 
be level and then so I'm three degrees
rolled<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.440> here<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.940> what<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.420> max<00:02:43.410> I've
