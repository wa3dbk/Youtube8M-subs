as upright and it makes the movement as

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.840 
as upright and it makes the movement as
a<00:01:23.240> result<00:01:23.659> a<00:01:23.899> little<00:01:24.380> more<00:01:24.530> hip<00:01:24.799> dominant<00:01:25.399> than

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
a result a little more hip dominant than

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.389 
a result a little more hip dominant than

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.660 
now that wide stance I tend to have a
little<00:02:14.590> more<00:02:14.740> stiffness<00:02:15.100> with<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.460> wise

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
little more stiffness with that wise

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.880 
little more stiffness with that wise
hands<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.180> my<00:02:16.270> hips<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:17.200> hard<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.470> me<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.710> get

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
hands on my hips it's hard for me to get

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.180 
hands on my hips it's hard for me to get
a<00:02:18.220> lot<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.030> depth<00:02:19.450> very<00:02:20.350> little<00:02:20.650> weight<00:02:20.890> and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
a lot of depth very little weight and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.800 
a lot of depth very little weight and
actually<00:02:22.000> having<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.270> little<00:02:22.510> bit<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.630> weight

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
actually having a little bit of weight

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.950 
actually having a little bit of weight
will<00:02:23.260> help<00:02:23.530> me<00:02:23.710> push<00:02:24.550> through<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.420> little

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
will help me push through that a little

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.330 
will help me push through that a little
bit<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.350> stiffness<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.830> go<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.130> bit

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
bit of stiffness and go a little bit

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
bit of stiffness and go a little bit
more<00:02:27.550> depth<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.780> you're<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.990> person<00:02:29.170> who<00:02:29.470> has

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
more depth if you're a person who has

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.380 
more depth if you're a person who has
the<00:02:29.650> same<00:02:29.950> issue<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.030> don't<00:02:31.180> have<00:02:31.240> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the same issue but you don't have the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.570 
the same issue but you don't have the
stability<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> strength<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.650> keep<00:02:32.980> good

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
stability in the strength to keep good

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.330 
stability in the strength to keep good
alignment<00:02:33.970> as<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.810> get<00:02:35.020> forced<00:02:35.440> through<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
alignment as you get forced through a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.800 
alignment as you get forced through a
little<00:02:36.610> more<00:02:36.790> range<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.060> motion<00:02:37.120> by<00:02:37.570> having

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
little more range of motion by having

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.330 
little more range of motion by having
some<00:02:37.930> weight<00:02:38.080> on<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.290> bar<00:02:38.470> then<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.190> should

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
some weight on the bar then you should

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.630 
some weight on the bar then you should
cut<00:02:39.459> off<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> little<00:02:39.850> bit<00:02:40.000> early<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:41.489> work<00:02:42.489> on

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
cut off a little bit early and work on

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.310 
cut off a little bit early and work on
your<00:02:42.670> mobility<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.050> can<00:02:44.170> get<00:02:44.260> that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
your mobility and so you can get that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.390 
your mobility and so you can get that
range<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.620> motion<00:02:44.680> safely<00:02:45.340> seem<00:02:46.239> long
