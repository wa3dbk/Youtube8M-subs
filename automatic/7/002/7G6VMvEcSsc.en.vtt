00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
and stretch out a little bit so that's

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.930 
and stretch out a little bit so that's
the<00:01:48.080> most<00:01:48.259> basic<00:01:48.680> way<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.860> wrap<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.520> Obi<00:01:49.759> belt

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
the shiny side of the leather is out it

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.430 
the shiny side of the leather is out it
gives<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.090> bot<00:01:53.240> gives<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.930> waist<00:01:54.140> some

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
gives the bot gives the waist some

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.219 
gives the bot gives the waist some
contour<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.220> some<00:01:55.550> interest<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.300> it's<00:01:57.020> just

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
contour and some interest and it's just

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.850 
contour and some interest and it's just
it's<00:01:57.500> it's<00:01:57.860> super<00:01:58.190> easy<00:01:59.350> now<00:02:00.350> another<00:02:00.619> way

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
it's it's super easy now another way

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.590 
it's it's super easy now another way
that<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.100> like<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.430> wrap<00:02:01.580> this<00:02:01.759> belt<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.180> there

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.109 
that I like to wrap this belt is there
is<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> really<00:02:03.740> beautiful<00:02:03.890> suede<00:02:04.430> side<00:02:04.820> to

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
is a really beautiful suede side to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.910 
is a really beautiful suede side to
these<00:02:05.240> belts<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.840> are<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:05.990> little<00:02:06.140> bit<00:02:06.350> softer

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
these belts that are a little bit softer

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.370 
these belts that are a little bit softer
and<00:02:07.190> have<00:02:07.399> some<00:02:07.610> texture<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.149> them<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.080> like

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
and have some texture to them so I like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.550 
and have some texture to them so I like
to<00:02:09.410> show<00:02:09.590> off<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:10.459> kind<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:11.140> contrast<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
to show off that kind of contrast and

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.170 
to show off that kind of contrast and
texture<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.220> we're<00:02:13.459> going<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> wrap<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.060> like

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
texture so we're going to wrap just like

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.300 
texture so we're going to wrap just like
we<00:02:14.300> did<00:02:14.510> around<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> waist<00:02:15.440> we're<00:02:16.130> going<00:02:16.250> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
we did around the waist we're going to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.100 
we did around the waist we're going to
crisscross<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:16.970> back<00:02:17.150> bring<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:17.930> around

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
crisscross in the back bring it around

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.720 
crisscross in the back bring it around
to<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.320> front<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.860> then<00:02:19.160> when<00:02:19.370> I'm<00:02:19.459> criss

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
to the front and then when I'm criss

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.509 
to the front and then when I'm criss
crossing<00:02:20.030> I'm<00:02:20.300> actually<00:02:20.510> going<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.959> twist<00:02:21.519> the

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
crossing I'm actually going to twist the

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.940 
crossing I'm actually going to twist the
leather<00:02:22.730> obi<00:02:23.090> belts<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.959> suede<00:02:24.290> shows<00:02:24.709> on

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
leather obi belts so the suede shows on

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.440 
leather obi belts so the suede shows on
the<00:02:25.040> outside<00:02:25.489> we're<00:02:25.940> arming<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.239> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
the outside we're arming on the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.390 
the outside we're arming on the
yeah<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> outside<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.160> we're<00:02:28.280> going

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
yeah on the outside and then we're going

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.699 
yeah on the outside and then we're going
to<00:02:28.430> bring<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.850> back<00:02:28.970> around<00:02:29.180> again<00:02:29.709> crisscross

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
to bring it back around again crisscross

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.070 
to bring it back around again crisscross
again<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.340> front<00:02:31.610> or<00:02:31.880> in<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.030> back<00:02:32.090> bring<00:02:33.049> it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
again the front or in the back bring it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.810 
again the front or in the back bring it
around<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.500> front<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.459> see<00:02:34.700> that

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
around to the front so you can see that

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.610 
around to the front so you can see that
the<00:02:34.970> suede<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.330> already<00:02:35.720> there<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.080> then<00:02:36.530> you

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
the suede is already there and then you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.020 
the suede is already there and then you
can<00:02:36.739> actually<00:02:36.920> criss<00:02:37.280> cross<00:02:37.519> again

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
can actually criss cross again

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.870 
can actually criss cross again
so<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.239> shiny<00:02:38.480> side<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.840> out<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:40.580> Obi

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
so the shiny side is out and the Obi

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.780 
so the shiny side is out and the Obi
belt<00:02:41.090> isn't<00:02:41.480> one<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.660> those<00:02:41.840> things<00:02:41.900> where

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
belt isn't one of those things where

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.039 
belt isn't one of those things where
there's<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.880> right<00:02:44.090> way<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.329> do<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:45.019> just

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
there's a right way to do it you just

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.569 
there's a right way to do it you just
need<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.560> kind<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.829> wrap<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.820> around<00:02:46.910> twist<00:02:47.720> it

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
need to kind of wrap it around twist it

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.370 
need to kind of wrap it around twist it
get<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.790> your<00:02:49.910> waist<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:51.110> get<00:02:51.290> in

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380

get it on your waist and then get in
front<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> mirror<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:51.980> play<00:02:52.160> with<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:53.110> move

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
front of a mirror and play with it move

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.140 
front of a mirror and play with it move
the<00:02:54.560> straps<00:02:54.829> around<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.340> little<00:02:55.489> bit<00:02:55.700> make<00:02:56.120> it

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
the straps around a little bit make it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.270 
the straps around a little bit make it
right<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:56.690> your<00:02:56.810> body<00:02:56.959> type<00:02:57.320> but<00:02:57.950> what<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.070> like

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
right for your body type but what I like

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.039 
right for your body type but what I like
about<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.880> both<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.269> shiny<00:02:59.540> side<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.959> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
about this is both the shiny side of the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.600 
about this is both the shiny side of the
leather<00:03:00.200> shows<00:03:00.560> as<00:03:00.829> well<00:03:01.040> as<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> suede<00:03:01.579> side

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
leather shows as well as the suede side

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.000 
leather shows as well as the suede side
so<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.120> gives<00:03:02.299> it<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.480> lot<00:03:02.630> more<00:03:02.890> dimension<00:03:03.890> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
so it gives it a lot more dimension and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.810 
so it gives it a lot more dimension and
texture<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:07.280> time<00:03:07.519> we're<00:03:07.610> going<00:03:07.760> to

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
texture so this time we're going to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.130 
texture so this time we're going to
knock<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.239> belt<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.630> then<00:03:08.750> wrap<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.079> around

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
knock the belt and then wrap it around

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.930 
knock the belt and then wrap it around
