00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.360
 warmed up with a light set to 15 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.100
 Repetitions will take place today after the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.739
 reverse for offer that train 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.590
 means in the first sentence my max 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.080
 take weight and six to ten 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.750
 repetitions do yes and there 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.580
 accordingly break with less weight 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.040
 a little more repetitions one more 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.140
 break if your weight is still a bit 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.150
 more repetitions okay but now 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.150
 Let's start with the heavy set 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.290
 10 repetitions would have seen 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.110
 I swung my upper body man 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.610
 controls the swing that is me 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.440
 have the dropping method here completely 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.960
 Used in a controlled manner and a bit 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.260
 to use in the hardest point 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.350
 and yes not quite so clean 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.650
 But feeling in the biceps is there and on it 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.480
 that matters 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.920
 the third exercise of my today's biceps 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.540
 trainings, scott girls are one-armed very 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.350
 nice exercises to have a stretch in 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:51.070
 to get the biceps in and look 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.070
 what is holding 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.910
 he is a wonderful exercise around the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.169
 muscles again to stretch out properly 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.820
 you just have to enjoy it 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.240
 Training that means the full 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.240
 Stretching in the musculature at the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.440
 eccentric phase and then the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.380
 optimal tension at the concentric 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.260
 phase of the movement here in the trap 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.030
 lower stretch concentrically to bow 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.370
 of the arm must be purely beautiful in the 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.370
 muscles and then it's really fun 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.790
 if here without training partner 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.580
 train like I did today you have 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.320
 possibility for example biceps training 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.790
 and in such a one-armed exercise itself 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.070
 a bit to support that is 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.690
 if we get stuck on this 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.270
 hardest point just the finger 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.120
 take three fingers and slightly upwards 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.850
 Press so you can practically intense 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.520
 repeat intense repetitions 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.290
 complete your own strength 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.010
 the fourth and last exercise of my 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.180
 biceps training are cable candles standing 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.560
 I have to train myself alone 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.710
 How can I improve my training 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.660
 Optimize intensity as with scott 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.420
 experience with intense repetitions 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.150
 One-armed somebody would come to make girls 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.710
 a decrease the sentence a level 30 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.810
 have my weight on where I am so 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.580
 Ten repetitions make it easy 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.560
 weight around and point a few more 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.300
 repetitions on the back that one times 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.530
 really good for the muscle quality 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.530
 to bring on let's go 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.009
 O 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.199
 H 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.510
 there were 210 repetitions one more 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.580
 come up with something 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.400
 meanwhile, last three 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.950
 repetitions in the second passage above 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.740
 kept short 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.690
 an ultra-high voltage are barrel has the 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:29.800
 method of contact already applied 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:31.270
 yes really grilled heribert schmitt 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.670
 bodybuilding friends that was a 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.420
 impression of my biceps training from 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.490

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:43.930
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:46.210
 intensity today was good was okay my 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.590
 fifth training day in a row 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.960
