00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
first I'll to get to the pump is that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.999 
first I'll to get to the pump is that
just<00:01:02.520> take<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.450> out<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.020> spring

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
just take this out here and then spring

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:31.789 
just take this out here and then spring
and<00:01:12.409> then<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:17.060> pull<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> you
