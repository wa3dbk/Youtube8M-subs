00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:17.132
[RICARDO] Good afternoon!

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.931
[LUIZE] - Hi!
[RICARDO] - How are you?

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:20.932
[RICARDO] - Is everything alright?
[LUIZE] - Nice to meet you!

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.412
[LUIZE] - I'm fine!
[RICARDO] - I'm alright!

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:24.509
Is there a match coming?

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:28.151
[LUIZE] We'll dispute an important
match against São Paulo on Sunday!

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:29.336
[RICARDO] Are you going to score?

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:31.183
[LUIZE] - God willing!
[RICARDO] - God willing!

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:33.400
[LUIZE] That's how strikers must think!

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:35.843
[RICARDO] - Have you scored ten goals?
[LUIZE] - That's right.

00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:38.495
[RICARDO] That's awesome, great!

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.810
I scored eleven during the Paulistão,

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:42.666
you're going to surpass me!

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:44.964
We're here supporting you,
everything is going to work out!

00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:48.241
[LUIZE] Our team is very grateful,
I believe that...

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:51.538
I'm honored to meet you...

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.813
[RICARDO] I'm truly happy!

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.403
[LUIZE] When I watch your matches
I keep singing:

00:00:55.404 --> 00:00:59.018
"Ah, é Oliveira!
Ah, é Oliveira!"

00:00:59.123 --> 00:00:59.867
[RICARDO] That's great!

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:02.435
[LUIZE] Sometimes, the ball is
on the opposite side of the field...

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.387
and I'm looking at you running,

00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:06.208
[RICARDO] Taking a look
at my positioning, right?

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:09.515
That's right!
I used to do that all the time!

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:11.959
I had the chance to play
with great strikers,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.140
and I used to watch them shooting,

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.302
their movements,

00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:17.404
and I used to do the same.

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:19.595
We're part of the same team,

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.239
- we're defending the same crest.
[LUIZE] - We're defending the same team.

00:01:22.497 --> 00:01:25.396
[RICARDO] I'm definitely a fan of yours.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:26.763
- We are Santos FC!
[LUIZE] - That's all that matters.

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:28.584
[RICARDO] Santos FC must always
be at the top,

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:32.688
including the Youth Academy,
the Women's Team and the Professional.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:35.371
We have to keep that in mind.

00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:45.796
[RICARDO] Santos FC fans,
that's Geuvânio!

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:51.637
[LUIZE] Awesome,
I'll meet another soccer star!

00:01:53.336 --> 00:01:54.953
[GEUVÂNIO] - Nice to meet you!
[LUIZE] - How are you?

00:01:56.073 --> 00:01:58.394
[GEUVÂNIO] I wish you the best of luck,
God bless you,

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.100
I hope you manage to score...

00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:02.365
and help our team to win
another title!

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:03.539
[LUIZE] Awesome!

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:06.937
[GEUVÂNIO] I'm speaking perfectly!

00:02:06.938 --> 00:02:10.484
[SANTOS TV] - He's speaking well!
[RICARDO] - He's evolving!

00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:16.144
[GEUVÂNIO] My minister has
a very distinct vocabulary!

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:18.393
[RICARDO] We have a deal!

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:21.849
If you make it to the finals
and our schedule turns out to be free,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.613
we'll gather as many players
as possible and we'll go there!

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:28.431
[LUIZE] Sereias, it's up to us!

00:02:29.747 --> 00:02:31.100
[GEUVÂNIO] Now they're under pressure!

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.256
[LUIZE] I'm under pressure as well!

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.378
I must score!

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:38.173
I'm really happy to meet you!

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:42.670
[RICARDO] Tell all the girls
that we'll be here supporting them!

00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:45.098
If you make it to the finals...

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.420
[LUIZE] - That part is cool!
[RICARDO] - and we're free,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.185
you can be sure we'll go there
to support you!

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:55.123
[LUIZE] We'll be extremely happy!

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.966
[RICARDO] We'll sing together!

00:02:58.967 --> 00:02:59.926
[LUIZE] That'd be awesome!

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:04.596
[RICARDO] Hello, Santos fans,

00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:07.974
I'm here to invite you
to come support our Women's Team!

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:10.845
