example ok so I select ok and then you
have<00:00:54.569> instant<00:00:55.129> texture<00:00:56.209> over<00:00:57.209> your<00:00:57.449> image<00:00:57.839> so

overlay apply and now you use search for

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
overlay apply and now you use search for
the<00:01:10.830> node<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.700> fits<00:01:12.060> better<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.750> your

image and this is the easiest way we can

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.220 
image and this is the easiest way we can
just<00:01:16.410> adjust<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.190> texture<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.570> continue

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
just adjust the texture we can continue

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.160 
just adjust the texture we can continue
painting<00:01:19.670> over<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.090> image<00:01:21.510> without

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
painting over the image without

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.190 
painting over the image without
affecting<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.980> texture<00:01:23.760> we<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.600> change<00:01:24.870> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
affecting the texture we can change the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
affecting the texture we can change the
texture<00:01:25.740> go<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.550> the<00:01:26.790> properties<00:01:28.910> just<00:01:29.910> search

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
texture go to the properties just search

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.950 
texture go to the properties just search
