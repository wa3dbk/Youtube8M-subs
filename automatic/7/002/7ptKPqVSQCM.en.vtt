00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.320
 very good, I'll give you a review 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.000
 where 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.450
 the electronic book called luca 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.630
 comment that this device is very 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.619
 well it's a pass as long as 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.680
 we know how to educate him correctly he has a 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.869
 slot for a memory card and 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.720
 we proceed to start the version 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.090
 rooted of the glÃ¼ck 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.120
 and I say rooted because I had to do it 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.899
 as 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 the device look gave me problems 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.420
 to connect to the internet I used to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.699
 connected but without internet access and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.059
 to solve this because the best that 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.000
 I could do is to say the only thing was to root 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.000
 what and in addition to solving the problem 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.270
 I got many more options than those 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.910
 bring the device from home 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.320
 comment that the screen looks very good 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.770
 in a 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.219
 spectacular 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.219
 Y 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.229
 even if you hit the sunlight you see 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.909
 perfectly this is the screen of 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.850
 start 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.079
 the look when surrounded when it comes 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.960
 from home does not look like this here we have a 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:34.600
 lots of applications that are installed and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.720
 I tell them when you reuters the device 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.570
 and among them we can highlight the ebook 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.930
 troy that is very good then to see 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.130
 documents for example in pdf 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.240
 here we can see 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.240
 for example a comic 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.120
 and we can see that it looks very good 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.250
 we can also zoom in and move on 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.270
 page with the physical buttons that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.070
 we have on the sides 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.429
 let's see for example now another 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.429
 example 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.050
 the hobby consoles magazine 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.489
 and the text is very tiny but I 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.610
 I commented that the options were neither 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:28.260
 more we can have 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.260
 a pretty good result 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.800
 comment also what 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.690
 the profit 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.450
 once we have preached it correctly 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.070
 It also has access to the market for 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.160
 download any application that 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:50.030
 we want games type and you mans and also 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.890
 has an internet browser with the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.570
 which can visit any page 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.570
 that we want 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.069
 we can appreciate the clarity with which 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.860
 you can 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.720
 observe web pages 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.720
 let's make another 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.250
 and comment well on the good of these 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.680
 gadgets is that they allow us 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.080
 visualize the images correctly 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.050
 although the light of the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.530
 sun to the screen that is one of the 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.100
 great advantages 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.370
 the electronic ink also comment 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.160
 that we can customize for the function 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.290
 assigned to the physical buttons 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.740
 once rooted as always the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.380
 device by means of one of the 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.000
 applications called knockouts mode 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.450
 manager 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.100
 let's see what a book would look like in 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.780
 epub format one of the most formats 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.260
 extended to view books 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.930
 electronic and as we see then 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.230
 and you can read very much 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.230
 comfort 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.000
 as I said we can turn the page 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.540
 with physical button or with the typical gesture 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.330
 of drag and good and finally you can 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.360
 comment that a lot of people settle 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.490
 games type angry birds and other things that 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.440
 It's great to teach friends 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.140
 and such but really in this kind of 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.750
 devices is not very optimal the 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.410
 visualization for example here we have 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:37.460
 the game of tic-tac-toe that we can 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.050
 entertain at some given moment 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.919
 I just hit a beating 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.470
 we also have access to gmail and 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.280
 for example to the news application 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.990
 and time which will allow us to have 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.789
 access to the time you are going to do in 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.520
 Our city 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.710
 to the headlines of the latest news 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.289
 although good for this we can use 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.889
 the web browser and access the page 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:10.629
 that we want or for example via 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:13.080
 rss feed which would not give any kind of 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.080
 problem 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.729
 we also have access to facebook and how 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.909
 I told you we can install any 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.280
 type of application compatible with the 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.860
 device through marketing and 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.710
 nothing more a greeting to all and I hope that 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.710
 have enjoyed this review
