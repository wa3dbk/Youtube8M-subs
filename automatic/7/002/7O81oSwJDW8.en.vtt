00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.150
 special tutorial for short nails this 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.150
 is the design we are going to make 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.360
 As you can see, it's a very simple design 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.090
 of those that I always do so 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.820

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.829
 beautiful design of nails do not move from 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.949
 there we'll see you at the end of the video is what 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.610
 that we are going to use to make this 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.430
 Precious manicure enamel base for 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.040
 Protect the nails top coat drying 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.379
 fast to protect the design a 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.129
 black enamel and an enamel 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.059
 golden color with screams and then we go 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.930
 to use 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.540
 some nail stickers in this case the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.329
 we will use white to contrast with 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.280
 the black enamel we are also going to use a 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.740
 piece of sponge 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.200
 from which we will cut a small piece 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.869
 which will be the one with which we will apply the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.720
 golden glitter we apply the enamel 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.830
 protector now let's paint our 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.830
 nails with black enamel 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.090
 let's cut a piece of sponge 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.929
 which is the one with which we will apply 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.929
 the glitter 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.940
 with this piece will be enough once 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.140
 the black enamel is dry we are going to catch 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.900
 this beautiful golden glitter and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.000
 holographic as you can see holographic 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.070
 means that it reflects all the colors 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.250
 it's a kind of glitter that to me 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.509
 also love and we will take the piece 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.509
 of sponge that we have cut 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:19.540
 let's apply the iter in the sponge 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.540
 forgive me that I have left 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.950
 of scene 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.650
 what we are going to do when applying the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.250
 glitter in this way is to dry 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.420
 long before we will apply it on the nail 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.890
 cancel 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.890
 then we do like this 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.090
 with careful not to leave even if 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.970
 we left it can be cleaned but if not 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.420
 we have to clean better than better 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.350
 and there we have the applied glitter 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.350
 to see a close-up 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.300
 of nails we are going to decorate with these 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.880
 white stickers that are shaped like 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.950
 of diamond we are going to choose 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.459
 randomly for example 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.459
 for the little finger we will choose 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.140
 one that is chiquitita 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.460
 Y 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.460
 we are going to apply 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.940
 in the cuticle 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.340
 instead of going centered I'm going to 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.730
 be applying them 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.989
 there in the cuticle once we have all 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.900
 the stickers placed where we want 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.900
 we have no need to apply a layer of 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.420
 quick-drying protective enamel and the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.420
 design would be more than ready
