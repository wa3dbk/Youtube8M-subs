00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:20.190
 and the story of the juggler dates back to 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.150
 1938 when a part endara of the city 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.949
 from Mexico 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.189
 rosarito particularly created this 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.720
 magical formula to satisfy 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.730
 conquer the palate of an actress 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.460
 very famous North American of the time 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.350
 called marjorie king on her body 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 he tolerated the only drink he tolerated 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.070
 it was tequila but he liked to have 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 pure tequila as did the rest of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.710
 his Mexican compatriots then at 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.430
 know this he tried to create the formula that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.199
 masks the pure taste of tequila and what 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.750
 combined with other ingredients 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.070
 which were very attractive for the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.710
 palate of 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.650
 actress which acknowledging a little her 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.630
 merit I visited him assiduously this 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.340
 history is complemented by another 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.190
 days 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.160
 Beverly Hills noticed that many boxes of 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.360
 Tequila were going out in the city 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.800
 particularly a bar that tale o'clock 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.990
 when this beverage distributor was 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.900
 to see what was happening in 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.030
 that place he realized they were 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.000
 consuming the same margarita cocktail 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.070
 that had been created by the best friend 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.869
 of this bartender general danny herrera 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.820
 the Mexican that was answered 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.510
 previously the palate of the actress 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.510
 North American 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.820
 the first 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.640
 present when preparing a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.590
 Daisy is important that the glass go 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.009
 acquiring temperature because this 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.229
 Cocktail is served refreshed or shaken but 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.960
 it is served casting or we follow it without 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.970
 ice inside this cup we go to the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.290
 ingredients in the shaker some 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.080
 ice stones two parts tequila 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.110
 a part of triple sec that is a liquor 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.570
 of orange peels and the last 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.000
 ingredient is lemon with a few drops of 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.830
 sugar a kind of salty syrup that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.760
 we prepare especially for this 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.760
 work then 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.800
 and we are going to beat 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.790
 to my mind 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.709
 for more than 10 seconds once the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.340
 cocktail temperature is acquired 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.140
 suitable we will see in the coastal 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.579
 when it feels a little colder 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.860
 apart we feel our hands a little bit more 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.870
 cold we are going to discard the ice that 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.569
 we use 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.720
 and let's live strained 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.870
 little the orders we owe the cup a 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.470
 little syrup and we finished it with a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.460
 slanted edge with two years 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.920
 our preparation and we have a 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.420
 margarita which we will decorate with 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.420
 'red' of lemon or lime 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.080
 and I enjoyed
