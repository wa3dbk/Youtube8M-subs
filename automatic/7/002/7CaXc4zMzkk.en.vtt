 entrepreneur blog briefly under blanc 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.879
 called 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.529
 accompany me on my life path 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.240
 and learn the secrets of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.769
 society in the economy know the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.030
 of politics and media 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.889
 to be concealed 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 and today I have a hot topic 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 selected greece and have to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.080
 I get a very balanced to the place 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.109
 whiskey by craig moore one of the classic 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.580
 malts of scotland wonderfully harmonious 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.590
 harmoniously it is with greece in the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 Do not hesitate and this topic 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.880
 greece becomes me and you this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 Heer follow a longer time 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 is busy again and again like that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 make a detour now look like yourself 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.280
 that reflects and, first of all, I want 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.350
 here hints on a color of the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.460
 ancient greek the among grasshoppers 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.800
 and ants fabelwelt has built up and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 the financial times germany has 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.410
 a translation to today's 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.870
 banking world and also the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.530
 government debt and there comes 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.950
 So the greeks are not so good 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 away with now well I have now a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.509
 object of BPH reinbekommen 22 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 october 17 clock eight first lawsuits against 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.790
 greece on full repayment of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.189
 yes greek state pages we borrow 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.280
 remember there was a haircut 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.280
 there were defaults on sovereign bonds 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 and then he said the start 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 carries what and the private sector must 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.290
 I also participate in it and so on 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.470
 and what happened 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.450
 at the kiel district court are nationwide 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.790
 the first payments are complaining 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.799
 repayments of Greek 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.399
 government bonds subscribed to German 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.649
 have entered and the spokesman of 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.860
 german protection association for 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.479
 Securities ownership dsw has a special one 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.799
 let out and now that's how it starts 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.369
 slowly simmer that will be 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.429
 already build a bit and this dsw 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.000
 So has a working group 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.170
 greece bonds 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.870
 kg founded and there they already represent 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.970
 4000 investors with the assets of 170 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.190
 So millions of euros seen nationally 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.450
 peanuts private christin a lot 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.730
 money and it is so on average 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.870
 systems of 25,000 euro so there it is 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.220
 it's not about the very poor ones 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.020
 very rich but it is about the whole 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.260
 normal people like you and me or 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:40.380
 as they are and they have about 80 here 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.140
 percent of their employment lost 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.160
 Now let's remember a bit 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.170
 I did not say they wanted one like that 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.300
 Haircut with something 50 or 40 percent 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.500
 or something and now they are 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.830
 private investors and the numbers 80 percent 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.420
 He is very suspicious of it 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.870
 Turned around it very carefully 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.190
 say 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.170
 that reminds me a bit of the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.110
 lehman bankrupt as they have at lehman 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.080
 the thing lehman brothers in new york 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.760
 mighty exaggerated and have 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
 Certificates always spent when 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.140
 word certificate be very careful that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.970
 is a bank own paper and 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.860
 if as the Bank about the online goes into 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.000
 Your certificates also with you over the years 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.670
 So on and there is now someone the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.769
 risk on these greece bonds 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.030
 passed not so beautiful is called 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.280
 So it does not have anything nice 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.570
 packed and then has a customer 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.340
 has said here quite 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.350
 sure thing we said maybe 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.970
 risk class b and so has that 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.700
 Let us sign a consultation paper 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:45.930
 not as noticed and now at once 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:49.739
 130 percent are gone now ask where 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.400
 Nevertheless, these bombs lurk with the army 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.980
 Kantner 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.950
 He has still bought government bonds 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:00.260
 now life insurance must have one 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.640
 bring whole amount of return and this 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.140
 return insurance services 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.910
 must be only with German 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.799
 not necessarily achieve government bonds 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.930
 because you pay the interest and right 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.459
 So they were looking for loans then 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.380
 the safe ones are a good rating 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.940
 had and 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.610
 as greece a few more 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.930
 not so bad there was standing there 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.550
 the still good rating then had 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.700
 we have bought now came the drk 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.750
 tactics so that means also in the 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.100
 life insurance where win 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.360
 there on the against 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.620
 additional insurance contracts 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.300
 to be distributed 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.110
 Surplus participation, even there, it is getting worse 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.250
 very big because here these losses 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.400
 to be caught there one tries 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.170
 Of course these risks are now in 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.970
 to give a private hand to him one 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.760
 loses all his money and not the 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.530
 life insurance then as such here 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.030
 Everyone can not score with the customers 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.160
 try the black peter in the other 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.770
 have to plug in the conclusion has 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.680
 lost 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.600
 well there is a little something else 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.390
 problems with greece and at 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.220
 these government bonds what so far what 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.200
 so far only once in the 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.670
 read and otherwise will 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.370
 totally hushed up 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.640
 I wonder why that is and indeed 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.870
 the greece bonds are too round 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.920
 95 percent according to Greek law 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.460
 spent and that happens to be 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.600
 all these countries in principle 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.890
 and if they are Greek 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.050
 then there is implied 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.910
 included if greece from the 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.790
 euro and the kites and 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.800
 then change the nominal value 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.720
 these government bonds drachme them 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.490
 and if now the drachme Gothic with 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.720
 loses installations and then on 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.730
 once only half or one 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.100
 quarter is worth the euro then gets 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.520
 you only need one more on your bonds 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.430
 third or back that is actually 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.750
 that the big danger of this 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.640
 greece alone that the big one 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.930
 danger in which the life insurance 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.730
 and the banks are stuck in it and that is 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.180
 the danger if you are on such 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.550
 take long running loan form 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.190
 that in the end in which conditions 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.100
 change and interest rates be it 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.320
 inflation is 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:30.870
 the broke of in a country in the 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:34.080
 this company has invested that 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.509
 goes through and down to the individual 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.919
 Citizen and now if you are so 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.840
 are just saying the greeks should 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.550
 one and now and one pressure and the 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.680
 have to get out of the eu and so on and on 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.120
 so away from the euro and should they 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.840
 after all, note that that 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:56.940
 direct influence on her 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:58.349
 But I have life insurance 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.419
 never in life one 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.410
 life insurance the food and there 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.110
 it then also a video of me about 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.889
 life insurance ribbon here and 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.530
 I only invest where I have something 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.910
 Understand that is a basic principle 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.830
 and when I am at the life insurance 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.330
 do not understand what the money with my 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.949
 Do the supply will be too 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.110
 fresh feeling and maybe one 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.780
 I'm there for a profit share 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.949
 highly skeptical and that's where I stay 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.240
 then rather more at the 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:27.150
 real economy not in such 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.639
 strange any insurance 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.820
 No, I'm very skeptical and if so 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:35.220
 you are in life insurance 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.539
 then they should urgently turn around 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.830
 a video about life insurance 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:43.530
 look there is explosives in it no 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:46.380
 explosives is twelve in the dragon ball 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.300
 years a really balanced single 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.419
 paints whiskey between smell taste 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:55.699
 and leaving all a freedom 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:55.699
 no risk exercised
