00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
this as you can see here in the back I

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.789 
this as you can see here in the back I
still<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.600> wear<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:20.990> open<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.500> little<00:01:21.530> bit

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
still have to wear it open a little bit

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.820 
still have to wear it open a little bit
I<00:01:22.250> can<00:01:22.880> close<00:01:23.299> it<00:01:23.330> more<00:01:23.869> but<00:01:24.200> then<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.590> causes

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
I can close it more but then it causes

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.149 
I can close it more but then it causes
some<00:01:25.310> sort<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:26.259> squishing<00:01:27.259> here<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.920> front

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
some sort of squishing here in the front

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.950 
some sort of squishing here in the front
so<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.369> prefer<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.729> have<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.210> little<00:01:29.240> bit<00:01:29.509> open

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
so I prefer to have it a little bit open

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
if you can see it because the material

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.370 
if you can see it because the material
is<00:01:37.700> late<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:38.180> if<00:01:38.299> I<00:01:38.360> put<00:01:38.509> my<00:01:38.630> hair<00:01:38.840> behind<00:01:38.990> it

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
16 on each side however yours might not

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.940 
16 on each side however yours might not
have<00:05:21.100> quite<00:05:21.370> as<00:05:21.610> many<00:05:21.760> because<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:23.230> did<00:05:23.710> get<00:05:23.890> a

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
have quite as many because I did get a

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.490 
have quite as many because I did get a
longer<00:05:24.340> torso<00:05:24.550> like<00:05:25.090> I<00:05:25.120> said<00:05:25.360> before<00:05:25.510> finished

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
longer torso like I said before finished

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.280 
longer torso like I said before finished
in<00:05:26.650> silver<00:05:26.890> which<00:05:27.160> I<00:05:27.280> like<00:05:27.460> I<00:05:28.270> like<00:05:28.900> how<00:05:29.110> it

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
in silver which I like I like how it

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.080 
in silver which I like I like how it
matches<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:30.070> rest<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.430> corset<00:05:30.850> but<00:05:31.030> I

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
matches the rest of the corset but I

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.730 
matches the rest of the corset but I
mean<00:05:31.300> that's<00:05:31.480> probably<00:05:31.600> not<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:32.020> design<00:05:32.410> thing

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
mean that's probably not a design thing

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.310 
mean that's probably not a design thing
that's<00:05:32.980> just<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.340> coincidence<00:05:34.030> thing<00:05:34.240> anyway<00:05:34.840> I

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
that's just a coincidence thing anyway I

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.310 
that's just a coincidence thing anyway I
was<00:05:35.980> nervous<00:05:36.460> about<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:37.510> corset<00:05:37.990> because

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
was nervous about this corset because

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.790 
was nervous about this corset because
the<00:05:38.470> brocade<00:05:39.010> when<00:05:39.760> I<00:05:39.790> feel<00:05:40.330> it<00:05:40.600> it<00:05:40.960> feels<00:05:41.500> like

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
the brocade when I feel it it feels like

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.830 
the brocade when I feel it it feels like
if<00:05:41.980> it's<00:05:42.100> not<00:05:42.220> treated<00:05:42.460> properly<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:43.360> could

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
if it's not treated properly it could

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.660 
if it's not treated properly it could
rip<00:05:44.260> away<00:05:44.800> from<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.190> grommet<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:45.580> the

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
rip away from the grommet so the

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.040 
rip away from the grommet so the
grommets<00:05:46.000> could<00:05:46.120> rip<00:05:46.270> away<00:05:46.480> from<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.810> fabric

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
grommets could rip away from the fabric

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.640 
grommets could rip away from the fabric
however<00:05:48.390> you<00:05:49.390> can<00:05:49.540> see<00:05:49.720> that<00:05:49.990> that's<00:05:50.530> not

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
however you can see that that's not

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.160 
however you can see that that's not
happening<00:05:51.160> in<00:05:51.400> this<00:05:51.550> case<00:05:51.850> even<00:05:52.570> around<00:05:53.050> the

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
happening in this case even around the

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.190 
happening in this case even around the
waistline<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:54.160> don't<00:05:54.640> see<00:05:54.880> any<00:05:55.240> coming<00:05:55.990> away

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
waistline you don't see any coming away

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.390 
waistline you don't see any coming away
at<00:05:56.620> all<00:05:57.030> which<00:05:58.030> I'm<00:05:58.680> pleasantly<00:05:59.680> surprised

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
at all which I'm pleasantly surprised

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.780 
at all which I'm pleasantly surprised
about

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
about

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.720 
about
so<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.900> guess<00:06:02.320> leather<00:06:02.740> otics-rio<00:06:03.250> takes<00:06:03.580> it

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
so I guess leather otics-rio takes it

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.330 
so I guess leather otics-rio takes it
seriously<00:06:04.120> when<00:06:04.360> they<00:06:04.480> get<00:06:04.630> complaints<00:06:05.110> about

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
seriously when they get complaints about

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.410 
seriously when they get complaints about
grommet<00:06:06.340> stripping<00:06:06.610> out<00:06:06.760> in<00:06:06.910> their<00:06:07.060> older

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
grommet stripping out in their older

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.640 
grommet stripping out in their older
style<00:06:07.720> corsets<00:06:08.290> and<00:06:08.970> so<00:06:09.970> yeah<00:06:10.690> apparently

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
style corsets and so yeah apparently

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.430 
style corsets and so yeah apparently
they<00:06:12.010> had<00:06:12.250> changed<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.450> type<00:06:13.930> of<00:06:13.960> grommets

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
they had changed the type of grommets
