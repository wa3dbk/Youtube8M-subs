00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.150
 but youtube and welcome to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.460
 a comment which is pretty 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 is scary for most now 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
 some and what a blatant mega 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.579
 will go to the brain and first 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.090
 so in the first moment where you can do that 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.380
 we hear only times as de facto ok some 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.629
 but have you heard of the li 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.489
 I am happy but I personally want my 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.030
 to give opinion because I just 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.820
 really great crass hammer so find it 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590
 what was spreading where I am not now 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.550
 can be sure if the whole 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.650
 information is correct 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.300
 if all this is correct 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.020
 or others say but I go 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 just have it in the title 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.410
 have you already read it so the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.050
 tension is already a bit out at 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.880
 google maps has become a staple 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.860
 murder occurs one can be a human 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.649
 which is located on a platform in the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.729
 dutch park almere one can 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:14.520
 watch as he dies so not yes you 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.960
 can see that he died is only 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.330
 A guess, of course, can also be a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.340
 be a brake from the rabbit or something 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.670
 but I do not want to commit myself there 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, it looks pretty good 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.840
 really from you I'm a naturally 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.619
 link immediately in the description pack 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.369
 that he can immediately see that there 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.729
 The whole thing was recorded in 2013 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.659
 If I'm so 2013 would have that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.220
 actually be 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.549
 i am i all i have i believe 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.049
 It was 2013 so you are watching it right now 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.700
 background you also see this person 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.380
 on the platform against and you can 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 recognize this very well that is one 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.600
 human person is so close 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.670
 We're out with the rabbit 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.500
 water from the water or through 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.439
 any liquid contaminated 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.780
 Finally, it has been in that too 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.439
 because it suggests everything to me out 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.149
 that's a loop track so the whole 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.079
 which is a bit funny now 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.930
 appears where I would say now 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:18.390
 ok makes me a bit suspicious so 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.250
 you see here the person is now 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.720
 just edged everything with sony vegas 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.840
 you see these people are lying 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.300
 what is left next to it or is it 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.630
 I would like to know so that 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.930
 second is you see the track here 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.560
 from the bottom so from the beginning of the bar to the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.900
 In the middle but I find the bridge I think 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.140
 no traces and I say it like this 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.180
 On green one should actually red too 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.460
 recognize well now you ask yourself 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 of course what happens there and where is there 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.830
 what is happening 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.590
 I can see here in the picture now 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.440
 no signs of any 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.070
 murder or something of what happens 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.530
 could be 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.320
 the only thing you can see is when you go 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.780
 a bit out of the picture 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.770
 and the passers-by look at that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.660
 once two pieces on bicycles on 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.850
 the bridge then another before the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.080
 bridge with a dog when I do that 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.670
 I can really recognize myself 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.380
 of course not set and yes, too 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.090
 no shit or something from me 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.190
 I would just say I was 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.739
 have been in the opinion when these people her 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.170
 would drive long then they would have 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.320
 but actually have to see 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.100
 so my guess is so i say 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.660
 again 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.950
 I do not want to commit myself 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.420
 I do not want to talk shit 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.980
 that's why you all can do it yourself 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.570
 convince that the whole thing too 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.880
 I agree with the google maps 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.739
 in the description on the left and 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.690
 Now I want your opinion 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.160
 know you have heard of it already 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.620
 or maybe just the first ones 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.420
 which come through my video on it and 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.269
 Now I just want to know 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.900
 Do you think it's real or do you think 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.180
 that there is something animal objects or 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.680
 something biological happened to me 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.560
 stick to it, I think it's real 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.600
 Something always happens and it is something 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.040
 what you should not laugh at what 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.049
 Do not make a joke and 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.580
 what you would not be happy about but 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.410
 I thought that's okay 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.940
 very horny commentary topic because you 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.370
 can tell many things about it 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.130
 I have no more detailed information 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.540
 just that somehow in one 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.250
 cosmopolitan landscape dar 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.900
 it is puzzled whether the real and now 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.330
 have already found the people 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.580
 So there's something to say 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.000
 Once again, the Netherlands happened in 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.470
 Almera Park I do not know exactly where 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.190
 that is located near two 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.510
 football takes place 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.820
 radeon stadiums instead of one now 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.220
 big names is now time ghetto 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.690
 Settlement you will again a picture 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.320
 So that means everything to me 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.540
 openly threatened 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.190
 So I could honestly say that 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.800
 could imagine that it is real 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.790
 and now I just want your man 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.140
 to know what you think is that real 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.430
 or is that fake writing it in the 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.290
 Comments 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.810
 I'm out of it and I hope you 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.320
 be on time and well informed 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.730
 been 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.500
 and if you already have this information 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.420
 I hope it was not 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.250
 superfluous but has yours 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.900

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:21.580
