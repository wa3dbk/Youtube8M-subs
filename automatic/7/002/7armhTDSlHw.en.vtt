00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.090 
okay so I got the rear sight installed

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.190 
okay so I got the rear sight installed
and<00:00:03.090> as<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.330> can<00:00:03.419> see<00:00:03.480> I've<00:00:03.750> got<00:00:03.899> all<00:00:03.959> the

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
and as you can see I've got all the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.430 
and as you can see I've got all the
channels<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.740> grooves<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.190> numbers<00:00:05.910> already

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
channels and grooves and numbers already

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.919 
channels and grooves and numbers already
cut<00:00:07.440> into<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:09.050> the<00:00:10.050> spring<00:00:10.440> works<00:00:11.929> fairly

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
cut into it and the spring works fairly

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.820 
cut into it and the spring works fairly
well<00:00:14.780> overall<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.990> thing<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.440> some<00:00:16.590> minor

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
well overall the thing is some minor

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.040 
well overall the thing is some minor
adjustments<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.600> know<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.840> would<00:00:18.990> be

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
adjustments and you know this would be

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.890 
adjustments and you know this would be
doc<00:00:19.320> site<00:00:19.590> put<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.150> but<00:00:21.150> other<00:00:21.330> than<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.570> it's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
doc site put on but other than that it's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.099 
doc site put on but other than that it's
pretty<00:00:21.990> much<00:00:22.320> good<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:25.590> locks<00:00:25.830> work<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:27.109> they

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
pretty much good the locks work and they

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
pretty much good the locks work and they
take<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.349> apart<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.859> basically<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.609> like

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
take it apart it's basically just like

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
take it apart it's basically just like
the<00:00:29.939> real<00:00:30.119> thing<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.900> should<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.710> apply

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the real thing you should you just apply

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.060 
the real thing you should you just apply
a<00:00:32.099> downward<00:00:32.399> pressure<00:00:32.820> I'll<00:00:33.120> put<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.530> very<00:00:34.530> tip

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
a downward pressure I'll put a very tip

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.280 
a downward pressure I'll put a very tip
of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> site<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.630> give<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> real<00:00:37.200> word<00:00:37.910> tap

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
of the site and give it a real word tap

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
of the site and give it a real word tap
and<00:00:40.290> I'll<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.590> slide<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and I'll just slide right on we're in

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
and I'll just slide right on we're in
this<00:00:42.270> case<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.660> why<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.680> thing

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
this case so why off because this thing

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.950 
this case so why off because this thing
is<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:45.020> but<00:00:46.020> anyways<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.750> these<00:00:48.750> two

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is so like but anyways so these two

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.150 
is so like but anyways so these two
things<00:00:49.289> would<00:00:50.039> engage<00:00:51.110> long<00:00:52.110> channels<00:00:52.800> cut

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
things would engage long channels cut

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.590 
things would engage long channels cut
into<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:54.379> cut<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> rear<00:00:55.860> sight<00:00:56.070> block

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
into two cut into the rear sight block

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.849 
into two cut into the rear sight block
and<00:00:57.600> now<00:00:57.690> enter<00:00:58.020> through<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> large<00:00:58.590> hole<00:00:58.829> in

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and now enter through the large hole in

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
and now enter through the large hole in
the<00:00:59.100> bottom<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.030> spring<00:01:00.690> would

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the bottom right here and spring would

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
the bottom right here and spring would
basically<00:01:01.440> lift<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.129> into<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> smaller

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
basically lift it up into a smaller

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
basically lift it up into a smaller
notch<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> uh<00:01:03.629> walking<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.769> place<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
notch and uh walking in place and to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.810 
notch and uh walking in place and to
take<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> spring<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.520> give<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
take the spring out just give it a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.609 
take the spring out just give it a
little<00:01:08.970> lift<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:11.850> comes<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.270> off

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
little lift and just comes right off

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.060 
little lift and just comes right off
like<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> vent<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.549> basically<00:01:15.150> uh

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
like that so the vent with basically uh

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
like that so the vent with basically uh
engaged<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.310> hole<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.229> lock<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.380> place

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
engaged in that hole and lock in place

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
engaged in that hole and lock in place
using<00:01:19.830> its<00:01:20.070> own<00:01:20.159> spring<00:01:20.759> tension<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.549> put

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
using its own spring tension and it put

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
using its own spring tension and it put
it<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.409> reverse<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> step<00:01:27.920> slide<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it back just reverse the step slide it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.460 
it back just reverse the step slide it
in<00:01:29.189> place<00:01:29.340> until<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.119> should<00:01:30.900> feel<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
in place until you should feel the the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.530 
in place until you should feel the the
no<00:01:34.470> dent<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:35.070> over<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.729> hump<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
no dent going over that hump and get it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.200 
no dent going over that hump and get it
whole<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.400> slide

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
whole and then you would have slide

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 
whole and then you would have slide
enough<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:40.979> telling<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> keep<00:01:41.549> your

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
enough so I'm telling you keep your

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.810 
enough so I'm telling you keep your
click<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.190 

other<00:01:48.820> than<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.090> that's<00:01:49.509> pretty<00:01:49.689> much<00:01:49.990> about

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
other than that that's pretty much about

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.980 
other than that that's pretty much about
it<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.909> plan<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.509> have<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.810> thing

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
it and the plan is to have this thing

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.520 
it and the plan is to have this thing
finished<00:01:53.820> by<00:01:55.140> Christmas<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.350> I'm<00:01:59.409> about

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
finished by Christmas and so I'm about

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.029 
finished by Christmas and so I'm about
coupling<00:01:59.979> my<00:02:00.130> weeks<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:02.259> after<00:02:02.740> I'm<00:02:02.829> sitting

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
coupling my weeks and after I'm sitting

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.880 
coupling my weeks and after I'm sitting
with<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.220> finals<00:02:04.259> she'd<00:02:05.259> be<00:02:05.350> able<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.560> work<00:02:05.740> on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
with the finals she'd be able to work on

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.749 
with the finals she'd be able to work on
this<00:02:06.039> more<00:02:06.220> often

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
this more often

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.180 
this more often
and<00:02:07.659> try<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> get<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.170> done<00:02:08.440> as<00:02:08.800> fast<00:02:08.979> as

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
and try to get it done as fast as

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.960 
and try to get it done as fast as
possible<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:13.140> that's<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.470> mg42<00:02:14.980> I'm

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
possible and that's for the mg42 I'm

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.699 
possible and that's for the mg42 I'm
actually<00:02:16.180> holding<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.750> off<00:02:16.870> from<00:02:17.080> some<00:02:17.290> finish

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
actually holding it off from some finish

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.280 
actually holding it off from some finish
like<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:17.950> says<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.310> kay<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.299> I<00:02:19.510> can

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
like this says a kay just so that I can

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.039 
like this says a kay just so that I can
get<00:02:20.530> more<00:02:20.709> practice<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.420> before<00:02:23.019> I

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
get more practice out of this before I

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.000 
get more practice out of this before I
move<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> ng<00:02:23.920> 42<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:26.019> I'm<00:02:26.230> hoping<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.920> a
