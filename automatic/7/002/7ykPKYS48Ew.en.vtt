made is having the subject looking
toward<00:00:30.649> you're<00:00:30.770> looking<00:00:30.980> away<00:00:31.099> having<00:00:32.000> a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
conversation getting different moods and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.790 
conversation getting different moods and
if<00:00:34.160> I<00:00:34.340> am<00:00:34.430> constantly<00:00:34.969> distracted<00:00:35.899> by<00:00:36.050> my

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
if I am constantly distracted by my

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.010 
if I am constantly distracted by my
light<00:00:37.100> I'm<00:00:37.820> not<00:00:38.210> going<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.510> get<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.750> image

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
light I'm not going to get the image

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.840 
light I'm not going to get the image
that<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:39.230> want<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.219> need<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.430> be<00:00:40.520> able<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.670> come

that I want so I need to be able to come

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.459 
that I want so I need to be able to come
in<00:00:41.059> set<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.570> light<00:00:41.750> get<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.110> exposure

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
in set the light get the exposure

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.649 
in set the light get the exposure
exactly<00:00:43.159> the<00:00:43.309> way<00:00:43.429> I<00:00:43.460> want<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:43.789> set<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.210> ratios

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
exactly the way I want it set the ratios

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.630 
exactly the way I want it set the ratios
and<00:00:44.929> then<00:00:45.320> trust<00:00:45.679> that<00:00:45.920> my<00:00:46.070> equipment<00:00:46.550> is

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
and then trust that my equipment is

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.700 
and then trust that my equipment is
calibrated<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.300> perfect<00:00:47.749> and<00:00:47.960> then<00:00:48.530> those

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
calibrated and perfect and then those

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.110 
calibrated and perfect and then those
images<00:00:49.069> are<00:00:49.249> going<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.460> be<00:00:49.519> correct<00:00:49.909> and

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
images are going to be correct and

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.489 
images are going to be correct and
that's<00:00:50.329> what<00:00:50.539> happens<00:00:50.899> when<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.199> have<00:00:51.469> a

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
that's what happens when I have a

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.549 
that's what happens when I have a
properly<00:00:51.920> calibrated<00:00:52.159> light<00:00:52.879> meter<00:00:53.559> this

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
properly calibrated light meter this

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.709 
properly calibrated light meter this
lighting<00:00:54.800> setup<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:55.429> use<00:00:55.460> speed<00:00:55.909> lights<00:00:56.179> I<00:00:56.479> can

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
lighting setup I use speed lights I can

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.779 
lighting setup I use speed lights I can
use<00:00:56.839> 4<00:00:57.079> speed<00:00:57.379> lights<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.920> first<00:00:58.219> was<00:00:58.460> our<00:00:58.579> key

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
use 4 speed lights the first was our key

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.090 
use 4 speed lights the first was our key
light<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.569> I<00:00:59.719> used<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.960> small<00:01:00.229> softbox<00:01:00.649> with<00:01:00.920> an

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
light and I used a small softbox with an

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.309 
light and I used a small softbox with an
egg<00:01:01.339> crate<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:02.210> make<00:01:02.359> sure<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.539> got<00:01:02.839> nice<00:01:03.079> soft

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
egg crate to make sure I got nice soft

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.890 
egg crate to make sure I got nice soft
light<00:01:03.649> on<00:01:03.949> our<00:01:04.250> models<00:01:04.610> face<00:01:04.850> without<00:01:05.479> getting

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
light on our models face without getting

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.260 
light on our models face without getting
a<00:01:06.020> spill<00:01:06.440> onto<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:07.340> back<00:01:07.520> wall<00:01:07.820> which<00:01:08.090> was<00:01:08.240> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
a spill onto the back wall which was a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.420 
a spill onto the back wall which was a
white<00:01:08.510> wall<00:01:08.720> now<00:01:09.409> that<00:01:09.590> created<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:09.979> wall<00:01:10.310> to

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
white wall now that created that wall to

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.610 
white wall now that created that wall to
fall<00:01:10.610> into<00:01:10.760> black<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:11.720> added<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.200> second

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
fall into black so I added a second

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.440 
fall into black so I added a second
light<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.159> illuminated<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.760> wall<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:14.360> I

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
light that illuminated the wall but I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.720 
light that illuminated the wall but I
didn't<00:01:14.660> want<00:01:14.840> just<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:15.080> whitewash<00:01:15.650> I<00:01:16.070> wanted<00:01:16.670> to

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
didn't want just a whitewash I wanted to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.550 
didn't want just a whitewash I wanted to
sort<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:16.880> have<00:01:17.030> been<00:01:17.180> yet<00:01:17.510> so<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:17.960> put<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.140> grid<00:01:18.410> on

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
sort of have been yet so I put a grid on

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.130 
sort of have been yet so I put a grid on
that<00:01:18.710> light<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.490> give<00:01:19.730> a<00:01:19.760> nice<00:01:20.060> sort<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.780> halo

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
that light to give a nice sort of a halo

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.870 
that light to give a nice sort of a halo
behind<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.560> model<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.040> let<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.430> fall<00:01:22.700> into

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
behind the model and let that fall into

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.150 
behind the model and let that fall into
darkness<00:01:23.240> around<00:01:23.510> her<00:01:23.870> but<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.560> also<00:01:24.740> wanted<00:01:25.100> to

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
darkness around her but I also wanted to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.800 
darkness around her but I also wanted to
really<00:01:25.400> separate<00:01:25.910> her<00:01:26.120> hair<00:01:26.330> from<00:01:26.480> the<00:01:26.660> wall

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
really separate her hair from the wall

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.530 
really separate her hair from the wall
as<00:01:27.020> well<00:01:27.230> so<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.920> put<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.490> another<00:01:29.060> speed<00:01:29.360> light

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
as well so I put a another speed light

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.170 
as well so I put a another speed light
with<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.840> snoot<00:01:30.260> on<00:01:30.770> her<00:01:31.070> hair<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.580> that<00:01:31.940> just

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
with the snoot on her hair and that just

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.790 
with the snoot on her hair and that just
gives<00:01:32.330> us<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.570> traditional<00:01:33.140> separation<00:01:33.320> light

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
gives us a traditional separation light

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.040 
gives us a traditional separation light
on<00:01:33.980> her<00:01:34.130> hair<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:35.030> snoot<00:01:35.360> made<00:01:35.660> sure<00:01:35.900> that

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
on her hair and a snoot made sure that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.930 
on her hair and a snoot made sure that
no<00:01:36.230> light<00:01:36.470> spilt<00:01:36.830> into<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.220> lens<00:01:37.430> giving<00:01:37.730> us<00:01:37.850> a

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
no light spilt into the lens giving us a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.580 
no light spilt into the lens giving us a
lens<00:01:38.150> flare<00:01:38.420> then<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:38.990> last<00:01:39.170> thing<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.410> wanted

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
lens flare then the last thing I wanted

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.770 
lens flare then the last thing I wanted
to<00:01:39.710> do<00:01:39.830> was<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.220> really<00:01:40.460> chisel<00:01:41.060> her<00:01:41.210> cheekbone

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
to do was to really chisel her cheekbone

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.960 
to do was to really chisel her cheekbone
and<00:01:42.350> contrast<00:01:43.010> that<00:01:43.070> soft<00:01:43.460> light<00:01:43.670> from<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
and contrast that soft light from the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.540 
and contrast that soft light from the
soft<00:01:44.210> lock<00:01:44.480> so<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:44.750> used<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.320> fourth<00:01:45.980> speed<00:01:46.310> light

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
soft lock so I used a fourth speed light

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.150 
soft lock so I used a fourth speed light
with<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> grid<00:01:47.480> and<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.470> was<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.710> hard<00:01:48.950> like

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
with a grid and it was just hard like

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.450 
with a grid and it was just hard like
coming<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.640> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
coming in and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.399 
coming in and
highlighting<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.000> cheekbone<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.260> got

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
highlighting that cheekbone so we got

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.780 
highlighting that cheekbone so we got
this<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.590> nice<00:01:52.860> shape<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.430> gave<00:01:53.610> us<00:01:53.760> some

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
this a nice shape that gave us some

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.460 
this a nice shape that gave us some
depth<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.440> results<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.890> got

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
depth I really like the results we got

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.109 
depth I really like the results we got
so<00:01:58.470> in<00:01:58.740> addition<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.190> just<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.640> ease<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.790> use

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
so in addition to just the ease of use

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.490 
so in addition to just the ease of use
of<00:02:00.150> being<00:02:00.479> able<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> dial<00:02:00.900> in<00:02:01.050> power<00:02:01.320> right

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
of being able to dial in power right

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.040 
of being able to dial in power right
from<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.979> meter<00:02:02.220> there's<00:02:02.610> times<00:02:03.030> when<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.960> can

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
from the meter there's times when it can

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.300 
from the meter there's times when it can
really<00:02:04.290> make<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.440> difference<00:02:04.560> between<00:02:04.979> making

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
really make a difference between making

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
really make a difference between making
and<00:02:05.610> breaking<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.000> set<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.330> specifically<00:02:07.080> in

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and breaking the set up specifically in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380 
and breaking the set up specifically in
this<00:02:07.380> set<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.920> had<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> light<00:02:08.850> with<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> snoot

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
this set up I had a light with the snoot

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.840 
this set up I had a light with the snoot
and<00:02:09.630> two<00:02:09.840> lights<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.229> grids<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.860> they're

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and two lights with grids and they're

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.729 
and two lights with grids and they're
finicky<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.959> move<00:02:13.140> those<00:02:13.350> just<00:02:13.650> a

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
finicky so if you move those just a

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.590 
finicky so if you move those just a
little<00:02:14.010> bit<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.880> gonna<00:02:15.030> throw<00:02:15.330> off<00:02:15.390> where

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
little bit it's gonna throw off where

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.990 
little bit it's gonna throw off where
that<00:02:15.750> light<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.140> falling<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.850> have

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that light is falling and so if you have

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.180 
that light is falling and so if you have
to<00:02:18.120> lower<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.630> light<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.260> make<00:02:20.069> an

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
to lower that light and make an

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
to lower that light and make an
adjustment<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.450> speed<00:02:21.720> light<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.110> raise

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
adjustment on the speed light and raise

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.229 
adjustment on the speed light and raise
it<00:02:22.440> up<00:02:22.560> then<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.730> basically<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
it up then you can basically have to

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.030 
it up then you can basically have to
start<00:02:24.300> from<00:02:24.600> scratch<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.920> gonna

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
start from scratch because you're gonna

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.290 
start from scratch because you're gonna
figure<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.340> where<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.700> light<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:26.910> make<00:02:27.269> sure

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
figure out where that light is make sure

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.240 
figure out where that light is make sure
it's<00:02:27.420> falling<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.290> person's<00:02:28.620> head<00:02:28.830> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
it's falling on the person's head and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.360 
it's falling on the person's head and
then<00:02:29.790> three<00:02:30.390> meter<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.780> go<00:02:30.930> again<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:32.010> even

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
then three meter and go again and even

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.650 
then three meter and go again and even
if<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.790> don't<00:02:32.910> lower<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.360> light<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.630> just

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
if you don't lower that light you just

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.570 
if you don't lower that light you just
change<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> power<00:02:34.560> output<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.280> some<00:02:35.489> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
change the power output with some of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.190 
change the power output with some of
those<00:02:35.670> snoots<00:02:36.030> they're<00:02:36.269> cloth<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:36.989> can

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
those snoots they're cloth and they can

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
those snoots they're cloth and they can
they<00:02:37.709> can<00:02:37.860> move<00:02:37.980> around<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.970> mess<00:02:39.090> up

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
they can move around so you can mess up

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.210 
they can move around so you can mess up
your<00:02:39.300> lighting<00:02:39.660> just<00:02:39.870> by<00:02:40.080> adjusting<00:02:41.040> things

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
your lighting just by adjusting things

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.850 
your lighting just by adjusting things
so<00:02:41.700> with<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> meter<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:43.140> great<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.739> can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
so with the meter it's great you can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.900 
so with the meter it's great you can
just<00:02:44.010> meter<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.459> things<00:02:44.640> need<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.820> change

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
just meter it if things need to change

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.940 
just meter it if things need to change
to<00:02:45.269> change<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.570> right<00:02:45.600> there<00:02:45.930> you're<00:02:46.170> done<00:02:46.320> in

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
to change it right there you're done in

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.259 
to change it right there you're done in
this<00:02:47.100> lighting<00:02:47.400> setup<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.760> used<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.060> single

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
this lighting setup I used a single

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.300 
this lighting setup I used a single
light<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:49.110> silver<00:02:49.410> reflector<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.100> used

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
light and a silver reflector and I used

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.490 
light and a silver reflector and I used
a<00:02:50.459> four<00:02:50.760> by<00:02:50.880> six<00:02:50.910> softbox<00:02:51.720> with<00:02:51.959> continuous

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
a four by six softbox with continuous

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.670 
a four by six softbox with continuous
light<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.700> set<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> softbox<00:02:54.780> horizontally

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
light and I set the softbox horizontally

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.270 
light and I set the softbox horizontally
and<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.670> light<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.600> wrapping<00:02:57.930> around

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
and that light is just wrapping around

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.920 
and that light is just wrapping around
with<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.370> silver<00:02:59.790> reflector<00:03:00.360> nice<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
with that silver reflector nice and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.039 
with that silver reflector nice and
close<00:03:01.200> or<00:03:01.920> getting<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:02.670> nice<00:03:02.940> soft<00:03:03.360> soft

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
close or getting is just nice soft soft

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.550 
close or getting is just nice soft soft
light<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.860> love<00:03:05.130> shooting

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
light I love shooting

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680 
light I love shooting
that<00:03:06.680> kind<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:06.980> an<00:03:07.400> environment<00:03:07.670> because<00:03:08.209> you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
that kind of an environment because you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.050 
that kind of an environment because you
can<00:03:08.810> see<00:03:09.020> what<00:03:09.140> you're<00:03:09.230> gonna<00:03:09.349> get<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.220> you

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
can see what you're gonna get and you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.790 
can see what you're gonna get and you
can<00:03:11.209> also<00:03:11.330> shoot<00:03:11.630> very<00:03:11.989> very<00:03:12.260> quickly<00:03:12.590> you

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
can also shoot very very quickly you

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.020 
can also shoot very very quickly you
don't<00:03:12.920> have<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.069> wait<00:03:13.220> for<00:03:13.250> flashes<00:03:13.880> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
don't have to wait for flashes to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.940 
don't have to wait for flashes to
recycle<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:15.020> just<00:03:15.230> something<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.530> allows

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
recycle it's just something that allows

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.820 
recycle it's just something that allows
me<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:17.510> really<00:03:17.870> start<00:03:18.080> interacting<00:03:18.349> and

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
me to to really start interacting and

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.650 
me to to really start interacting and
creating<00:03:19.220> photos<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.270> really<00:03:20.420> go

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
creating photos and I can really go

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.940 
creating photos and I can really go
through<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.930> range<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.260> emotions<00:03:21.470> really

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
through a range of emotions really

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.949 
through a range of emotions really
quickly<00:03:22.520> without<00:03:23.000> having<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.599> wait<00:03:23.750> for

quickly without having to wait for
things<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.290> recycle<00:03:24.500> again<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.550> change<00:03:25.790> this

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
things to recycle again and change this

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.570 
things to recycle again and change this
in<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.720> shot<00:03:26.959> specifically<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.920> am<00:03:27.980> metering

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
in this shot specifically I am metering

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.339 
in this shot specifically I am metering
for<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:28.970> highlights<00:03:29.390> because<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.140> want<00:03:30.290> to

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
for the highlights because I want to

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.809 
for the highlights because I want to
capture<00:03:30.530> all<00:03:31.040> those<00:03:31.160> highlights<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.640> ensure

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
capture all those highlights and ensure

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.000 
capture all those highlights and ensure
nothing<00:03:32.180> falls<00:03:32.450> out<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.590> range<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.860> my

that<00:03:36.260> specifically<00:03:36.980> with<00:03:37.099> one<00:03:37.340> light<00:03:37.550> source

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
that specifically with one light source

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.090 
that specifically with one light source
you<00:03:38.510> can<00:03:38.690> change<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.380> direction<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:40.040> your

you can change the direction of your

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.740 
you can change the direction of your

the shadows or get the good average
between<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.280> two<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.819> can<00:03:46.970> get<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.269> best

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
between the two and can get the best

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.240 
between the two and can get the best
compromise<00:03:47.750> now<00:03:48.470> if<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.620> do<00:03:48.739> things<00:03:48.980> right

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
compromise now if you do things right

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.400 
compromise now if you do things right
with<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.299> reflector<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:51.140> can<00:03:51.260> make<00:03:51.380> sure

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
with the reflector you can make sure

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.720 
with the reflector you can make sure
that<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.739> compress<00:03:52.069> everything<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.580> fall

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
that you compress everything to fall

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.729 
that you compress everything to fall
within<00:03:52.970> about<00:03:53.269> anything<00:03:53.480> camera<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.709> don't

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
within about anything camera you don't

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.259 
within about anything camera you don't
have<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.099> make<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> compromise<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:56.060> those

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
have to make a compromise and those

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.610 
have to make a compromise and those
shadows<00:03:56.840> or<00:03:57.019> these<00:03:57.140> highlights<00:03:57.470> and

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
shadows or these highlights and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.289 
shadows or these highlights and
everything<00:03:58.220> I<00:03:58.459> wanted<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.849> make<00:03:59.030> sure<00:03:59.180> that

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
everything I wanted to make sure that

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.600 
everything I wanted to make sure that
was<00:03:59.450> happening<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.440> I'm<00:04:00.650> eager<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.980> keep<00:04:01.489> the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
was happening so I'm eager to keep the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.580 
was happening so I'm eager to keep the
highlights<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.480> then<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.750> brought<00:04:03.230> in<00:04:03.440> that

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
highlights and then I brought in that

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.000 
highlights and then I brought in that
reflected<00:04:04.099> nature

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
reflected nature

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.009 
reflected nature
so<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:06.909> is<00:04:07.060> something<00:04:07.329> that<00:04:07.359> was<00:04:07.659> a<00:04:07.689> happy

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
so this is something that was a happy

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.890 
so this is something that was a happy
accident<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.670> shot<00:04:10.120> straight<00:04:10.540> into<00:04:10.780> that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
accident and I shot straight into that

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.050 
accident and I shot straight into that
light<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.680> because<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.129> exactly<00:04:12.670> where<00:04:12.969> the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
light and because of exactly where the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.369 
light and because of exactly where the
model<00:04:13.359> was<00:04:13.540> bridging<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.200> gap<00:04:14.349> between

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
model was bridging the gap between

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.370 
model was bridging the gap between
softbox<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.489> seamless<00:04:15.909> paper<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.840> gave<00:04:17.049> us<00:04:17.199> a

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
softbox and seamless paper it gave us a

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.430 
softbox and seamless paper it gave us a
nice<00:04:18.160> perfect<00:04:18.489> even<00:04:18.989> transition<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.380> you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
nice perfect even transition so you

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.620 
nice perfect even transition so you
can't<00:04:20.739> tell<00:04:21.009> where<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.699> seamless<00:04:22.240> paper<00:04:22.360> or

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
can't tell where the seamless paper or

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.740 
can't tell where the seamless paper or
reflection<00:04:23.139> starts<00:04:23.470> inward<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:24.009> the<00:04:24.220> over

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
reflection starts inward just the over

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.999 
reflection starts inward just the over
exposed<00:04:25.750> light<00:04:26.259> coming<00:04:26.560> straight<00:04:26.680> into<00:04:26.830> the

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
exposed light coming straight into the

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.060 
exposed light coming straight into the
lens<00:04:27.220> starts<00:04:27.759> I<00:04:28.090> wanted<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.690> get<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.139> look<00:04:29.410> that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
lens starts I wanted to get a look that

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.659 
lens starts I wanted to get a look that
look<00:04:30.310> like<00:04:30.520> ambient<00:04:31.389> natural<00:04:32.259> sunlight<00:04:32.680> where

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
look like ambient natural sunlight where

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.390 
look like ambient natural sunlight where
that<00:04:34.060> strong<00:04:34.750> background<00:04:35.349> light<00:04:35.560> was<00:04:36.099> maybe

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
that strong background light was maybe

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.070 
that strong background light was maybe
the<00:04:36.550> Sun<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.000> then<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.150> was<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.270> filling<00:04:37.660> with

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
the Sun and then I was just filling with

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.390 
the Sun and then I was just filling with
the<00:04:38.110> beauty<00:04:38.440> dish<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.919> that's<00:04:39.039> really<00:04:39.160> what<00:04:39.370> I

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
the beauty dish and that's really what I

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.499 
the beauty dish and that's really what I
was<00:04:39.520> going<00:04:39.550> for<00:04:39.759> to<00:04:40.060> have<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.210> really<00:04:40.449> strong

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
was going for to have a really strong

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.870 
was going for to have a really strong
backlight<00:04:41.199> that<00:04:41.440> was<00:04:41.530> beautiful<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.310> then

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
backlight that was beautiful and then

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.400 
backlight that was beautiful and then
pop<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.419> in<00:04:43.509> some<00:04:43.660> light<00:04:43.810> with<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.960> beauty<00:04:44.259> dish

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
pop it in some light with a beauty dish

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.020 
pop it in some light with a beauty dish
to<00:04:44.650> make<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.889> look<00:04:45.099> not<00:04:45.400> like<00:04:45.610> we<00:04:45.820> are<00:04:45.880> in<00:04:45.970> a

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
to make it look not like we are in a

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.600 
to make it look not like we are in a
studio<00:04:46.270> I'm<00:04:47.020> also<00:04:47.199> I<00:04:47.380> love<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.860> fact<00:04:48.310> that<00:04:48.460> I

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
studio I'm also I love the fact that I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.629 
studio I'm also I love the fact that I
can<00:04:48.820> set<00:04:49.180> my<00:04:49.810> middle<00:04:50.470> gray<00:04:50.680> my<00:04:50.919> midpoint<00:04:51.430> and

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
can set my middle gray my midpoint and

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.409 
can set my middle gray my midpoint and
then<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.630> have<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.960> visual<00:04:53.440> readout<00:04:53.889> of<00:04:54.310> what<00:04:54.849> is

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
then I have a visual readout of what is

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.330 
then I have a visual readout of what is
going<00:04:55.599> to<00:04:55.630> happen<00:04:55.810> in<00:04:56.080> my<00:04:56.110> exposure<00:04:56.560> so<00:04:57.130> as<00:04:57.220> I'm

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
going to happen in my exposure so as I'm

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.339 
going to happen in my exposure so as I'm
taking<00:04:57.550> different<00:04:57.849> readings<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.599> see<00:04:58.840> if

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
taking different readings to see if

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.570 
taking different readings to see if
something<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.770> overexposed<00:05:00.400> or<00:05:00.520> underexposed

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
something is overexposed or underexposed

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.580 
something is overexposed or underexposed
by<00:05:01.389> metering<00:05:01.720> for<00:05:01.750> my<00:05:01.960> shadows<00:05:02.380> or<00:05:02.500> my

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
by metering for my shadows or my

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.040 
by metering for my shadows or my
highlights<00:05:03.009> I<00:05:03.160> can<00:05:03.310> see<00:05:03.460> visually<00:05:03.639> if<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.900> is

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
highlights I can see visually if that is

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.480 
highlights I can see visually if that is
going<00:05:05.289> to<00:05:05.410> be<00:05:05.500> within<00:05:05.680> my<00:05:06.009> camera's

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
going to be within my camera's

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.820 
going to be within my camera's
capability<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.690> if<00:05:07.810> it's<00:05:07.960> not<00:05:08.139> I<00:05:08.470> can<00:05:08.710> make

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
capability and if it's not I can make

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.740 
capability and if it's not I can make
changes<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.759> again<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.150> don't<00:05:10.270> have<00:05:10.449> to<00:05:10.599> take

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
changes and again I don't have to take

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.659 
changes and again I don't have to take
any<00:05:10.990> photos<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.919> see<00:05:12.099> if<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.310> have<00:05:12.460> anything

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
any photos to see if I have anything

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.460 
any photos to see if I have anything
blown<00:05:13.060> out<00:05:13.210> or<00:05:13.240> underexposed<00:05:13.599> from<00:05:14.110> losing

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
blown out or underexposed from losing

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.550 
blown out or underexposed from losing
detail<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:15.070> can<00:05:15.550> see<00:05:15.789> right<00:05:16.150> on<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.389> scale<00:05:16.659> that

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
detail I can see right on the scale that

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.890 
detail I can see right on the scale that
I<00:05:18.009> have<00:05:18.520> everything<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:19.000> I<00:05:19.150> need<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.780> that's

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
I have everything that I need and that's

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.629 
I have everything that I need and that's
that's<00:05:20.289> critical<00:05:20.860> for<00:05:20.889> a<00:05:21.070> shot<00:05:21.370> like<00:05:21.610> this

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
that's critical for a shot like this

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.899 
that's critical for a shot like this
where<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:23.039> you<00:05:24.039> need<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.250> make<00:05:24.460> sure<00:05:24.520> that<00:05:24.789> you

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
where you you need to make sure that you

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.999 
where you you need to make sure that you
can<00:05:25.030> still<00:05:25.389> see<00:05:25.659> the<00:05:25.780> details<00:05:26.229> with<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:26.860> much

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
can still see the details with so much

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.100 
can still see the details with so much
light<00:05:27.280> flooding<00:05:27.699> into<00:05:27.849> the<00:05:28.000> lens<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:28.960> can

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
light flooding into the lens and I can

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.270 
light flooding into the lens and I can
see<00:05:29.259> it<00:05:29.349> before<00:05:29.560> I<00:05:29.590> took<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.830> picture<00:05:30.070> that

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
see it before I took a picture that

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.080 
see it before I took a picture that
we're<00:05:30.430> going<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.610> be<00:05:30.699> safe

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
we're going to be safe

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.629 
we're going to be safe
to<00:05:32.690> Muhammad<00:05:33.080> Ali<00:05:33.169> has<00:05:33.590> a<00:05:33.620> quote<00:05:34.010> that<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.430> love

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
to Muhammad Ali has a quote that I love

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.150 
to Muhammad Ali has a quote that I love
and<00:05:35.030> he<00:05:35.389> said<00:05:35.720> I'm<00:05:36.199> paraphrasing<00:05:36.530> that's<00:05:37.040> what

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
and he said I'm paraphrasing that's what

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.770 
and he said I'm paraphrasing that's what
he<00:05:37.250> said<00:05:37.520> it's<00:05:37.850> not<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.060> mountains<00:05:38.510> ahead

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
he said it's not the mountains ahead

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.230 
he said it's not the mountains ahead
that<00:05:39.260> wears<00:05:39.500> out<00:05:39.800> its<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.699> pebble<00:05:41.060> in<00:05:41.210> your

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.670 
that wears out its the pebble in your
shoe<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.960> I<00:05:42.800> think<00:05:43.130> that<00:05:43.370> is<00:05:43.639> absolutely
