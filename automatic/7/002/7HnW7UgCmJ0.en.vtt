00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
here this is the hug snug that I got a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
here this is the hug snug that I got a
hundred<00:00:32.489> yards<00:00:32.879> of<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.269> and<00:00:33.420> I've<00:00:33.510> been<00:00:33.540> using

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
hundred yards of it and I've been using

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.100 
hundred yards of it and I've been using
it<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.220> some<00:00:35.850> stamping<00:00:36.780> upper

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

anchors<00:00:37.590> these<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.400> older<00:00:38.850> ones<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.390> think

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
anchors these are older ones I think

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.450 
anchors these are older ones I think
these<00:00:39.750> might<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:40.170> retired<00:00:40.559> colors<00:00:41.040> because<00:00:41.339> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
these might be retired colors because I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.920 
these might be retired colors because I
got<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> garage<00:00:42.059> sale<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.900> dollar

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and some Ziploc bags and then you need

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.770

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
of cool spots but it just didn't look

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.450 
of cool spots but it just didn't look
good<00:02:03.060> anyway<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.560> coffee<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> tea

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
good anyway so in the coffee and tea

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.210 
good anyway so in the coffee and tea
make<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> same<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.079> color<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.829> but

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
make the same kind of color as this but

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.830 
make the same kind of color as this but
it's<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:10.220> don't<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:12.600> didn't

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it's just not I don't know I just didn't

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.729 
it's just not I don't know I just didn't
think<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.140> set<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.769> well<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:16.440> ink

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
think it's set as well as that this ink

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.460 
think it's set as well as that this ink
does<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.630> added<00:02:18.989> more<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.320> there

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
does so I just added more in there

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.050 
does so I just added more in there
because<00:02:19.620> they've<00:02:19.920> died<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.459> much<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
because they've died so much of it I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.520 
because they've died so much of it I
thought<00:02:21.239> I'd<00:02:21.420> wanted<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.019> get<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.380> little

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
thought I'd wanted to get it a little

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.949 
thought I'd wanted to get it a little
darker<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.489> can<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.150> squish<00:02:24.389> it<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.720> like

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
darker so you can just squish it in like

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.220 
darker so you can just squish it in like
that<00:02:25.169> and<00:02:25.230> then<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.590> gets<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:26.010> through<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
that and then it gets all through the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.259 
that and then it gets all through the
seen<00:02:27.409> by<00:02:27.650> me<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:28.220> can<00:02:28.370> let<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.580> sit<00:02:28.700> for<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
seen by me and you can let it sit for a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.229 
seen by me and you can let it sit for a
while<00:02:29.480> if<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.959> want<00:02:29.989> but<00:02:30.920> once<00:02:31.190> it's<00:02:31.459> died<00:02:31.760> its

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
while if you want but once it's died its

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.860 
while if you want but once it's died its
died<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.930> doesn't<00:02:33.440> really<00:02:33.590> seem<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.540> lose<00:02:35.540> its

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
died it doesn't really seem to lose its

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.910 
died it doesn't really seem to lose its
color<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.280> then<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.519> just<00:02:37.849> pull<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.299> out<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.920> the
