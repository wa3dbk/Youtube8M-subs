this put it on the inside wrist wait 20
minutes<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.000> there's<00:02:09.209> no<00:02:09.450> reaction

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
minutes and if there's no reaction

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.920 
minutes and if there's no reaction
you're<00:02:10.590> good<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.009> move<00:02:11.190> forward<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.510> second

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you're good to move forward the second

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.309 
you're good to move forward the second
step

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
step

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.800 
step
you're<00:02:13.439> going<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> take<00:02:13.890> two<00:02:14.400> cups<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.909> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you're going to take two cups of the

you're going to take two cups of the
coconut<00:02:16.379> oil<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.890> you'll<00:02:17.459> melt<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
coconut oil and you'll melt it in the

coconut oil and you'll melt it in the
microwave<00:02:19.099> ten<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.310> twenty<00:02:20.639> seconds<00:02:21.709> then

microwave ten to twenty seconds then

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.069 
microwave ten to twenty seconds then
you're<00:02:22.859> going<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.099> add<00:02:23.310> 20<00:02:24.090> drops<00:02:24.389> of<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.900> tea

you're going to add 20 drops of the tea
tree<00:02:25.379> oil<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:27.090> tea<00:02:27.510> tree<00:02:27.780> oil<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.310> an

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
tree oil the tea tree oil is an

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.690 
tree oil the tea tree oil is an
insecticide<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.469> that's<00:02:31.769> why<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.219> combine

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
insecticide so that's why we combine

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.080 
insecticide so that's why we combine
this<00:02:32.939> so<00:02:33.599> 20<00:02:34.109> drops<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.889> two<00:02:35.579> cups<00:02:35.879> of

you're going to take the shower cap and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.530 
you're going to take the shower cap and
put<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.340> over<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.760> head<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.239> you're<00:03:09.329> going<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
put it over the head and you're going to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.240 
put it over the head and you're going to
want<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.810> leave<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.109> on<00:03:10.230> anywhere<00:03:10.769> from<00:03:10.829> eight

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
want to leave it on anywhere from eight

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.550 
want to leave it on anywhere from eight
to<00:03:11.400> twelve<00:03:11.669> out<00:03:11.849> because<00:03:12.150> lice<00:03:12.540> they<00:03:13.379> can

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
to twelve out because lice they can

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.250 
to twelve out because lice they can
actually<00:03:13.799> shut<00:03:14.370> down<00:03:14.400> their<00:03:14.909> system<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:16.109> up

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
actually shut down their system for up

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.189 
actually shut down their system for up
to<00:03:16.469> four<00:03:16.739> hours<00:03:17.099> at<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.370> time<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.389> figure<00:03:19.019> if

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
to four hours at a time so I figure if

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.699 
to four hours at a time so I figure if
you<00:03:19.379> double<00:03:20.009> that<00:03:20.639> time<00:03:21.030> if<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:22.259> do<00:03:22.319> happen

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
you double that time if they do happen

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.219 
you double that time if they do happen
to<00:03:22.949> shut<00:03:23.189> down<00:03:23.220> their<00:03:23.639> system<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.540> go<00:03:24.959> into

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
to shut down their system to go into

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.530 
to shut down their system to go into
survival<00:03:25.709> mode<00:03:25.889> they<00:03:26.609> can<00:03:26.759> only<00:03:26.970> do<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.329> for

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
survival mode they can only do it for

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.390 
survival mode they can only do it for
four<00:03:27.780> hours<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:28.620> once<00:03:28.889> they<00:03:29.099> wake<00:03:29.370> up

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
four hours so then once they wake up

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.539 
four hours so then once they wake up
they<00:03:30.209> actually<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.560> coconut<00:03:31.979> oil<00:03:32.129> will

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
they actually and the coconut oil will

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.149 
they actually and the coconut oil will
drowned<00:03:33.090> them<00:03:33.419> or<00:03:33.629> suffocate<00:03:34.199> them<00:03:34.439> and<00:03:34.680> then

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
drowned them or suffocate them and then

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.069 
drowned them or suffocate them and then
the<00:03:35.310> insecticide<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.209> course<00:03:36.449> will<00:03:36.659> kill<00:03:36.840> them

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
the insecticide of course will kill them

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.710 
the insecticide of course will kill them
I<00:03:37.290> typically<00:03:38.009> do<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.519> at<00:03:38.699> night<00:03:39.150> before<00:03:39.449> bed

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I typically do this at night before bed

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.849 
I typically do this at night before bed
so<00:03:40.680> when<00:03:40.889> you<00:03:40.949> wake<00:03:41.099> up<00:03:41.340> after<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.810> 8<00:03:43.259> to<00:03:43.560> 12

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
so when you wake up after the 8 to 12

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.789 
so when you wake up after the 8 to 12
hours<00:03:44.359> you're<00:03:45.359> going<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.780> rinse<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.319> coconut

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
hours you're going to rinse the coconut

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.339 
hours you're going to rinse the coconut
oil<00:03:47.009> and<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.939> tea<00:03:48.150> tree<00:03:48.389> oil<00:03:48.599> out<00:03:48.840> with<00:03:49.199> the

oil and the tea tree oil out with the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.860 
oil and the tea tree oil out with the
Listerine<00:03:49.979> the<00:03:50.549> reason<00:03:50.939> why<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> use<00:03:51.209> Listerine

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
Listerine the reason why I use Listerine

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170 
Listerine the reason why I use Listerine
is<00:03:52.109> because<00:03:52.379> it<00:03:52.500> has<00:03:52.620> alcohol<00:03:52.889> in<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.759> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
is because it has alcohol in it and the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.259 
is because it has alcohol in it and the
alcohol<00:03:54.599> is<00:03:54.780> going<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.169> loosen<00:03:55.680> up<00:03:55.829> any<00:03:56.189> of<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
alcohol is going to loosen up any of the

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.119 
alcohol is going to loosen up any of the
eggs<00:03:57.509> that<00:03:57.750> are<00:03:57.959> stuck<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.530> hair<00:03:58.829> shaft

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
eggs that are stuck to the hair shaft

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.119 
eggs that are stuck to the hair shaft
and<00:03:59.540> also<00:04:00.540> dissolve<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.139> casing<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.889> eggs

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
and also dissolve the casing of the eggs

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.149 
and also dissolve the casing of the eggs
also<00:04:02.609> this<00:04:03.359> has<00:04:03.599> eucalyptus<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:04.500> menthol<00:04:04.889> and

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
also this has eucalyptus and menthol and

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.899 
also this has eucalyptus and menthol and
both<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.639> those<00:04:06.030> also<00:04:06.689> insecticides<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.280> after

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
both of those also insecticides so after

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.490 
both of those also insecticides so after
you<00:04:09.030> rinse<00:04:09.329> your<00:04:09.419> hair<00:04:09.840> you're<00:04:10.319> going<00:04:10.439> to

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
you rinse your hair you're going to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.069 
you rinse your hair you're going to
leave<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:10.979> on<00:04:11.159> for<00:04:11.250> about<00:04:11.729> 15<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.449> 20<00:04:12.780> minutes

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
leave this on for about 15 to 20 minutes

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.589 
leave this on for about 15 to 20 minutes
so<00:04:13.259> that<00:04:13.409> it<00:04:13.500> can<00:04:13.650> work<00:04:13.859> its<00:04:14.069> magic<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.759> then

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
so that it can work its magic and then

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.370 
so that it can work its magic and then
you're<00:04:15.989> going<00:04:16.259> to<00:04:16.500> take<00:04:16.769> your<00:04:17.310> NIT<00:04:17.579> combs<00:04:17.880> and
