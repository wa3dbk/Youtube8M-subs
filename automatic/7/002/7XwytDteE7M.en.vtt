00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.179
 lololoshki and frost I remind you that the previous 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.090
 standoff was spoon iwangaya 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.520
 which you can see in the description 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 there is a link there but today also like 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 last time our battle will be decided 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 great akinator and poll group 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.840
 in contact with 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.879
 so get ready we start the conversation 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.480
 u unravel in turning and and our 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.940
 favourite 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.340
 akinator so we immediately transfer to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 he went well friends that we are in 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.949
 our favorite movie tare and we already 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.649
 first question 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.710
 I will note that I now make a spoon in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.840
 last time we found it in about 20 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.629
 questions let's see how much we 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 we find and now it is not related to oil 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.950
 how did ivangai okay go yes actually 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.950
 all your character has licenses 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.369
 minecraft has minecraft licenses 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.080
 whether your character is pumped up 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 team their capital is irrelevant 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.630
 more than a million this is the sixth 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:28.790
 question student yes and is not related to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:32.310
 robots and well, well, 10 questions he found 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.159
 10 questions gentlemen is fast 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.200
 it's very fast actually watching 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.259
 we guessed thanks and this character was 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.450
 played back over 111 thousand times now in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.040
 the battle I will take into account this criterion 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.960
 because it still affects 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.920
 popularity actually we compare 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.909
 in popularity and not only well you me 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.950
 understand yes more than 111 thousand times I 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:06.110
 remember that number my head and now 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:09.140
 we are we who we are looking for just go 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.060
 so frost this character is not related 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.840
 oil is minecraft license is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.210
 communication with the port 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.990
 I think after this question he is already 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.840
 I guess he cat I do not know if he has 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.140
 cat guys like to eat yes if then for 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.840
 the lowest frost of animals is just the growth and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:36.890
 animal no such animal pumped up 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.850
 body you are right for quality is excellent two 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.580
 question to a number is pet i 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.800

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.690

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.640

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.010
 I know and I mean, there is no scarf about scarf 11 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.580
 questions use the network vkontakte about 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.390
 warface 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.239
 oh no no your you watched the cartoon 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.209
 cartoon with this character 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.230
 just but if by name then there 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.320
 cold heart 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.739
 froz no not looked because no 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.280
 such a movie players are a farce character with 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.280
 frost 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.760
 but you can also play itself yah 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.270
 okay no, your character is connected to the game 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.000
 minecraft 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.430
 yes your connected still eats don't know your 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.170
 the character is no prototype yet 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.290
 like your character from thailand god 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.320
 jesus and not this 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.240
 No, your character is connected to the game lights 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.070
 but if it passes but let's say it should 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.680
 it does not remove counter-strike 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.080
 quest and suede so i don't know either 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.750
 whether your character year okay let u 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.070
 frost is a cat I don't know forgive me 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.310
 guys but let's say there is 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:24.580
 but he should make everyone laugh yes yes well 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:31.150
 it frost my lord guessed and 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:35.930
 look he was played back more or more 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.120
 124 thousand times it's for a minute at 13 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.140
 thousand more than the spoon of the researcher 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.890
 according to akinator frost more popular 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.620
 spoons and he wins battle 10 but 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.200
 Gentlemen, as usual it's not all because 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.200
 the most important thing will be the VKontakte group on 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.960
 which is a reference to the bottom of the survey where 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.020
 you guess who is still more popular 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.820
 so friends the outcome of the battle depends 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.190
 only from you therefore vote in group 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.190
 in contact but I have nothing more to say 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.730
 except write your ideas for 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.380
 bits 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.800
 necessarily in the comments 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.960
 and maybe something we are and what we are 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.930
 the battle we actually spend well and swami 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.300
 I was buffy spoon and of course frost 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.040
 who today fought all good luck not 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.040
