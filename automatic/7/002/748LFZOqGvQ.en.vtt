00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 about the fact that people do not have individual 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.290
 metering devices will pay more 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.570
 say not the first year now before 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.420
 moments left a few weeks from 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.429
 January 1, 2015 comes into force 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.920
 Russian government regulations 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.210
 which involves raising 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.580
 utilities consumption standards 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.340
 services simply put those who do not have 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.140
 counters for hot and cold water with 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.539
 the new year is probably not nice 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.939
 be surprised by digital payment receipts 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 about the new rules residents began to learn 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.750
 from the ads of their attendants 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.030
 companies and sometimes they wore 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.950
 ultimatum they clarify the character 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.750
 however in the city management company 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.309
 assured is not arbitrariness about 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
 compliance with federal requirements 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.920
 legislation ruling 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.719
 Government number 344 of April 16 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.850
 2013 claims exactly such 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.320
 procedure for raising standards by 10 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.660
 percent from January 1 to July 21 and already with 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.699
 40 percent of such measures in 2016 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.010
 legislators will encourage 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 population preserve energy as well 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.930
 will make payment of utilities more 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 just happens apartment lives 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.979
 one person we charge one 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.450
 man and in fact there is registered 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.400
 one and live 5 people 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.210
 why even the rest of the tenants should 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.170
 how to pay for them is therefore logical 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.299
 install individual metering devices 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 Moreover, today their cost 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.950
 different price can be looked at 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 sites everywhere public utilities explain 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.670
 all checks really help save 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.409
 simple calculation is now the consumption rate 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.409
 cold water per person 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.630
 is just over seven and a half 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.909
 cubic meters per month or 250 liters per day 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.100
 it turns out that according to the standard of the family 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.560
 four people a day use a thousand 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.810
 liters of cold water even 700 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 hot if you translate these numbers to 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.100
 due to trouble no one is cold water 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.579
 costs the family more than 400 rubles per 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.740
 month 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.540
 the hot cost of which consists of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.880
 proper water and and heating up 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.979
 the required temperature is poured almost 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 in one thousand eight hundred rubles, however, to 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.670
 really spend so much water and her 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.860
 need to pour almost all day say 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.869
 specialists at the same time some people 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.069
 fear that after the general activity 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.729
 installing meters 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.470
 management company can 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.390
 raise tariffs and in the end no 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.310
 savings will not work but experts 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.220
 consider that suspicions are not substantiated 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.510
 because their growing responsibilities 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.110
 federal government federal service 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.060
 according to tariffs 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.150
 annually set the top bar 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.829
 growth rate 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.269
 to certain types of utilities 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.099
 above this bar tariffs Russia can not 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.689
 by definition plus everything on 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.090
 regional level governor 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.220
 approves the growth limit for fees 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.860
 utilities from acne fare on 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.319
 consumption is higher and higher, respectively 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.599
 a certain level so also means 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.370
 are compensated from the budget therefore also in 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.260
 this meaning is protected by the way 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.540
 announced 10 percent this 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.159
 government recommended increase 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.620
 but regions have the right to 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.870
 need to increase this ratio 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.540
 MP Yury Shvidky member of the committee 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.639
 For with the supervising questions housing and communal services considers that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.280
 not every such right is imperative 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.849
 use we proceed from the possibilities 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.250
 residents of Krasnoyarsk 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.170
 mean relevant especially understanding 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.780
 today's situation of today and 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.299
 understanding the conditions in which he lives 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.700
 residents of their family component 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.099
 budget has those enterprises where not 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.230
 work so we assume it means but 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.450
 of bitter grass blend so how much 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.430
 it will rise utility standards 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.410
 services and how it is reflected in the bills 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.690
 this issue is still under review 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.889
