00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you just have to take the time to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
you just have to take the time to
program<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> which<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.649> don't<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
program in which I don't have a lot of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
program in which I don't have a lot of
patience<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
patience for that so I just go with a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.560 
patience for that so I just go with a
lot<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> pre-programmed<00:00:46.200> stuff<00:00:46.879> but<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.360> show

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
lot of pre-programmed stuff but to show

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.630 
lot of pre-programmed stuff but to show
you<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.140> few<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.530> facts<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you just a few of the facts on here I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.779 
you just a few of the facts on here I
have<00:00:52.910> pressure<00:00:53.910> distortion<00:00:54.840> chorus<00:00:55.789> delay

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
have pressure distortion chorus delay

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.779 
have pressure distortion chorus delay
and<00:00:57.420> reverb<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.469> effect<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and reverb on this one effect here and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:14.460 
and reverb on this one effect here and
this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> how<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> sounds

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.289 

and<00:01:15.470> with<00:01:16.159> my<00:01:16.340> foot<00:01:16.549> pedal<00:01:16.850> over<00:01:16.909> here<00:01:17.150> I<00:01:17.180> could

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
and with my foot pedal over here I could

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.000 
and with my foot pedal over here I could
take<00:01:17.600> any<00:01:17.869> those<00:01:18.049> out<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.440> stuff<00:01:18.650> but<00:01:18.830> with

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
take any those out and stuff but with

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.680 
take any those out and stuff but with
this<00:01:19.159> in<00:01:19.369> here<00:01:19.549> I<00:01:19.580> pretty<00:01:19.970> much<00:01:20.180> leave<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.570> to

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
this in here I pretty much leave it to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.140 
this in here I pretty much leave it to
side<00:01:20.900> now<00:01:21.740> oh<00:01:22.009> my<00:01:22.159> drum<00:01:22.400> machine<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:22.729> having

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
side now oh my drum machine I having

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.550 
side now oh my drum machine I having
something<00:01:23.390> pre-programmed<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.110> here<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.500> I'm

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
something pre-programmed in here so I'm

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.840 
something pre-programmed in here so I'm
gonna<00:01:24.680> probably<00:01:24.830> just<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.190> small<00:01:25.460> piece<00:01:25.820> of

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
gonna probably just a small piece of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.850 
gonna probably just a small piece of
this<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.570> kind<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.960> give<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.229> ideal<00:01:27.619> how<00:01:27.830> I

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
this and kind of give you ideal how I

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.410 
this and kind of give you ideal how I
put<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.190> all<00:01:28.369> together<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.030> do<00:01:29.270> my

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
put it all together and do my

00:01:29.420 --> 00:02:23.489 
put it all together and do my
presentation

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:23.499 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.140 

as<00:02:24.499> you<00:02:24.769> can<00:02:24.889> see<00:02:25.129> it<00:02:25.340> makes<00:02:25.519> for<00:02:25.639> quite<00:02:25.819> Sam

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
as you can see it makes for quite Sam

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.940 
as you can see it makes for quite Sam
and<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.049> thing<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.069> get<00:02:28.549> true<00:02:29.920> not<00:02:30.920> just

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and the thing is is to get true not just

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.800 
and the thing is is to get true not just
be<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> copycat<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:32.030> some<00:02:32.209> money<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.569> stuff

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
be a copycat of some money and stuff

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.030 
be a copycat of some money and stuff
what<00:02:33.019> you<00:02:33.049> have<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.349> do<00:02:33.499> is<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.859> to<00:02:33.889> just

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
what you have to do is you have to just

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.890 
what you have to do is you have to just
play<00:02:34.340> something<00:02:34.879> like<00:02:34.909> dad's<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:35.510> over<00:02:35.780> and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
play something like dad's it's over and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.619 
play something like dad's it's over and
over<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.439> just<00:02:36.680> kind<00:02:36.859> of<00:02:37.159> let<00:02:38.000> yourself<00:02:38.420> go

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
over and just kind of let yourself go

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.910 
over and just kind of let yourself go
and<00:02:38.900> let<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.079> kind<00:02:39.859> of<00:02:39.950> feel<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.579> music<00:02:41.120> and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
and let you kind of feel the music and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.890 
and let you kind of feel the music and
make<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> situation<00:02:43.790> in<00:02:43.909> your<00:02:44.090> mind's<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:44.810> then
