00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 let yourself go 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.130
 and how is it so strange today is Tuesday and 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.130
 That's how it went 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.810
 Finally it was yesterday at a conference 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.029
 of graphic design and I could not do the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.560
 video there was also congress but I 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.040
 I stayed to be able to make the video for 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.040
 your 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.770
 they have never stopped to think how they had 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.470
 the announcements if they tell us the truth 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.290
 I do not know if they take us for fools or is 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.130
 that they really believe their balls 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.130
 obviously they take us for fools 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.600
 and well it was just to give them the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.500
 benefit of the doubt 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.500
 missions 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.780
 as are the ads for the dishwashers 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.450
 with 25,000 you only need one drop to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.940
 scrub all the slab and remain resident 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.010
 of clean so save more reaches you 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.600
 up to four hundred folded 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.119
 while with the competition of 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.920
 utility up to four fresh lose 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.250
 Well the truth is that if it saves you a 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.250
 heap 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.240
 25 thousand scrub as with any 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.399
 product of the competition but we 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.770
 we sell it more expensive to pay 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.710
 television advertising with only one 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.470
 drop and another drop and another drop and another drop 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.380
 and another drop cleaned like any other 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.540
 and spend more towels are also 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.700
 sanitary and if I already know that I am not 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.410
 woman but you do not have to be to know 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.790
 how difficult it is for these poor 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.920
 farms when they are in your life 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.290
 conscious free ultra plus line 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.619
 you will feel the freshness of leiber between your 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.420
 legs and you'll be happy you can sleep all 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.690
 the night without interruptions with the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.660
 security that gives you feel free 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.150
 and the ones in there like that if it's the rule what 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.600
 that this was to smoke and you have to 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.720
 to water 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.300

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.920
 conscious free ultra plus more equal 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.900
 you will have to change constantly 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.460
 what do you think we put portal back 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.590
 dimensional that disappears the street 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.630
 besides burdening pain as it is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.950
 usual in this situation and you will be happy 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.950
 as usual 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.230

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.739
 most embarrassing situation that has 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.930
 touched live 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.859

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.239
