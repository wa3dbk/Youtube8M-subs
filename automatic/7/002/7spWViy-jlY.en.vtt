mean like that just for a top part then
we're<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.190> roll<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.579> Tomatoes<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.540> we're

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we're gonna roll out Tomatoes so we're

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
we're gonna roll out Tomatoes so we're
gonna<00:00:39.780> draw<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> 9-year<00:00:40.649> bit<00:00:40.890> sticking<00:00:41.370> out

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
gonna draw a 9-year bit sticking out

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.560 
gonna draw a 9-year bit sticking out
okay

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
okay

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.799 
okay
they're<00:00:43.079> gonna<00:00:43.350> curve<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.289> like<00:00:47.570> this<00:00:48.570> will

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
they're gonna curve it in like this will

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
they're gonna curve it in like this will
represent<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.530> tomatoes<00:00:50.070> alright<00:00:50.489> destroy<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
represent the tomatoes alright destroy a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.880 
represent the tomatoes alright destroy a
circle<00:00:51.390> inside<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
circle inside of it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.729 
circle inside of it
okay<00:00:53.640> then<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.899> second<00:00:55.530> time

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
okay then we go to the second time

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.099 
okay then we go to the second time
tomato<00:00:56.340> will<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.730> sticking<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
tomato will be sticking out and this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.680 
tomato will be sticking out and this
part<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.489> draw<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> destroys<00:01:00.239> circle

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
part so we can draw it destroys circle

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.990 
part so we can draw it destroys circle
all<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.840> they're<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> circle<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.729> solve

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
all right they're not a circle and solve

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.320 
all right they're not a circle and solve
it<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.720> represent<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.250> second<00:01:08.790> layer<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it to represent the second layer of the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.260 
it to represent the second layer of the
tomato<00:01:10.340> okay<00:01:13.640> then<00:01:14.640> we're<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:14.970> working

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
tomato okay then we're going working

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
tomato okay then we're going working
this<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.290> reading<00:01:16.770> goes<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
this one and some reading goes to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.080 
this one and some reading goes to
represent<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.380> structure<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.640> tomato

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
represent the structure of the tomato

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.230 
represent the structure of the tomato
like<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:26.060> okay<00:01:27.229> then<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.740> cheese

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
like that okay then we go to a cheese

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.899 
like that okay then we go to a cheese
okay<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.630> cheese<00:01:31.040> will<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.280> dying<00:01:32.610> out

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
okay so the cheese will be in dying out

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.109 
okay so the cheese will be in dying out
then<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.990> gonna<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.310> flat<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
then it's gonna just kind of flat so I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.219 
then it's gonna just kind of flat so I
write<00:01:36.570> down<00:01:36.680> yeah<00:01:37.710> flat<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.549> okay<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:40.170> were

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
write down yeah flat out okay they were

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.330 
write down yeah flat out okay they were
going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> secondary<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:42.020> 209<00:01:43.020> down

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
going to a secondary will be 209 down

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
going to a secondary will be 209 down
then<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:45.060> follow<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.630> line<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.140> draw

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
then just follow the line that you draw

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.390 
then just follow the line that you draw
to<00:01:46.470> order<00:01:46.950> first<00:01:48.320> okay

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.370 

so<00:01:52.030> this<00:01:52.270> will<00:01:52.480> represent<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:53.200> t's<00:01:53.530> all<00:01:53.860> right

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
so this will represent the t's all right

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.360 
so this will represent the t's all right
and<00:01:56.380> then<00:01:56.620> we<00:01:56.800> got<00:01:56.980> water<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:58.690> meat<00:01:58.990> okay<00:01:59.710> so
