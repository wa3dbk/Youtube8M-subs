00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.910
 so very good to start I'll have 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.899
 a black hand and a white hand to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.880
 make it easier for you 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.540
 explain we've also set benchmarks for 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.030
 12pm and 6pm so noon here this is the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.779
 midi position the 6 o'clock position and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.470
 no flywheel in normal operation at 9:15 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.330
 so here in the round very little is done 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.210
 just what's called an eighth of 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.460
 turns to the left yeah 8th two rounds 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.250
 for the law that's very little is called 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 that a curve 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 then when it turns more than an 8th of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.020
 turns that it's more than a curve on 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.390
 enter the medium ie 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 the turn at that moment we are obliged 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.760
 to get the steering wheel with your hand 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 black to go to the left and to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.690
 shots on the wheel up to 3.8 km 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 maximum our black hands she is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.750
 arrival at the bottom for a right turn 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.850
 one hand white and pulls up 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.050
 3.8 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.149
 so we may have turns 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 more important up to three quarters of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.080
 turn at that moment we also ride the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.890
 black hand for the left 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.390
 one shoots and the second hand can do to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.110
 about the same thing up to three 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.229
 quarter turn for the right 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.119
 I climb the white hand I pull and I 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.860
 can help a second time with the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.400
 black hand to go up to three 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 train stations this is the turn 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.869
 third category enormously it's a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.270
 turning and we will ride our hands 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.990
 so we ride the black hand for a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.820
 left at noon and she shoots taking away 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.780
 white hand with her and we're going 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.040
 ride thus between 12h and 16h for 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 left 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.200
 when we are a background we can turn from 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.120
 the same way on this side between noon 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.160
 look closely at the black hand that cuts through 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.360
 through for the scrolls the course 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.360
 five hours 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.960
 without explanation turn it 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.050
 look at the black hand as they 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.740
 cut by the shortest way 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.740
 every time
