00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
time into a smaller ice surface where

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.600 
time into a smaller ice surface where
there's<00:00:28.720> bigger<00:00:28.960> men<00:00:29.230> less<00:00:29.529> time<00:00:29.860> they're

over<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:17.320> year<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.820> brought<00:01:18.850> him<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.270> to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
over this year we brought him in to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.180 
over this year we brought him in to
Grand<00:01:19.600> Rapids<00:01:19.659> he<00:01:20.470> finished<00:01:20.830> up<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.100> year

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
Grand Rapids he finished up the year

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.830

playing<00:01:21.430> for<00:01:21.610> Grand<00:01:21.820> Rapids<00:01:22.210> in<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.390> playoffs

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
playing for Grand Rapids in the playoffs

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.170 
playing for Grand Rapids in the playoffs
I<00:01:23.140> thought<00:01:23.500> overall<00:01:24.100> he<00:01:24.490> showed<00:01:24.790> an<00:01:24.940> ability

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
I thought overall he showed an ability

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.719 
I thought overall he showed an ability
to<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> real<00:01:26.350> good<00:01:26.530> offensive<00:01:27.010> player<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.610> a

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
to be a real good offensive player and a

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.610 
to be a real good offensive player and a
real<00:01:27.940> good<00:01:28.090> defensive<00:01:28.630> player<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.409> think

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
real good defensive player and I think

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.219 
real good defensive player and I think
because<00:01:30.190> of<00:01:30.220> his<00:01:30.610> futures<00:01:31.060> bring<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.630> started

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
because of his futures bring I started

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.620 
because of his futures bring I started
at<00:01:32.320> hop<00:01:32.500> talk<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:33.040> when<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.220> was<00:01:33.430> about<00:01:34.270> six

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
at hop talk to when I was about six

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.950 
at hop talk to when I was about six
years<00:01:34.690> old<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:36.280> grandfather<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:37.000> my<00:01:37.450> dad<00:01:37.659> took

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
years old my grandfather and my dad took

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.719 
years old my grandfather and my dad took
me<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.409> rink<00:01:38.619> so<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:38.950> think<00:01:39.159> that's<00:01:39.520> what

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
me to the rink so I think that's what

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.030 
me to the rink so I think that's what
the<00:01:40.060> reason<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.479> start<00:01:40.810> with<00:01:40.990> hockey<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.500> of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
the reason I start with hockey and of

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.380 
the reason I start with hockey and of
course<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.729> look<00:01:43.240> up<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.450> Nicola<00:01:44.409> finnstrom's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
course I look up to Nicola finnstrom's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.500 
course I look up to Nicola finnstrom's
Red<00:01:46.390> Wings<00:01:46.650> so<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.700> pretty<00:01:48.880> good<00:01:49.090> defense

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
Red Wings so it's pretty good defense

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.590 
Red Wings so it's pretty good defense
plan<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:50.080> waste<00:01:50.290> defenseman<00:01:50.860> I'm<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.939> think<00:01:52.420> I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
plan to waste defenseman I'm I think I'm

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.020 
plan to waste defenseman I'm I think I'm
two<00:01:53.110> ways<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.650> so<00:01:53.950> good<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.490> look<00:01:54.670> up<00:01:54.850> to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
two ways to so good to look up to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.850 
two ways to so good to look up to
because<00:01:55.720> he<00:01:55.869> will<00:01:56.020> be<00:01:56.200> starting<00:01:56.710> his<00:01:56.830> first

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
because he will be starting his first
