00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
back of the sheet so it will be on your

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.630 
back of the sheet so it will be on your
belt<00:01:11.770> with<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.429> loop<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:15.220> will<00:01:15.399> hang

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
there it's just a bit different I

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.820

it<00:01:32.920> does<00:01:33.160> it<00:01:33.910> does<00:01:34.240> limit<00:01:34.479> your<00:01:34.660> your

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
it does it does limit your your

possibilities to carry a knife to the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.020 
possibilities to carry a knife to the
original<00:01:39.819> system<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.190> big<00:01:42.399> problem

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
original system is that a big problem

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.109 
original system is that a big problem
I<00:01:43.060> don't<00:01:43.479> think<00:01:43.509> so<00:01:44.429> so<00:01:45.429> it's<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.670> little<00:01:45.819> sheet

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
I don't think so so it's a little sheet

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.760 
I don't think so so it's a little sheet
and<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:51.060> retention<00:01:52.060> strap<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.110> take<00:01:53.590> out

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
and do the retention strap and take out

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.130 
and do the retention strap and take out
knife<00:01:56.069> now<00:01:57.069> as<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:57.459> see<00:01:57.520> inside<00:01:58.330> well

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
knife now as you can see inside well

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.330 
knife now as you can see inside well
this<00:01:59.259> may<00:01:59.440> may<00:02:00.039> be<00:02:00.069> very<00:02:00.459> difficult<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.060> see

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
this may may be very difficult to see

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.990 
this may may be very difficult to see
but<00:02:03.340> there's<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:04.349> softer<00:02:05.349> inner<00:02:05.800> shell<00:02:06.130> now<00:02:06.970> a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
but there's a softer inner shell now a

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.490 
but there's a softer inner shell now a
softer<00:02:07.569> plastic<00:02:07.840> inner<00:02:08.500> shell<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.509> it's<00:02:10.959> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
softer plastic inner shell so it's the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.830 
softer plastic inner shell so it's the
knife<00:02:11.709> blade<00:02:12.610> itself<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.209> very<00:02:13.360> very<00:02:13.630> well

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
knife blade itself is very very well

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.020 
knife blade itself is very very well
protected<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.950> fits<00:02:15.219> like<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.489> glove<00:02:15.579> as<00:02:15.879> they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
protected that fits like a glove as they

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.940 
protected that fits like a glove as they
stated

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.090 

okay<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> knife<00:02:22.500> full-tang<00:02:23.500> design<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.840> also

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
okay the knife full-tang design but also

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.580 
okay the knife full-tang design but also
it's<00:02:27.100> more<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.550> an<00:02:27.730> integral<00:02:28.360> knife<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
it's more like an integral knife the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.330 
it's more like an integral knife the
handle<00:02:32.980> itself<00:02:33.720> are<00:02:34.720> just<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.500> lace<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.690> it's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
handle itself are just in lace so it's

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.590 
handle itself are just in lace so it's
basically<00:02:39.340> one<00:02:39.670> piece<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.180> metal<00:02:40.360> with<00:02:41.400> two

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
basically one piece of metal with two

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.950 
basically one piece of metal with two
small<00:02:43.600> pieces<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.710> life<00:02:45.460> for<00:02:45.790> handle<00:02:46.210> it's

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
small pieces of in life for handle it's

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.560 
small pieces of in life for handle it's
a<00:02:47.020> very<00:02:47.260> sturdy<00:02:47.500> design<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.280> don't<00:02:49.240> know<00:02:49.360> if<00:02:49.480> the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
a very sturdy design I don't know if the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.330 
a very sturdy design I don't know if the
knife<00:02:49.720> itself<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:50.260> very<00:02:50.410> sturdy<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:50.950> haven't

like the design and the fact that it's a
integral<00:03:07.300> build<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:10.750> says<00:03:10.960> martini

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
integral build so it says martini

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
integral build so it says martini
stainless<00:03:12.250> steel<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.980> made<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.430> Finland<00:03:17.460> so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
stainless steel it's made in Finland so

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.900 
stainless steel it's made in Finland so
it's<00:03:18.670> not<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.880> nice<00:03:19.440> knife<00:03:20.440> Trier<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:21.580> it's<00:03:21.730> by

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
it's not a nice knife Trier if it's by

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.530 
it's not a nice knife Trier if it's by
the<00:03:21.970> way<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.770> will<00:03:24.340> be<00:03:24.459> sturdy<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.060> as<00:03:25.480> I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the way so it will be sturdy and as I

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.830 
the way so it will be sturdy and as I
mentioned<00:03:25.990> earlier<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.390> pros<00:03:28.660> about

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
mentioned earlier one of the pros about

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.760 
mentioned earlier one of the pros about
this<00:03:30.600> construction<00:03:31.600> this<00:03:32.260> integral

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
this construction this integral

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.160 
this construction this integral
destruction<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.550> if<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.540> are<00:03:34.690> returning<00:03:35.050> with

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
destruction is if you are returning with

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.400 
destruction is if you are returning with
it<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:36.010> hit<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:37.360> eat<00:03:37.540> here<00:03:37.810> but<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.290> can

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
it you hit here you eat here but you can

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.800 
it you hit here you eat here but you can
also<00:03:38.530> hit<00:03:38.830> here<00:03:39.130> there's<00:03:39.760> no<00:03:39.940> plastic<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.570> mess

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
also hit here there's no plastic to mess

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.750 
also hit here there's no plastic to mess
up<00:03:40.990> so<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:43.020> entirely<00:03:44.020> metal<00:03:44.550> on<00:03:45.550> the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
up so it's just entirely metal on the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.100 
up so it's just entirely metal on the
top<00:03:45.970> part<00:03:46.270> of<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.540> knife<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:49.570> said<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> bit

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
top part of the knife as I said a bit

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.250 
top part of the knife as I said a bit
strange<00:03:50.440> dangle<00:03:51.070> system<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.570> very<00:03:52.840> secure

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
strange dangle system but a very secure

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.620 
strange dangle system but a very secure
and<00:03:53.590> safe<00:03:54.600> sheet<00:03:56.610> yeah<00:03:57.610> I<00:03:57.880> think<00:03:58.000> it's<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.450> nice

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
and safe sheet yeah I think it's a nice

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.560 
and safe sheet yeah I think it's a nice

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
package ok the martini full-tang knife

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.440 
package ok the martini full-tang knife
take<00:04:04.570> care<00:04:04.780> of<00:04:04.930> buddy<00:04:05.170> all<00:04:05.530> right
