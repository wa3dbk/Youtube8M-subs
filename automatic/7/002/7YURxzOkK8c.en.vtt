00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
increase it and I like to turn it it's a

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.520 
increase it and I like to turn it it's a
little<00:02:01.070> better<00:02:01.250> angle<00:02:01.730> for<00:02:01.970> me<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.600> bring<00:02:03.410> it

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
little better angle for me and bring it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.230 
little better angle for me and bring it
up<00:02:03.650> like<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.370> that's<00:02:04.490> how<00:02:04.760> that<00:02:04.970> side

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
up like this so that's how that side

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.450 
up like this so that's how that side
would<00:02:05.420> look<00:02:05.800> turning<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:07.010> over<00:02:07.130> you're<00:02:07.370> going

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
would look turning it over you're going

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.500 
would look turning it over you're going
to<00:02:07.550> do<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.820> same<00:02:08.000> thing<00:02:08.300> on<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.509> other<00:02:08.540> side

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.289 

now<00:02:12.510> once<00:02:12.720> again<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.739> top<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.400> this

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
now once again this is the top and this

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.640 
now once again this is the top and this
is<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.540> bottom<00:02:15.989> because<00:02:16.200> there's<00:02:16.379> nothing

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
is the bottom because there's nothing

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.699 
is the bottom because there's nothing
that<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.280> pull<00:02:17.549> out<00:02:17.579> on<00:02:18.319> so<00:02:19.319> what<00:02:19.560> you're

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that I can pull out on so what you're

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.100 
that I can pull out on so what you're
going<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.459> crease<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:24.110> like

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
going to do is crease this down like

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.429 
going to do is crease this down like
this<00:02:25.970> now<00:02:26.970> there's<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.299> little<00:02:27.629> pocket<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.230> here

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
this now there's a little pocket in here

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.849 
this now there's a little pocket in here
you<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:28.769> open<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.220> up<00:02:29.370> some<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.650> tuck<00:02:31.650> this

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
you just open it up some and tuck this

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.940 
you just open it up some and tuck this
in<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.049> work<00:02:34.349> with<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.769> little

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
in and you have to work with it a little

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.069 
in and you have to work with it a little
bit<00:02:35.099> on<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> heavier<00:02:35.670> paper<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.959> because

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
bit on the heavier paper just because

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.349 
bit on the heavier paper just because
you<00:02:37.319> want<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.709> be<00:02:37.829> in<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.129> tight<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.150> once

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
you want it to be in there tight so once

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.830 
you want it to be in there tight so once
again<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.720> bring<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.500> down<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.489> edge

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
again just bring this down to this edge

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.199 
again just bring this down to this edge
that<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.989> just<00:02:43.200> had<00:02:43.590> created<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:45.000> want<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
that you just had created you want to

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.580 
that you just had created you want to
fold<00:02:45.389> it<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.629> little<00:02:45.780> bit<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.260> might<00:02:46.409> go<00:02:46.560> in

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
fold it a little bit so it might go in

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.759 
fold it a little bit so it might go in
and<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.099> that's<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.670> little<00:02:47.970> easier<00:02:48.650> find<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
and some that's a little easier find the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.240 
and some that's a little easier find the
center<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.989> tuck<00:02:51.989> your<00:02:52.170> tab<00:02:52.409> in<00:02:53.389> like<00:02:54.389> this<00:02:55.250> do

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.610 

so<00:03:05.670> make<00:03:05.910> sure<00:03:05.940> all<00:03:06.360> these<00:03:06.510> guys<00:03:06.810> are<00:03:07.110> nice<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
creased now this is a side that was the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.200 
creased now this is a side that was the
top<00:03:10.890> because<00:03:11.100> we<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.430> got<00:03:11.580> through<00:03:11.760> folding

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
top because we just got through folding

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.460 
top because we just got through folding
it<00:03:12.300> down<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.600> can<00:03:12.630> also<00:03:12.900> see<00:03:13.050> there's<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
before I blow it I like to fold it back

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.510 
before I blow it I like to fold it back
a<00:03:21.900> little<00:03:22.290> bit<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.680> give<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.830> some<00:03:23.130> strength
