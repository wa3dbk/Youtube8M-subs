some of the specs do vary but there is a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.160 
some of the specs do vary but there is a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
size range available 1080 of course as

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
size range available 1080 of course as
previously<00:01:49.740> mentioned<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.490> response

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
previously mentioned and the response

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910 
previously mentioned and the response
time<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.240> two<00:01:51.479> milliseconds<00:01:52.140> gray<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.680> gray

time of two milliseconds gray to gray

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.850 
time of two milliseconds gray to gray
which<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.119> pretty<00:01:54.540> decent<00:01:54.780> response<00:01:55.350> time<00:01:55.619> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
which is pretty decent response time I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.679 
which is pretty decent response time I
should<00:01:56.369> say<00:01:56.549> quite<00:01:56.909> good<00:01:57.090> response<00:01:57.450> time<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
should say quite good response time so

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.950 
should say quite good response time so
