three month run the reason why I started

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.010 
three month run the reason why I started
a<00:00:14.610> little<00:00:14.759> bit<00:00:14.969> later<00:00:15.210> than<00:00:15.450> everybody<00:00:15.690> else

a little bit later than everybody else

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.620 
a little bit later than everybody else
is<00:00:16.260> because<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:17.039> was<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.310> first<00:00:17.340> time<00:00:17.880> ever<00:00:18.210> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
all I wanted to share that even though i

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.299

wardrobe i still didn't wear every
single<00:00:38.520> piece<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.899> made<00:00:40.290> me<00:00:40.410> think<00:00:40.739> maybe

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
single piece so it made me think maybe

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.450 
I didn't have to do it that often which
is<00:01:36.659> honestly<00:01:37.229> part<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> reason<00:01:37.950> why<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.100> had

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
is honestly part of the reason why I had

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240 
is honestly part of the reason why I had
a<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> clothes<00:01:39.810> before<00:01:40.049> another<00:01:40.920> thing<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
a lot of clothes before another thing I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
a lot of clothes before another thing I
noticed<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:42.090> clothes<00:01:42.450> started<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
noticed is that my clothes started to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.280 
noticed is that my clothes started to
wear<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.890> lot<00:01:44.280> quicker<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.780> think<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> has

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
wear a lot quicker and I think that has

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
wear a lot quicker and I think that has
to<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> fact<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.640> watching

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to do with the fact that I was watching

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
to do with the fact that I was watching
them<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.840> more<00:01:49.200> often<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.280> didn't<00:01:50.700> have

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
them a lot more often and I didn't have

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.450 
them a lot more often and I didn't have
a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.180> stuff<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.020> wasn't<00:01:52.710> washing<00:01:53.100> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
know separate colors very often and they

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.220 
know separate colors very often and they
started<00:01:56.159> creating<00:01:56.369> Pinot<00:01:56.790> low

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
started creating Pinot low

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.580

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
more than enough I was way more

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.000 
more than enough I was way more
selective<00:02:56.990> about<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.230> things<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.830> was

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
selective about the things that I was

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.950 
selective about the things that I was
potentially<00:02:58.610> purchasing<00:02:59.150> than<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.720> ever

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
been before in my life for the purposes

been before in my life for the purposes
of<00:03:01.970> my<00:03:02.270> winter<00:03:02.540> capsule<00:03:02.900> wardrobe<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.410> didn't

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
of my winter capsule wardrobe I didn't

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.870 
of my winter capsule wardrobe I didn't
count<00:03:03.980> any<00:03:04.630> hats<00:03:05.630> scarves<00:03:06.620> gloves<00:03:07.010> or<00:03:07.520> my

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
count any hats scarves gloves or my

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.840 
count any hats scarves gloves or my
outer<00:03:08.180> wear<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.950> reason<00:03:10.340> why<00:03:10.490> I<00:03:10.520> did<00:03:10.820> that

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
outer wear and the reason why I did that

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.090 
outer wear and the reason why I did that
was<00:03:11.090> because<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.510> was<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:11.780> cold<00:03:12.020> I<00:03:12.320> thought<00:03:12.739> I

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
was because it was so cold I thought I

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.490 
was because it was so cold I thought I
need<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.120> wear<00:03:14.300> them<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.660> it's<00:03:14.989> not<00:03:15.170> even<00:03:15.410> an

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
need to wear them like it's not even an

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.990 
need to wear them like it's not even an
option<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:15.980> what's<00:03:16.160> winning<00:03:16.550> counting<00:03:16.850> them

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
option so what's winning counting them

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.150 
option so what's winning counting them
and<00:03:17.209> actually<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.290> think<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.709> was<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.830> good

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
and actually I think that was a good

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.710 
and actually I think that was a good
choice<00:03:19.430> on<00:03:19.760> my<00:03:19.790> end<00:03:20.120> because<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.570> have

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
choice on my end because if I have

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.540 
choice on my end because if I have
counted<00:03:21.140> those<00:03:21.380> five<00:03:21.830> items<00:03:22.070> because<00:03:22.430> you're

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
counted those five items because you're

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.150 
counted those five items because you're
supposed<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.940> count<00:03:23.060> accessories<00:03:23.680> then<00:03:24.680> that

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
supposed to count accessories then that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.199 
supposed to count accessories then that
would<00:03:25.190> have<00:03:25.370> been<00:03:25.459> five<00:03:25.730> items<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.150> my
