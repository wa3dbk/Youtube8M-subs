00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
came up with a really cool idea I want

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.270 
came up with a really cool idea I want
to<00:00:12.570> get<00:00:12.660> started<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.860> thought<00:00:14.040> well

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
to get started on and I thought well

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.829 
to get started on and I thought well
it's<00:00:14.400> about<00:00:14.460> time<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.759> found<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.210> video<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.750> I'm

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
it's about time I found a video so I'm

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.620 
it's about time I found a video so I'm
going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:15.990> start<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:17.029> my<00:00:18.029> idea<00:00:18.390> is

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
going to start with this one my idea is

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.179 
going to start with this one my idea is
a<00:00:19.310> based<00:00:20.310> off<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.930> American<00:00:21.930> speedster<00:00:22.500> PVC

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
a based off of American speedster PVC

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.550 
a based off of American speedster PVC
cart<00:00:23.480> I<00:00:24.480> had<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:26.210> ordered<00:00:27.210> their<00:00:27.300> plans<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
cart I had I ordered their plans and I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.669 
cart I had I ordered their plans and I
got<00:00:29.070> him<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.580> quick<00:00:30.170> good<00:00:31.170> communication

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
got him really quick good communication

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.340 
got him really quick good communication
with<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.800> site<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.110> wasn't

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
with that site but it really wasn't

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.590 
with that site but it really wasn't
happy<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.370> plans<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.420> seemed

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
happy with their plans it just seemed

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.060 
happy with their plans it just seemed
kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.610> don't<00:00:38.610> know<00:00:38.760> hokey<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.950> not<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
kind of I don't know hokey and not that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.270 
kind of I don't know hokey and not that
my<00:00:41.250> design<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.760> any<00:00:41.910> better<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.280> just

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
my design is any better but I just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.360 
my design is any better but I just
decided<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> PVC<00:00:45.870> buggy<00:00:46.230> based<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
decided to make a PVC buggy based on

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.540 
decided to make a PVC buggy based on
that<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.410> about<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> size<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> golf<00:00:50.219> cart

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that but about the size of a golf cart

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.100 
that but about the size of a golf cart
maybe<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.059> smaller<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.960> as

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
maybe a little smaller and to be as

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.500 
maybe a little smaller and to be as
comfortable<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> golf<00:00:53.010> cart<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:54.149> when

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
comfortable as a golf cart because when

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
comfortable as a golf cart because when

golf cart just about except for me and
I'm<00:01:02.190> cheap<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:03.270> notoriously<00:01:03.780> cheap<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
I'm cheap I'm notoriously cheap so I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
decided to build my buddy and I thought

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.660 
decided to build my buddy and I thought
steel<00:01:08.490> originally<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.689> why<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.680> PVC<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
steel originally but why not PVC it's a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
steel originally but why not PVC it's a
cool<00:01:11.850> factor<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> buddy<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> mine<00:01:12.720> said<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
cool factor and a buddy of mine said you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.890 
cool factor and a buddy of mine said you
got<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> my<00:01:14.729> dad<00:01:14.970> says<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
got to do it my dad says I got to do it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
got to do it my dad says I got to do it
so<00:01:16.250> I'm<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:19.250> I'm<00:01:20.250> using<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:20.610> inch

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
so I'm going to do it I'm using an inch

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550 
so I'm going to do it I'm using an inch
and<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> quarter<00:01:21.030> PVC<00:01:21.570> I'll<00:01:22.140> show<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> my

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and a quarter PVC I'll show you my

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.399 
and a quarter PVC I'll show you my
design<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:24.110> but<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.290> I'm

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
design here in a little bit but what I'm

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.890 
design here in a little bit but what I'm
using<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:28.100> furniture-grade<00:01:29.689> PVC<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:32.900> this

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
using are furniture-grade PVC and this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
using are furniture-grade PVC and this
is<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> plumbing<00:01:34.710> connection<00:01:35.189> obviously

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
is not a plumbing connection obviously

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
is not a plumbing connection obviously
because<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> useless<00:01:36.750> plumbing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
because that would be a useless plumbing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.910 
because that would be a useless plumbing
connection<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:38.040> no<00:01:38.250> flow<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.920> can

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
connection you get no flow but you can

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.149 
connection you get no flow but you can
see<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:41.549> tapered<00:01:41.939> ends<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:43.530> set<00:01:43.860> for

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
see it's got tapered ends the set for

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.160 
see it's got tapered ends the set for
the<00:01:44.220> pipe<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.790> mean<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.360> deep<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.720> goes<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the pipe I mean how deep it goes is a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.190 
the pipe I mean how deep it goes is a
little<00:01:46.500> bit<00:01:46.619> deeper<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.250> normal<00:01:47.430> PVC<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
little bit deeper than normal PVC I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
little bit deeper than normal PVC I
measured<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.920> against<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> couple<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> have

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
measured it against a couple that I have

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.520 
measured it against a couple that I have
here<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.509> only<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.840> couple<00:01:52.110> millimeters

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
here and I'm only a couple millimeters

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.340 
here and I'm only a couple millimeters
deeper<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.930> but<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.079> makes

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
deeper but that's not much but it makes

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.410 
deeper but that's not much but it makes
a<00:01:55.439> little<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:55.710> stronger<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.310> PVC<00:01:56.729> itself<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
a little bit stronger the PVC itself is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.410 
a little bit stronger the PVC itself is
a<00:01:57.659> glossy<00:01:58.229> no<00:01:58.469> print<00:01:58.880> not<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.149> matters

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
a glossy no print not so that matters

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.480 
a glossy no print not so that matters
I'm<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> paint<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.930> anyway

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
I'm going to paint it anyway

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.389 
I'm going to paint it anyway
and<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:03.479> UV<00:02:03.630> resistant<00:02:04.290> regular<00:02:05.040> PVC

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
and it's UV resistant regular PVC

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.490 
and it's UV resistant regular PVC
sometimes<00:02:06.329> gets<00:02:06.540> brittle<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.079> sits<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
sometimes gets brittle if it sits in the

Sun for a long time this stuff doesn't

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.610 
Sun for a long time this stuff doesn't
and<00:02:11.269> it<00:02:11.420> seems<00:02:11.599> pretty<00:02:11.660> strong<00:02:11.989> I<00:02:12.230> mean<00:02:12.379> my

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
and it seems pretty strong I mean my

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.160 
and it seems pretty strong I mean my
test<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.069> haven't<00:02:13.459> been<00:02:13.550> able<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.700> break<00:02:13.879> one

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
test I haven't been able to break one

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
test I haven't been able to break one
any<00:02:15.170> more<00:02:15.230> than<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.530> would<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.709> normal<00:02:16.160> one<00:02:16.730> I'm

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
any more than I would a normal one I'm

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.880 
any more than I would a normal one I'm
really<00:02:17.330> stressed<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.989> enough<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.500> guess<00:02:18.739> to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
really stressed it enough I guess to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.699 
really stressed it enough I guess to
tell<00:02:19.209> so<00:02:20.209> that's<00:02:20.959> one<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> fittings<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
tell so that's one of the fittings I

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.059 
tell so that's one of the fittings I
mean<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.920> got<00:02:22.180> many<00:02:23.180> different<00:02:23.269> fittings<00:02:23.660> here

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.320 

this<00:02:28.069> is<00:02:28.220> cool<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:29.410> PVC<00:02:31.060> insert<00:02:32.060> this

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
this is cool this is a PVC insert this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.270 
this is cool this is a PVC insert this
is<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.569> inch<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> quarter<00:02:33.110> this<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.069> an

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
is all inch and a quarter this is an

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.460 
is all inch and a quarter this is an
insert<00:02:34.549> for<00:02:34.610> Castor's<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:35.989> goes<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.379> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
insert for Castor's so it goes in the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.770 
insert for Castor's so it goes in the
end<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.830> fitting<00:02:37.160> not<00:02:37.910> pipe<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.420> fitting

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
end of a fitting not pipe but fitting

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.449 
end of a fitting not pipe but fitting
and<00:02:39.379> you<00:02:39.470> just<00:02:39.590> put<00:02:39.709> your<00:02:39.799> castor<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.310> there

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
and you just put your castor in there

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.580 
and you just put your castor in there
but<00:02:40.640> I'm<00:02:40.730> going<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:40.970> use<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.299> as<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
but I'm going to use it as a as a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.680 
but I'm going to use it as a as a
bearing<00:02:43.069> holder<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.640> I'm<00:02:44.269> going<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.480> mill<00:02:44.660> it

bearing holder as a I'm going to mill it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.259 
bearing holder as a I'm going to mill it
out<00:02:44.900> here<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.410> put<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> bearing<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.849> there<00:02:46.970> and

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
out here and put a bearing in there and

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.120 
out here and put a bearing in there and
this<00:02:47.720> are<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.170> fitting<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.650> my<00:02:48.739> axle

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
this are going a fitting and my axle

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.449 
this are going a fitting and my axle
will<00:02:49.220> go<00:02:49.370> through<00:02:49.579> that<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.630> uh<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.040> lost<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
will go through that so uh so I lost the

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.620 
will go through that so uh so I lost the
support<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.060> have<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.239> bunch<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.510> these

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
support and I have a bunch of these

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.819 
support and I have a bunch of these
throughout<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.079> got<00:02:54.260> six<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.709> them<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:55.040> put<00:02:55.220> in

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
throughout I got six of them to put in

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.589 
throughout I got six of them to put in
you<00:02:57.829> know<00:02:57.920> more<00:02:58.250> more<00:02:58.879> fittings<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.480> is

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
you know more more fittings this is

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.479 
you know more more fittings this is
another<00:02:59.870> useless<00:03:00.440> plumbing<00:03:01.010> fitting<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.459> a

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
another useless plumbing fitting but a

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.979 
another useless plumbing fitting but a
good<00:03:01.730> furniture<00:03:01.940> fitting<00:03:02.360> Lodge<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.840> do

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
good furniture fitting Lodge to do

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.199 
good furniture fitting Lodge to do
square<00:03:03.260> corners<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:04.310> easily<00:03:04.790> which<00:03:05.060> you

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
square corners but easily which you

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.990 
square corners but easily which you
can't<00:03:05.450> really<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:05.900> neatly<00:03:06.799> with<00:03:07.250> regular

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
can't really do neatly with regular

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.250 
can't really do neatly with regular
plumbing<00:03:10.420> fittings<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.489> that's<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.660> as<00:03:15.019> far<00:03:15.230> as

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
plumbing fittings so that's it as far as

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.210 
plumbing fittings so that's it as far as
the<00:03:15.410> fittings<00:03:15.709> go<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:18.650> would<00:03:18.769> be<00:03:18.829> one<00:03:19.100> of

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the fittings go this would be one of

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.319 
the fittings go this would be one of
many<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.489> guess<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.209> an

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
many I guess this is just an

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.840 
many I guess this is just an
introduction<00:03:20.690> video<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.549> we'll<00:03:22.549> see<00:03:22.670> how<00:03:22.760> it

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
introduction video and we'll see how it

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.890 
introduction video and we'll see how it
goes<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.720> stay<00:03:23.959> tuned<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:25.420> I'll<00:03:26.420> show<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
goes so stay tuned and I'll show you the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.629 
goes so stay tuned and I'll show you the
design<00:03:27.200> next<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:30.590> here's<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.220> model<00:03:31.370> with<00:03:31.609> the

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
design next so here's the model with the

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.410 
design next so here's the model with the
PVC<00:03:32.000> cart<00:03:32.650> it's<00:03:33.650> roughly<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.670> same<00:03:34.819> size<00:03:35.060> as<00:03:35.120> a

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
PVC cart it's roughly the same size as a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.039 
PVC cart it's roughly the same size as a
golf<00:03:35.690> cart<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:37.489> width<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:38.030> about<00:03:38.359> the<00:03:38.480> same<00:03:38.690> as

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
golf cart the width is about the same as

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.170 
golf cart the width is about the same as
a<00:03:39.109> golf<00:03:39.380> cart<00:03:39.650> but<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.400> overall<00:03:40.700> length<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:41.120> a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
a golf cart but the overall length is a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.970 
a golf cart but the overall length is a
little<00:03:41.239> bit<00:03:41.480> shorter<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.049> didn't<00:03:42.650> need<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.799> to

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
little bit shorter I didn't need it to

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.970 
little bit shorter I didn't need it to
be<00:03:43.099> exactly<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.669> a<00:03:43.849> golf<00:03:44.209> cart

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
be exactly like a golf cart

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.550 
be exactly like a golf cart
the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.710 
the
the<00:03:48.370> point<00:03:48.670> was<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:49.150> make<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.330> as<00:03:49.540> comfortable

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
the point was to make it as comfortable

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.650 
the point was to make it as comfortable
as<00:03:50.110> riding<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.680> golf<00:03:50.890> cart<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.760> distance

balance<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:06.100> torque<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.490> speed<00:05:06.720> because<00:05:07.720> I

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
balance of torque and speed because I

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.270 
balance of torque and speed because I
don't<00:05:07.900> want<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.080> be<00:05:08.140> going<00:05:08.260> too<00:05:08.470> fast<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.979> it's

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
don't want to be going too fast and it's

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.390 
don't want to be going too fast and it's
just<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.550> little<00:05:09.700> neighborhood<00:05:10.180> cruiser<00:05:11.400> the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
just a little neighborhood cruiser the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.040 
just a little neighborhood cruiser the
frame<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:15.340> can<00:05:15.460> see<00:05:15.520> little<00:05:16.419> models<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:16.990> my
