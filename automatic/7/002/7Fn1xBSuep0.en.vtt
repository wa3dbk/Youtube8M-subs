cello<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.599> trill<00:00:00.840> wasn't<00:00:01.199> completely

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
cello the trill wasn't completely

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.949 
cello the trill wasn't completely
filling<00:00:02.159> in<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.399> whole<00:00:02.580> quarter<00:00:03.210> note<00:00:03.419> make

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
filling in a whole quarter note make

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.390 
filling in a whole quarter note make
sure<00:00:04.080> it's<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.319> whole<00:00:04.589> quarter<00:00:04.980> note<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.339> the

sure it's a whole quarter note of the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:19.599 
sure it's a whole quarter note of the
trill<00:00:05.640> try<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.420> again

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.830 

yeah<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.060> much<00:00:21.210> better<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
yeah that was much better that you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.090 
yeah that was much better that you
didn't<00:00:21.990> race<00:00:22.109> away<00:00:22.289> from<00:00:22.529> your<00:00:22.680> choice<00:00:22.890> of

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
didn't race away from your choice of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.240 
didn't race away from your choice of
that<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.910> only<00:00:23.939> thing<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.949> would<00:00:25.949> want<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that the only thing that I would want to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.710 
that the only thing that I would want to
refine<00:00:26.609> where's<00:00:26.849> your<00:00:27.000> pedaling<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
refine where's your pedaling with a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.960 
refine where's your pedaling with a
little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.109> oversaturated<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.550> me<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
little bit oversaturated to me but a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.999 
little bit oversaturated to me but a
little<00:00:30.390> too<00:00:30.510> much<00:00:30.660> pedal<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.199> times<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
little too much pedal at times with the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.280 
little too much pedal at times with the
tendency<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.759> Chopin<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> over<00:00:33.719> pedal<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
tendency with Chopin is to over pedal it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.590 
tendency with Chopin is to over pedal it
you<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.010> would<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> hear<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> under

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you know I would like to hear it under

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.860 
you know I would like to hear it under
pedals<00:00:37.550> this<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.969> indicated<00:00:39.690> it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pedals this the way it's indicated it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.479 
pedals this the way it's indicated it's
in<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> great<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> don't

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
in and great so we don't know I don't

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 
in and great so we don't know I don't
know<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.730> she'll<00:00:42.000> find<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.420> wanted<00:00:43.140> us

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
know what she'll find really wanted us

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
know what she'll find really wanted us
to<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.610> get<00:00:44.820> off<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> pedal<00:00:45.510> on

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
to do but I would get off the pedal on

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
to do but I would get off the pedal on
the<00:00:45.750> second<00:00:46.200> beat<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> shows<00:00:47.430> in

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the second beat just like it shows in

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
the second beat just like it shows in
the<00:00:47.730> music<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> vertical<00:00:49.140> line

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the music with that with a vertical line

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.430 
the music with that with a vertical line
goes<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> second<00:00:50.340> beat<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.199> want

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
goes up on the second beat so you want

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
goes up on the second beat so you want
to<00:00:52.500> play<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> first<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.640> then<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.969> off

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to play it on the first but then get off

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.680 
to play it on the first but then get off
it<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> second<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.110> third<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.500> possible

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
it on a second and third if possible

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.910 
it on a second and third if possible
let's<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.899> happens<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
let's see what happens if you can do a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.479 
let's see what happens if you can do a
lighter<00:00:59.370> pedaling<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.449> heavy<00:01:01.489> so

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
lighter pedaling and not so heavy so

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.230 
lighter pedaling and not so heavy so
yeah<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.750> would<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.140> better<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
yeah I think I would like it better so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:39.469 
yeah I think I would like it better so
and<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> super<00:01:34.860> better<00:01:35.100> under<00:01:36.560> no<00:01:37.560> pedal<00:01:38.479> now

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and it's super better under no pedal now

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.620 
and it's super better under no pedal now
here<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.930> pedal<00:01:40.350> through<00:01:40.500> two<00:01:40.770> beats<00:01:41.630> right

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
here you pedal through two beats right

00:01:42.630 --> 00:02:10.420 
here you pedal through two beats right
now<00:01:42.899> no<00:01:43.140> title<00:01:43.500> third<00:01:43.740> beat

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.910 

okay<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> prove<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.200> little<00:02:13.650> phrase

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
okay just to prove that little phrase

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.490 
okay just to prove that little phrase
there<00:02:13.950> 15<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.090> 16<00:02:17.300> go<00:02:18.300> over<00:02:18.660> your<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.470> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
there 15 and 16 go over your with a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:03:02.630 
there 15 and 16 go over your with a
softer<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.610> resolution<00:03:01.400> now<00:03:02.400> there

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
softer and in the resolution now there

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.759 
softer and in the resolution now there
is<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> case<00:03:03.390> where<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.780> would<00:03:04.200> Pat<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.620> very

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
is a case where I would Pat the very

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.170 
is a case where I would Pat the very
last<00:03:05.010> measure<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.549> just<00:03:05.730> did

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
last measure you just did

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.140 
last measure you just did
pedal<00:03:06.810> two<00:03:07.260> beats<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.920> lift<00:03:08.549> on<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> third

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
pedal two beats and lift on the third

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.520 
pedal two beats and lift on the third
this<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.390> all<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.959> chord

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
this is all one chord

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.009 
this is all one chord
there's<00:03:10.890> no<00:03:11.070> clashing<00:03:11.700> there<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.180> it's

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
there's no clashing there so like it's

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.009 
there's no clashing there so like it's
homophonic<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.100> minor<00:03:14.340> that's<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.880> right

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.870 

so<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.049> would<00:03:19.410> get<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:19.920> very<00:03:20.130> last<00:03:20.400> one<00:03:20.700> I

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
so I would get in that very last one I

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.350 
so I would get in that very last one I
would<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.090> pedal<00:03:21.780> for<00:03:22.440> two<00:03:22.620> beats<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.400> then

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
would have pedal for two beats and then

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.360 
would have pedal for two beats and then
lift<00:03:24.690> off<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.829> have<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.040> keep<00:03:26.160> holding

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
lift off but you have to keep holding

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.800 
lift off but you have to keep holding
this

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.990 

yeah<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.020> actually<00:03:31.680> take<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.250> pedal<00:03:32.580> off<00:03:32.730> and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
yeah you actually take the pedal off and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.490 
yeah you actually take the pedal off and
you'll<00:03:33.209> have<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.360> third<00:03:33.630> beat<00:03:33.840> rest<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.349> that

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
you'll have a third beat rest so that

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.850 
you'll have a third beat rest so that
synchronizes<00:03:34.980> together<00:03:35.520> right<00:03:35.970> yeah<00:03:36.959> used

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
synchronizes together right yeah used

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.290 
synchronizes together right yeah used
your<00:03:37.980> lifting<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.670> third<00:03:38.880> beat<00:03:39.060> but

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
your lifting on the third beat but

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.280 
your lifting on the third beat but
you're<00:03:39.390> also<00:03:39.510> lifting<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.900> pedal<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
you're also lifting the pedal on the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.520 
you're also lifting the pedal on the
third<00:03:40.530> beat<00:03:41.209> right<00:03:45.349> excellent
