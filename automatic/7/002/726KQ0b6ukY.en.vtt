00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.670
 hello youtube is annick nick and me 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.080
 have a quick round team deathmatch 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.340
 on the map slums denied the bbw and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.500
 today's video theme is loud 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.080
 commission in kiÃŸlegg like it best 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.300
 fix i have informed a lot about it 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.550
 tried a lot and I believe today 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.160
 is it so far that can imagine 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.780
 how best it everything we a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.239
 skill berkeley prevents 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.540
 For technical reasons, not for reasons 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.420
 why the skill is missing us that 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.159
 Could prevent the combination completely 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.080
 simply said, the compensation 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.570
 between a good and a 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.979
 bad connection 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.540
 the bad thing is that the people 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.860
 with a good connection would have 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.350
 be punished that single 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.790
 The real goal is one 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.530
 that does not do justice 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.570
 always the players with the good internet 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.220
 have the advantage because they are good 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.060
 internet but have in reality 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.560
 we have to fight with very strong ex 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.450
 The shots I was present around 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.320
 run a corner and still be 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.810
 we still shot 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.509
 we actually have no chance against 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.189
 teacher having a bad connection 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.979
 have and will be punished for that we 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.299
 to have a good internet 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.920
 it was already a lot against 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.270
 there was a rearing of the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.009
 community why treyarch react 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.439
 had to have a few patches 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.630
 brought out the la convention itself 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.090
 did not fix, however 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.439
 you did not even realize that 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.179
 player with a bad one 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.350
 connection comes together if you are 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.990
 you do not want it and who you are 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.499
 suffers that only under the commission 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.390
 suffers the first patch has set 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.429
 if you do not have the search setting 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.079
 also has placed any one was with 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.939
 not with people from a stranger 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.649
 continent messed up on pc 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.030
 So not the server is also a 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.609
 europe or the post office on the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.749
 Consoles will not come then 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.990
 somehow from a foreign continent 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:12.880
 that has been somewhat 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.160
 improved and another patch has 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.950
 at least let adjust on the pc 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.860
 how much how much how high the pin 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.440
 At most that surfer is that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.000
 I would definitely recommend 30 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.680
 to adjust that the lowest one 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.660
 can be between 30 and 100 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.040
 and because the best connection comes 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.620
 You should definitely be 30 in that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.020
 consoles I do not know how it is but 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.310
 in any case 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.130
 I think you can watch it too 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.290
 between anything arbitrary and best 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.480
 is definitely the best take for 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.520
 if you like my connection is so good 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.800
 that they will not be any 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.990
 games more you should find the best 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.990
 take that then corresponds to a 45 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.490
 There is a further point and that 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.620
 settings mainly in 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.670
 buchrain video at the best settings 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.230
 made in this game 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.880
 I'll link it to you again 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.800
 the description or right here 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.239
 Pure and we should definitely like 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.980
 sync issue that ever 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.150
 leading 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.590
 why does the catering have that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.489
 could again look what exactly 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.440
 It is said and aberrations but there are 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.140
 a noticeable input was what was natural 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.850
 shit online games another 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.709
 point is you should follow your 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.989
 meeting you defend yourself for the respective 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.000
 platform i will import you 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.530
 should open in the description 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.080
 I'll chew and end up too 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.299
 let's see how exactly how that works 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.670
 you should never care with cable 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.230
 Internet now so no wlan or stop 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.410
 controller mouse keyboard 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.400
 there is hardly a cable with just one 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.890
 input was at acting alone 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.660
 for technical reasons already and wanted 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.280
 Of course not because non-self 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.400
 limited so always with cable too 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.920
 if you are always with me 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.140
 wireless lan has gambled and with 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.049
 wireless controller everything 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.450
 In no case, pick up a cable if 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.440
 you think that you are in the project 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.419
 maybe you are already at it 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.979
 but with cable gets used to everyone 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.860
 his case better seen a technically 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.419
 if you play on the console 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.039
 partly on the pc you can yours 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:34.470
 internet you idiot that's you her 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.350
 reduced internet artificially reduced 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.830
 the quality 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.840
 with performance artificially an order to the 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.130
 positive side of the commission too 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.810
 come that your teacher since that 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.250
 does not always work and 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.260
 I would not really recommend it to me 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.120
 I'll show you how to do it in the end anyway 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.520
 It can be worth a try 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.580
 another point is you should 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.750
 play alone if you are with several 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.700
 people then do not play simply 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.860
 the best server for you 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.320
 but the west server for everyone 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.950
 and it's just not the best anymore 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.110
 for you now I'll show you again 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.080
 a few classes definitely 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.160
 should use if if you if the 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.160
 lobby sets that are once the msi and 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.600
 the pbb why because I can quickly you 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.670
 really fast going on the opponent 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.320
 which of course takes you some time 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.190
 in comparison to the story drive, you want it 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.200
 give you extra points 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.250
 the ms mmc would I get you tor 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.750
 recommend on the pdc too and on the 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:43.130
 I've smc in contrast to bdp 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.500
 I almost max on the ms enzi and on the 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.510
 pw laser time because you with the small 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.400
 magazine of rc faster after you have to 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.440
 but with that with the pbb burning well 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.210
 behaved video had seen bearberry before 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.710
 increase your damage to range and here 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.940
 are missing two points in the class that is 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.940
 not quite finished but that 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.470
 most important saint victor and text haiti 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.440
 that takes you then you are right 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.060
 fast even after the race and drop 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.430
 are also still helpful 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.330
 especially if you use a sp with 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.740
 laser the water from me now for the first time 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.610
 I give her will equal now 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.650
 even a clip showing how you get your night 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.760
 opens at least with a fritz box and 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.190
 how your connection kills it goes then 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.630
 only with wlan is white I said 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.890
 I should you should play with them 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.660
 but if you can try yours 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.520
 connection as bad as possible too 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.170
 do the other with a good one 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.510
 Connection must suffer from this 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.580
 but is and everyone wants in this game 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.419
 you can see for a long time 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.650
 my stores opened since fritz box 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.259
 go or on the 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.330
 corresponding louder and could then 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:57.860
 stop releasing or here 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:00.020
 under wlan radio afterwards you can point 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.909
 adjust settings and then click on the 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.099
 maximum send power lower 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:06.250
 set that up to try 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:06.250
 then
