 seven rooms and a room of 75 meters 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.630
 square already imagined that this is true 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.759

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.750

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.540
 the reform that of these spaces the room 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.190
 of a couple who lives with the three 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.070
 children actually this couple this 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.650
 family lives in the parana and only one son who 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.090
 that the style is very different from 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.940
 all that we have already shown that our 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.459
 Deco is a more ethnically themed style 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.130
 with rustic as was this story that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.420
 this study of these net clients 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.040
 I was called to make a decoration 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.120
 custom 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.860
 My client said that she wanted a 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.269
 The first pillory in the house 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.209
 The thing she told me 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.989
 the transformation took place with all 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.700
 floor ceiling reform movement has been 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.040
 a lot to move 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.440
 The cool thing is that it's the recycling that 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.110
 we did we worked with the floor 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.690
 which was already in the room was there 11 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.160
 years here, then we can 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.019
 recycle what everyone is 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.989
 transformed into a deck turned into 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.640
 doors and cabinets you've reproved Tony 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.640
 then this floor that exists here that was 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.860
 all of wood in six other pieces made 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.420
 securities did finally furnishings rate 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.940
 living room shelf 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.209
 beck you worked this floor well and 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.980
 recycled and other parts were also 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.489
 reused yes yes something that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.170
 got it was part of the site people 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.370
 several authorizations to be able to 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.350
 able to work with it 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.269
 Amazonian carpentry has to have a 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.780
 certificate may be able to work 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.870
 but in the surroundings are stores 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.930
 From here to victory and things we brought 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.220
 of the site and everything worked together 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.709
 The cool because I have a lot of 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.180
 intimacy with the family and this was 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.430
 generating always adding value and in the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.569
 story of the house then the house was 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.780
 creating a face 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.969
 It's cool everyone who comes in is 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.120
 stopped in the forum style that calls a lot 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:13.040
 be careful to have these tree trunks 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.290
 this reuse that you created 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.769
 pieces on top of these many trunks 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.410
 times lost there at the family site 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.380
 now veto at the base of the dining table 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.610
 He did not play well was a lost log. 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.580
 that you brought the entrance to the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.530
 apartment is the basis of her 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.400
 I was with the shell, we took it in the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.930
 same place that to enter had to 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.750
 cut in three parts because it does not 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.680
 I could not go up almost 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.320
 think five people has a lot of history 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.289
 which in this network tells the story 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.330
 this net came from outside comes from 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.000
 a trip she did know the truth 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.490
 the whole house picking up people 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.220
 Find something, send her. 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.660
 accept that one that brought some 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.620
 things we bought together some 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.930
 things I bring but in total is fine 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.789
 garimpo is the cool thing about you riding the house 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.880
 with time and has a detail also 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.220
 It's cool of you, too. 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.680
 that they wanted to bring 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.479
 this rustic style losing apartment 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.000
 and it was super difficult because it's all full 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.159
 staff no longer there to 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.070
 people were in the old factory they just 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.990
 did this had already closed but he 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.030
 cried so much that he did because I think 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.130
 we were a man two months trying 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.169
 this loyal person said that he would not 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.020
 Other than the beautiful house 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.400
 do not look just be serious and you had to be 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.400
 Cool, cool. 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.320
 the tv room was actually a 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.630
 room what you heard the recording 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.180
 bathroom room right there 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.130
 Is this TV room done with you? 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.530
 said the door are reuse of the 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.590
 previous floor here before what you did 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.479
 the door has also used on the shelf and has a 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.969
 interesting detail on the wall 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.250
 explains that the bottom of the wall 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.639
 as half of a room no window 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.460
 has got communication then not to leak 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.740
 the noise made a wall of plaster for 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.289
 behind and there came the wood doing 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.310
 acoustics then does not include 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.960
 deep 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.840
 and this house that they really lived 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.840
 here they wear purple it 's man they come 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.290

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.370
 meeting point of the family and 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.190
 from that tradition that we are 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.100
 used to seeing that sofa with the 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.560
 table is not always several seats is the 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.050
 tradition of 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.150
 layout nerds steps here is completely 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.520
 unlike anything we show that 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.820
 the larger space with fewer seats 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.980
 But as they call grandchild, I still want to 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.200
 there are more things to put more 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.720
 how it changed these people will approach 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.430
