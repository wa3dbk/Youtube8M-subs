good intentions and they feed their dogs

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.310 
good intentions and they feed their dogs
I<00:02:36.180> think<00:02:36.360> what<00:02:36.480> they<00:02:36.570> think<00:02:36.840> they're<00:02:36.960> supposed

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
I think what they think they're supposed

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.890 
I think what they think they're supposed
to<00:02:37.410> feed<00:02:37.620> them<00:02:37.800> but<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.640> treats<00:02:38.910> yeah<00:02:39.720> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to feed them but it's the treats yeah I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.300 
to feed them but it's the treats yeah I
find<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> treats<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> bin

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
find it's the treats and it's the bin

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.160 
find it's the treats and it's the bin
just<00:02:41.820> like<00:02:41.940> people<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.570> binge<00:02:42.750> eating<00:02:42.930> is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
just like people just a binge eating is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.420 
just like people just a binge eating is
there<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> quarterly<00:02:43.709> meals<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.250> there<00:02:44.400> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
there a quarterly meals is there a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.580 
there a quarterly meals is there a
correlation<00:02:44.640> between<00:02:45.000> over<00:02:45.630> weight<00:02:45.660> pet

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
if there's been a study done to look at

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.040 
if there's been a study done to look at
that<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.670> my<00:02:50.760> clinical<00:02:51.150> practice<00:02:51.209> yes<00:02:51.750> I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that but in my clinical practice yes I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.870 
that but in my clinical practice yes I
see<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> lot<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.890> dogs<00:02:53.160> were<00:02:53.310> overweight<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
see a lot of dogs were overweight and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.490 
see a lot of dogs were overweight and
their<00:02:54.000> owners<00:02:54.120> tend<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.990> be<00:02:55.080> overweight<00:02:55.380> as

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
their owners tend to be overweight as

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.350 
their owners tend to be overweight as
well<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.250> Nora<00:02:56.459> how<00:02:56.940> long<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.300> think
