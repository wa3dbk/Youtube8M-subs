00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
with dusted off like old rags and it
looks<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> lot<00:00:41.579> nicer<00:00:41.820> than<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> did<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.629> got

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
looks a lot nicer than it did when I got

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.440 
looks a lot nicer than it did when I got
it<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.820> basically<00:00:45.149> works

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
it and it all like basically works

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
it and it all like basically works
except<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> trake<00:00:46.530> track<00:00:46.890> had<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
except the trake track had a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.529 
except the trake track had a
deteriorated<00:00:48.030> belt<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.570> place<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> belt<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
deteriorated belt I place the belt but I

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.729 
deteriorated belt I place the belt but I
couldn't<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:51.629> find<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.960> good<00:00:52.140> belt<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> fit

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
couldn't really find a good belt to fit

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.760 
couldn't really find a good belt to fit
so<00:00:52.920> I'll<00:00:52.980> use<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> rubber<00:00:53.579> band<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:55.110> works

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so I'll use the rubber band and it works

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.700 
so I'll use the rubber band and it works
with<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.420> runs<00:00:57.809> slightly<00:00:58.170> slower

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with that but it runs slightly slower

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.490 
with that but it runs slightly slower
than<00:00:58.859> regular<00:00:59.219> speed<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.629> eventually<00:01:01.170> I'll

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
than regular speed but eventually I'll

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
than regular speed but eventually I'll
probably<00:01:01.710> find<00:01:02.010> another<00:01:02.280> belt<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.699> use<00:01:03.030> some

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
probably find another belt or use some

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
probably find another belt or use some
other<00:01:03.329> deck<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> great<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
other deck that's not that great and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.830 
other deck that's not that great and
sacrificed<00:01:05.909> its<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.659> or<00:01:06.810> something

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
sacrificed its up for this or something

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.710 
sacrificed its up for this or something
