stimulator edge control to compare it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.670 
stimulator edge control to compare it
unlike<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.879> creme<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.540> nature<00:01:02.690> one<00:01:03.320> better

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
unlike the creme of nature one better

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.370 
unlike the creme of nature one better
because<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:05.089> has<00:01:05.449> more<00:01:05.869> of<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:07.630> clear<00:01:08.630> texture

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
because it has more of a clear texture

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.990 
because it has more of a clear texture
it's<00:01:09.680> not<00:01:10.720> white<00:01:11.800> finish<00:01:12.800> but<00:01:13.369> actually<00:01:13.850> on

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's not white finish but actually on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.770 
it's not white finish but actually on
this<00:01:14.210> side<00:01:14.479> with<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.789> which<00:01:16.789> one<00:01:17.030> with<00:01:17.660> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
this side with the which one with the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.510 
this side with the which one with the
organic<00:01:18.259> root<00:01:18.410> stimulator<00:01:18.740> edge<00:01:19.220> control

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
organic root stimulator edge control

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.850 
organic root stimulator edge control
because<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.869> whiteness<00:01:21.289> it<00:01:21.440> actually

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
because of the whiteness it actually

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.430 
because of the whiteness it actually
fills<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.880> hairline<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.690> little<00:01:24.050> bit<00:01:24.170> more

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
fills in the hairline a little bit more

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.010 
fills in the hairline a little bit more
and<00:01:24.500> makes<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.160> hair<00:01:25.369> line<00:01:25.550> look<00:01:25.789> thicker<00:01:26.119> but

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
and makes the hair line look thicker but

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.169 
and makes the hair line look thicker but
overall<00:01:27.440> I<00:01:27.800> think<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.190> would<00:01:28.399> go<00:01:28.610> with<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
overall I think I would go with the
