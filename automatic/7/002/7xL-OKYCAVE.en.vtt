00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
on the ledge and they just spawn back in

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.570

look<00:01:44.650> up<00:01:44.890> there's<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.670> pipe<00:01:46.060> right<00:01:46.480> here<00:01:46.510> that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
look up there's a pipe right here that

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.480 
look up there's a pipe right here that
we<00:01:46.990> can<00:01:47.110> actually<00:01:47.200> jump<00:01:47.560> up<00:01:47.740> on<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.130> if<00:01:48.220> we<00:01:48.340> jump

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
we can actually jump up on to if we jump

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.070 
we can actually jump up on to if we jump
out<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.910> right<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.090> then<00:01:49.420> back<00:01:49.600> over<00:01:49.630> to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
out to the right and then back over to

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.200 
out to the right and then back over to
the<00:01:50.170> left<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:51.040> now<00:01:51.280> we're<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.760> pipe<00:01:51.940> okay

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
the left so now we're on the pipe okay

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.080 
the left so now we're on the pipe okay
you<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.320> jump<00:01:53.500> up<00:01:53.590> one<00:01:53.830> more<00:01:54.040> time<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.670> we're

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
you can jump up one more time and we're

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.120 
you can jump up one more time and we're
on<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:55.360> wall<00:01:55.630> right<00:01:55.660> here<00:01:55.870> now<00:01:56.680> if<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:56.980> look

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
on this wall right here now if you look

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.100 
on this wall right here now if you look
out<00:01:57.370> there's<00:01:57.910> where<00:01:58.180> we<00:01:58.270> normally<00:01:58.450> are<00:01:58.690> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
out there's where we normally are and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.130 
out there's where we normally are and
then<00:01:59.830> here's<00:02:00.640> out<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.150> map<00:02:01.330> just<00:02:01.630> like

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
then here's out of the map just like

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.140 
then here's out of the map just like
that<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.620> easy<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:03.730> can<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:03.880> hop<00:02:04.090> right

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
that that easy so you can just hop right

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.810 
that that easy so you can just hop right
down<00:02:04.540> here<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.740> you're<00:02:06.190> out<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.400> map<00:02:06.580> now

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
down here and you're out of the map now

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.910 
down here and you're out of the map now
it's<00:02:07.120> really<00:02:07.240> dark<00:02:07.540> but<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.800> a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
it's really dark but this is just like a

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.270 
it's really dark but this is just like a
lot<00:02:09.129> of<00:02:09.660> forests<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:11.050> know<00:02:11.230> tropical<00:02:11.950> normal

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
lot of forests you know tropical normal

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.010 
lot of forests you know tropical normal
stuff<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.730> would<00:02:12.850> see<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.330> Venus

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
stuff that you would see on Venus

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.320 
stuff that you would see on Venus
now<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:15.160> can't<00:02:15.430> go<00:02:15.550> any<00:02:15.730> farther<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.270> left

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
now we can't go any farther to the left

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.630 
now we can't go any farther to the left
but<00:02:16.600> we<00:02:16.720> can<00:02:16.840> go<00:02:17.020> as<00:02:17.350> far<00:02:17.950> as<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:18.190> went<00:02:18.370> over<00:02:18.490> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
but we can go as far as we went over to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.180 
but we can go as far as we went over to
the<00:02:18.730> right<00:02:18.940> okay<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:20.350> there's<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.800> big<00:02:20.950> gap

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
the right okay now there's a big gap

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.500 
the right okay now there's a big gap
right<00:02:21.460> here<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:21.850> took<00:02:22.120> me<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.330> while<00:02:22.450> to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
right here and I took me a while to

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.020 
right here and I took me a while to
figure<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.290> what<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.130> do<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.880> you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
figure it out but what you can do is you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.490 
figure it out but what you can do is you
can<00:02:25.060> hop<00:02:25.360> on<00:02:25.510> your<00:02:25.600> Sparrow<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.260> can<00:02:26.380> jump

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
can hop on your Sparrow and you can jump

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.190 
can hop on your Sparrow and you can jump
across<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.130> you're<00:02:27.910> good<00:02:28.060> you're<00:02:28.990> going<00:02:29.140> to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
across so you're good you're going to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.480 
across so you're good you're going to
boost<00:02:29.410> across<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.800> new<00:02:29.890> sparrow<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.340> once

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
boost across the new sparrow and once

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.800 
boost across the new sparrow and once
your<00:02:30.610> spirit<00:02:30.880> starts<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.270> drop<00:02:31.450> out<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
your spirit starts to drop out of the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.180 
your spirit starts to drop out of the
sky<00:02:32.020> you're<00:02:32.260> gonna<00:02:32.350> hop<00:02:32.590> off<00:02:32.800> you're<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.130> a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
sky you're gonna hop off you're going a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.100 
sky you're gonna hop off you're going a
double<00:02:33.520> jump<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.910> glide<00:02:33.940> across<00:02:34.330> okay<00:02:34.930> I've

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
double jump or glide across okay I've

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.780 
double jump or glide across okay I've
seen<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.440> done<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:35.830> all<00:02:36.010> class<00:02:36.310> types<00:02:36.580> so

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
seen this done with all class types so

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.550 
seen this done with all class types so
it<00:02:36.880> does<00:02:37.030> work<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.300> everybody<00:02:37.690> actually

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
it does work for everybody actually

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.750 
it does work for everybody actually
think<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.920> hunter<00:02:39.190> if<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.490> can<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:39.730> over

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
think the hunter if you can get over

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.070 
think the hunter if you can get over
here<00:02:40.240> if<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.390> can<00:02:40.480> get<00:02:40.570> on<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.750> ledge<00:02:40.930> you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
here if you can get on that ledge you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.310 
here if you can get on that ledge you
might<00:02:41.290> have<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.680> advantage<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:43.200> what<00:02:44.200> we're

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
might have the advantage so what we're

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.140 
might have the advantage so what we're
going<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.500> do<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.710> I'm<00:02:44.890> going<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.070> try<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.460> if<00:02:45.790> I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
going to do is I'm going to try it if I

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.240 
going to do is I'm going to try it if I
don't<00:02:46.330> get<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.660> then<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.440> will<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:47.710> cut<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
don't get it then I will just cut to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.060 
don't get it then I will just cut to
whenever<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.270> do<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.290> runway<00:02:50.710> I<00:02:50.830> do<00:02:50.980> get

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
whenever I do to the runway I do get

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.860 
whenever I do to the runway I do get
across<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.210> prove<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.540> y'all<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.780> you

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
across so I can prove to y'all that you

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.700 
across so I can prove to y'all that you
can<00:02:53.080> do<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.770> go<00:02:58.530> alright<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.650> we

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
can do it so here we go alright so we

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.280 
can do it so here we go alright so we
got<00:02:59.740> a<00:02:59.860> first<00:03:00.100> try<00:03:00.310> um<00:03:00.580> okay<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.900> can<00:03:02.050> land

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
got a first try um okay so you can land

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.630 
got a first try um okay so you can land
on<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.620> thing<00:03:02.830> that's<00:03:03.010> what<00:03:03.100> i<00:03:03.130> actually

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
on this thing that's what i actually

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.240 
on this thing that's what i actually
prefer<00:03:03.850> but<00:03:04.390> if<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.660> crouch<00:03:04.990> you'll<00:03:05.350> get<00:03:05.470> like

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
prefer but if you crouch you'll get like

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.610 
prefer but if you crouch you'll get like
you'll<00:03:06.640> hit<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.910> barrier<00:03:07.270> right<00:03:07.510> here<00:03:07.690> okay<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you'll hit a barrier right here okay so

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.440 
you'll hit a barrier right here okay so
you<00:03:08.680> can<00:03:08.770> jump<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.370> then<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:09.700> can<00:03:09.850> crouch<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
you can jump and then you can crouch and

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.540 
you can jump and then you can crouch and
get<00:03:10.630> around<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:11.050> barrier<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.770> then<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.430> can

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
get around that barrier and then you can

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.060 
get around that barrier and then you can
just<00:03:12.670> jump<00:03:12.820> across<00:03:13.000> no<00:03:13.390> problem<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.070> that's

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
just jump across no problem so that's

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.350 
just jump across no problem so that's
actually<00:03:15.250> pretty<00:03:15.610> awesome<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:16.060> we<00:03:16.120> made<00:03:16.270> it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
actually pretty awesome that we made it

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.650 
actually pretty awesome that we made it
on<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.510> first<00:03:16.690> try<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:18.490> as<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.700> can<00:03:18.820> see<00:03:19.060> we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
on the first try so as you can see we

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.630 
on the first try so as you can see we
are<00:03:19.690> outside<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> map<00:03:20.530> clearly<00:03:21.070> now<00:03:21.610> a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
are outside of the map clearly now a

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.550 
are outside of the map clearly now a
little<00:03:22.000> disclaimer<00:03:22.390> once<00:03:22.870> you're<00:03:23.050> over<00:03:23.080> here

little disclaimer once you're over here

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560 
little disclaimer once you're over here
you're<00:03:23.770> over<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.370> like<00:03:24.730> there's<00:03:24.970> no<00:03:25.270> way<00:03:25.300> to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
you're over here like there's no way to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
get back to cross if you die you'll

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.220 
get back to cross if you die you'll
spawn<00:03:27.430> back<00:03:27.670> over<00:03:27.910> here<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:28.720> have<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:29.110> go

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
spawn back over here so you have to go

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.010 
spawn back over here so you have to go
to<00:03:29.290> orbit<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.830> get<00:03:29.980> out<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.370> now<00:03:31.090> honestly

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
to orbit to get out of this now honestly

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.420 
to orbit to get out of this now honestly
that's<00:03:32.140> not<00:03:32.320> that<00:03:32.410> big<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.650> deal<00:03:32.770> because<00:03:32.980> if

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
that's not that big of a deal because if

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.470 
that's not that big of a deal because if
you're<00:03:33.580> gonna<00:03:33.670> get<00:03:33.820> out<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.060> map<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.330> want

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
you're gonna get out of the map you want

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.840 
you're gonna get out of the map you want
to<00:03:34.570> get<00:03:34.660> out<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.780> map<00:03:34.959> anyways<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.070> as<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.790> can

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
to get out of map anyways so as you can

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.980 
to get out of map anyways so as you can
see<00:03:37.000> we<00:03:37.120> can<00:03:37.209> see<00:03:37.450> through<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.720> lot<00:03:37.870> of

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
see we can see through a lot of

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.140 
see we can see through a lot of
everything<00:03:38.440> that's<00:03:38.830> generally<00:03:39.580> generally

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
everything that's generally generally

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.000 
everything that's generally generally
the<00:03:40.540> way<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.840> goes<00:03:41.140> whenever<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.680> get<00:03:41.770> out<00:03:41.890> of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
the way it goes whenever you get out of

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.440 
the way it goes whenever you get out of
maps<00:03:42.160> on<00:03:42.340> anything<00:03:42.550> you<00:03:43.090> can<00:03:43.240> go<00:03:43.330> on<00:03:43.420> your

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
maps on anything you can go on your

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.000 
maps on anything you can go on your
Sparrow<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.110> can<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:44.470> go<00:03:44.650> for<00:03:44.680> a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
Sparrow and you can you just go for a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.570 
Sparrow and you can you just go for a
while<00:03:45.250> um<00:03:45.780> be<00:03:46.780> careful<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.230> can<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.250> fall

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
while um be careful you can you can fall

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.480 
while um be careful you can you can fall
out<00:03:48.610> some<00:03:49.240> places<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.830> haven't<00:03:51.010> found<00:03:51.220> too

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
out some places but I haven't found too

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.260 
out some places but I haven't found too
many<00:03:51.520> places<00:03:51.880> like<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.480> be<00:03:52.600> honest<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:54.270> I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
many places like that to be honest so I

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.510 
many places like that to be honest so I
normally<00:03:56.020> don't<00:03:56.290> try<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.800> drive<00:03:56.980> across<00:03:57.190> this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
normally don't try to drive across this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.780 
normally don't try to drive across this
oh<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:58.420> almost<00:03:58.720> fell<00:03:59.020> off<00:03:59.050> right<00:03:59.410> there<00:03:59.560> okay<00:03:59.800> so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
oh I almost fell off right there okay so

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.390 
oh I almost fell off right there okay so
yeah<00:04:01.270> this<00:04:01.450> is<00:04:01.570> pretty<00:04:01.720> much<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:01.990> guys<00:04:02.200> um<00:04:02.650> you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
yeah this is pretty much it guys um you

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.949 
yeah this is pretty much it guys um you
can<00:04:03.550> get<00:04:03.670> out<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.880> Venus<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.330> can<00:04:04.480> come<00:04:04.690> up<00:04:04.810> to

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
can get out of Venus you can come up to

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.600 
can get out of Venus you can come up to
these<00:04:05.110> walls<00:04:05.410> in<00:04:05.740> some<00:04:05.920> places<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.490> can

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
these walls in some places and you can

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.940 
these walls in some places and you can
see<00:04:06.880> through<00:04:07.180> them<00:04:07.330> clearly<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:08.020> think<00:04:08.830> it's

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
see through them clearly I think it's

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.170 
see through them clearly I think it's
kind<00:04:09.070> of<00:04:09.160> interesting<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.790> they<00:04:10.030> actually

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
kind of interesting that they actually

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.210 
kind of interesting that they actually
have<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.840> lot<00:04:11.140> of<00:04:11.170> textures<00:04:11.709> back<00:04:11.890> here<00:04:12.070> for

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
have a lot of textures back here for

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.150 
have a lot of textures back here for
things<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:12.640> don't<00:04:13.000> see<00:04:13.480> like<00:04:14.230> I'm<00:04:14.709> sure<00:04:15.040> you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
things you don't see like I'm sure you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.440 
things you don't see like I'm sure you
can<00:04:15.310> see<00:04:15.489> them<00:04:15.610> from<00:04:15.640> different<00:04:16.030> parts<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.359> the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
can see them from different parts of the

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.720 
can see them from different parts of the
map<00:04:16.630> but<00:04:16.959> for<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:17.890> most<00:04:18.040> part<00:04:18.130> this<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:18.400> behind

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
map but for the most part this is behind

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.880 
map but for the most part this is behind
a<00:04:18.910> lot<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.180> walls<00:04:19.410> let's<00:04:20.410> see<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.560> we<00:04:20.680> can<00:04:20.770> come

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
a lot of walls let's see if we can come

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.270 
a lot of walls let's see if we can come
up<00:04:20.950> here<00:04:21.690> can't<00:04:22.690> get<00:04:22.810> up<00:04:22.900> there<00:04:23.080> okay<00:04:23.740> that's

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
up here can't get up there okay that's

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.000 
up here can't get up there okay that's
cool<00:04:24.490> but

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
cool but

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.950 
cool but
like<00:04:26.160> now<00:04:26.790> we're<00:04:26.970> under<00:04:27.210> these<00:04:27.360> buildings<00:04:27.780> you

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
like now we're under these buildings you

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.930 
like now we're under these buildings you
can<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.260> go<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:28.980> on<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.400> me<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:29.850> my

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
can just go on and on and on me and my

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.300 
can just go on and on and on me and my
friends<00:04:30.240> spend<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.510> couple<00:04:30.680> couple<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.860> minutes

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
friends spend a couple couple of minutes

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.120 
friends spend a couple couple of minutes
down<00:04:32.430> here<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.760> other<00:04:32.850> day<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.510> we<00:04:34.500> just<00:04:34.740> you

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
down here the other day and we just you

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.620 
down here the other day and we just you
could<00:04:35.250> go<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.550> forever<00:04:37.730> but<00:04:38.730> simply<00:04:39.480> approach

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
could go on forever but simply approach

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.900 
could go on forever but simply approach
to<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:39.990> there<00:04:40.200> we<00:04:40.320> go<00:04:40.500> so<00:04:41.070> now<00:04:41.220> we<00:04:41.280> can<00:04:41.520> see

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
to that there we go so now we can see

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.470 
to that there we go so now we can see
through<00:04:43.040> we<00:04:44.040> can<00:04:44.220> see<00:04:44.460> through<00:04:44.880> these<00:04:45.090> walls

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
through we can see through these walls

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.150 
through we can see through these walls
but<00:04:46.020> anything<00:04:46.500> that's<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.920> other<00:04:46.950> side

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
but anything that's on the other side

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.540 
but anything that's on the other side
can't<00:04:47.760> see<00:04:48.090> through<00:04:48.420> to<00:04:48.540> us<00:04:48.800> ok<00:04:49.800> now<00:04:50.490> the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
can't see through to us ok now the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.490 
can't see through to us ok now the
enemies<00:04:50.910> if<00:04:51.150> they<00:04:51.330> see<00:04:51.390> over<00:04:52.050> there<00:04:52.170> they<00:04:52.320> will

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
enemies if they see over there they will

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.340 
enemies if they see over there they will
shoot<00:04:52.800> at<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:54.030> they<00:04:54.450> can't<00:04:54.750> hit<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.170> so

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
shoot at you but they can't hit you so

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.070 
shoot at you but they can't hit you so
you're<00:04:55.500> pretty<00:04:55.620> much<00:04:55.740> invincible<00:04:56.040> over<00:04:56.400> here

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
you're pretty much invincible over here

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.660 
you're pretty much invincible over here
you<00:04:58.080> know<00:04:58.170> I<00:04:58.200> think<00:04:58.380> they<00:04:58.620> could<00:04:58.800> see<00:04:59.040> like<00:04:59.460> if

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
you know I think they could see like if

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.100 
you know I think they could see like if
there's<00:05:00.030> another<00:05:00.240> player<00:05:00.540> over<00:05:00.870> there<00:05:00.990> they

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
there's another player over there they

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.460 
there's another player over there they
could<00:05:01.290> see<00:05:01.470> through<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.160> wall<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:04.200> like<00:05:04.320> yeah

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
could see through the wall so like yeah

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.320 
could see through the wall so like yeah
you<00:05:04.530> can<00:05:04.710> come<00:05:04.860> through<00:05:05.100> that<00:05:05.130> there's<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.150> lot

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
you can come through that there's a lot

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.580 
you can come through that there's a lot
of<00:05:06.360> buildings<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.900> can<00:05:06.930> go<00:05:07.110> through<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.500> it

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
of buildings you can go through so it

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.200 
of buildings you can go through so it
might<00:05:07.770> look<00:05:07.800> like<00:05:08.070> you're<00:05:08.460> stuck<00:05:08.820> like<00:05:09.060> you

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
might look like you're stuck like you

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.120 
might look like you're stuck like you
can't<00:05:09.450> go<00:05:09.600> any<00:05:09.810> farther<00:05:09.990> but<00:05:10.440> in<00:05:10.680> reality<00:05:10.830> you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
can't go any farther but in reality you

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.210 
can't go any farther but in reality you
actually<00:05:11.460> can<00:05:11.730> so<00:05:12.470> that's<00:05:13.470> pretty<00:05:13.830> much<00:05:13.920> where

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
actually can so that's pretty much where

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.620 
actually can so that's pretty much where
I'm<00:05:14.310> going<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.520> wrap<00:05:14.610> this<00:05:14.790> video<00:05:14.910> up<00:05:15.060> guys<00:05:15.330> if

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
like this I know there's a way to get

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.030 
like this I know there's a way to get
out<00:05:18.120> of<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.330> map<00:05:18.480> on<00:05:18.720> old<00:05:19.020> Russia<00:05:19.260> I<00:05:19.530> might<00:05:19.830> try

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
out of the map on old Russia I might try

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.440 
out of the map on old Russia I might try
to<00:05:20.070> do<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.310> guide<00:05:20.520> on<00:05:20.670> that<00:05:20.820> if<00:05:20.940> y'all<00:05:21.090> want<00:05:21.360> to

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
to do a guide on that if y'all want to

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.700 
to do a guide on that if y'all want to
see<00:05:21.570> that<00:05:21.690> if<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:21.900> one<00:05:22.110> goes<00:05:22.200> over<00:05:22.350> well<00:05:22.590> I'll

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
see that if this one goes over well I'll

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.500 
see that if this one goes over well I'll
go<00:05:22.890> ahead<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:23.100> I'll<00:05:23.280> make<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.760> that<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.210> I

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
go ahead and I'll make one on that so I

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.480 
go ahead and I'll make one on that so I
think<00:05:25.110> these<00:05:25.200> things<00:05:25.260> are<00:05:25.530> pretty<00:05:25.680> cool<00:05:25.980> I
