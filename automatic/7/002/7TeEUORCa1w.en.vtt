00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
are four of them and the reason why they

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.580 
are four of them and the reason why they
did<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.540> because<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.380> one

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
did this was because when there was one

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020 
did this was because when there was one
ring<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> middle<00:01:20.159> everyone<00:01:20.759> would<00:01:21.000> just

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
ring in the middle everyone would just

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
ring in the middle everyone would just
constantly<00:01:21.780> crowd<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:23.159> there

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
constantly crowd in there because there

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.130 
constantly crowd in there because there
was<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.759> place<00:01:23.970> where<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.330> exchange<00:01:24.540> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
was one place where you can exchange so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.140 
was one place where you can exchange so
everyone<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:25.920> crowd<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.759> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
everyone was just all crowd there and it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
everyone was just all crowd there and it
would<00:01:27.270> cause<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> lot<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> lag<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:28.950> sure

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
would cause a lot of lag and I'm sure

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
would cause a lot of lag and I'm sure
most<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.549> guys<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.939> dealt<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> before

I<00:01:57.600> myself<00:01:57.960> enjoy<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.710> graphical<00:01:59.130> updates

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
I myself enjoy the graphical updates

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
I myself enjoy the graphical updates
because<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.119> makes<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> game<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:00.840> more

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
because it makes the game look more

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.219 
because it makes the game look more
realistic<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.790> don't<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.509> love

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
realistic and I don't know I just love

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.780 
realistic and I don't know I just love
it<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.469> i<00:02:04.649> see<00:02:04.890> graphical<00:02:05.369> updates<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.759> your

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it when i see graphical updates on your

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.670 
it when i see graphical updates on your
escape<00:02:06.030> i<00:02:06.329> do<00:02:06.570> miss<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.110> old<00:02:07.320> runescape

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.160 
escape i do miss the old runescape
graphics<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.489> those<00:02:09.209> were<00:02:09.390> good<00:02:09.539> times<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
graphics but those were good times and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.690 
graphics but those were good times and
it<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> 2011<00:02:11.280> now

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it is 2011 now

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.339 
it is 2011 now
I<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> new<00:02:12.450> graphics<00:02:12.900> better<00:02:13.050> than

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
I do like the new graphics better than

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.320 
I do like the new graphics better than
the<00:02:13.440> old<00:02:13.590> ones<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.670> Grain<00:02:14.819> Exchange<00:02:14.849> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the old ones so the Grain Exchange I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.420 
the old ones so the Grain Exchange I
would<00:02:15.780> probably<00:02:15.989> give<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.800> rating<00:02:17.190> from

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
would probably give that a rating from

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.270 
would probably give that a rating from
ten<00:02:17.760> I'd<00:02:18.090> say<00:02:18.260> eight<00:02:19.260> out<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> ten<00:02:19.800> just

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
ten I'd say eight out of the ten just

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.610 
ten I'd say eight out of the ten just
because<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.780> kind<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.080> different<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
because that it is kind of different and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.080 
because that it is kind of different and
it<00:02:22.769> will<00:02:22.890> take<00:02:23.069> some<00:02:23.280> time<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.730> used<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it will take some time to get used to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.390 
it will take some time to get used to
but<00:02:24.720> overall<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.440> gran<00:02:25.590> exchange<00:02:25.890> update<00:02:26.220> was
