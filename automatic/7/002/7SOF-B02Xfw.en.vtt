00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
there are three packages the first one

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.350 
there are three packages the first one
is<00:01:26.909> $30<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:28.049> includes<00:01:28.470> 15<00:01:29.070> minutes<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> talk

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
is $30 which includes 15 minutes of talk

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
is $30 which includes 15 minutes of talk
time<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:30.930> essentially<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.439> works<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
time now essentially that works out to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
time now essentially that works out to
about<00:01:32.070> 60<00:01:32.729> cents<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> minute
