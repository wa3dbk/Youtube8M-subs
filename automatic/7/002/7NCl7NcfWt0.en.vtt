00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hi, I'm very good, you're Cascais. 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.500
 Well today I'll explain 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.790
 all about weight loss and the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.740
 decrease in percentage of fat 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.929
 good body first thing we should 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.570
 to know is that we need a deficit 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.029
 caloric a caloric deficit is that in 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.029
 the one that the calories that we ingest are 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.210
 less than the calories we spend for 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.570
 example if I said 2,000 kilocalories 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.079
 and I spend 2 thousand 500 kilocalories would have 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.179
 a caloric deficit of 500 calories 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.079
 these are going to come from the oxidation of 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.269
 The fats 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.609
 we know that approximately one gram of 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.559
 fat are 9 kilocalories so for 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.629
 lose a kilogram of fat 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.730
 I will need to be of 9 thousand kilocalories 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.949
 It should be noted that this does not have to be 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 only in a day but it can be section 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.800
 a week or two weeks or a certain 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.839
 good period there are three ways to get there 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 to a caloric deficit the first and the 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.640
 more important is the feeding 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.980
 we want to control our diet in the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.440
 case of humans we ingest 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.870
 between 2000 and 2500 kilocalories for 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.870
 being on a neutral diet is not going 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.840
 to have neither loss nor advance of weight 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.430
 so if a woman wants to be in 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.160
 a hypocaloric diet is to say a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.690
 diet that generates a caloric deficit 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.570
 you will need to be in a range of 1,000 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.130
 local days and be at 1,300 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.540
 kilocalories 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.820
 in the case of men it is a bit 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 greater due to the requirement of tone 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.509
 muscle that you have then in the case 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 of men would be 10,500 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.270
 kilocalories 1,800 kilocalories in both 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.460
 cases there would be a caloric and good deficit 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.000
 what is recommended for a person 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.039
 average would be between half a kilo to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.410
 maximum one kilo per week of fat 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.539
 It should also be noted that it is 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.539
 because this weight loss is not just going to 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:59.009
 be of fat but there will also be 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:01.320
 liquids and also a little bit but for 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.539
 we should keep in mind that our 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.400
 macronutrients are very present and in 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.560
 the appropriate amounts in the case of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.929
 the proteins should be a gram like 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.299
 minimum to maintain a tone 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.790
 muscular good the second way to 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.310
 to lose 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.190
 body weight 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.870
 is to make a caloric deficit by 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.500
 exercise that is to say keep the calories 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.150
 that we usually consume 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.990
 decreasing them and creating this deficit 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.790
 caloric through physical exercise 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.100
 there is aerobic exercise and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.430
 aerobic in this case the most important thing 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.860
 it would be electronic work since it generates 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.020
 a greater expense of kilocalories in a 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.370
 less time but it is also important 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.310
 have a few sessions 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.900
 aerobic exercise because this one 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.680
 will keep our tone exhausted 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.659
 muscular good the third way 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.790
 next to the first and the second is to say 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.430
 a hypocaloric diet and exercise 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.489
 cardiovascular since with this form 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.140
 let's get the best results 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 Well now I'll talk about a few 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.250
 minutes that exist for example sweat 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.739
 it is always associated with fat which 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.950
 it is totally false this is not possible 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.829
 because sweat alone are liquid 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.260
 like some electrolytes and it's a 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.349
 substance that serves to cool us 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.819
 when we raise our temperature is 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.579
 why when an external medium 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.680
 as the temperature of the sun makes us 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.280
 raising this temperature and therefore 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.560
 we sweat to keep cool 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.560
 then we conclude that it is a means of 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.720
 cooling therefore any 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.209
 substance or component that deals with 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.860
 bring our temperature in shape 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.170
 external will not help us lose weight 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.750
 it will simply make us sweat more and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.520
 eliminate liquids which when drinking water 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.190
 we will get the same weight and 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.950
 that there is no effective result if 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.319
 there is an external substance could be 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.270
 cold substances and not as much as 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.520
 they think hot because this 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.190
 would generate that we spend more heat to 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.650
 keep us at a temperature of 37 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.620
 Celsius degrees approximately 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.540
 well then this this what I wanted 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.920
 tell them about weight loss and 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.650
 the decrease in the percentage of fat 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.289
 The most important thing, as I say, is 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.449
 diet and also supplement it with 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.449
 aerobic cardiovascular exercise
