00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.450
 in the long run to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.030
 sleep, you just need to know the rules 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.340
 golden baby sleep such rules have 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.430
 10 So let's take these rules quickly 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.490
 consider and if we know these rules 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.439
 it will probably be easier for us to sleep 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.949
 the whole family, that is, we will have a strong 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.109
 sleep all family members again 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.840
 I emphasize this first rule 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.840
 that you must prioritize and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.309
 the main priority is that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.320
 nobody is interested in the child sleeping 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.860
 at the cost of insomnia dad and mom 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.510
 our main task is calm sweet 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.660
 sleep of all family members 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.989
 rule second decide on the mode 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 sleep mode should be convenient to mom 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.039
 and dad 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.890
 if you are comfortable to sleep at 10 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.940
 in the evening, make that decision 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.989
 convenient to make a decision 12 is 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 the decision is based on how you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.299
 work as you like what you have 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 biological rhythms have you and but 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.780
 if you have already decided that you are laying 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.710
 sleep at 23:00 then obey you 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 Decided to decide further where to sleep 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 with whom if you want to sleep in three 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.680
 it's your right if mom is pleased when 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.290

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.060
 endlessly no one insists on 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.549
 that this should not be so 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.430
