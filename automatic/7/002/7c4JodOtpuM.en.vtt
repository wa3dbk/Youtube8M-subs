it's<00:00:44.190> more<00:00:44.340> fun<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> move<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.809> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's more fun because a move like that

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's more fun because a move like that
during<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.440> game<00:00:46.590> today<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.910> difficult<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.390> do

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
during a game today it's difficult to do

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
during a game today it's difficult to do
even<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.620> said<00:00:49.770> before<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.430> be

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
even if like I said before it can be

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.920 
even if like I said before it can be
really<00:00:50.820> useful<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.809> discuss<00:00:53.719> but<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
really useful I just discuss but if you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.569 
really useful I just discuss but if you
miss<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.590> pretty<00:00:55.800> ridiculous<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
miss it you look pretty ridiculous so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.979 
miss it you look pretty ridiculous so
it's<00:00:56.789> best<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> during<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.840> match

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's best not to do it during a match

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.450 
it's best not to do it during a match
how<00:00:58.710> much<00:01:00.469> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.710> only<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> have

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
how much you can only do it if you have

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.170 
how much you can only do it if you have
the<00:01:02.550> opportunity<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:04.320> know<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.830> example

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180
