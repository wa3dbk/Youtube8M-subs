00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
wanted running on as low revs as

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.390 
wanted running on as low revs as
possible<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.080> obviously<00:01:22.409> me<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.189> cold

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
possible but obviously me I want as cold

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
possible but obviously me I want as cold
as<00:01:23.520> possible<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.210> put<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> a

as possible so I put it on there and a
speed<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.780> 2,000<00:01:27.780> revs<00:01:28.460> per<00:01:29.460> minute<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.590> as

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
speed of 2,000 revs per minute so and as

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
speed of 2,000 revs per minute so and as
you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.549> starting<00:01:33.030> off<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you can see starting off at what was it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.679 
you can see starting off at what was it
44<00:01:34.259> thinks<00:01:34.680> something<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:36.540> you

44 thinks something like that and you
can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> mean<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> speed<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.400> part<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
can see I mean a speed this part the

but it ended up cooling it down to about

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.090 
but it ended up cooling it down to about
28<00:03:02.400> degrees<00:03:02.820> flat<00:03:03.180> which<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.290> know<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.920> is

15<00:03:08.070> degrees<00:03:08.640> compared<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.209> what<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.360> had<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.660> so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
15 degrees compared to what I had it so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.140 
15 degrees compared to what I had it so
definitely<00:03:10.739> keeping<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.160> cool<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.640> wouldn't

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
definitely keeping it cool I wouldn't

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.820 
definitely keeping it cool I wouldn't
send<00:03:12.330> regards<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.140> cheapest<00:03:13.650> fan

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
send regards that the the cheapest fan

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.140 
send regards that the the cheapest fan
out<00:03:13.950> there<00:03:13.980> by<00:03:14.280> any<00:03:14.430> means<00:03:14.670> because<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:15.060> know

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
out there by any means because you know

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.760 
out there by any means because you know
it<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> good<00:03:15.690> quality<00:03:16.050> product<00:03:16.470> because

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
it is a good quality product because

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.680 
it is a good quality product because
some<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.760> ones<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.239> get<00:03:18.420> for

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
some of the ones that you can get for

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.270 
some of the ones that you can get for
the<00:03:19.290> slim<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.890> even<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> old<00:03:20.340> xbox<00:03:22.280> basically

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the slim and even the old xbox basically

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.729 
the slim and even the old xbox basically
draws<00:03:23.670> more<00:03:24.000> voltage<00:03:24.540> from<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.170> from<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
draws more voltage from the from the

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.860 
draws more voltage from the from the
xbox<00:03:26.040> therefore<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:26.880> gets<00:03:27.030> warmer<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:27.690> with

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
xbox therefore it gets warmer but with

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.290 
xbox therefore it gets warmer but with
this<00:03:28.020> one<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.800> only<00:03:28.920> takes<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.970> small

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
this one it only takes a really small

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.710 
this one it only takes a really small
amount<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.110> got<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:32.180> total<00:03:33.180> cpu<00:03:33.360> in

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
amount as it's got the total cpu in

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.390 
amount as it's got the total cpu in
their<00:03:33.840> transition<00:03:34.080> resistors<00:03:34.920> telling<00:03:35.280> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
their transition resistors telling it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.949 
their transition resistors telling it
not<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.730> draw<00:03:35.910> water<00:03:36.060> power<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:36.540> once<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.810> gets

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
not to draw water power but once it gets

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.020 
not to draw water power but once it gets
in<00:03:37.080> there<00:03:37.200> amplify<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.770> power<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.700> spin<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
in there amplify the power to spin the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.360 
in there amplify the power to spin the
phone<00:03:39.209> up<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.330> 2,000<00:03:39.959> ribs<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.160> really

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
phone up to 2,000 ribs so it's a really

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.070 
phone up to 2,000 ribs so it's a really
good<00:03:41.489> thing<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.510> doesn't<00:03:42.720> draw

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
good thing that you know it doesn't draw

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.050 
good thing that you know it doesn't draw
any<00:03:43.320> extra<00:03:43.680> power<00:03:43.830> for<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.130> xbox<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.760> all<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
any extra power for the xbox and all the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.030 
any extra power for the xbox and all the
slims<00:03:45.620> do<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.130> facility<00:03:49.010> unlike<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
slims do have that facility unlike the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.310 
slims do have that facility unlike the
old<00:03:50.160> xbox<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.970> too<00:03:51.330> didn't<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.019> know<00:03:52.140> if<00:03:52.230> you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
old xbox is too didn't you know if you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.140 
old xbox is too didn't you know if you
put<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.709> USB<00:03:53.130> device<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.820> drew<00:03:54.000> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
put a USB device and it just drew the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.509 
put a USB device and it just drew the
same<00:03:54.330> power<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.720> new<00:03:54.870> Slim's<00:03:55.290> actually<00:03:56.220> give

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
same power the new Slim's actually give

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.790 
same power the new Slim's actually give
extra<00:03:56.820> power<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.360> USB<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.470> know<00:03:58.590> both

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
extra power to the USB so you know both

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.420 
extra power to the USB so you know both
ways<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.280> works<00:03:59.430> great<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.440> yeah<00:04:01.590> great
