insurgent it's the world of divergent
getting<00:00:23.810> bigger<00:00:24.550> essentially<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.699> civil<00:00:26.149> war

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.369 

so<00:00:54.890> much<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.340> hard<00:00:55.579> work<00:00:55.789> of<00:00:56.379> divergent

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
so much of the hard work of divergent

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.950 
so much of the hard work of divergent
was<00:00:57.980> establishing<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.149> rules<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.750> world

was establishing the rules of the world
our<00:01:00.710> founders<00:01:01.160> built<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.489> wall<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.699> keep<00:01:02.059> us

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
our founders built the wall to keep us

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.020 
our founders built the wall to keep us
safe<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.070> they<00:01:04.070> divided<00:01:04.460> us<00:01:04.519> into<00:01:04.699> five

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
safe and they divided us into five

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.770 
safe and they divided us into five
factions<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:06.710> keep<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.070> peace<00:01:07.659> are<00:01:08.659> you

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
factions to keep the peace are you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.460 
factions to keep the peace are you
nervous<00:01:09.369> for<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:10.399> for<00:01:11.240> your<00:01:11.360> Dustin<00:01:11.810> that's

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
nervous for you for your Dustin that's

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.609 
nervous for you for your Dustin that's
terrified<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.580> test<00:01:13.820> will<00:01:13.970> tell<00:01:14.119> me<00:01:14.270> who<00:01:14.420> I<00:01:14.450> am

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
terrified the test will tell me who I am

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.149 
terrified the test will tell me who I am
where<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:15.649> belong<00:01:17.560> your<00:01:18.560> results<00:01:18.979> were

can't<00:01:22.220> tell<00:01:22.369> anyone<00:01:22.549> about<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:22.909> not<00:01:23.030> even

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
can't tell anyone about this not even

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.969 
can't tell anyone about this not even
your<00:01:23.299> parents<00:01:23.530> divergence<00:01:24.530> can't<00:01:24.800> be

your parents divergence can't be

your parents divergence can't be
controlled<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.759> it's<00:01:26.330> absolutely<00:01:26.509> necessary

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.770
