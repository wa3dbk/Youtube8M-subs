you<00:02:37.220> end<00:02:37.400> up<00:02:37.520> with<00:02:37.700> slightly<00:02:37.940> larger<00:02:38.510> or

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
you end up with slightly larger or

over them anyway or cover them up with
something<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:43.970> doesn't<00:02:44.240> matter

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390

to add the decorations I've used this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.940 
to add the decorations I've used this
pattern<00:02:53.480> tool<00:02:53.720> on<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.170> top<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.830> bottom

as<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.800> can<00:02:57.950> see<00:02:58.010> I've<00:02:58.310> added<00:02:58.490> reindeer<00:02:59.060> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
as you can see I've added reindeer to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.030 
as you can see I've added reindeer to
the<00:02:59.270> top<00:02:59.480> tier<00:02:59.780> and<00:02:59.959> Christmas<00:03:00.500> trees<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
bottom tier with some additional shapes

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.640 
bottom tier with some additional shapes
always<00:03:04.220> attach<00:03:04.580> your<00:03:04.850> application<00:03:05.690> first<00:03:06.110> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
always attach your application first and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.160 
always attach your application first and
then<00:03:07.490> you<00:03:07.670> only<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.150> pipe<00:03:08.450> over<00:03:08.750> any

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
then you only have to pipe over any

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.650 
then you only have to pipe over any
holes<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.220> still<00:03:10.520> see<00:03:10.550> on<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
holes that you can still see on the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.050 
holes that you can still see on the
Bollywood<00:03:11.840> cake<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:12.830> more<00:03:13.130> about<00:03:13.370> color<00:03:13.730> and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
Bollywood cake it's more about color and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.270 
Bollywood cake it's more about color and
as<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.600> can<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:14.990> I've<00:03:15.260> used<00:03:15.320> colors<00:03:16.040> that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
as you can see I've used colors that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.580 
as you can see I've used colors that
complement<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.060> other<00:03:17.090> three<00:03:17.690> tiers<00:03:17.990> on<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
complement the other three tiers on the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.500 
complement the other three tiers on the
cake

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.500 

and<00:03:26.599> so<00:03:27.439> -<00:03:27.500> pattern<00:03:27.980> -<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.180> really

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
and so - pattern - this is a really

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.300 
and so - pattern - this is a really
pretty<00:03:29.810> six<00:03:30.260> egg<00:03:30.439> design<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.099> works

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
pretty six egg design that works

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.789 
pretty six egg design that works
beautifully<00:03:31.579> on<00:03:31.970> its<00:03:32.120> own<00:03:32.329> or<00:03:32.870> as<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.200> base<00:03:33.439> for

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
beautifully on its own or as a base for

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:41.350 
beautifully on its own or as a base for
more<00:03:33.980> elaborate<00:03:34.549> patterns<00:03:39.879> how<00:03:40.879> pretty<00:03:41.239> is

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
more elaborate patterns how pretty is

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.720 
more elaborate patterns how pretty is
that<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.959> how<00:03:42.439> long<00:03:42.829> would<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.099> take<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.700> to

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
that and how long would it take you to

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.509 
that and how long would it take you to
mark<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.450> out<00:03:44.510> using<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.739> paper<00:03:45.980> template

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
mark that out using the paper template

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.690 
mark that out using the paper template
and<00:03:46.849> pins<00:03:47.150> as<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.110> bad<00:03:48.260> old<00:03:48.470> days<00:03:48.700> I've

used<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.239> tool<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.959> middle<00:03:51.230> tier<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.500> the

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
used this tool on the middle tier of the
