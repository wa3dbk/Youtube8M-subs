was<00:01:03.650> here<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.729> 2<00:01:06.000> gigabyte<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.659> had<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
was here we have the 2 gigabyte I had a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
was here we have the 2 gigabyte I had a
choice<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.500> either<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.580> gigabyte<00:01:08.939> or<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
choice of either the one gigabyte or the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
choice of either the one gigabyte or the
2<00:01:09.420> gigabyte<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> decided<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
2 gigabyte but I decided to go with this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.249 
2 gigabyte but I decided to go with this
one<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.610> believe<00:01:12.270> 4<00:01:12.570> gigabytes<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:14.150> $250

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
one I believe 4 gigabytes was $250

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.770 
one I believe 4 gigabytes was $250
because<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.860> 200<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.549> believe<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
because this one was 200 I believe so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990
