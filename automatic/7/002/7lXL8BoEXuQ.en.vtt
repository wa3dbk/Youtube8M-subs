your whole life so if you can see here

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.480 
your whole life so if you can see here
in<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.300> orange<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.960> yellow<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:29.039> says<00:00:29.250> it's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
in the orange to the yellow it says it's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.759 
in the orange to the yellow it says it's
acidic<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.869> into<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> green<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
acidic then we get into the green it's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.069 
acidic then we get into the green it's
neutral<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.120> into<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> blue<00:00:33.690> that's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
neutral then we get into the blue that's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.319 
neutral then we get into the blue that's
alpha<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.120> significance

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
alpha and what is this what significance

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.650 
alpha and what is this what significance
this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> play<00:00:37.309> guys<00:00:38.309> we're<00:00:38.940> drinking<00:00:39.480> and

eating a lot of acidic foods and a lot

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.240 
eating a lot of acidic foods and a lot
of<00:00:42.300> acidic<00:00:42.660> drinks<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.800> pass

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
of acidic drinks out here that we pass

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.069 
of acidic drinks out here that we pass
through<00:00:44.550> different<00:00:45.030> things<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.840> causing

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
through different things that's causing

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
a lot of obesity problems and what we're

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
a lot of obesity problems and what we're
doing<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.860> showing<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
difference between what kind of fluid

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.600 
difference between what kind of fluid
your<00:00:52.469> drink<00:00:52.649> cause<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.579> eat

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
your drink cause if you are what you eat

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.990 
your drink cause if you are what you eat
that<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.840> certainly<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.129> drink<00:00:56.430> so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that you are certainly what you drink so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.160 
that you are certainly what you drink so
what<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:57.870> going

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:00:58.199> take<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.190> I'm<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.940> going

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to take this right here I'm just going

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
to take this right here I'm just going
to<00:01:00.210> show<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.989> test<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.680> water

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to show you a little test on this water

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.000 
to show you a little test on this water
here<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> course<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.170> guess<00:01:04.650> everybody

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
here this is of course I guess everybody

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
here this is of course I guess everybody
knows<00:01:05.220> what<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
knows what that is this one is just a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.429 
knows what that is this one is just a
bottled<00:01:09.960> water

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
bottled water

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.980 
bottled water
most<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.280> these<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.430> reverse<00:01:11.850> osmosis<00:01:12.330> waters

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
most of these are reverse osmosis waters

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
most of these are reverse osmosis waters
okay<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.060> body<00:01:15.060> recognizes<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
okay so body recognizes that one this is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
okay so body recognizes that one this is
another<00:01:18.270> bottled<00:01:19.049> water<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.979> gonna

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
another bottled water we're just gonna

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.030 
another bottled water we're just gonna
do<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> little<00:01:20.430> test<00:01:20.790> real<00:01:21.150> quick<00:01:21.619> test<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> show

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
do a little test real quick test to show

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.670 
do a little test real quick test to show
you<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.610> pH<00:01:24.360> drops<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:25.560> kind<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> water<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you with pH drops what kind of water the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.960 
you with pH drops what kind of water the
people<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.100> drinking<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> water

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
people are drinking what kind of water

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510 
people are drinking what kind of water
you<00:01:30.180> drink<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:32.400> I've

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520

got this new technology that has ceramic
it<00:01:35.939> takes<00:01:36.270> any<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.840> water<00:01:37.170> except<00:01:37.560> for

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it takes any of this water except for

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
it takes any of this water except for
this<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.070> course<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.869> sweetened

okay with minerals that are dispersed
into<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> water<00:01:48.210> giving<00:01:48.509> me<00:01:48.630> high

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
into the water giving me high

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.819 
into the water giving me high
antioxidant<00:01:49.890> alkaline<00:01:50.399> water<00:01:51.090> okay<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.079> what
