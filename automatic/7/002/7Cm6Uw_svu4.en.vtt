you

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.880 

we've<00:00:49.400> just<00:00:49.760> finished<00:00:50.030> one<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.810> this<00:00:51.470> one<00:00:51.710> we

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
we've just finished one and this one we

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.740 
we've just finished one and this one we
made<00:00:52.100> in<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.370> circle<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:53.240> circle<00:00:53.420> is<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.720> little

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
made in a circle the circle is a little

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.470 
made in a circle the circle is a little
bit<00:00:54.320> small<00:00:54.740> so<00:00:55.430> on<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.640> next<00:00:55.760> one<00:00:56.000> we<00:00:56.030> decided

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
bit small so on the next one we decided

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.880 
bit small so on the next one we decided
to<00:00:56.540> make<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.720> just<00:00:56.900> a<00:00:57.140> little<00:00:57.440> bigger<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.860> little

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
to make it just a little bigger a little

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.500 
to make it just a little bigger a little
different<00:00:58.520> size<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:01.070> purchase<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.550> lawn

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.890 
Depot and I had to get a couple extra
stakes<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.190> total<00:01:10.550> looking<00:01:11.090> at<00:01:11.210> about<00:01:11.360> thirty

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
stakes so total looking at about thirty

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.120 
stakes so total looking at about thirty
bucks<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:13.250> that's<00:01:13.430> going<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.730> do<00:01:13.880> both<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
bucks and that's going to do both the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.800 
bucks and that's going to do both the
lawn<00:01:16.340> edging<00:01:16.790> on<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:17.240> tree<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.940> tree

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.719 

so<00:01:23.810> we<00:01:23.930> started<00:01:24.229> by<00:01:24.320> digging<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:25.070> trench<00:01:25.400> it

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
so we started by digging the trench it

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.580 
so we started by digging the trench it
doesn't<00:01:26.330> need<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.540> be<00:01:26.600> very<00:01:26.990> deep<00:01:27.229> at<00:01:27.410> all<00:01:29.590> just

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
doesn't need to be very deep at all just

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.000 
doesn't need to be very deep at all just
about<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.920> steep<00:01:32.020> then<00:01:33.020> lawn<00:01:33.350> edging<00:01:33.740> sits

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
about the steep then lawn edging sits

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.390 
about the steep then lawn edging sits
right<00:01:34.220> down<00:01:34.280> inside<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.100> started

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
right down inside of it and we started

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.020 
right down inside of it and we started
by<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.610> putting<00:01:37.910> in<00:01:38.150> one<00:01:38.360> stake<00:01:39.160> here<00:01:40.160> just

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
by you putting in one stake here just

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.609 
by you putting in one stake here just
pound<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.390> right<00:01:41.630> down<00:01:41.810> into<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.229> little

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
pound that right down into the little

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.420 
pound that right down into the little
edge<00:01:43.570> very<00:01:44.570> easy<00:01:47.740> next<00:01:48.740> we'll<00:01:48.950> put<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.220> one

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
edge very easy next we'll put in one

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.180 
edge very easy next we'll put in one
more<00:01:49.460> stake<00:01:49.880> here<00:01:50.770> then<00:01:51.770> we're<00:01:51.950> going<00:01:52.130> to

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
more stake here then we're going to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.580 
more stake here then we're going to
backfill<00:01:53.440> from<00:01:54.440> here<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.700> here<00:01:56.410> maybe<00:01:57.410> a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
backfill from here to here maybe a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.200 
backfill from here to here maybe a
little<00:01:57.950> fill<00:01:58.160> here<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:03.200> should<00:02:03.440> do<00:02:03.620> it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
little fill here and that should do it

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.640 
little fill here and that should do it
when<00:02:05.210> we're<00:02:05.450> done<00:02:05.480> we're<00:02:05.930> also<00:02:06.080> going<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.440> take

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
when we're done we're also going to take

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.600 
when we're done we're also going to take
remove<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.340> grass<00:02:07.580> from<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:08.090> side<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.310> here

remove the grass from this side so here
at<00:02:10.730> the<00:02:10.880> tree<00:02:11.120> we're<00:02:11.360> going<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.810> just

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
at the tree we're going to have just

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.870 
at the tree we're going to have just
mulch<00:02:13.280> maybe<00:02:13.970> some<00:02:14.300> plants<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> back<00:02:15.880> but

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
mulch maybe some plants in the back but

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.060 
mulch maybe some plants in the back but
no<00:02:17.060> grass<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:18.050> grass<00:02:18.260> will<00:02:18.470> come<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.950> it

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
no grass the grass will come up to it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.610 
no grass the grass will come up to it
here<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.810> going<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.140> make<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.380> much

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
here this is going to make it much

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.000 
here this is going to make it much
easier<00:02:21.890> for<00:02:22.239> weeding<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.810> will<00:02:24.019> we'll<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:24.920> able

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
easier for weeding it will we'll be able

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.780 
easier for weeding it will we'll be able
to<00:02:25.250> weed<00:02:25.370> eat<00:02:25.519> up<00:02:25.700> against<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:27.670> instead<00:02:28.670> of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
to weed eat up against this instead of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.590 
to weed eat up against this instead of
right<00:02:29.000> into<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.360> mulch<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.709> see<00:02:30.890> now

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
right into the mulch you can see now

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.090 
right into the mulch you can see now
even<00:02:32.600> though<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:33.080> mulch<00:02:33.380> here<00:02:33.680> we've<00:02:33.890> got

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
even though we have mulch here we've got

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.930 
even though we have mulch here we've got
so<00:02:34.700> much<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:36.140> grass<00:02:36.380> coming<00:02:37.280> into<00:02:37.610> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
so much of the grass coming into it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.500 
so much of the grass coming into it
there's<00:02:38.450> really<00:02:38.780> no<00:02:39.140> separation

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
there's really no separation

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.190 
there's really no separation
so<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:42.880> lawn<00:02:43.880> edging<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.570> going<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.049> help

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
so this lawn edging is going to help

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800 
so this lawn edging is going to help
give<00:02:45.530> us<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.890> separation<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.630> need

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
give us that separation that we need

00:02:47.810 --> 00:03:03.090 
give us that separation that we need
between<00:02:48.260> these<00:02:48.470> two<00:02:48.769> lawn<00:02:49.519> elements

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.150 

so<00:03:04.100> here<00:03:04.280> we're<00:03:04.430> doing<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.820> back<00:03:04.970> filling

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
so here we're doing the back filling

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.970 
so here we're doing the back filling
with<00:03:07.160> some<00:03:07.310> nice<00:03:07.490> good<00:03:07.790> black<00:03:08.060> dirt<00:03:08.860> get<00:03:09.860> it

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
with some nice good black dirt get it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:19.500 
with some nice good black dirt get it
really<00:03:10.240> packed<00:03:11.240> in<00:03:11.450> around

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.899 

all<00:03:20.319> right<00:03:20.890> we've<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:21.280> finished<00:03:21.430> removing

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909

all the grass and that looks really good

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.979

might<00:03:24.670> have<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:24.909> put<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> little<00:03:25.390> bit<00:03:25.569> more<00:03:25.659> dirt

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
in there to get it built up and then

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.050
