00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
something bigger such as a four by four

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.880 
something bigger such as a four by four
we<00:01:36.780> need<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.050> drill<00:01:37.290> into<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.910> you<00:01:38.910> set<00:01:39.300> it

plywood turn the jaws around and then

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.370 
plywood turn the jaws around and then
we'll<00:02:07.710> hold<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> 16<00:02:08.700> inches<00:02:10.040> place<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.220> in

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
we'll hold at the 16 inches place it in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.210 
we'll hold at the 16 inches place it in
set<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.530> lock<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.580> clamp<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.950> I'm<00:02:16.950> gonna<00:02:17.070> make<00:02:17.130> a
