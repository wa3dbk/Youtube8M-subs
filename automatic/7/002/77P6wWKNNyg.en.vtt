cancelling that I've heard from a gaming
headset<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.570> while<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.680> pretty<00:00:37.829> good

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
headset for a while so it's pretty good

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
headset for a while so it's pretty good
too<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.000> volume<00:00:39.420> control<00:00:39.500> right<00:00:40.500> down

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
too and the volume control right down

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.010 
too and the volume control right down
here<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.579> actually<00:00:41.730> controls<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> entire

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
here it actually controls the entire

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
here it actually controls the entire
volume<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:43.860> computer<00:00:44.370> rather<00:00:44.579> than<00:00:44.910> just

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
volume of your computer rather than just

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.380 
volume of your computer rather than just
the<00:00:45.360> volume<00:00:45.840> headsets<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.500> way<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:48.300> don't

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the volume headsets that way you don't

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.670 
the volume headsets that way you don't
have<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:48.960> change<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> bunch<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
have to really change up a bunch of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
have to really change up a bunch of
settings<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.809> pose

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
settings I can see how that can pose

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830 
settings I can see how that can pose
some<00:00:52.350> problems<00:00:52.410> later<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
some problems later on but like when you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
some problems later on but like when you
want<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.949> game<00:00:56.190> sound<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> go

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
want you know the game sound to go

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.010 
want you know the game sound to go
higher<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.449> still<00:00:57.930> want<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.379> your

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
higher but you still want like your

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.380 
higher but you still want like your
teamspeak<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.559> maybe<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.129> skype<00:01:02.550> volume<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
teamspeak or maybe your skype volume to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.550 
teamspeak or maybe your skype volume to
still<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:04.159> terrible<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.479> that's<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
still be terrible but that's one of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
still be terrible but that's one of the
problems<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.030> would

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
problems they have with it you would

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
right up here and then that's pretty

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.580 
right up here and then that's pretty
much<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.509> also<00:01:51.659> has<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
oublie setting which doesn't do very

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.010
