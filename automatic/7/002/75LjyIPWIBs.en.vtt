factory<00:00:57.350> amp<00:00:58.399> holder<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.520> here<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:02.840> it'll<00:01:03.840> be

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
factory amp holder up here so it'll be

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.670 
factory amp holder up here so it'll be
mounted<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.860> eventually<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.500> now

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
mounted up there eventually but for now

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.230 
mounted up there eventually but for now
i'm<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.040> doing<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> box<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.880> him<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.150> the

i'm just doing the box for him in the
sound<00:01:09.479> deadening<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:12.650> it'll<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.920> flushed

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
sound deadening so it'll be all flushed

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
sound deadening so it'll be all flushed
here's<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:14.939> side<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.430 

pretty<00:01:41.150> nice<00:01:41.299> amp<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.780> used<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.080> have<00:01:42.229> the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
pretty nice amp I used to have the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.149 
pretty nice amp I used to have the
alpine<00:01:42.680> pdx<00:01:43.220> 1000<00:01:44.500> did<00:01:45.500> pretty<00:01:45.710> good<00:01:45.799> power

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
alpine pdx 1000 did pretty good power

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.230 
alpine pdx 1000 did pretty good power
got<00:01:46.490> kind<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.790> hot<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:49.610> was<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> little

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
got kind of hot but it was a little

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.960 
got kind of hot but it was a little
powerhouse<00:01:50.600> for<00:01:51.140> sure<00:01:51.350> here's<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.460> first

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
powerhouse for sure here's the first

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.410 
powerhouse for sure here's the first
sheet<00:01:54.700> they<00:01:55.700> are<00:01:55.880> rated<00:01:56.450> at<00:01:57.700> 75<00:01:58.700> watts<00:01:59.060> per

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
sheet they are rated at 75 watts per

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.460 
sheet they are rated at 75 watts per
channel<00:01:59.619> does<00:02:00.619> actually<00:02:00.890> 106<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.470> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
channel does actually 106 and the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.570 
channel does actually 106 and the
subchannel<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.190> rated<00:02:04.460> at<00:02:04.549> 300<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:06.460> actual<00:02:07.460> is

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
subchannel is rated at 300 and actual is

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.720 
subchannel is rated at 300 and actual is
for<00:02:07.850> 33<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.720> that's<00:02:08.899> rms<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:10.720> guess<00:02:12.730> max

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
for 33 and that's rms so I guess max

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.220 
for 33 and that's rms so I guess max
power<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.330> probably<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.810> little<00:02:14.900> bit<00:02:15.050> more

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
power and probably a little bit more

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.360 
power and probably a little bit more
than<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:17.769> but<00:02:18.769> i'll<00:02:18.860> keep<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.190> all

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
than that so but i'll keep you all

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.930 
than that so but i'll keep you all
updated<00:02:19.600> talk<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.750> later
