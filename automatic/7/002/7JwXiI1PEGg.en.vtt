00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.420
 It was difficult to find this place. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.430
 You told me to be discreet, thank you. 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.260
 for me these vampires killed even 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.460
 even kill 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.460
 we must have a care 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.930
 I'm not afraid of vampire. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.640
 I know honey but I prefer boy. 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.640
 of what binds me 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.940
 then we both 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:00.790
 the girl took the bullet 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.790
 it was disgusting 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:11.380
 I have many suitcases and other woods 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.380
 toys make a long night benzing 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.229

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.380
 ae 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.340
 she managed to chatter 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.119
 I'm just getting fred, let's use the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.490
 head 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.770
 I just want a boy, it's our duty to help. 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.640
 we are so talking about duty honor 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:48.090
 they are vampires and mexico where we move 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.090
 we are all like that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:10.800
 let's try again 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.800
 help mother said 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.910
 whom you killed even I think I was 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:29.080
 I 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:29.080
 This is where the ipod comes in. 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.490
 I'm sorry about your friends 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.440
 not always like this, right? 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:11.790
 or is it not 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.120
 It's a non- expensive building, you live in 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.090
 Only a vampire land is much better. 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.080
 That's what he told me about. 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.650
 respect 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.750
 He left though he died I think 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.520
 Before you help tell me the truth. 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.590
 I do not know what it came to do here 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.940
 brother died you know it but 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.550
 So why was he on a motorcycle enough? 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.780
 to stay and let yourself be killed for 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.780
 of a stone he was looking for 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.850
 stone the moon stone 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.850
 I did not know what 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.780
 moon stone 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.520
