00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.410 

I<00:00:07.099> think<00:00:08.099> one<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.400> big<00:00:08.940> difference<00:00:09.300> is

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
I think one of the big difference is

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.330 
I think one of the big difference is
about<00:00:09.660> eventually<00:00:10.050> by<00:00:10.139> Disney<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
about eventually by Disney is the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160 
about eventually by Disney is the
storytelling<00:00:11.969> we<00:00:12.269> bring<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.660> stories<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
storytelling we bring the stories of the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.010 
storytelling we bring the stories of the
world<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.590> life<00:00:14.269> was<00:00:15.269> really<00:00:15.540> exciting<00:00:15.960> about

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
world to life was really exciting about

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.590 
world to life was really exciting about
developing<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.340> trip<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> idea<00:00:18.539> that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
developing this trip was the idea that

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390 
developing this trip was the idea that
we<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:18.990> go<00:00:19.170> ahead<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.470> find<00:00:19.890> these<00:00:20.160> great

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we can go ahead and find these great

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.340 
we can go ahead and find these great
stories<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.850> tell<00:00:21.180> people<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.109> just

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
stories to tell people and it's not just

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.830 
stories to tell people and it's not just
about<00:00:22.560> Paris<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.640> about<00:00:23.910> France<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> just

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
about Paris it's about France and just

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.330 
about Paris it's about France and just
the<00:00:24.930> different<00:00:25.230> regions<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the different regions that we go to and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.310 
the different regions that we go to and
just<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> stories<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.630> were<00:00:27.810> able<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> tell

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
just the stories that were able to tell

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.679 
just the stories that were able to tell
from<00:00:28.470> those<00:00:28.650> different<00:00:28.980> regions<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.689> think

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
from those different regions I think

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.120 
from those different regions I think
that<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.170> best<00:00:31.289> way<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.040> know

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that the best way that you can you know

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.950 
that the best way that you can you know
keep<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.640> authentic<00:00:33.090> experience<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.750> all

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
keep the authentic experience in all

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.979 
keep the authentic experience in all
these<00:00:34.170> places<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.160> actually

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
these places that we go is actually

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.270 
these places that we go is actually
having<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.260> people<00:00:37.620> who<00:00:37.710> live<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:37.920> tell

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
having the people who live there tell

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.850 
having the people who live there tell
the<00:00:38.399> story<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.780> finding<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> places

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
it to the next level being able to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.750 
it to the next level being able to
immerse<00:01:01.020> them<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.320> an<00:01:01.440> experience<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:02.609> we

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
immerse them in an experience so when we

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
immerse them in an experience so when we
go<00:01:03.000> into<00:01:03.329> Monet's<00:01:03.899> garden<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.439> someone<00:01:04.680> who

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
go into Monet's garden it's someone who

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.890 
go into Monet's garden it's someone who
knows<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.220> 18<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.659> it
