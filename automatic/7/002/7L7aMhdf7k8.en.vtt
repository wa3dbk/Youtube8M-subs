00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
keyboard player but it can be really

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.229

shoegazer<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.489> cool<00:02:46.489> term<00:02:46.730> right<00:02:47.090> now<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
shoegazer is the cool term right now and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.440 
shoegazer is the cool term right now and
so<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.820> would<00:02:49.940> do<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.720> would<00:02:51.220> record<00:02:52.220> it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
so what I would do is I would record it

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:20.210 
so what I would do is I would record it
something<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.810> this
