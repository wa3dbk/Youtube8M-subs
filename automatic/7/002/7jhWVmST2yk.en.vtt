00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.369
 but in the press I have much earlier 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.109
 also by and for young people after the past 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.650
 ap times in this plan a bit 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.490
 the pilot had had you with one 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.490
 the tone of rate politics has met 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.480
 the cabinet all started the room 10 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.349
 in need more 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.139
 because that can count over time 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.140
 attacks cure 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.390
 well for tom beans 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.180
 with customers 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.580
 the member of parliament 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.180
 arie can grab 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.930
 just clicking 3 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 I have told 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.530
 it is striking that looking out is a bit off 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.830
 in it the crime all help actor standards but I thought your detail 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.240
 somewhat disappointing this year 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.240
 Activist may also seem to be working 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.650
 he sold 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.260
 as in the newspaper and in one 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 always a little bit 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.920
 great top with short not with a few lamppost drove again this year 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 projects 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.560
 its match against mexico imagine the fire when chemistry pack is never ready 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.689
 I think you beat him once with 4 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.870
 something to do with Feyenoord 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.020
 I find minister 50 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
 ms a bit good for a long time 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.690
 the attacker I trust you enter 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.270
 the holes there we go again 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.700
 what you can imagine 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 and it is for sale 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 both for sale your child 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.250
 the attacker did 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 it is not going to leave 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 of course 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.570
 then from ling 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.570
 We think this is a ticket 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.439
 This may mean that a wine list is bankrupt 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.359
 and it falls 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.359
 the party always did 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.429
 nor does it seem like one 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 twice in Thailand and India 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.530
 Only then can you often become sore
