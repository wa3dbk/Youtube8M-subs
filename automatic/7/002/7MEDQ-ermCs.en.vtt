side<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> horseshoe<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.860> we're<00:00:50.010> trying<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
side of the horseshoe so we're trying to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.660 
side of the horseshoe so we're trying to
draw<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.090> pigeons<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> across<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.280> front<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
draw the pigeons in across in front of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.639 
draw the pigeons in across in front of
us<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> mostest

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
us so that we can get all the mostest

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.200 
us so that we can get all the mostest
eyes<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.100> shot<00:00:56.460> we've<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> pigeons

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
eyes on shot we've got on the pigeons

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
eyes on shot we've got on the pigeons
coming<00:00:57.570> directly<00:00:58.109> into<00:00:58.230> us<00:00:58.680> otherwise

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
coming directly into us otherwise

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.970 
coming directly into us otherwise
they'll<00:00:59.430> probably<00:00:59.699> see<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> movement<00:01:00.980> now

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
they'll probably see the movement now

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.740 
they'll probably see the movement now
we're<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> pan<00:01:02.609> round<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
we're going to pan round a bit here and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
we're going to pan round a bit here and
I<00:01:03.840> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> show<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:05.129> few<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> decoys

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
I want to show you a few of the decoys

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.600 
I want to show you a few of the decoys
now<00:01:06.960> they're<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.010> front<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> us<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
now they're in front of us now are the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.590 
now they're in front of us now are the
2010<00:01:11.610> row<00:01:12.000> turquois

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
2010 row turquois

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.219 
2010 row turquois
now<00:01:13.500> these<00:01:14.070> three<00:01:14.670> row<00:01:14.909> turquoise<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.810> actual

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
now these three row turquoise in actual

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.460 
now these three row turquoise in actual
fact<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> new<00:01:17.220> timer<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.869> a1<00:01:19.290> has

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
fact are on the new timer that a1 has

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.929 
fact are on the new timer that a1 has
developed<00:01:20.630> now<00:01:21.740> how<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.950> actually<00:01:23.189> works<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
developed now how this actually works is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.570 
developed now how this actually works is
you've<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.509> three<00:01:25.500> outputs<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.280> timer

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you've got three outputs on this timer

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.340 
you've got three outputs on this timer
you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.030> join<00:01:27.210> three<00:01:27.540> rotor<00:01:27.780> coils<00:01:28.229> up

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you can join three rotor coils up

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.850 
you can join three rotor coils up
together<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:29.490> starts<00:01:30.150> two<00:01:30.570> stops<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.439> start

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
together one starts two stops to start

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.390 
together one starts two stops to start
one<00:01:32.220> stop<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.180> they<00:01:33.360> all<00:01:33.600> sort<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.590> have

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
one stop and they all sort of just have

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700 
one stop and they all sort of just have
a<00:01:35.430> random<00:01:35.790> time<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.750> they<00:01:36.840> start<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> stop

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
a random time and they start and stop

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
a random time and they start and stop
between<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.280> three<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.640> them<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.270> gives<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
between all three of them this gives a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.980 
between all three of them this gives a
nice<00:01:39.869> realistic<00:01:40.939> pattern<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> bird<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
nice realistic pattern and the bird and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
nice realistic pattern and the bird and
a<00:01:43.110> little<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> movement<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> birds

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
a little bit of movement for the birds

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.469 
a little bit of movement for the birds
to<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.689> come<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.579> now<00:01:47.640> moving

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
to see when they come in now moving

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.810 
to see when they come in now moving
across<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.729> to
