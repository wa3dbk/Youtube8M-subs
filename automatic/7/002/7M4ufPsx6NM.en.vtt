00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.720 
terms of seeing what the student is
really<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.740> what<00:02:49.950> they<00:02:50.070> respond<00:02:50.490> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
really like what they respond to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.960 
really like what they respond to
so<00:02:51.660> many<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.710> many<00:02:52.800> possibilities<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.760> train

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
so many so many possibilities to train

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.060 
so many so many possibilities to train
character<00:02:54.450> train<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> will<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.560> discipline

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
character train the will and discipline

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.929 

so<00:03:05.620> when<00:03:05.769> somebody<00:03:05.980> invests<00:03:06.549> money<00:03:06.700> in

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
so when somebody invests money in

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.399 
so when somebody invests money in
something<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.480> because<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:07.959> something

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
something is because if something

something is because if something
worthwhile<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.159> we<00:03:10.120> believe<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.480> education
