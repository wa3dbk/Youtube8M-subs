we're car audio guys and I'm short yeah

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.900 
we're car audio guys and I'm short yeah
I<00:00:18.900> don't<00:00:19.439> know<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.680> it'll<00:00:19.890> work<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.730> basically

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
I don't know if it'll work so basically

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.480 
I don't know if it'll work so basically
what<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.449> did<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.779> created<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.980> clear

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
what we did is we created a clear

cylinder<00:00:24.029> tube<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.539> made<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> MDF

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
cylinder tube that we made out of MDF

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.109 
cylinder tube that we made out of MDF
rings<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.039> wrapped<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.580> some<00:00:26.789> kind<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
rings that we wrapped with some kind of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.450 
rings that we wrapped with some kind of
weird<00:00:27.359> clear<00:00:27.779> stuff<00:00:28.109> you'll<00:00:28.619> see<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.980> yep<00:00:29.310> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
five left now we'll play the sub

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.380 
five left now we'll play the sub
side-by-side<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:41.939> see<00:03:42.090> how<00:03:42.269> they

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
side-by-side so you can see how they

00:03:42.390 --> 00:04:06.009 
side-by-side so you can see how they
compare<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.750> each<00:03:42.870> other

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.899 

the<00:04:07.019> re<00:04:07.230> audio<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.860> nvx<00:04:08.189> launched<00:04:08.489> all<00:04:08.640> the

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
the re audio and nvx launched all the

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.190 
the re audio and nvx launched all the
balls<00:04:09.090> out<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.420> tube<00:04:09.599> giving<00:04:10.079> them<00:04:10.170> a

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
balls out of the tube giving them a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.740 
balls out of the tube giving them a
perfect<00:04:10.739> score<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.189> 20<00:04:11.610> points<00:04:11.849> now<00:04:12.540> as<00:04:12.659> we

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
perfect score of 20 points now as we

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.059 
perfect score of 20 points now as we
found<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.110> first<00:04:13.230> event<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.620> v-shaped

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
found in the first event of v-shaped

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.710 
found in the first event of v-shaped
cones<00:04:14.310> didn't<00:04:14.610> do<00:04:14.730> all<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:14.909> great<00:04:15.060> because

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
cones didn't do all that great because

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.479 
cones didn't do all that great because
they<00:04:15.840> launched<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.259> balls<00:04:16.440> into<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.829> side<00:04:17.280> of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
they launched the balls into the side of

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.599 
they launched the balls into the side of
the<00:04:17.579> tube<00:04:17.789> instead<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.509> out<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.900> top<00:04:19.609> remember
