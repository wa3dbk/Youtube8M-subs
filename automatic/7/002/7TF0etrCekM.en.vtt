they'll break up if you don't get them
long<00:06:07.000> enough<00:06:07.150> to<00:06:07.540> to<00:06:08.170> cook<00:06:08.410> but<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:08.800> got<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:08.980> be

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
long enough to to cook but you got to be

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.320
