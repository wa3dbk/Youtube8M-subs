00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi girls had done this 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 tutorial with commitment products for 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.069
 this I live in every one of course 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.840
 these are mine and they are all produced 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.480
 that I was sent from a site that 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.360
 it's called biolche mila with which I already have 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.400
 done in the past with a kiwi at stake 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 set of snow cosmetics brushes mi 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 I remember well and these too are all 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.170
 snow and cosmetics products 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 is a site that is an online site that sells 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.500
 eco organic products therefore not 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.740
 they contain petroleum derivatives 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.050
 various silicones and many crap 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.520
 there are brands in addition to snow cosmetics 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.340
 three rooms really like this one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.989
 I tell you this because often in the comments 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.700
 I read that so many guys ask me how 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.530
 I take care of my hair wines 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.829
 skin and those who have been following me for a long time 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 they know that I am very much for these two things 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.219
 be careful ie try to use 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 products that are natural bio therefore 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 with good ingredients and three brands that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 I love their Tuscan neighbor 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
 low but fantastic drink bio 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.289
 as for the shampoo and a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.650
 another fantastic cave inside 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.990
 and the gas on the fly will be on and what it's called 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.299
 the nature of nature is wrong 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.040
 and in any case therefore having all 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.840
 these natural organic products including 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 just snow cosmetics and I mean the tube 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.299
 of products for this TV and then 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 qualcomm bretto quality plage a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 brush of pencils I will show you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.189
 immediately race show the collection that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.770
 I chose the French royalty make up 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.720
 collection and are practically two blushes 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.290
 and four eye shadows obviously all 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.829
 minerals 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.110
 then it started to rain 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.630
 the first one I want to show that too 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.210
 the first is used in the corner 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.689
 internal of the eye and this that is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.270
 called collier and is practically a one 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.079
 very fine powder eye shadow 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 silver ore per os x that you are there 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.490
 also of the gray of the violet of the blue is a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.049
 very very cold but very beautiful color 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.810
 because it creates this effect 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.700
 three-dimensional and is beautiful bright 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.439
 especially in my opinion if you go to 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 use it like I did today with 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.250
 a glue for the underneath because it 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.080
 makes it even more intense and then there is 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.690
 this eye shadow is called blue sand 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.099
 so it is a chrome duo too 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.599
 has the purple base and the blue reflections it is 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.459
 he is very nice too and I have this 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.620
 used in the outer corner to give 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.569
 to the eye a bit of depth the third 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.239
 instead eye shadow is called versailles ed 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.489
 is my favorite of this collection 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.110
 see why it is not used because 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.870
 I always do everyone at work on 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.000
 bronze and brown are the colors 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.250
 absolute favorites and this is a 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.120
 bronze or better on the site it says that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.450
 in short, an amber gold is beautiful 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.269
 very very bright bronze and it is 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.950
 beautiful second put on the eyes 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.690
 hazelnut but also on light eyes 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.000
 now with the tan was the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.030
 fourth eye shadow is called shot and and is 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.599
 this is very particular because it is a 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.030
 mauve brown with green reflections with 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.190
 useful reflections verte emerald not duke 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.020
 pistachio green I also put of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.210
 them therefore emerald green and is a 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.880
 It's a nice eye shadow for your chrome 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.100
 of his eyeshadow his chrono and that depending 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.830
 of the base that is used can be 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.600
 decide to emphasize the base or the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.950
 reflection of eyeshadow so if you ad 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.620
 example with this patent used 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.520
 a green base pulled out reverses i 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.170
 green reflections if you use one 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.800
 brown base pull out the eyeshadow 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.840
 brown and I did a video a while ago 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.510
 on the bases maybe I 'll leave you up here 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.190
 the link because it is the same thing happens 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.320
 with the other pigments they have 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.240
 these dog a different base of 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.200
 reflections are very nice and downgraded 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:52.050
 bit 2 eduardo to that with both French 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.840
 both bad and not plus are both 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.060
 pink but boudoir this is clearer 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.080
 light pink they say with this 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.390
 delicate mauve satin and cores 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.300
 instead it is this pink brick with gods 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.870
 purple and lilac reflections are excellent and the 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.030
 first time i try them and being also 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.410
 these in very fine powder are succeeded 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.780
 to fade very very well so not 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.250
 leave the patches of color is alone 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.049
 better the modular then they always do 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.840
 parts of this collection these two 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.500
 pencils that are pastel pencils ho 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.780
 had a stuffed animal 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.550
 as always and they are eye pencils 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:35.050
 bio diesel and natural pencils are two 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.750
 this is the sapphire that this sapphire 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.600
 in I say this is blue and also 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.000
 these are excellent because they are 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.530
 pigmented are extremely soft and 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.650
 therefore it is possible to blend very well 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.770
 and can be used in different ways 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.990
 then there is this that is called 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.940
 silver crown and this silver 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.039
 he was also beautiful in addition to the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.150
 collection I chose to equalize 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.780
 prix of you also 22 other blushes then 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.340
 this and cherie flowers that this 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.160
 this beautiful pink blush is that 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.840
 I used today is a rose but a 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.150
 delicate rose so it doesn't stay too much 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.570
 lit on the cheeks and a finish 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.850
 satin and very nice and this one 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.460
 instead I have yet to try this 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.630
 called origami and is warmer instead 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.940
 because this coral fishes and is well 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.650
 Roman matron has no glitter then 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.860
 one pack remains on the cheeks another 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.350
 prize and this brush that is part 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.030
 of the glossy kit and the brush for 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.880
 contouring because in fact you see that 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.699
 remains beautifully angled diagonal to 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.669
 synthetic fibers and very soft and beautiful 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.560
 rent also and in addition to the 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.330
 contouring is great for the 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.190
 arm to a product at stake and this 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.660
 foundation also this great snow 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.139
 cosmetics one of a hundred percent 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.320
 mineral powder pounds to power 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.510
 s to say so because I am always 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.010
 was now still a lover of 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.889
 liquid foundation because I like it 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.000
 the complexion is homogeneous because I like it 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.310
 I 'm going to cover all the imperfections 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.889
 all the faults but the basis of the wife 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.270
 however, he does not have this heat in the summer 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.159
 you can put liquid foundation 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.090
 so by day what I do I have 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.650
 zero base or something really 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.490
 delicate light truck with natural effect 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.440
 on the skin and that should not be obstructed 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.970
 all the pores so you have to leave it 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.370
 frees the skin to breathe 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.440
 so surely I found the funds 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.800
 or foundation or mineral foundation 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.050
 summer liquids if not 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.550
 if not in the evening and this I must 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.740
 to say that a sail is opacity and of that 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.720
 which I used today as a shade 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.069
 this is the light that a shade 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.900
 clear with warm undertone then 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.659
 but now it has been thought that 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.490
 we could do a little good for everyone 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.990
 you this is produced for grabs 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.050
 this type and then these blush 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.650
 eye shadows foundation brushes pencils 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.539
 snow cosmetics all the tricks 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.449
 healthy natural good minerals 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:09.550
 our skin and so I hope the first one 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.110
 you like it as always to participate
