did some early runs and the experience

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.450 
did some early runs and the experience
was<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.600> compromise<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.439> sitting<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
was a little compromise and sitting and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550

said you they don't need to look at a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.569 
said you they don't need to look at a
clock<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:52.079> off<00:01:52.290> by<00:01:52.649> say<00:01:53.520> two

minutes they are quite discombobulated

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.200 
minutes they are quite discombobulated
and<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.340> want<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.670> able<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> capture<00:01:57.000> all

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and so we want to be able to capture all

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.389 
and so we want to be able to capture all
those<00:01:57.329> predicting<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> loading

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
those predicting what are the loading

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.039 
those predicting what are the loading
time<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.149> need<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.840> type<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
time that we need what type of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
time that we need what type of
congestion<00:02:01.530> are<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.009> looking<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.460> how<00:02:02.700> would

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
congestion are we looking at how would

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.060 
congestion are we looking at how would
this<00:02:03.000> affect<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.630> current<00:02:03.780> yes<00:02:04.439> this

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
this affect the current yes this

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.490 
this affect the current yes this
particular<00:02:05.430> exhibit<00:02:06.000> has

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
particular exhibit has

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.680 
particular exhibit has
where<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.100> enter<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> exhibit<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.179> exit<00:02:08.539> in

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
where you enter the exhibit and exit in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.870 
where you enter the exhibit and exit in
the<00:02:08.810> same<00:02:09.020> entryway<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.429> was<00:02:10.550> truly

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
the same entryway so it was truly

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.520 
the same entryway so it was truly
important<00:02:11.390> for<00:02:11.510> us<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.660> understand<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
important for us to understand the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890 
important for us to understand the
logistics<00:02:12.940> component<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.630> actually

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
logistics component of this we actually

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.050 
logistics component of this we actually
use<00:02:15.200> an<00:02:15.380> agent<00:02:15.500> based<00:02:15.710> approach<00:02:16.430> where<00:02:16.820> we

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
use an agent based approach where we

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.180 
use an agent based approach where we
model<00:02:17.420> every<00:02:17.900> single<00:02:18.290> individual<00:02:18.860> in<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
model every single individual in the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.830 
model every single individual in the
whole<00:02:19.370> aquarium<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:20.030> means<00:02:20.240> at<00:02:20.390> different

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
whole aquarium that means at different

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.080 
whole aquarium that means at different
point<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.320> time<00:02:21.560> what<00:02:22.160> decisions<00:02:22.670> would<00:02:22.910> they

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
point in time what decisions would they

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.180 
point in time what decisions would they
be<00:02:23.270> making<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.900> how<00:02:24.440> do<00:02:24.500> they<00:02:24.740> move<00:02:24.950> around

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
be making and how do they move around

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.910 
be making and how do they move around
then<00:02:25.820> we<00:02:26.060> build<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.510> optimization<00:02:27.230> engine<00:02:27.709> on

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
then we build the optimization engine on

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.730 
then we build the optimization engine on
top<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.850> simulation<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.290> now<00:02:30.709> you

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
top of the simulation so that now you

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.740 
top of the simulation so that now you
get<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> operations<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.209> current<00:02:32.540> flow

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
get the operations of the current flow

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.320 
get the operations of the current flow
and<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.350> can<00:02:33.500> maximize<00:02:34.160> or<00:02:34.400> optimize<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
and you can maximize or optimize the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.690 
and you can maximize or optimize the
really<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.110> incorporation<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> new<00:02:37.370> show

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
really the incorporation of the new show

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.210 
really the incorporation of the new show
and<00:02:37.970> how<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.810> actually<00:02:39.140> operate<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.070> that

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
and how to actually operate it so that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.220 
and how to actually operate it so that
it<00:02:40.400> gives<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.150> best<00:02:41.300> result<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> think

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
it gives you the best result so I think

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.979 
it gives you the best result so I think
this<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.370> very<00:02:43.700> important<00:02:44.360> collaboration

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
this is a very important collaboration

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.620 
this is a very important collaboration
for<00:02:45.530> us<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.950> very<00:02:46.790> happy<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.330> we<00:02:47.450> were<00:02:47.570> able

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
for us and very happy that we were able

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.260 
for us and very happy that we were able
to<00:02:47.930> really<00:02:48.350> help<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.709> aquarium<00:02:49.340> leaders<00:02:49.670> to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
to really help the aquarium leaders to

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.449 
to really help the aquarium leaders to
be<00:02:50.390> able<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.840> offer<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.890> very<00:02:52.130> smooth

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
be able to offer a very smooth

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.990 
be able to offer a very smooth
operations<00:02:53.150> for<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> new<00:02:53.780> dolphin<00:02:54.440> pouch

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
operations for the new dolphin pouch

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.580 
operations for the new dolphin pouch
exhibit
