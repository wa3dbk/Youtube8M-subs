00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
any of you have some tips i'm using the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.500 
any of you have some tips i'm using the
foul<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.250> pretty<00:02:30.640> much<00:02:30.820> outclassed<00:02:31.300> by

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
foul it's pretty much outclassed by

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.860 
foul it's pretty much outclassed by
every<00:02:32.020> other<00:02:32.170> assault<00:02:32.560> rifle<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.340> game

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
every other assault rifle in this game

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.890 
every other assault rifle in this game
just<00:02:34.870> because<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.350> fact<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:36.190> is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
just because of the fact that it is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.600 
just because of the fact that it is
semi-automatic<00:02:37.900> single<00:02:38.770> shot<00:02:39.010> which<00:02:39.370> means

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
semi-automatic single shot which means

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.850 
semi-automatic single shot which means
for<00:02:39.910> every<00:02:39.940> shot<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.660> take<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.320> have<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.710> pull

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
for every shot you take you have to pull

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.390 
for every shot you take you have to pull
the<00:02:41.980> trigger<00:02:42.810> once<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:46.020> um<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.100> let's<00:02:48.250> give

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the trigger once and um and let's give

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.160 
the trigger once and um and let's give
them<00:02:48.520> on<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> controller<00:02:49.120> your<00:02:49.540> fire<00:02:49.870> rate

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
them on a controller your fire rate

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.550 
them on a controller your fire rate
really<00:02:50.590> can't<00:02:51.040> keep<00:02:51.310> up<00:02:51.580> with<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:53.200> automatic

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
really can't keep up with an automatic

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.590 
really can't keep up with an automatic
assault<00:02:53.920> rifle<00:02:54.310> or<00:02:54.520> even<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.030> burst<00:02:55.240> weapon

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
assault rifle or even a burst weapon

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.010 
assault rifle or even a burst weapon
which<00:02:55.750> can<00:02:55.960> kill<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:56.500> one<00:02:57.840> instant<00:02:58.840> burst

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
which can kill you in one instant burst

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.190 
which can kill you in one instant burst
really<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.570> but<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:01.600> still<00:03:01.840> don't<00:03:02.020> think<00:03:02.080> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
really so but I still don't think the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.830 
really so but I still don't think the
burst<00:03:02.470> weapons<00:03:02.920> are<00:03:03.100> as<00:03:03.220> powerful<00:03:03.520> as<00:03:03.970> you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
burst weapons are as powerful as you

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.240 
burst weapons are as powerful as you
know<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.050> m16<00:03:05.500> was<00:03:05.680> back<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.220> caught<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:06.550> but

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
know the m16 was back and caught for but

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.210 
know the m16 was back and caught for but
it's<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:10.510> challenge<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.500> use<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:11.710> gun<00:03:11.890> because

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
it's a challenge to use this gun because

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.370 
it's a challenge to use this gun because
it's<00:03:12.490> just<00:03:12.580> really<00:03:13.270> not<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.720> good<00:03:13.900> as<00:03:14.050> any<00:03:14.170> of

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
it's just really not as good as any of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.160 
it's just really not as good as any of
the<00:03:14.470> other<00:03:14.590> weapons<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:16.570> don't<00:03:16.870> need

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
the other weapons you don't need

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.710 
the other weapons you don't need
stopping<00:03:17.920> power<00:03:18.040> with<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.400> either<00:03:18.600> well<00:03:19.600> if

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
stopping power with it either well if

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.540 
stopping power with it either well if
you're<00:03:19.900> not<00:03:19.930> using<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.500> silencer<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:21.280> gets<00:03:21.459> a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
you're not using a silencer it gets a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.630 
you're not using a silencer it gets a
pretty<00:03:21.700> heavy<00:03:21.940> damage<00:03:22.390> drop<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.489> are

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
pretty heavy damage drop if you are

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.100 
pretty heavy damage drop if you are
using<00:03:24.820> one<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:26.610> if<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:28.480> are<00:03:28.600> not<00:03:28.750> using<00:03:28.989> a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
using one so if you are not using a

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.790 
using one so if you are not using a
silencer<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.360> go<00:03:31.480> from<00:03:31.630> anything<00:03:31.900> use

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
silencer you can go from anything use

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.490 
silencer you can go from anything use
hardline<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.820> don't<00:03:34.660> know<00:03:34.780> why<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:34.930> guy<00:03:35.230> put<00:03:35.440> a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
hardline I don't know why that guy put a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.170 
hardline I don't know why that guy put a
tactical<00:03:36.340> insertion<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.880> middle<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.090> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
tactical insertion in the middle of the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.070 
tactical insertion in the middle of the
map<00:03:37.300> but<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:37.630> use<00:03:37.750> hardline

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
map but you can use hardline

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.270 
map but you can use hardline
cold-blooded<00:03:41.080> I'm<00:03:41.530> not<00:03:41.830> going<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.070> tell<00:03:42.160> you

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
cold-blooded I'm not going to tell you

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.710 
cold-blooded I'm not going to tell you
these<00:03:42.370> danger<00:03:42.700> close<00:03:42.910> because<00:03:43.090> we<00:03:43.330> don't<00:03:43.510> need

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
these danger close because we don't need

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.440 
these danger close because we don't need
more<00:03:44.019> danger<00:03:44.350> close<00:03:44.530> assholes<00:03:45.010> in<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.190> world

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.570 

but<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> pretty<00:03:50.140> powerful<00:03:50.410> weapon<00:03:51.010> also

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
but it is a pretty powerful weapon also

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.940 
but it is a pretty powerful weapon also
um<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:52.540> want<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.840> use<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.110> holographic<00:03:53.620> sight

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
um you want to use the holographic sight

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.680 
um you want to use the holographic sight
not<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.250> red<00:03:54.400> dot<00:03:54.550> because<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.120> red<00:03:55.300> dot<00:03:56.400> the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
not the red dot because the red dot the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.949 
not the red dot because the red dot the
ridicule<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.870> off<00:03:59.820> the<00:04:00.820> bullet<00:04:01.480> actually<00:04:01.660> goes

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
ridicule is off the bullet actually goes

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.610 
ridicule is off the bullet actually goes
a<00:04:01.989> little<00:04:02.290> below<00:04:02.910> where<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.090> actual<00:04:04.450> dot<00:04:05.380> is

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
a little below where the actual dot is

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.150 
a little below where the actual dot is
on<00:04:05.890> your<00:04:06.040> screen<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:08.830> have<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.010> aim<00:04:09.130> a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
on your screen so you have to aim a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.350 
on your screen so you have to aim a
little<00:04:09.310> higher<00:04:09.459> than<00:04:09.880> you<00:04:10.000> normally<00:04:10.150> would

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
little higher than you normally would

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.380 
little higher than you normally would
and<00:04:14.370> with<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.489> holographic<00:04:15.880> sight<00:04:16.180> there's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
and with the holographic sight there's

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.060 
and with the holographic sight there's
actually<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.720> little<00:04:16.959> glitch<00:04:17.230> if<00:04:17.530> you're<00:04:17.919> using

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
actually a little glitch if you're using

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.699 
actually a little glitch if you're using
stopping<00:04:18.549> power<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.840> few<00:04:20.260> shock<00:04:20.470> he'll

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
stopping power it is a few shock he'll

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.620 
stopping power it is a few shock he'll
anywhere<00:04:21.270> at<00:04:22.270> any<00:04:22.810> distance<00:04:23.020> so<00:04:24.479> well<00:04:25.479> in<00:04:25.600> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
anywhere at any distance so well in the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.320 
anywhere at any distance so well in the
chest

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
chest

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.280 
chest
so<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.450> makes<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.690> weapon<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:29.020> lot<00:04:29.140> more

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
so that makes the weapon a lot more

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.200 
so that makes the weapon a lot more
powerful<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:30.310> only<00:04:30.520> reason<00:04:30.790> why<00:04:30.940> I'm<00:04:31.090> not

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
powerful the only reason why I'm not

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.880 
powerful the only reason why I'm not

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
using the holographic sight is because i

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.360 
using the holographic sight is because i
hadn't<00:04:33.370> unlocked<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.940> yet<00:04:35.190> but<00:04:36.190> you
