00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 well inside this house the digital terrestrial television up 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.300
 where they can give the interactivity of television 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.750
 clearly this can be quite this function of it from the channel 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.619
 return 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.999
 percent and you can perform games you can perform interventions the 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.980
 program you can chat you can 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.159
 in him participate in the program exchange information 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.630
 really this time the next oscar a small part 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.259
 i certainly are quite happy with the result the kids but the world 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.499
 let's see here this has just begun 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.519
 what you have seen your life a display a demonstration of how 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.290
 it is still not alive that is to say it still does not work from the cassano button 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.940
 but even so an important knot of limanes has been a technical effort 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.970
 campus and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.240
 without a way what we were interested in was we could agreements on beasts a set 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.500
 between different agents 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.570
 parana value that contributes to this imbabura the boat before time 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.140
 how are technologies disappear from lists lack penetration 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.750
 of market in turn that they are today according to your digital voice denounced 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.710
 beads to pray to this 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610
 the team of what happens is that memphis have different technologies for 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.800
 access to the information I am of all the approach the multichannel access that 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.820
 you have the base information will be this phase and therefore allows to facilitate 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 I have sent defense people 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.130
 is that it converts a program like ours into several programs at the same 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.860
 weather 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.460
 that could end up being sent to Havana when we talk to the users or 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.420
 we know 3 pm users by use I do not want to see what he wants when he wants 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.100
 the way you want to go deeper into that I started in the budget 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.799
 and somehow you get mad make it possible your visits to give the male not 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.790
 linear will be deepened in themes deepened by downloading material and 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.340
 I'll make it available to you when you want 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.600
 and of course you know received to deepen learn this case 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.840
 want boxes has meant the fact that the cd and digital format to be able 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.510
 develop these trends that what it brings to the image 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.600
 honor the main thing bought joseph john say interactivity 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.670
 with interactivity what you can is good the inner island and has 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.600
 different levels the first thing that you can be this while you are watching the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 program for being deepening on the thematic to the program pedrosa but 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.510
 your first level without having a return channel we were for 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.340
 deepen simply have details on the subject hammer extended networks 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.209
 march porphyries etcetera 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.759
 second level the most important is possibly interactivity 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.470
 within the interaction the user can participate vote to be a poem a 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.339
 rocket in examination exercise 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:22.189
 get more information using abc moca deficit access 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.329
 how the world of digital television goes 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.769
 we will follow what we owe or not the world of digital television in 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.079
 let's say you have to divide it into two parts what is the audio part and 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.239
 video to frankly well the penetration is being pretty good 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.060
 and the world is that TV the public is being incorporated into the digital world 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.109
 in relation to interactivity 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.369
 we can not say the same thing really 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.599
 only a small part of the decoders are selling 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.329
 allow you to access these additional contents that we are already transmitting 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.319
 sa the television of the future is the one of the present sme for many people 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.779
 who have chosen to buy an interactive digital decoder 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.400
 those people who have not constituted interactive decoder can not 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.519
 do to this digital world then let's say there are 2 two levels of 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.009
 penetration a world for the united udi that goes well 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.139
 the world for the tri are we say properly interactive that's going 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.869
 slow radiant 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.280
 p the true science case of april 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.540
 she apparently is a good example to put these things to the test 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.769
 we can in an interview to go deeper into the subject 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.040
 but undoubtedly it will have many more uses in another type of television 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.449
 more of the daily profile advertising in contests there are many more applications 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:36.049
 In some way, it can also boost your own establishment of the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.189
 digital television 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.060
 If we already have other programs such as silverware, another plan 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.669
 way 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.239
 of Spanish tennis has given where you can look for offers of
