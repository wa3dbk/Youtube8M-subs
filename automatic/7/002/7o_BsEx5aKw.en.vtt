this case I have a vaunting from Maya
like<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.829> said<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.219> my<00:00:38.280> depth<00:00:38.489> chart<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.969> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
like I said up in my depth chart and I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.790 
like I said up in my depth chart and I
like<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> count<00:00:39.870> which<00:00:40.050> side<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> run

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.090 
the ball to the left and all we're doing
here<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.120> we're<00:00:45.300> combining<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.960> power<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
here is one we're combining the power of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
here is one we're combining the power of
the<00:00:47.129> stretch<00:00:47.520> run<00:00:47.899> mixed<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.320> deception

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the stretch run mixed with the deception

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.810 
the stretch run mixed with the deception
of<00:00:50.399> motion<00:00:51.440> okay<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.770> I've<00:00:52.949> used<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.309> concept

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
of motion okay now I've used as concept

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.760 
of motion okay now I've used as concept
before<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.899> watch<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> double<00:00:55.559> teams

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
before as you watch the double teams

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.020 
before as you watch the double teams
here<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> line<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.399> scrimmage<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
here on the line of scrimmage and the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
here on the line of scrimmage and the
leading<00:00:57.899> block<00:00:58.140> from<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.469> running<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
leading block from my running back and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
leading block from my running back and
look<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> block<00:01:00.120> shed<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> next<00:01:00.840> level

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
look at the block shed to the next level

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.020 
look at the block shed to the next level
I've<00:01:01.800> used<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.160> before<00:01:02.219> four<00:01:02.730> different

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I've used this before four different

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
I've used this before four different
plays<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> power<00:01:04.080> 0<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> counter

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
plays like the power 0 in the counter

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.310 
plays like the power 0 in the counter
but<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> stretch<00:01:06.630> play<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
but this is the stretch play out of the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.630 
but this is the stretch play out of the
iphone<00:01:07.680> tight<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.130> pretty<00:01:08.340> special

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
iphone tight and that's pretty special

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
iphone tight and that's pretty special
be<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.750> said<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.049> stretch<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> very

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
be and like I said the stretch is very

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
be and like I said the stretch is very
very<00:01:11.040> good<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.460> year<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:12.299> super<00:01:12.780> hard<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
very good this year I'm super hard to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.300 
very good this year I'm super hard to
stop<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.450> run<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.750> regular<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:17.070> time

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
stop so you can run it regular that time

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.830 
stop so you can run it regular that time
I<00:01:17.430> didn't<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> best<00:01:18.060> block<00:01:18.390> shed<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I didn't get the best block shed but I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.530 
I didn't get the best block shed but I
wanted<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> show<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> guys<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:20.479> how<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
wanted to show you guys that on how the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.969 
wanted to show you guys that on how the
blocking<00:01:22.080> system<00:01:22.259> works<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> zone

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
blocking system works is the zone

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.730 
blocking system works is the zone
blocking<00:01:23.310> system<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.270> means<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
blocking system and what that means is

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.749 
blocking system and what that means is
yes<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> play<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.100> designed<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.580> outside

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
yes the play is designed to go outside

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
yes the play is designed to go outside
but<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.299> also<00:01:27.390> designed<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.930> cut<00:01:28.080> back<00:01:28.229> lean

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
but it's also designed for cut back lean

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.569 
but it's also designed for cut back lean
so<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.619> probably<00:01:28.829> could<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.070> cut<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.340> back

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
so i probably could have cut it back

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.100 
so i probably could have cut it back
right<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.090> eighth<00:01:30.299> gap<00:01:30.509> where

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
right there in that eighth gap where

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.480 
right there in that eighth gap where
that<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.409> guard<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> pick<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that our guard was going to pick up the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.679 
that our guard was going to pick up the
middle<00:01:32.640> linebacker<00:01:33.060> boom<00:01:33.270> i<00:01:33.450> could<00:01:33.600> have

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
middle linebacker boom i could have

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.030 
middle linebacker boom i could have
sliced<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.380> there<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.740> i<00:01:34.829> really

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
sliced it right up there if i really

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.130 
sliced it right up there if i really
wanted<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.520> i<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:36.240> probably<00:01:36.360> maybe<00:01:36.689> would

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
wanted to i was probably maybe would

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230 
wanted to i was probably maybe would
have<00:01:37.170> been<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.560> decision<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> it's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240

outside that's what zone blocking is and
that's<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> stretch<00:01:45.060> brings

it's<00:02:49.709> actually<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.390> really<00:02:51.630> short<00:02:51.870> drop

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
it's actually it's a really short drop

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.560 
it's actually it's a really short drop
it's<00:02:52.350> about<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> one-step<00:02:52.980> drop<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:54.120> how<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.299> run

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
it's about a one-step drop but how I run

it's about a one-step drop but how I run
it<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.959> put<00:02:55.170> Sean<00:02:55.680> Jackson<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.280> curl<00:02:56.489> I

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
it is I put Sean Jackson on the curl I

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.720 
it is I put Sean Jackson on the curl I
