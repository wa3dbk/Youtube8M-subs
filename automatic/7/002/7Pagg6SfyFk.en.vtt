to show you hopefully it works see why
it<00:00:23.730> went<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.350> how<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> set<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.050> looks

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
it went but how to set it up so it looks

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.540 
it went but how to set it up so it looks
like<00:00:28.769> these<00:00:29.340> things<00:00:29.960> pop<00:00:30.960> open<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> popped

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
like these things pop open so I popped

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
like these things pop open so I popped
open<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:34.309> and<00:00:38.750> put<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> around<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
open one here and put it around here and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.619 
open one here and put it around here and
it<00:00:40.980> looks<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> great<00:00:41.700> thing<00:00:42.030> goes<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it looks like the great thing goes to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:01:07.499 
it looks like the great thing goes to
the<00:00:42.719> bottom<00:00:43.520> so

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.679 

same<00:01:08.509> thing<00:01:09.020> with<00:01:09.229> this<00:01:09.350> one<00:01:10.060> let's<00:01:11.060> open<00:01:11.360> it

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
same thing with this one let's open it

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:20.260 
same thing with this one let's open it
up<00:01:15.009> so<00:01:16.009> it's<00:01:16.369> open<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:19.549> gray<00:01:19.700> anything<00:01:20.090> goes

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
up so it's open the gray anything goes

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.030 
up so it's open the gray anything goes
on<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.539> bottom

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.330 

I<00:01:28.780> find<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.170> easier<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.680> snap<00:01:31.160> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
I find that it's easier to snap the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.510 
I find that it's easier to snap the
bottom<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.910> first<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:33.440> then<00:01:33.530> just<00:01:33.740> close<00:01:34.010> the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
bottom in first and then just close the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.630 
bottom in first and then just close the
top<00:01:34.730> so<00:01:35.030> there's<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.600> bottom<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.140> latches

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
top so there's the bottom it latches

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.440 
top so there's the bottom it latches
around<00:01:37.640> pull<00:01:38.120> it<00:01:38.150> up<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.960> snaps<00:01:39.290> over<00:01:39.830> that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
around pull it up that snaps over that

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.700 
around pull it up that snaps over that
screw<00:01:41.450> looking<00:01:41.840> thing<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:43.660> then<00:01:44.660> snap<00:01:45.470> this

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
screw looking thing and then snap this

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.130 
screw looking thing and then snap this
thing<00:01:45.979> around<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:47.270> close<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:49.750> gotta<00:01:50.750> turn<00:01:50.960> it

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
thing around to close it gotta turn it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.960 
thing around to close it gotta turn it
up<00:01:51.260> so<00:01:52.130> now<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.340> both<00:01:52.820> black<00:01:53.720> things<00:01:54.970> these

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
up so now that both black things these

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.320 
up so now that both black things these
things<00:01:56.840> parts<00:01:57.560> with<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.860> holes<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.250> them<00:01:58.400> are

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
things parts with the holes on them are

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.280 
things parts with the holes on them are
facing<00:02:00.170> upward<00:02:02.500> if<00:02:03.500> we're<00:02:03.740> ready<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:05.570> snap<00:02:06.050> in

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
facing upward if we're ready to snap in

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.740 
facing upward if we're ready to snap in
a<00:02:06.500> snack<00:02:06.890> tray<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.940> are<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.420> metal

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
a snack tray so here are the metal

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:37.750 
a snack tray so here are the metal
pieces<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:14.300> goes<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> holes<00:02:36.370> next<00:02:37.370> Oh

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
pieces that goes in the holes next Oh

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.259 
pieces that goes in the holes next Oh
this<00:02:38.360> move<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:39.290> good<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:41.120> can<00:02:43.269> it's

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
this move so that's good so you can it's

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.180 
this move so that's good so you can it's
not<00:02:44.360> like<00:02:44.750> one<00:02:45.019> piece<00:02:45.290> which<00:02:45.769> makes<00:02:46.040> it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
not like one piece which makes it

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.479 
not like one piece which makes it
difficult<00:02:47.650> push<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.799> down<00:02:51.310> push<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.340> down

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
difficult push it down push it down

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.860 
difficult push it down push it down
there<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.120> guess<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.390> should<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:53.750> pushed

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
there I guess I should have pushed

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.000 
there I guess I should have pushed
harder<00:02:54.320> I'm<00:02:55.280> gonna<00:02:55.430> push<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.790> down<00:02:55.940> here

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
harder I'm gonna push it down here

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.710 
harder I'm gonna push it down here
probably<00:02:58.010> good<00:02:58.400> idea<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.090> before<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
probably good idea to do this before the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.860 
probably good idea to do this before the
baby<00:02:59.900> gets<00:02:59.989> in<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.900> release<00:03:07.420> those<00:03:08.420> gray
