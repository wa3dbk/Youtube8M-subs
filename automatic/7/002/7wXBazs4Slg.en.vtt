00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
to the eventual winner like Game three

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.019 
to the eventual winner like Game three
we<00:00:25.560> were<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.800> both<00:00:25.890> top<00:00:26.189> taking<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.820> got<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
we were just both top taking if I got a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.519 
we were just both top taking if I got a
monster<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.449> any<00:00:27.570> point<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.199> gonna<00:00:28.289> win<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
monster at any point I was gonna win the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.310 
monster at any point I was gonna win the
game<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.460> fortunate<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.090> three<00:00:30.269> msds<00:00:30.750> before

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
game but fortunate for three msds before

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
game but fortunate for three msds before
he<00:00:31.470> drew<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.679> windblast<00:00:32.189> industriousness

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
he drew on windblast industriousness

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.940 
he drew on windblast industriousness
so<00:00:33.570> i'm<00:00:33.840> he<00:00:33.989> got<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> top<00:00:34.380> takes<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> little

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
so i'm he got to the top takes a little

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520 
so i'm he got to the top takes a little
quicker<00:00:35.190> than<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.460> did<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.630> ended<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.380> losing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
quicker than I did so I ended up losing

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.410 
quicker than I did so I ended up losing
I<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.460> that's<00:00:39.059> all<00:00:39.180> right

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
tacks but other than that it's pretty

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
tacks but other than that it's pretty

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
they yell you'll see for the mirror just

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.170 
they yell you'll see for the mirror just
from<00:05:39.990> their<00:05:40.139> three<00:05:40.560> spell<00:05:40.830> shattering<00:05:41.280> three

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
from their three spell shattering three

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.279 
from their three spell shattering three
Dinah<00:05:42.330> theory<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:42.690> that's<00:05:42.810> how<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:42.990> make<00:05:43.169> they

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
Dinah theory and that's how I make they

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.300 
Dinah theory and that's how I make they
have<00:05:43.380> some<00:05:43.560> of<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.710> writing<00:05:43.919> zero<00:05:44.160> in<00:05:44.250> the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
have some of the writing zero in the

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.800 
have some of the writing zero in the
mirror<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.669> it's<00:05:44.820> really<00:05:45.150> really<00:05:45.330> good<00:05:45.479> if

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
mirror and it's really really good if

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.730 
mirror and it's really really good if

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
in my round five a feature I actually

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.370 
in my round five a feature I actually
ended<00:06:03.150> up<00:06:03.240> using<00:06:03.300> six<00:06:03.720> counts<00:06:04.020> that<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.289> will

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
ended up using six counts that it will

ended up using six counts that it will
thanks<00:06:05.009> to<00:06:05.099> this

was gonna go to the next a orgy and I
think<00:06:17.520> that's<00:06:17.639> enough<00:06:17.850> for<00:06:17.880> it<00:06:18.120> Worth<00:06:18.240> Texas

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
think that's enough for it Worth Texas

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.210 
think that's enough for it Worth Texas
but<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:18.840> realm<00:06:19.050> is<00:06:19.139> it's<00:06:19.320> a<00:06:19.380> 1k<00:06:19.740> as<00:06:19.889> far<00:06:20.070> as<00:06:20.160> I

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
but the realm is it's a 1k as far as I

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.830 
but the realm is it's a 1k as far as I
know<00:06:20.280> if<00:06:20.790> it<00:06:20.910> ends<00:06:21.000> up<00:06:21.060> being<00:06:21.210> it<00:06:21.360> like<00:06:21.510> let's

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
know if it ends up being it like let's

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.909 
know if it ends up being it like let's
try<00:06:21.900> good<00:06:22.050> series<00:06:22.260> I'll<00:06:22.380> play<00:06:22.620> be<00:06:22.740> there

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
probably be at the next circuits which

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.570 
probably be at the next circuits which
are

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
are

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.970
