00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:18.680
 When God created Adam and Eve 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:25.509
 before Adam and Eve get married if 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:30.710
 to join together to form an alliance 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:33.940
 they existed they were created what 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.030
 I mean by that I mean that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.130
 they were first created and then 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.100
 married 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.890
 the first thing they did after 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.460
 to be raised or marriage 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.000
 the first thing that happened in life 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.560
 from Adam and Eve 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.590
 after they were created it was the 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:02.660
 marriage was the alliance what this 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.509
 suggests that the first thing after the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.210
 our salvation that we have to 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.619
 investing is a marriage 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.420
 So, you listening to me are 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:20.119
 single bachelor divorced and such 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:25.299
 It is very important that you know has 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.810
 awareness of the grandeur of 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.350
 marriage 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.950
 God did not make woman to be woman 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.350
 God just did it to be 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:46.759
 simply an adam woman not him 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:52.670
 made the eva to help him assist him 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:58.069
 I failed a more helper helper 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:02.859
 in which to take care of the land to take care 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:09.470
 of things down here also 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:14.300
 also, but mostly eva would come if I 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.290
 should be a person who added up the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.459
 adam life and vice versa 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.340
 I mean there was a relationship 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.359
 between them that one would sustain the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.450
 other one support the other 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:35.950
 but my friend my friend 20 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.269
 You know how to marry is easy. 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:45.010
 It is very easy difficult is to keep the 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.349
 marriage to be saved I also do you 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.609
 gave your life to jesus setass 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.010
 difficult goal is to keep salvation is not 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.590
 like this 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.069
 really is so you see that salvation 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.239
 and marriage is all about why home is 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.489
 easy to be saved is also easy difficult is 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.799
 keep the marriage that way too difficult 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.010
 keep the salvation to keep the 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.950
 marriage we make 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.769
 we have to sacrifice each one we have 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.079
 to sacrifice so that our 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.979
 marriage I'm talking here in my 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:30.310
 if I stayed I could be married there 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:35.349
 43 years is because we had each of 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.979
 make the sacrifice according to the other 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:41.590
 we had to sacrifice our will 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:47.099
 to do the other so that we 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:55.019
 we could live in communion 43 years 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:58.090
 then this idea of ​​marriage that is 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:02.919
 strengthened is solidified through the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.099
 sacrifice of both parties both of her 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.979
 in my favor how much my favor from her 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.209
 because if she makes a sacrifice in my 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.180
 favor 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.289
 I'll see this too, I'll do mine. 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.120
 sacrifice in heaven's favor to see me 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.940
 sacrificing in her favor 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.320
 obviously will also make your 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.320
 sacrifice in my favor
