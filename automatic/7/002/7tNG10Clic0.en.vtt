the light you guys and say that it was a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.000 
the light you guys and say that it was a
breeze<00:00:59.730> because<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.500> guess<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
breeze because it was like I guess that

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.370 
breeze because it was like I guess that
just<00:01:02.850> being<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.420> anxious<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.159> made<00:01:05.369> me

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
just being so anxious it kind of made me

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.460 
just being so anxious it kind of made me
probably<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.860> edge<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.180> does<00:01:09.659> hurt

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
probably more on edge but it does hurt

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
probably more on edge but it does hurt
but<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.280> did<00:01:11.670> say<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> once<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
but they did say that once you do it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
but they did say that once you do it
more<00:01:13.049> regularly<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.890> won't<00:01:14.130> hurt<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.430> bad<00:01:14.939> or

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
more regularly it won't hurt as bad or

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
like it took all of like five to ten

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
like it took all of like five to ten
minutes<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.189> she<00:01:29.369> had<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> prep<00:01:29.939> and

stuff but she was like going through our
fingers<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.860> okay<00:01:35.130> just

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
fingers like I was just like okay just

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
fingers like I was just like okay just
it's<00:01:36.119> okay<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> cuz<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.590> want

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it's okay and then you know cuz you want

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.130 
it's okay and then you know cuz you want
to<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.280> done<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:39.900> go

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to just get it done I think when they go

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.980 
to just get it done I think when they go
fast<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.130> even<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.240> still<00:01:42.659> make

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
fast with it even you know still make

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.450 
fast with it even you know still make
sure<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.259> they're<00:01:43.439> careful<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> everything

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
sure that they're careful and everything

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.789 
sure that they're careful and everything
but<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.329> fast<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.259> just

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
but I think when they go fast and just

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.429 
but I think when they go fast and just
get<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.579> less<00:01:47.939> painful<00:01:48.439> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
get it out the way it's less painful so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.310 
get it out the way it's less painful so
um<00:01:49.860> yeah<00:01:50.280> they're<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.939> professional<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:52.049> was

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
um yeah they're very professional I was

I<00:04:35.610> use<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:37.330> brush<00:04:37.570> here<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.930> got<00:04:38.110> from<00:04:38.350> Sephora

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.090 
I use this brush here I got from Sephora
and<00:04:39.010> actually<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:40.660> bristles<00:04:41.140> here<00:04:41.440> were

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
and actually the bristles here were

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.520 
and actually the bristles here were
longer<00:04:42.370> than<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.510> cut<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.050> because<00:04:44.410> I

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
longer than this but I cut it because I

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.130 
longer than this but I cut it because I
wanted<00:04:44.890> more<00:04:45.160> control<00:04:45.480> this<00:04:46.480> thing<00:04:46.810> was<00:04:47.020> like

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
with five dollars at Sephora so it's a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.480 
with five dollars at Sephora so it's a
really<00:04:49.420> good<00:04:49.570> price<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.170> all<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.800> do<00:04:51.040> is<00:04:51.220> just

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
here is actually it actually was like us

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.420 
here is actually it actually was like us
they<00:05:28.240> had<00:05:28.390> a<00:05:28.419> sick<00:05:28.840> attach<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:30.190> it's

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
they had a sick attach to it so it's

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.270 
they had a sick attach to it so it's
like<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.610> back<00:05:30.910> scrubber<00:05:31.300> or<00:05:31.540> whatever<00:05:31.810> but<00:05:32.650> it

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
like a back scrubber or whatever but it

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.630 
like a back scrubber or whatever but it
broke<00:05:33.520> off<00:05:33.730> so<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.090> was<00:05:34.330> just<00:05:34.630> you<00:05:34.930> know<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.640> just

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
call these they're not rough but they

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.270 
call these they're not rough but they
have<00:05:57.520> this<00:05:57.669> material<00:05:57.850> where<00:05:58.770> you<00:05:59.770> know<00:06:00.010> it's

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
have this material where you know it's

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.340 
have this material where you know it's
gonna<00:06:00.490> like<00:06:00.910> scrub<00:06:01.450> but<00:06:01.750> it's<00:06:01.900> not<00:06:02.080> going<00:06:02.260> to

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
gonna like scrub but it's not going to

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.310 
gonna like scrub but it's not going to
like<00:06:02.470> scrape<00:06:03.010> so<00:06:03.669> what<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:04.570> would<00:06:04.630> do<00:06:04.930> is<00:06:05.110> just

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
like scrape so what I would do is just

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.710 
like scrape so what I would do is just
put<00:06:05.530> these<00:06:05.710> on<00:06:06.010> and<00:06:06.460> then<00:06:06.640> I'll<00:06:06.820> put<00:06:07.270> some<00:06:07.479> soap

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
put these on and then I'll put some soap

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.170 
put these on and then I'll put some soap
in<00:06:08.020> there<00:06:08.229> in<00:06:08.860> my<00:06:09.100> hands<00:06:09.669> and<00:06:09.820> they<00:06:09.910> all<00:06:10.030> just

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
in there in my hands and they all just

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.659 
in there in my hands and they all just
go<00:06:10.270> together<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:11.050> then<00:06:11.290> clean<00:06:11.830> like<00:06:12.040> that<00:06:12.070> it

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
go together and then clean like that it

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.290 
go together and then clean like that it
all<00:06:13.090> depends<00:06:13.690> on<00:06:13.870> you<00:06:14.169> eat<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:15.300> sensitivity

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
all depends on you eat the sensitivity

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.700 
all depends on you eat the sensitivity
over<00:06:16.330> your<00:06:16.570> skin<00:06:16.840> because<00:06:17.020> some<00:06:17.200> people<00:06:17.500> can't

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
over your skin because some people can't

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.830 
over your skin because some people can't
use<00:06:17.830> a<00:06:17.979> lot<00:06:18.310> of<00:06:18.340> stuff<00:06:18.790> that's<00:06:18.940> too<00:06:19.180> abrasive

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
use a lot of stuff that's too abrasive

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.330 
use a lot of stuff that's too abrasive
Jeff<00:06:20.169> one<00:06:20.320> of<00:06:20.440> those<00:06:20.560> works<00:06:20.860> for<00:06:21.040> you<00:06:21.160> but

Jeff one of those works for you but
definitely<00:06:21.460> make<00:06:21.820> sure<00:06:21.850> you<00:06:22.060> use<00:06:22.300> something

definitely make sure you use something

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.070 
definitely make sure you use something
because<00:06:23.950> that<00:06:23.979> definitely<00:06:24.840> keeps<00:06:25.840> the

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
because that definitely keeps the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.780 
because that definitely keeps the
bacteria<00:06:26.620> there<00:06:26.830> and<00:06:27.070> that<00:06:27.220> keeps<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
bacteria there and that keeps the

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.700 
bacteria there and that keeps the
ingrown<00:06:28.450> hairs<00:06:28.810> away<00:06:29.729> so<00:06:30.729> um<00:06:31.210> keep<00:06:31.930> you<00:06:32.560> know
