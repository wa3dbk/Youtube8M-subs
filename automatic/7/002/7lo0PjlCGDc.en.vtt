we don't get any growth so like if the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.690 
we don't get any growth so like if the
company<00:01:55.539> does<00:01:56.169> really<00:01:56.409> really<00:01:56.679> good<00:01:56.859> we<00:01:57.490> don't

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
company does really really good we don't

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.580 
company does really really good we don't
get<00:01:57.969> any<00:01:58.119> growth<00:01:58.479> like<00:01:58.779> the<00:01:58.899> stock<00:01:59.139> doesn't<00:01:59.349> go

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
get any growth like the stock doesn't go

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.969 
get any growth like the stock doesn't go
up<00:01:59.739> really<00:02:00.009> unless<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:01.090> convertible

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
up really unless it's convertible

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.859 
up really unless it's convertible
convertible<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:04.119> if<00:02:04.299> it's<00:02:04.560> convertible

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
convertible so if it's convertible

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.960 
convertible so if it's convertible
convertible<00:02:07.869> shares<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.619> means<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:09.789> can
