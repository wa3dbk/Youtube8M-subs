before<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.470> close<00:01:10.770> everything<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.180> once

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
before you close everything up but once

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
before you close everything up but once
you're<00:01:12.659> done<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> fogging<00:01:13.409> oil<00:01:13.799> well

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you're done with the fogging oil well

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
you're done with the fogging oil well
you<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.210> close<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.840> exhaust<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you want to close the exhaust and you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.310 
you want to close the exhaust and you
want<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> close<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> intake<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
want to close the intake you can do that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.190 
want to close the intake you can do that
with<00:01:19.590> masking<00:01:20.189> tape<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.700> make<00:01:20.939> sure<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
with masking tape but make sure that the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
with masking tape but make sure that the
masking<00:01:22.710> tape<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.490> type<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.049> releases

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
masking tape is the type that releases

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.770 
masking tape is the type that releases
so<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.380> doesn't<00:01:25.740> bond<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> finish<00:01:27.570> on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so it doesn't bond with the finish on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.920 
so it doesn't bond with the finish on
the<00:01:28.320> exhaust<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> intake<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.450> may<00:01:30.659> want

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the exhaust or the intake you may want

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410 
the exhaust or the intake you may want

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to be outside you want an outside cover

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
to be outside you want an outside cover

if it's going to be inside you want one

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.530 
if it's going to be inside you want one

off<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.159> tires<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.299> will

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
off of the tires because that will

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.200 
off of the tires because that will

you certainly want to take care of the
battery<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.709> means<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.670> need<00:02:17.819> a

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
battery and that means you need a

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.750 
battery and that means you need a
battery<00:02:18.329> maintainer<00:02:19.189> traditional<00:02:20.189> type<00:02:20.459> we

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
battery maintainer traditional type we

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.179 
battery maintainer traditional type we
have<00:02:21.000> over<00:02:21.390> there<00:02:21.659> but<00:02:22.319> here's<00:02:22.709> what<00:02:23.010> we're

have over there but here's what we're
seeing<00:02:23.489> today<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.719> is<00:02:24.959> electronic<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:25.920> you

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
seeing today this is electronic and you

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.220 
seeing today this is electronic and you
can<00:02:26.790> set<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> for<00:02:27.209> different<00:02:27.540> types<00:02:27.989> of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
can set it for different types of

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.080 
can set it for different types of
batteries<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.219> set<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.579> for<00:02:29.609> different

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
batteries you can set it for different

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.599 
batteries you can set it for different
voltages<00:02:30.719> has<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.319> lot<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.889> different<00:02:32.219> features

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
voltages has a lot of different features

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.929 
voltages has a lot of different features
in<00:02:32.639> it<00:02:32.969> and<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.540> very<00:02:33.629> precise<00:02:34.590> at<00:02:35.099> keeping<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
in it and it's very precise at keeping a

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.959 
in it and it's very precise at keeping a
battery<00:02:36.599> healthy<00:02:37.260> while<00:02:37.859> it's<00:02:38.219> not<00:02:38.579> being

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
battery healthy while it's not being

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.869 
battery healthy while it's not being
