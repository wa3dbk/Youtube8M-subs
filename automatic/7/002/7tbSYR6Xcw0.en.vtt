unclear pieces of game design I've ever

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.070 
unclear pieces of game design I've ever

is<00:02:46.010> basically<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:46.550> Sonic<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.150> coyote<00:02:47.930> which

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
is basically just Sonic the coyote which

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.440 
is basically just Sonic the coyote which
which<00:02:48.890> could<00:02:49.190> be<00:02:49.370> okay<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.970> mean<00:02:50.150> I'll<00:02:50.269> even

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
which could be okay I mean I'll even

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.660 
which could be okay I mean I'll even
give<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.930> if<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.470> did<00:02:51.650> this<00:02:51.800> right<00:02:51.890> this

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
give it that if you did this right this

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.140 
give it that if you did this right this
could<00:02:52.970> be<00:02:53.150> okay<00:02:53.630> it's<00:02:54.620> done<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.280> far<00:02:55.580> from<00:02:55.820> okay

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
could be okay it's done so far from okay

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.060 
could be okay it's done so far from okay
and<00:02:56.300> has<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.570> pay<00:02:56.690> extra<00:02:56.989> for<00:02:57.110> shipping<00:02:57.590> it's

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
and has to pay extra for shipping it's

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.740 
and has to pay extra for shipping it's
basically<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.700> principles<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.360> Sonic

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
basically the principles of Sonic

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.840 
basically the principles of Sonic
without<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.560> design<00:03:00.890> elements<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.550> make

without the design elements that make

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.090 
without the design elements that make
those<00:03:02.000> principles<00:03:02.540> work<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:03.380> like<00:03:03.440> oh<00:03:03.739> you

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
those principles work it's like oh you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.400 
those principles work it's like oh you
