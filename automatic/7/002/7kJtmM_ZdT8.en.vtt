00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
always pop the ear first because you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.990 
always pop the ear first because you
don't<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.450> bend<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> ear<00:01:46.409> back<00:01:47.000> because

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
don't want to bend the ear back because

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.690
