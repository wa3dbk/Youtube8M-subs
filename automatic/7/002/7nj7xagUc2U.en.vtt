00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 I would like to use these few minutes in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.610
 this is this room where we talk about 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 this strange rhetoric that sees us 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.820
 talk about the school as often happens 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.270
 in a fairly absent year I would like 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.550
 thank these minutes for using 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.850
 these funds to thank the government 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 I would like to thank him clearly 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 sincerely starting from the words that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.929
 I heard from Senator Tocci 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.149
 when he said that at first he was 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.210
 then he started with this law design 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.340
 the premier had said it would be a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.379
 moment stopped and would have said that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 it would have made the genus states the school 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.430
 to try and reason on the subject e 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.430
 so I want to thank him for having it 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.530
 done and we want to thank him too 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 because we heard it serves the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.170
 selector tocci that reminded everyone 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 in this classroom that was the pd that has 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.660
 blocked the discussion in committee and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.800
 so we must also thank the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.500
 majority 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 how many thanks we must make 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:13.140
 we must also thank the government 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 because we arrived at the 30364 issued 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.570
 i love trust on a deed and that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.299
 means that for 37 times that divided i 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.420
 months that are the months of this government 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.400
 are so many times this parliament is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.140
 was once again discredited by the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 its function is immediately to violence 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.400
 of the executive commanded by the tyrant 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.560
 renzi but let us realize but it really is 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.079
 a tyrant perhaps simply a 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.689
 small fish that you think is shark then 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.409
 it's your eyes that deform her 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.320
 size but it is a fish that I said it 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.540
 as we say it in Campania 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.689
 we must thank the government because 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.110
 today we officially celebrated the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.509
 public school funeral 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.750
 yes my children i have two children of 4 of 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.190
 two years will have a worse school in 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.300
 which private schools will prevail over 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.820
 public school if there will be schools 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.910
 in bad schools it will be your merit 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.090
 thanks thanks also for having 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.680
 crushed all collegiate seats in 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.890
 which free teachers could 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 to discuss about educational activity e 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.720
 instead we preferred a school on 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.360
 company level in those first super 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.760
 principals that will be able to dispose of 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.540
 education of all our children 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.540
 I come from Campania and often in the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.650
 campania are exchange logics 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.020
 strange favoritism 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.810
 are things we know all notes and already 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.380
 I imagine what favoritism they will be 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.480
 be applied in this sense maybe 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.150
 against teachers who do not 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.390
 maybe they want to align against the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.680
 teachers who are not nice maybe 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 because they teach things they don't like 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:08.350
 maybe we will provide some teacher who 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:12.220
 how to say can be more fascinating 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.800
 for principals on duty men or women 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.790
 nothing changes, we get chills 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:24.970
 they come on the skin of the precarious and for 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.980
 half of the usual occupational blackmail 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.270
 you want this thing to go well 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.540
 with this thing it is not good 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.040
 this thing just sucks e 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.450
 finally we must tell him thanks to 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.770
 parliamentary majority 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.830
 then we'll see it later maybe out here 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.350
 embraces teachers and students 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.360
 parents say that the school is a 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.120
 free and publish all the usual things 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.000
 to the usual rhetoric and then in here to 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.100
 palace instead we sit well and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.070
 nailed to the usual seats for 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.630
 arrive at the end of the legislature 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.140
 but you also know that this thing does 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.950
 you suck you know too 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.130
 and then you want to put me a moment 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.989
 straight with your back and then we don't talk 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.100
 however I am running out of responsibility 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.570
 president we don't talk about 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.489
 responsibility because we are doing 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.609
 school channel marcello this not 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.430
 this irresponsibility is the responsibility 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.840
 and selfishness and this 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.870
 should therefore be ashamed when 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.280
 let's go and vote let's remember how 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.470
 we all are spokesmen of the movement 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.419
 close to all the teachers who are 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.060
 out here demonstrating that they are protesting 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.639
 of course there is no need to say it 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.289
 we wanted to let them in and so you looked 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.530
 in the face, however, there are obviously some 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.180
 safety rules you have yourself protected a 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.100
 palace for men and women 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.100
 completely detached from this reality 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.789
 we can't stay there of course 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.380
 We will never vote for this trust though 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.120
 ricordiamocelo 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.070
 we don't say we do these things for 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.490
 sense of responsibility because it is not 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.680
 true 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.419
 it's time to kick the balls if there is 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.419
 you have therefore easy to see
