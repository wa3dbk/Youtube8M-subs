they<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.420> they<00:00:39.420> would<00:00:39.620> create<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> separate

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
they would they would create a separate

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the swipe down to update probably I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.230 
the swipe down to update probably I
don't<00:01:41.170> know<00:01:41.260> if<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.470> see<00:01:41.800> a<00:01:41.830> camera

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.330 

anyways<00:01:46.610> at<00:01:47.610> least<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> iOS<00:01:48.780> version<00:01:49.340> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
anyways at least on the iOS version you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.230 
anyways at least on the iOS version you
can<00:01:50.490> kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> hear<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> click<00:01:52.970> not<00:01:53.970> sure<00:01:54.149> if

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
can kind of hear it click not sure if

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.469 
can kind of hear it click not sure if
that<00:01:54.330> registers<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.020> camera<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.470> well<00:01:55.500> but

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
that registers on the camera as well but

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.469 
that registers on the camera as well but
you<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.350> pretty<00:01:58.530> much<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.180> app<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you know this is pretty much it app I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.889 
you know this is pretty much it app I
think<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.840> pointless<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:03.509> cool<00:02:03.750> that

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
think it's very pointless just cool that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.410 
think it's very pointless just cool that
maybe<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.320> they<00:02:05.100> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> offer<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.700> an<00:02:06.179> app

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
maybe they they want to offer you an app

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.440 
maybe they they want to offer you an app
that<00:02:06.450> doesn't<00:02:07.099> make<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.580> facebook<00:02:08.789> but

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that doesn't make you go on facebook but

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.300 
that doesn't make you go on facebook but
