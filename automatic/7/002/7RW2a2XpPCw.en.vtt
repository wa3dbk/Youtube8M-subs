 a resolution that has municipality the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.869
 which prevents the passage of answers that 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.460
 Rionegro Pacho come over here that 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.130
 It causes them to have problems 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.970
 to complete their groups and of course 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.710
 inconveniences like the famous war 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.419
 sitting they complain they have 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.219
 talked about specifying the government according to 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.170
 they likewise with the acaldía and has not 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.870
 received a lot of attention the afternoon after 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.150
 a protest was depreciated by the sector of 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 the 15th with octave of 15 with a fourth 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.990
 totally totally protested 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.490
 peaceful only met then 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.660
 between them and to wait then set aside 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.970
 to the municipal mayor and good this 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.739
 scenario not with the municipal government to 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.450
 see if after they see them and see 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.500
 what's wrong with not seeing the drivers 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.360
 that at that time are gathered by 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.800
 a protest due to several poems that 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.380
 have showed how fat 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.720
 was his name David Guarnizo and all 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.909
 since when 14 years in fleet and 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.439
 He listened to what the problems are 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.970
 that they have and for those that motivate 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.020
 this meeting this little protest to the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.340
 today 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.689
 well actually the problems that 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.090
 we have the criticism is because it has not 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.170
 a resolution that the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.899
 cars that come outside the town 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.850
 enter the town and by the pirates 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.969
 many pirates and soon the authority does not 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.740
 has done nothing that's why we've seen and we 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.060
 Coast police control regarding 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.679
 If you meet or meet, you have signs of 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.880
 transit to stop at sites 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.560
 prohibited but then you are not 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.750
 also fulfilling what it has to do 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.549
 with the cars outside, and that's not 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.840
 we have been fighting for over a year 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.329
 that's because the resolution came out more 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.500
 one year and has not met the given 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.720
 fulfillment we had to get to this 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.069
 point because we have been in meetings and 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 in mayoral meetings and not ever 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.720
 had still reached an agreement then 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:56.149
 why are we stumble upon us as unemployment 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:59.869
 a man the driver has like 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.130
 driver the same as my partner in 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.420
 reality 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.420
 that all the companions 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.840
 of the amount they have to pay 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.130
 have to pay what they are called 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.050
 you drive a lot of good people in between 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.730
 they did not know that this treaty 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.170
 equal in term they have to pay 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.780
 also a money for the right of 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.890
 remember inside that precisely in 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.410
 the first tour that we do 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.780
 we have to expose you have to say for 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.530
 turn to four thousand pesos for leads and 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.360
 by clock and in Bogota speaks to us arrange 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.370
 of nine thousand pesos to pay a 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.590
 parking lot and to pay for a drive and 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.780
 a breathalyzer test and out of that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.049
 We are here to pay a return that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.750
 they do not charge us who in each company 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.190
 fuel tolls and other expenses that 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.080
 we have additional here then in the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 actually we fight politics 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.549
 that they remove the cars of step because 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.690
 those cars they park here 34 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.049
 thousand issues here we have a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.220
 time control towards the fourth and 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.030
 then we see that going out 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.240
 flying and out that because they teaching 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.700
 to people with eating value the price 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.930
 of the passage is for those who have direct 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.850
 control over price management of 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.070
 they from the companies outside do not 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.690
 initially the company that we 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.360
 puts in another the rates that we have to 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.490
 to pay for each round but it was 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.790
 them if they are the ones who give the 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.200
 control of payroll prices 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.480
 with some owners of shameless lady 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.370
 like this rule this name is stable 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.310
 my name is rosa gutiérrez here 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.459
 we work in ayacucho fleet we are 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.840
 harmed because we have 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.140
 been pressing for the mayor 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.630
 is present at a meeting and never comes 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.670
 we do not distinguish many people 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.709
 we do not know who he is then we have 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.990
 been in meetings and they always tell us 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.290
 that they will solve and they do not solve 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.390
 nothing is worse and what about the cars 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.030
 step also because they are leading the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.190
 people at less price then we are 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.910
 harming because work for 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.500
 we are already very bad like this 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.700
 they let us work you have to 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.440
 meet a schedule of course with 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.050
 a fee not his name and when 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.380
 driving mauricio quintero I have 14 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.480
 years 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.700
 and if the problem has been lived 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.459
 here in zipaquirá is basically 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.140
 by the cars of step there has not been 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.210
 collaboration by the mayor's office 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:30.540
 to enforce the decree that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.000
 signed more than two years ago and then we 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.790
 We were forced to make this stoppage 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.950
 so that they listen to us and collaborate with us and 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.990
 and enforce the mayor for 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.340
 that is present and does not give us the face 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.320
 and collaborate with us because the service that 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.570
 loan here is from the town and it is for the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.760
 people and benefit are the cars 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.070
 that come from outside we need 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.390
 you collaborate how long it takes 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.220
 driving and regulation man is wrong 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.250
 My name is Carlos Gomes, he has a 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.900
 average of 25 years leading the 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.070
 situation that arises is not that 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.350
 we want to generate any kind of 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.440
 violence but quite the opposite is a 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.750
 it is a peaceful protest we are 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.430
 doing it with the benefit of our 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.840
 families with the benefit of being able 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.470
 provide a good service to users 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.390
 that are some in an adequate service 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.650
 that is a comfortable service but it turns out 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.360
 that all this war 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.030
 what we are experiencing the pressure that 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.509
 we are paying to see by the clock by 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.160
 the time for the complicated traffic 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.259
 that we have a lot of cars parked 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.330
 on the tracks and that all this is us 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.190
 hampering time and all this we 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.720
 has been generating too much stress 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.580
 too much non-compliance in 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.990
 payroll with companies then 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.710
 it is really generating a problem 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.449
 the idea is not to get to that we have 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.460
 that we face between companions of 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.960
 work but otherwise we 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.720
 we want companies to provide us 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.130
 I support solving the children other than 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.750
 they are working for as they say stops 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.539
 and to question how many drivers 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.820
 approximately public transport and 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.770
 for I think it is we have 15 pages 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:09.190
 and we have an average of 12 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:11.650
 80 more than 120 drivers once 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.680
 all the routes or for the savanna 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.620
 bogota for the portal then always 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.849
 is the big number after the 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.979
 inconvenience that there are with the tractors 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.960
 well we'll be somewhere else here 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.729
 where also some other part of that 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.139
 protest that as you see and as 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.069
 show the images of Rodrigo have 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.289
 be in a protest totally 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.699
 peaceful and good they consider me 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.930
 like since they are not fulfilling the 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.090
 need they have and of course 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.349
 they have many problems that cause 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.770
 that this timely mind is known as 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.770
 penny war 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.849
 Y
