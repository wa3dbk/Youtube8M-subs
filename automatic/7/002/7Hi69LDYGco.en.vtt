00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
Windsor Newton has a variety of alkyd

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.609 
Windsor Newton has a variety of alkyd
mediums<00:00:13.329> called<00:00:13.629> liquid<00:00:14.049> which<00:00:14.320> are<00:00:14.469> made<00:00:14.589> by

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:14.619 
mediums called liquid which are made by

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.410 
mediums called liquid which are made by
treating<00:00:15.009> a<00:00:15.129> naturally<00:00:15.610> derived<00:00:15.849> oil<00:00:16.150> like

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
treating a naturally derived oil like

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.380 
treating a naturally derived oil like
linseed<00:00:16.840> oil<00:00:16.930> with<00:00:17.440> alcohol<00:00:17.950> and<00:00:18.160> acid<00:00:18.820> that's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
linseed oil with alcohol and acid that's

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.550 
linseed oil with alcohol and acid that's
where<00:00:19.540> the<00:00:19.600> name<00:00:19.780> comes<00:00:20.050> from

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
where the name comes from

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.350 
where the name comes from
first<00:00:20.740> part<00:00:20.920> of<00:00:20.980> alcohol<00:00:21.340> last<00:00:21.640> part<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:21.970> acid

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
first part of alcohol last part of acid

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.780 
first part of alcohol last part of acid
and<00:00:22.450> you<00:00:22.510> get<00:00:22.660> alkyd<00:00:23.350> and<00:00:23.500> what<00:00:24.010> alkyds<00:00:24.400> do<00:00:24.640> is

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
and you get alkyd and what alkyds do is

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.100 
and you get alkyd and what alkyds do is
they<00:00:24.910> speed<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.450> drying<00:00:25.690> rate<00:00:25.960> of

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
they speed the drying rate of

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.380 
they speed the drying rate of
conventional<00:00:26.620> oils<00:00:26.950> by<00:00:27.130> about<00:00:27.310> 50%<00:00:27.640> so<00:00:28.240> what

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
conventional oils by about 50% so what

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.240 
conventional oils by about 50% so what
that<00:00:28.510> means<00:00:28.780> for<00:00:29.080> you<00:00:29.260> as<00:00:29.530> a<00:00:29.560> painter<00:00:30.039> as<00:00:30.130> an

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
that means for you as a painter as an

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.940 
that means for you as a painter as an
artist<00:00:30.610> is<00:00:30.760> that<00:00:31.120> pigments<00:00:31.900> paints<00:00:32.770> oil

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
artist is that pigments paints oil

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.310 
artist is that pigments paints oil
paints<00:00:33.250> will<00:00:33.370> dry<00:00:33.670> about<00:00:34.329> 2<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.750> 12<00:00:34.990> days

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
paints will dry about 2 to 12 days

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.319 
paints will dry about 2 to 12 days
depending<00:00:36.070> upon<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.520> pigment<00:00:36.910> so<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.240> can

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
depending upon the pigment so you can

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.120 
depending upon the pigment so you can
split<00:00:37.540> that<00:00:37.600> drying<00:00:38.050> time<00:00:38.350> in<00:00:38.530> half<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.980> about

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
split that drying time in half to about

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.670 
split that drying time in half to about
1<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.489> 6<00:00:39.760> days<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.600> that's<00:00:40.660> touch<00:00:41.020> dry<00:00:41.320> you'd

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
1 to 6 days and that's touch dry you'd

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.930 
1 to 6 days and that's touch dry you'd
still<00:00:41.950> want<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.130> wait<00:00:42.280> six<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.610> twelve<00:00:42.880> months

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
still want to wait six to twelve months

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.120 
still want to wait six to twelve months

of the fact that it was the first one
pour<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.420> out<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:53.079> can<00:00:53.110> see<00:00:53.410> that's<00:00:53.559> quite

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
pour that out you can see that's quite

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.740 
pour that out you can see that's quite
fluid<00:00:54.790> I'm<00:00:54.910> going<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.090> take<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.329> little<00:00:55.540> bit

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
fluid I'm going to take a little bit

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.350 
fluid I'm going to take a little bit
that<00:00:55.960> off<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.500> side<00:00:56.590> here<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.309> take<00:00:58.180> some

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
that off to the side here and take some

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.750 
that off to the side here and take some
oil<00:00:58.510> color<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:59.050> here<00:00:59.350> the<00:01:00.130> proportion<00:01:00.670> of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
oil color in here the proportion of

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.150 
oil color in here the proportion of
medium<00:01:01.180> here<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.390> want<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.600> do<00:01:01.660> about<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.920> to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
medium here you want to do about one to

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.700 
medium here you want to do about one to
two<00:01:04.920> liquid<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.570> paint<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.840> color<00:01:08.049> I'm<00:01:08.620> going

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
two liquid to paint to color I'm going

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.360 
two liquid to paint to color I'm going
to<00:01:08.830> mix<00:01:08.920> that<00:01:09.159> up

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
to mix that up

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.130 
to mix that up
take<00:01:09.820> this<00:01:09.909> off<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.240> side<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.659> can<00:01:10.960> see

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
take this off to the side you can see

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.100 
take this off to the side you can see
already<00:01:11.290> how<00:01:11.590> fluid<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.330> glossy<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.510> makes<00:01:13.990> it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
already how fluid and glossy it makes it

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.260 
already how fluid and glossy it makes it
the<00:01:14.200> color<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.530> just<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.770> rich<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.790> can<00:01:16.060> take

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
the color is just so rich so I can take

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.380 
the color is just so rich so I can take
the<00:01:16.450> stiff<00:01:16.750> consistency<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.850> oil<00:01:18.850> paint<00:01:19.180> which

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
the stiff consistency of oil paint which

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.750 
the stiff consistency of oil paint which
you<00:01:19.510> see<00:01:19.690> over<00:01:19.900> here<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.010> quite<00:01:21.460> short

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
you see over here which is quite short

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.090 
you see over here which is quite short
right<00:01:22.720> and<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:23.229> can<00:01:23.409> really<00:01:23.710> get<00:01:23.950> the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
right and I can really get the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.160 
right and I can really get the
consistency<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.670> make<00:01:24.760> that<00:01:25.180> move<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.810> flow

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
consistency to make that move and flow

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.219 
consistency to make that move and flow
across<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.500> surface<00:01:26.830> really<00:01:27.400> really<00:01:27.580> nice

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
across the surface really really nice

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.840 
across the surface really really nice
liquid<00:01:29.229> fine<00:01:29.470> detail<00:01:29.920> as<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.220> name<00:01:30.340> suggests

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
liquid fine detail as the name suggests

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.100 
liquid fine detail as the name suggests
is<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.630> very<00:01:31.869> very<00:01:31.990> fluid<00:01:32.439> medium<00:01:32.770> much<00:01:33.369> more<00:01:33.640> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
is a very very fluid medium much more so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.270 
is a very very fluid medium much more so
right<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.439> reason<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.770> have<00:01:35.920> something<00:01:36.250> like

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
right the reason we have something like

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.620 
right the reason we have something like
that<00:01:36.400> also<00:01:36.850> going<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.030> dry<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.360> gloss<00:01:37.600> finish

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
that also going to dry to a gloss finish

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.660 
that also going to dry to a gloss finish
is<00:01:38.170> because<00:01:38.650> they<00:01:38.770> will<00:01:38.890> level<00:01:39.220> your<00:01:39.400> brush

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
is because they will level your brush

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.010 
is because they will level your brush
marks<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.180> when<00:01:40.299> you<00:01:40.360> want<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.570> get<00:01:40.659> into<00:01:40.840> fine

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
marks so when you want to get into fine

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.570 
marks so when you want to get into fine
detail<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.740> don't<00:01:41.950> want<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.189> leave<00:01:42.310> brush

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
detail and you don't want to leave brush

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.550 
detail and you don't want to leave brush
marks<00:01:42.880> behind<00:01:43.030> liquid<00:01:43.960> fine<00:01:44.140> detail<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.530> a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
marks behind liquid fine detail is a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.620 
marks behind liquid fine detail is a
really<00:01:44.830> great<00:01:45.009> choice<00:01:45.189> for<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.520> then<00:01:46.180> liquid

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
really great choice for that then liquid

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.480 
really great choice for that then liquid
light<00:01:46.810> gel<00:01:47.140> I'm<00:01:47.770> actually<00:01:47.920> going<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.189> grab<00:01:48.430> a

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
light gel I'm actually going to grab a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.070 
light gel I'm actually going to grab a
palette<00:01:49.000> knife<00:01:49.030> for<00:01:49.390> this<00:01:49.479> because<00:01:49.780> liquid

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
stiff consistency which is why it comes

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
stiff consistency which is why it comes
in<00:02:27.159> a<00:02:27.219> tube<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:28.420> will<00:02:28.540> retain<00:02:29.280> texture<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
in a tube and it will retain texture and

in a tube and it will retain texture and
retain<00:02:32.200> brushstrokes<00:02:32.859> they'll<00:02:33.609> be<00:02:33.730> very<00:02:33.879> very

retain brushstrokes they'll be very very
crisp<00:02:34.480> brushstrokes<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.319> will<00:02:35.469> change<00:02:35.739> so

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
crisp brushstrokes that will change so

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.839 
crisp brushstrokes that will change so
it's<00:02:35.980> going<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.129> it's<00:02:36.370> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.549> keep<00:02:36.670> those

then liquid olio pasto also in a tube

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.899 
then liquid olio pasto also in a tube
looks<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.650> little<00:02:44.739> bit<00:02:44.950> similar<00:02:45.189> at<00:02:45.430> first<00:02:45.459> if<00:02:45.819> I

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
looks a little bit similar at first if I

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.339 
looks a little bit similar at first if I
spread<00:02:46.150> some<00:02:46.359> of<00:02:46.389> this<00:02:46.510> out<00:02:46.720> or<00:02:46.930> squeeze<00:02:47.200> it

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
spread some of this out or squeeze it

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.740 
spread some of this out or squeeze it
out<00:02:47.730> see<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.819> looks<00:02:49.000> very<00:02:49.120> much<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.389> same

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
out see it looks very much the same

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.780 
out see it looks very much the same
however<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.709> difference<00:02:51.099> is<00:02:51.250> with<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.579> it's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
however the difference is with this it's

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.879 
however the difference is with this it's
going<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:51.970> dry<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.389> semi<00:02:52.689> matte<00:02:53.019> finish

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
going to dry to a semi matte finish

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.920 
going to dry to a semi matte finish
different<00:02:54.609> than<00:02:54.669> the<00:02:54.849> other<00:02:54.970> liquid<00:02:55.389> mediums

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.379 
different than the other liquid mediums
and<00:02:56.109> it's<00:02:56.560> going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.769> dry<00:02:56.950> more<00:02:57.220> quickly

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
and it's going to dry more quickly

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.940 
and it's going to dry more quickly
thicken<00:02:58.389> very<00:02:58.629> rapidly<00:02:59.169> and<00:02:59.409> the<00:02:59.739> brush

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
thicken very rapidly and the brush

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.869 
thicken very rapidly and the brush
strokes<00:03:00.219> you're<00:03:00.370> going<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.549> have<00:03:00.669> with<00:03:00.760> that

are going to level out so that's that's
a<00:03:02.349> big<00:03:02.530> difference<00:03:02.709> with<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> impasto<00:03:04.120> very

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
a big difference with the impasto very

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.390 
a big difference with the impasto very

and<00:03:08.709> remember<00:03:09.310> as<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.489> said<00:03:09.669> you<00:03:09.819> can<00:03:09.939> add<00:03:10.120> a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
and remember as I said you can add a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.449 
and remember as I said you can add a
proportion<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> ratio<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.409> about<00:03:11.530> one<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.310> two

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
liquids to oil color and you can change
