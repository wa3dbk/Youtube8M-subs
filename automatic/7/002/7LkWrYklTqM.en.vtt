00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.100
 I have been well and better what I was 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.100
 saying 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.969
 for 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:00.909
 everything is for those who want the money 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:02:03.659
 because you do not have to pay it in 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.740
 where you see here the 50 are outside 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.429
 points out 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.429
 shit 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:19.520
 so little by little and as you can see there are two 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:24.770
 two of these two copper so you'll see 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.290
 We are in 73 silvers and 10 copper 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.230
 supposedly a let's say 100 copper 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.930
 will jump to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.400
 to the silver one more that is to say that in 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.269

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.269
 what are we going to say 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.210

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.660

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.260
 You see we have sold the 1050 and we have 64 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.409
 10 if we sell these more 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.790

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:02.489

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.019
 another city and you are going to catch it more 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.700
 the pumpkin and more carrots that also 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.030
 the carrot pumpkins serve to 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.040
 be healed but good to heal you 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.380
 but good to get money is a 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.970
 good option so you know that never 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.540
