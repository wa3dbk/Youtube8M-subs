00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
team I really don't want to be losing

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.560 
team I really don't want to be losing
this<00:02:06.440> I've<00:02:06.740> heard<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.550> bird<00:02:07.910> chip<00:02:08.330> is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
this I've heard that the bird chip is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.450 
this I've heard that the bird chip is
one<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.990> best<00:02:09.229> players<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.770> community

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
one of the best players in the community

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.250 
one of the best players in the community
so<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.000> going<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.360> be<00:02:11.450> pretty<00:02:11.630> damn<00:02:11.990> hard

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so it's going to be pretty damn hard

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.050 
so it's going to be pretty damn hard
even<00:02:12.800> though<00:02:13.040> I've<00:02:13.160> got<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.520> absolutely

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060
