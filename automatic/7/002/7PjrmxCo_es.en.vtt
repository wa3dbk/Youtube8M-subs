00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.900 

what<00:01:57.350> we're<00:01:57.500> trying<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.740> do<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.130> give<00:01:58.520> an

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
what we're trying to do is give an

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.760 
what we're trying to do is give an
instruction<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.080> people<00:02:00.410> buying<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
instruction to the people buying the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.110 
instruction to the people buying the
products<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.400> they<00:02:01.430> have<00:02:01.730> a<00:02:01.760> better

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
products so they have a better

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.060 
products so they have a better
understanding<00:02:02.240> how<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.200> works<00:02:03.410> your<00:02:03.890> hands

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
understanding how it works your hands

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.340 
understanding how it works your hands
have<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.370> look<00:02:04.520> clean<00:02:05.060> but<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.330> think<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.170> idea

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
have to look clean but I think the idea

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.200 
have to look clean but I think the idea
of<00:02:06.620> using<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:07.040> person<00:02:07.520> makes<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.820> more<00:02:07.910> personal

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210
