00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
to operate when you get down to the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.050 
to operate when you get down to the
bottom<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> page<00:02:42.190> there's<00:02:42.579> an<00:02:42.700> automatic

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
bottom of the page there's an automatic

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.699 
bottom of the page there's an automatic
page<00:02:43.420> turn<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.049> let's<00:02:44.290> see<00:02:44.440> if<00:02:44.500> we<00:02:44.590> could

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
page turn so let's see if we could

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.210 
page turn so let's see if we could
demonstrate<00:02:44.829> that<00:02:45.130> for<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:46.620> I'm<00:02:47.620> gonna<00:02:47.859> slide

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
demonstrate that for you I'm gonna slide

00:02:48.220 --> 00:03:07.610 
demonstrate that for you I'm gonna slide
it<00:02:48.400> up<00:02:48.579> a<00:02:48.730> little

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.949 

so<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.890> programmed<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.849> so<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.360> turns<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.780> little

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
so I programmed it so it turns a little

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.690 
so I programmed it so it turns a little
bit<00:03:11.200> early<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.770> have<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.190> learn<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.519> read

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
bit early so you have to learn to read

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.839 
bit early so you have to learn to read
ahead<00:03:12.849> just<00:03:13.300> by<00:03:13.450> like<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> measure<00:03:14.200> because<00:03:15.130> you

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
ahead just by like a measure because you

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.370 
ahead just by like a measure because you
your<00:03:16.180> eyes<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.540> going<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.690> need<00:03:16.840> time<00:03:17.140> to

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
your eyes are going to need time to

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.240 
your eyes are going to need time to
focus<00:03:17.590> on<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.010> new<00:03:18.130> page<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:20.590> really<00:03:20.890> once

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
focus on the new page and it really once

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.620 
focus on the new page and it really once
you<00:03:21.310> play<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:21.880> couple<00:03:22.060> times<00:03:22.300> like<00:03:22.510> that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
you play it a couple times like that

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.850 
you play it a couple times like that
you'll<00:03:22.780> get<00:03:22.930> used<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.380> it's<00:03:23.530> actually<00:03:23.830> a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
you'll get used to it it's actually a

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.680 
you'll get used to it it's actually a
very<00:03:23.980> good<00:03:24.220> habit<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.640> be<00:03:24.849> in<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.269> read<00:03:25.450> ahead<00:03:25.540> a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
very good habit to be in to read ahead a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.420 
very good habit to be in to read ahead a
little<00:03:25.840> bit<00:03:25.989> but<00:03:26.650> that's<00:03:26.769> basically<00:03:27.099> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
little bit but that's basically the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.059 
little bit but that's basically the
whole<00:03:27.459> app<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:28.600> very<00:03:28.690> easy<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.140> use<00:03:29.230> fun<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.890> use
