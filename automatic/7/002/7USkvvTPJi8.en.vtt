00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.609
 welcome to the new review this time 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.950
 let's see an application that is a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.349
 beta is a preview is an application 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.840
 that will be coming soon for iphone 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.109
 is the popular pixelmator application 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.580
 that we have in mac and the truth is that I 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.050
 love this version of iphone is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 really amazing to have it in a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.670
 device because it becomes something 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 as well as a true photoshop but 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.570
 for iphone and without complexes really 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 has a lot of possibilities this 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.900
 application is also for ipad guys 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 already available but the iphone 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 it will be coming soon and good 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.680
 we have been able to access the beta and we are going to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 go to see it to begin to notice that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.040
 here this synchronizes perfectly with 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 icloud drive and these are all 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840
 folders that I use for example 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.489
 good to make the little signs of the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.960
 videos in pixelmator which is what I 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 I use to edit the images not 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 notice that here I have for example 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.719
 the covers and notice that here by 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.820
 example I have some posters we are going to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.379
 go to the popular poster this here that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.180
 I use in all reviews of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.460
 applications and notice that from here 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.530
 well I have this this poster 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.820
 as you are seeing that it is the one that I use 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.360
 so good to put the name of the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.850
 Applications 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.320
 not good that we can do here to fix 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.520
 that we are already seeing a little 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.190
 possibilities that this application has 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 note that we can choose any of 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.700
 the layers that we have available we go 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 to catch is for example to notice that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 we can make bigger we can move 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 any of these objects as if 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.740
 out a photoshop really back 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.170
 we can work in layers and see that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.640
 we are even going to be able to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.620
 reorganize well all the layers 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.300
 in this way we are not going to undo that 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.250
 this interests me to have it well and we are going to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.110
 get out of here let's give more and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 notice that we can create an image 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.650
 new let's see a little bit what 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.240
 possibilities we have we can create a 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.400
 image for example that is a 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.500
 collage to make or put a collage 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.509
 of photos plain and simple we can not 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.100
 make a picture of the reel but also 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.780
 we will be able to apply a framework of these 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.850
 that we have here we also have the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 option to create cards a card 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.540
 visit a card for an invitation 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.550
 of birthday whatever it is we can not 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 make a poster also with different 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.660
 texts so cool a photograph 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.170
 normal with different ray effects 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.940
 sun rays light color good effect 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.560
 different filters do not also here 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.510
 we also have a vintage effect for 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 love then to personalize the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.390
 let's continue because we also have 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.280
 the option of going to take images that 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.020
 let's have in the cloud drive and this 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.060
 also what I really like that is the 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.650
 apple cloud no longer to finish telling you 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.750
 that we have the option of making a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.540
 photography with the iphone camera or 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.010
 well choose a photograph of the reel 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.290
 let's choose a photograph of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 reel for example let's catch this 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.770
 here that I was the other day for good 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.450
 partly on a girls me 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.250
 They put a bunch of stickers on their faces 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.050
 that we went to the good party this 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.000
 brand and good guys what can we do 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.980
 here and notice that we of this 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.710
 we will be able to unfold the theme 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.330
 of the layers of agreement and we with 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.190
 the little button we can also add more 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.920
 photographs we are going to add some for 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.150
 action is here from marvel and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.490
 notice that we can 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.650
 reorganize in this way as we 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.230
 we want we can even resize 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.820
 the ones this way is not there and this what 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.170
 more I like we are going to have a photoshop 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.360
 full guys we will be able to work 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.680
 perfectly by layers but what else 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.720
 we have here to notice that we 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.550
 holding the image down we're going to 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.740
 see what we are going to be able to do 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.930
 that we see a menu to cut 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.500
 copy paste delete or even create a 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.660
 duplicate of this 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.310
 we will also be able to edit 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.350
 any of the layers for example 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.970
 we will be able to paint or erase and with this 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.440
 option we can first select if 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.330
 we want to paint or if we want to erase 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.880
 let's choose to erase and notice that 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.380
 we can erase part of the fund we are going to 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.000
 choose now paint and notice that 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.230
 we are going to be able to draw as 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.780
 you are seeing we can change the color 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.910
 the type of brush and such we are not going to give it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.500
 to done and we continue we meet 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.880
 with the option of retouching also very 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.410
 interesting because we for example 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.630
 we can remove blemishes from the face 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.430
 illuminate certain areas apply more 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.800
 sharpness let's for example remove a 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.780
 Stain to see that I have a mole 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.030
 here I simply paint it in this way 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.340
 and notice that now automatically this 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.959
 Moon will disappear we will not 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.940
 continue let's make this bigger 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.530
 to see what else we find the subject of 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.150
 distortion this is one of the most 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.100
 cool we have different here 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.020
 formats to choose the distortion 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.760
 perhaps the most usual is this one here and 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.709
 we notice that for example today 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.420
 we are very curbs let's make it a 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.669
 little bit thinner and this way we're going 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.650
 to power and by 'bon edit the snapshot 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.090
 well let's cancel and we continue 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.620
 guys because we have too much mogollÃ³n 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.690
 of more fixed options those that we have the 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.830
 color adjustment we can apply some 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.340
 of these filters that come by 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.010
 decide 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.090
 we can adjust the levels set 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.790
 we also have options to adjust 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.650
 brightness contrast saturation and also 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.419
 here we can adjust a little more the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.400
 colors things that I like for example 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.320
 we can retouch the white balance of all 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.449
 the image we simply choose the white 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.830
 for example here we have it and we give it to 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.780
 done and fix those that we have adjusted the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.940
 white balance with the white of the 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.620
 instantaneous and here we have more options 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.330
 to touch the curves and all this moved 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.130
 We are not going to give you to cancel and see what 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.250
 more we have here to notice that we can 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.050
 add effects this is so good curious 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.340
 note that we can add effects like 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.050
 this for example and in this way 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.360
 we can customize this 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.400
 we can also make an effect that 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.840
 this one and we are going to be able to good as 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.700
 you see here adjust it in this way not 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.070
 we have lots of effects also this 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.479
 maybe it's not what I like the most but the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.490
 truth is that we also have options 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.930
 to select and how can we 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.460
 select well then we have here the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.960
 typical options I hope you are 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.850
 realizing that we have the options 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.400
 more subtle we can have in 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.710
 photoshop and especially in pixelmator the 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.840
 full of the mac we have practically 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.580
 the same is not all but really what 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.260
 most important we have it we have the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.400
 magic wand we can select from 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.530
 free form 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.050
 with a square with a circle we are going to 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.639
 choose this form to select and 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.290
 see what good simply here we go 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.669
 to paint and where we will paint 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.470
 it will be automatically selected 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.449
 agree to see that it works 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.009
 really very good to see what else we have 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.320
 guys, check that we can also 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.150
 trim fix that this way this 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.669
 it's pretty trivial enough 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.410
 On the other hand, we can not change the 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.729
 fixed format the guys here here this 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.039
 I like it a lot because I use it a lot 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:01.070
 for example with the letters we will be able to 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.860
 For example, add an outline to 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.449
 letters so for example so you have 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.979
 a plot of a certain color here 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.110
 we would do it with the layout and such 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.180
 we can fill for example the layers 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.560
 notice that we can say that 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.720
 the layer merges with the ones 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.800
 under a certain way like what 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.870
 we would do in photoshop if it is 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.310
 Exactly the same thing we can add as 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.889
 I tell you we can add other images 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.720
 we can add other layers in white 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.610
 we can add text with different 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.099
 fonts or we can add 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.020
 different geometric figures in 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.699
 essence this is all that the 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.650
 application but really today is 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.120
 pretty good just to finish 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.430
