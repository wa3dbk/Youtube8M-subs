 presentation of a headset of this case 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.399
 the truth is appreciated that detail that the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.200
 true that when transporting these 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.820
 these helmets or any helmet or 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.680
 any material is very rare what 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.680
 we care about exercising 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.210
 This will be what is very comfortable with 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.260
 regulation of the word ear with a lot 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.390
 regulation I do not know if you see it here 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.800
 you perfectly see that you can regulate 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.430
 the headset the high as you want to 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.409
 get better or worse to an ear 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.099
 or another here we have 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.860
 we have here a success to put is for 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.720
 plug in the default micro I have and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.730
 brings us in the right handset we 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.769
 bring the little hole for her to stop 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.160
 embed in the micro but if by 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.340
 any reason because of him 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.830
 in any way we can simply 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.010
 embedded in the left speaker in the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.650
 left atrial because if not more 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.210
 comfortable or with you want here 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.700
 functions that brings us here we 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.980
 they bring the function to plug in the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.480
 command here of the xbox command or 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.670
 playstation 3 if necessary 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.740
 offered 4 is plugged in here from the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.810
 control the headset to talk on 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.390
 the microphone without problems here a 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.640
 small port to plug in the battery 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.130
 to load the headset and here 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.770
 there's the ignition button this is 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.170
 a little button embedded in the logo 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.170
 of jute clear that is very 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.540
 very unusual to see this embedded in a 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.160
 logo and here of this vote I do not know if 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.099
 you hear the sound but it's a little motor 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.680
 affects the mind in which this 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.170
 blinking light meaning that the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.069
 headset is connecting to the system 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.379
 what are you using 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.999
 more things to exercise for example in the 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.799
 right angle here we see the the 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.900
 micro forgiveness configuration here 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.499
 we see the micro configuration here what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.650
 we put the red vote we press and we leave 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:36.049
 in mute the micro set match to give it 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.480
 more volume to chat from game to chat 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.280
 it left true to be of the players and 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.189
 made less to take away the volume 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.299
 same example players in the headset 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:52.459
 left red center button for 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:55.340
 cancel the double-click sound to 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.319
 that the headset becomes a 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.370
 headset of four speakers or two 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.159
 speakers 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.409
 chapman gay less sorry to go down 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.930
 volume to the game and gay more to upload 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.870
 volume to the game what is this for? 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.549
 Well basically if we are listening 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.590
 the game too loud and we do not listen 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.540
 to the classmates we simply have to 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.419
 download the game and upload the companions 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.699
 viceversa because it boorishly and 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.889
 you can simply configure the 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.510
 perfection the sound to both the game and 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.340
 of the players so you hear simple 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.810
 more to your colleagues or not 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.699
 you want to listen to two colleagues who 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.440
 they are very heavy to silence them to 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.060
 the companions we lower the volume to the 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.370
 companions and we raise the volume of 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.940
 game so good is all about 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.539
 what the helmet brings us now 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.270
 let's see what it brings us to bind you iutet 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.729
 here we have the workable cable that serves 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.190
 to load it with the usb connector and the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.660
 connector that connects high koval 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.270
 you are in to start at your saving value 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.600
 it plugs into any console and it 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.720
 load automatically 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.870
 here we see one here is 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.270
 an object that already albín will do many is 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.580
 the micro the microphone that is embedded 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.230
 that you see it so much in the headset in the 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.720
 right earphone in the headset of the 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.300
 left as there will be that is flexible 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.490
 to be able to move the wings to 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.960
 positions that you want for it is 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.120
 super super comfortable 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.110
 more things more things more things here 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.110
 we have the bluetooth adapter 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.130
 this is the bluetooth adapter plugs 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.240

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.830
 four plug in the usb gel and with this x 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.320
 turn on a blue led if I remember correctly 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.160
 and it will mean that there is 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.330
 synchronizing with the mic the headset and 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.950
 here we see the different components 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.560
 what extreme and perhaps not the used 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.750
 but they serve for pc or the different 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.050
 add-ons so that to configure the 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.420
 pc at an optimal level and what better then
