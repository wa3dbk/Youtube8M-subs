emission levels of that truck

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.139 
emission levels of that truck
we've<00:01:40.560> reduced<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.220> monoxides<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.389 
down by 99 plus percent over the period
of<00:01:48.030> eight<00:01:48.240> or<00:01:48.360> nine<00:01:48.509> years<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.439> challenge<00:01:50.220> any

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
of eight or nine years I challenge any

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.389 
of eight or nine years I challenge any
other<00:01:50.580> industry<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:52.110> match<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:53.189> value

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
other industry to match that that value

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.240 
other industry to match that that value
so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.509> know<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> say<00:01:55.320> clean<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.890> diesel

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
so you know you can say clean and diesel

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090 
so you know you can say clean and diesel
now<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.000> same<00:01:57.210> sentence<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> we've<00:01:58.920> now

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
now in the same sentence so we've now

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.700 
now in the same sentence so we've now
taken<00:01:59.390> emissions<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.630> step<00:02:01.110> forward<00:02:01.350> with

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
taken emissions a step forward with

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.770 
taken emissions a step forward with
diesel<00:02:02.130> particular<00:02:02.490> filters<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.299> these<00:02:03.630> are

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
diesel particular filters and these are

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
diesel particular filters and these are
intelligent<00:02:04.350> filters<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.039> when

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
intelligent filters they know when

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190

as far as diesel being looked at is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.060 
as far as diesel being looked at is
dirty<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.230> quickly<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.830> away

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
dirty I think that is quickly going away

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.710 
dirty I think that is quickly going away
we<00:02:44.489> have<00:02:45.590> 2407<00:02:46.590> EPA<00:02:47.280> engines<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.450> fuel

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
we have 2407 EPA engines the fuel

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.449 
we have 2407 EPA engines the fuel
economy<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.380> hiring<00:02:49.620> what<00:02:49.859> we<00:02:49.980> thought<00:02:50.310> it

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
economy is hiring what we thought it

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.789 
economy is hiring what we thought it
would<00:02:50.549> be<00:02:50.730> these<00:02:51.660> trucks<00:02:51.959> when<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.560> look<00:02:52.709> at

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
would be these trucks when you look at

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.259 
would be these trucks when you look at
the<00:02:52.890> exhaust<00:02:53.070> system<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.579> them<00:02:53.730> there's

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
the exhaust system on them there's

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.960 
the exhaust system on them there's
nothing<00:02:54.420> comes<00:02:54.780> out<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.760> at<00:02:56.850> those

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
nothing comes out so I look at those

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.050 
nothing comes out so I look at those
trucks<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.329> see<00:02:57.480> clean<00:02:58.320> engines<00:02:58.799> clean<00:02:59.250> air<00:02:59.430> so

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
trucks I see clean engines clean air so

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.910 
trucks I see clean engines clean air so
that's<00:03:00.269> our<00:03:00.420> goal<00:03:00.630> when<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> truck<00:03:01.799> go

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
that's our goal when you have a truck go

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.740 
that's our goal when you have a truck go
down<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> road<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.670> has<00:03:03.030> your<00:03:03.060> name<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
side of it and you're hauling for a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.840 
side of it and you're hauling for a
company<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:07.290> their<00:03:07.440> loads<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.859> there<00:03:08.160> they

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
company and their loads on there they

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.330 
company and their loads on there they
want<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.709> truck<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.859> looks<00:03:11.040> clean

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
want to have a truck that looks clean

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.670 
want to have a truck that looks clean
and<00:03:11.609> not<00:03:12.299> smoking<00:03:12.780> up<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.019> environment<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and not smoking up the environment and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.370 
and not smoking up the environment and
that's<00:03:13.859> our<00:03:14.040> goal<00:03:14.190> well<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.450> exhaust<00:03:16.079> stacks

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
that's our goal well the exhaust stacks

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.370 
that's our goal well the exhaust stacks
of<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.769> pba<00:03:17.220> 07<00:03:17.790> mission<00:03:18.510> certified<00:03:18.959> engines

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
of the pba 07 mission certified engines

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800 
of the pba 07 mission certified engines
are<00:03:19.650> clean<00:03:20.069> on<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.400> inside<00:03:20.430> even<00:03:21.150> thousands

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
are clean on the inside even thousands

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.690 
are clean on the inside even thousands
of<00:03:21.900> hundreds<00:03:22.200> of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
of hundreds of

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.860 
of hundreds of
miles<00:03:23.120> after<00:03:23.920> they've<00:03:24.920> been<00:03:25.069> put<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.430> service

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
miles after they've been put in service

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.720 
miles after they've been put in service
so<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.620> set<00:03:27.950> coming<00:03:28.400> out<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:28.550> these

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
so that so the set coming out of these

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.809 
so that so the set coming out of these
trucks<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.840> zero<00:03:30.410> essentially<00:03:31.190> zero<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.700> these

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
trucks is zero essentially zero so these

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.970 
trucks is zero essentially zero so these
things<00:03:32.060> are<00:03:32.269> very<00:03:32.300> clean<00:03:32.780> diesel<00:03:33.500> engine<00:03:33.830> is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
things are very clean diesel engine is

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.759 
things are very clean diesel engine is
