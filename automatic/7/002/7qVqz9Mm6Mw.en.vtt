will<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.850> depends<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.510> I've<00:00:51.930> been<00:00:52.050> using

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
will it just depends and I've been using

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
will it just depends and I've been using
this<00:00:52.500> method<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.100> training<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.969> 100<00:00:54.510> k

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that sort of things go check out that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
that sort of things go check out that
series<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.820> example<00:01:02.850> guys<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:03.840> this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
series so for example guys you got this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.660

is<00:01:16.950> next<00:01:17.280> cheapest<00:01:17.640> by<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.509> chemist

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
is next cheapest by now in that chemist

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
is next cheapest by now in that chemist
or<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> does<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.710> any<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.159> mean<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.670> probably

doubt that any Sylvan forms have got any

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
doubt that any Sylvan forms have got any
more<00:01:23.700> over<00:01:24.000> 12<00:01:24.299> hours<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.750> financial<00:01:25.170> coins

you can see the next cheapest why should

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
you can see the next cheapest why should
this<00:01:27.630> isn't<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.080> cheapest<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> seeps<00:01:28.799> nine

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this isn't the cheapest it seeps nine

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190 
this isn't the cheapest it seeps nine
thousand<00:01:29.670> nine<00:01:29.729> points<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:30.810> could

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
thousand nine points which could

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
thousand nine points which could
probably<00:01:31.409> actually<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.979> very<00:01:32.130> good<00:01:32.280> deal<00:01:32.579> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
probably actually a very good deal so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
probably actually a very good deal so
that's<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.540> example<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:34.290> how<00:01:34.470> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that's just one example of how this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
that's just one example of how this
method<00:01:35.040> works<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.700> guys<00:01:35.939> I'll<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
method works so guys I'll just going to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.030 
method works so guys I'll just going to
show<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.659> guys<00:01:36.750> some<00:01:37.110> proof<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.799> massive

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
show you guys some proof of this massive

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.859 
show you guys some proof of this massive
working<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.759> example<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.329> both<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> these

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
working for example about both of these

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
working for example about both of these
inform<00:01:40.710> ferrets<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:41.670> bought

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
inform ferrets which I actually bought

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
inform ferrets which I actually bought
and<00:01:42.479> both<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.530> about<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> thinkable<00:01:44.369> 1

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and both them for about a thinkable 1

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.389 
and both them for about a thinkable 1

to<00:01:53.070> board<00:01:53.369> these<00:01:53.579> players<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.899> easy

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to board these players so it's very easy

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
to board these players so it's very easy
to<00:01:55.350> make<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.799> probably<00:01:56.130> say<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.369> 5k<00:01:57.000> +<00:01:57.060> profit

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
to make I probably say about 5k + profit

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.260 
to make I probably say about 5k + profit
on<00:01:58.020> each<00:01:58.350> pair<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.979> obviously<00:01:59.549> sometimes<00:01:59.850> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
on each pair and obviously sometimes to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
on each pair and obviously sometimes to
not<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.540> able<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.110> master<00:02:01.560> because

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
not be able to do this master because

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.020 
not be able to do this master because
the<00:02:02.009> work<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:02.369> cars<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> market

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the work with your cars on the market

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
the work with your cars on the market
most<00:02:03.869> times<00:02:04.049> out<00:02:04.259> not<00:02:04.469> when<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.890> check

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
most times out not when you do check

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.490 
most times out not when you do check
there<00:02:05.340> will<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.700> least<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:06.270> inform<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
there will be at least one inform on the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800 
there will be at least one inform on the
market<00:02:08.039> whether<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> deal<00:02:09.179> i'm<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.599> sure

market whether it be a deal i'm not sure

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.809 
market whether it be a deal i'm not sure
so<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.080> best<00:02:10.319> thing<00:02:10.440> I'll<00:02:10.649> say<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:11.099> use<00:02:11.670> this

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
so the best thing I'll say is use this

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.720 
so the best thing I'll say is use this
method<00:02:12.120> long

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
method long

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.490 
method long
other<00:02:12.879> methods<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.659> most<00:02:13.989> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.170> times<00:02:14.349> when

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
other methods and most of the times when

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.990 
other methods and most of the times when
they<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:14.739> check<00:02:15.040> using<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.489> method<00:02:15.849> there

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
they do check using this method there

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.369 
they do check using this method there
will<00:02:16.180> be<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> deal<00:02:16.659> and<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.989> will<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.230> able<00:02:17.290> to
