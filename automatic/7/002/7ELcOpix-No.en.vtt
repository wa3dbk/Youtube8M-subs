in an earlier unit we've already looked
at<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.750> developments<00:00:32.439> and<00:00:32.590> key<00:00:33.059> milestones

in the development of Nursing theory in
this<00:00:37.660> unit<00:00:38.110> what<00:00:38.410> we<00:00:38.559> need<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.830> do<00:00:38.980> is<00:00:39.100> to<00:00:39.250> have

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
this unit what we need to do is to have

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.729 
this unit what we need to do is to have
a<00:00:39.430> look<00:00:39.640> at<00:00:39.820> some<00:00:40.090> of<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.360> images<00:00:40.989> that

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
a look at some of the images that

a look at some of the images that
illustrate<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.420> kind<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:43.809> developments

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
illustrate and the kind of developments

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.250 
illustrate and the kind of developments
that<00:00:45.129> have<00:00:45.280> taken<00:00:45.519> place<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:46.239> nursing<00:00:47.110> and

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
nursing theory and what do these images

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.740 
nursing theory and what do these images
tell<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.339> unit<00:00:54.790> what<00:00:55.330> I'd<00:00:55.449> like<00:00:55.629> you

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
tell you for this unit what I'd like you

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
to do is to try to find some

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.610 
to do is to try to find some

during<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.590> 1950's<00:01:05.590> 1960s<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.630> 1970s<00:01:08.850> what

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
during the 1950's 1960s and 1970s what

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.070 
during the 1950's 1960s and 1970s what
do<00:01:10.000> those<00:01:10.119> pictures<00:01:10.720> tell<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:13.049> order<00:01:14.049> to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
do those pictures tell you in order to

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.680 
do those pictures tell you in order to
illustrate<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.190> task<00:01:15.490> I've<00:01:15.970> chosen<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.540> few

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
illustrate the task I've chosen a few

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.990 
illustrate the task I've chosen a few
pictures<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.229> my<00:01:17.350> own<00:01:17.530> I've<00:01:17.890> I've<00:01:18.700> treated

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
pictures of my own I've I've treated

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.660 
pictures of my own I've I've treated
slightly<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:20.080> I've<00:01:20.860> gone<00:01:21.070> beyond<00:01:21.520> the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
slightly in I've gone beyond the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.719 
slightly in I've gone beyond the
requirements<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.720> 50s<00:01:23.170> 60s<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.799> 70s<00:01:23.890> and

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
requirements of the 50s 60s and 70s and

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.440 
requirements of the 50s 60s and 70s and
but<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.450> did<00:01:25.689> want<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:25.960> illustrate<00:01:26.229> that<00:01:26.710> point

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
but I did want to illustrate that point

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.430 
but I did want to illustrate that point
let's<00:01:28.450> have<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.630> look<00:01:28.840> at<00:01:28.960> some<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.200> those

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
let's have a look at some of those

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.140 
let's have a look at some of those
pictures<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:33.100> first<00:01:33.130> picture<00:01:33.910> that<00:01:34.030> I've

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
pictures the first picture that I've

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.550 
pictures the first picture that I've
chosen<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:35.350> one<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.370> a<00:01:37.060> group<00:01:37.660> of<00:01:37.840> nurses<00:01:38.050> who

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
chosen is one of a group of nurses who

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.830 
chosen is one of a group of nurses who
presumably<00:01:39.280> are<00:01:39.460> just<00:01:39.760> graduating<00:01:40.480> just

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
presumably are just graduating just

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.750 
presumably are just graduating just
becoming<00:01:41.110> qualified<00:01:41.350> nurses<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.220> it<00:01:42.640> was

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
becoming qualified nurses and it was

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.100 
becoming qualified nurses and it was
taken<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.770> 1933<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:45.660> don't<00:01:46.660> know<00:01:46.780> who<00:01:46.930> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
taken in 1933 I don't know who the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.160 
taken in 1933 I don't know who the
little<00:01:47.500> girl<00:01:47.650> in<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> middle<00:01:48.040> was<00:01:48.340> but

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
little girl in the middle was but

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.070 
little girl in the middle was but
presumably<00:01:50.170> she<00:01:50.380> wasn't<00:01:50.710> graduating<00:01:52.050> have<00:01:53.050> a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
presumably she wasn't graduating have a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.990 
presumably she wasn't graduating have a
good<00:01:53.409> look<00:01:53.710> at<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.040> photograph<00:01:54.610> I'll<00:01:54.820> leave

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
good look at the photograph I'll leave

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.210 
good look at the photograph I'll leave
it<00:01:55.120> up<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:55.270> for<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:55.690> few<00:01:55.750> seconds<00:01:56.409> what<00:01:57.040> can

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
it up here for a few seconds what can

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.410

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
to me I like the the long sleeves and if

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.230 
to me I like the the long sleeves and if
you<00:02:04.720> look<00:02:04.900> closely<00:02:05.430> you'll<00:02:06.430> also<00:02:06.610> see<00:02:06.970> they've

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
you look closely you'll also see they've

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.089 
you look closely you'll also see they've
got<00:02:07.270> cuffs<00:02:07.869> on<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.470> ends<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.830> sleeves

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
they're all wearing hats of course and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.309 
they're all wearing hats of course and
look<00:02:12.580> at<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.849> length<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.980> dress

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
look at the length of the of the dress

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.190 
look at the length of the of the dress
perhaps<00:02:17.319> more<00:02:17.530> importantly<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:19.390> what<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.900> not

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
perhaps more importantly and what is not

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.040 
perhaps more importantly and what is not
in<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.620> picture<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:25.209> second<00:02:25.810> photograph

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
hemlines have risen a little bit and but

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.949 
hemlines have risen a little bit and but
the<00:02:41.680> uniforms<00:02:42.220> look<00:02:42.430> pretty<00:02:42.880> much<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.600> same

the uniforms look pretty much the same

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.050 
the uniforms look pretty much the same
perhaps<00:02:44.709> not<00:02:44.950> quite<00:02:45.160> as<00:02:45.430> high<00:02:45.610> around<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
perhaps not quite as high around the

perhaps not quite as high around the
neck<00:02:46.830> again<00:02:47.830> what<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.880> missing<00:02:49.180> from<00:02:49.420> this
