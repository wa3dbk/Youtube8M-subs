00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.440
 Hello everyone today I came here so 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.960
 small package black sachet similar 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.339
 on a bag of bike prices but it's not from there 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.980
 this package with ebay in this package 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:21.760
 as I already understood is the transmitter 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.560
 which I ordered for interest well then 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.610
 there is to see what it really is 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.320
 deed and test it in action so 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:35.580
 the more difficult it is to take off 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:42.400
 one hand and open one hand hard 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:45.850
 so now open so here so he is good 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.750
 this transmitter is packed 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.560
 insert into the phone and broadcast by 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.060
 radio channel music to any of the receiver 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.340
 Well, in principle, you can leave not 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.420
 only phone to any device 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.730
 which makes sounds rather not from everyone 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.500
 and which has a linear audio output 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.530
 or headphone output 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.780
 stick this pin in the connector 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.749
 headphones and get what the audio signal 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.020
 converted to radio frequency and can 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:25.439
 to be taken by any method here 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.340
 the bundle is about usb cable 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.409
 transmitter 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.310
 so we will continue to consider 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.960
 such a heaven enough interesting device 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.350
 which transmits sound to the radio purity and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.710
 with which you can broadcast 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:49.580
 the sound on the radio that is what 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.039
 he can come in handy he can come in handy 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.500
 those who are good enough 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:59.420
 radio but the entrance under the flash drive is not and no 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.819
 opportunities to play various mp3 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.399
 files and here we connect this one 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:11.690
 device to the phone for example like this 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:14.530
 here we stick it in and broadcast the sound already 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.260
 but on the receiver of this monitors 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.739
 that's how it can still be useful 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.180
 for example you tortured 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.269
 the driver of the same bus itself with its 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.239
 chances enabled tuned to frequency and 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.769
 interrupt him muzon which he takes 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.109
 this radio so to check 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.269
 health from this let's ka 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.390
 I'll show you again what it is 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:45.549
 Here's a pin about a chick that is stuck 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.670
 in the audio output connector button of 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.040
 turn on 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.400
 then immediately show the purity on which he 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.579
 working right here in the right corner 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.459
 Charging is shown but also the inscription that in 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.000
 megahertz from everything is transmitted with right 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.970
 the end of the drive under the micro usb 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.630
 there is a connector for charging 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.380
 need kit comes wesby cable like me 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.560
 already showed well and it charges 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:19.250
 quite a short time only 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.730
 what I noticed here is not a good thing 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.500
 not quite the right indicator 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.730
 charging full 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.639
 stuck it somewhere or a cold 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.970
 turn on and immediately one division disappears 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:34.940
 that this is an indicator or battery error 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.370
 so quickly I sit down and did not understand but in 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.590
 In principle, it works long enough 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.200
 probably consumes not very much and 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.959
 so you can use it 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.500
 Such a film was originally glued but I 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.260
 did not do won not get lost like this 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.739
 what let's get normal now I'm 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.409
 show by example 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.730
 playing with the phone now with this and 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.939
 broadcasting from the speakers in such a 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.110
 which is worth the radio like him 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:13.370
 Transmits sound so we insert now in 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:16.130
 Chicago phone is included here 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.030
 displayed frequency that can 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.729
 change now show the least 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.539
 how much more than we get 108 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:29.030
 hertz itself less than 8 7 and a half but you 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.340
 now put on 88 megahertz so she 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.659
 anywhere the court did not coincide with anything and 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:40.580
 turn on from muzonchik see how he is there 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:42.770
 that broadcasts free to include 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.530
 me youtube not blocked went off 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.030
 music is played 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.150
 the transmitter is broadcasting something there now 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:57.520
 turn on breakdown try to catch what 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:59.849
 He transmits there caught 8 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.849
 hedgehogs lets 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.190
 then leaves 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.529
 back returns everything is normal to play 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.340
 very quiet 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:24.710
 and normal enough such 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.710
 the car will be amazingly all arranged 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:37.740
 otherwise youtube will block me so 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:42.319
 This device is so normal brothers 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.809
 well, and in general it is not expensive 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:48.360
 eccentric 230 rubles it on ebay bro 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:55.159
 Now this seller has it in stock 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:06:00.089
 No, you can see of course in the store 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:02.339
 Well, or choose a similar thing on that 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.080
 same ebay from another seller 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:06.689
 we took the seller from whom 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.249
 adequate is quite possible in his 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.129
 the store still has such 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:15.649
 but you need to look like I have a snapshot 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:18.509
 already gone far and the link is gone 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:20.819
 so I'm probably throwing a reference on 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:24.080
 this seller and it is quite possible that 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.509
 there is everyone so long everyone thanks 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.689
 watch my video put huskies well and 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.719
 order normal things in chinese 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.719
 stores
