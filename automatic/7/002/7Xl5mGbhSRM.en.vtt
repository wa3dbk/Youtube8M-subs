I think that it it totally Arkin's to
the<00:01:06.360> universe<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.939> it's<00:01:08.939> also<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the universe I think that it's also a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.080 
the universe I think that it's also a
big<00:01:09.990> fu<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.040> board<00:01:11.280> players<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.700> trying

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that as an upgrade it really does help

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.730

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
little bit mix it doesn't necessarily

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.090 
little bit mix it doesn't necessarily
take<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> bite<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> but
