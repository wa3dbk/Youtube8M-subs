00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.020 
the roof of it and brother brother will
help<00:05:05.980> me<00:05:06.160> we'll<00:05:06.310> get<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.990> off<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.290> truck

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.100 

because<00:05:13.030> everybody<00:05:13.330> says<00:05:13.600> it's<00:05:13.780> in<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:13.990> way

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
because everybody says it's in the way

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.750 
because everybody says it's in the way
when<00:05:14.590> you<00:05:14.680> go<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.800> pull<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.070> engine<00:05:15.310> out

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
when you go to pull the engine out

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.720 
when you go to pull the engine out
I'm<00:05:16.090> guessing<00:05:16.570> pull<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.530> straight<00:05:17.650> up<00:05:17.830> they

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
I'm guessing pull it straight up they

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.310 
I'm guessing pull it straight up they
ought<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:18.940> be<00:05:19.120> in<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.240> way<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:19.900> be<00:05:20.020> hard<00:05:20.260> to

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
ought to be in the way and be hard to

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.990 
ought to be in the way and be hard to
pull<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:23.070> mean<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.250> looks<00:05:24.460> like<00:05:24.520> Kokomo

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
pull it I mean it looks like Kokomo

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.620 
pull it I mean it looks like Kokomo
straight<00:05:25.570> uh<00:05:25.600> about<00:05:26.140> an<00:05:26.290> idea<00:05:26.910> I'll<00:05:27.910> figure<00:05:28.510> it

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
straight uh about an idea I'll figure it

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.180 
straight uh about an idea I'll figure it
out<00:05:28.780> when<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:28.990> use<00:05:29.110> there<00:05:29.350> I<00:05:29.380> mean<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:29.980> gonna

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
out when I use there I mean it's gonna

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.510 
out when I use there I mean it's gonna
be<00:05:30.460> tight<00:05:31.560> I've<00:05:32.560> done<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.010> measurements<00:05:33.460> from

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
be tight I've done the measurements from

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.600 
be tight I've done the measurements from
the<00:05:33.610> back<00:05:33.820> of<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.060> engine<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.570> front<00:05:34.870> and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
the back of the engine to the front and

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.400 
the back of the engine to the front and
from<00:05:36.610> up<00:05:36.940> there<00:05:37.510> to<00:05:38.130> right<00:05:39.130> up<00:05:39.280> to<00:05:40.260> where<00:05:41.260> this

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
from up there to right up to where this

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.650 
from up there to right up to where this
AC<00:05:41.950> line<00:05:42.550> is<00:05:42.790> which<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.090> might<00:05:43.270> end<00:05:43.480> up<00:05:43.540> putting

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
AC line is which I might end up putting

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.910 
AC line is which I might end up putting
a<00:05:43.810> piece<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.050> plywood<00:05:44.200> in<00:05:44.440> there<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:44.770> don't

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
a piece of plywood in there so I don't

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.350 
a piece of plywood in there so I don't
actually<00:05:45.070> hit<00:05:45.400> it<00:05:47.460> it's<00:05:48.460> gonna<00:05:48.850> be<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.120> close

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
actually hit it it's gonna be a close

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.850 
actually hit it it's gonna be a close
one<00:05:49.420> to<00:05:49.690> get<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:49.900> out<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.290> people<00:05:50.440> are<00:05:50.650> right
