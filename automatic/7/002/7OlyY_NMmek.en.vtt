 the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.670

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.160

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.180
 we have the focus this focus is subject 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.110

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.010
 in case it does not fit well we have 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.760

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.890

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.580
