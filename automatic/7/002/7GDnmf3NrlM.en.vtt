2001 and this says it's a 1001 amp
I<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.900> either<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.500> right<00:00:31.740> but

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
I don't think either one is right but

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.360 
I don't think either one is right but
let's<00:00:32.250> find<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> dyno<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> first<00:00:35.160> off

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
let's find out on the dyno so first off

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.549 
let's find out on the dyno so first off
we'll<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> certified<00:00:36.270> run<00:00:38.030> 4<00:00:39.030> ohms<00:00:39.210> each<00:00:41.210> amp

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
we'll do a certified run 4 ohms each amp

power

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.160 

it's<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.259> lands<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> wind<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.960> not

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it's like lands are for the wind but not

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's like lands are for the wind but not
that<00:01:22.560> much<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.100> win<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:25.670> nowhere<00:01:26.670> near<00:01:27.000> its

so<00:01:34.040> let's<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:37.430> try<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> 2<00:01:38.970> ohm<00:01:40.130> start

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so let's go back and try a 2 ohm start

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.789 
so let's go back and try a 2 ohm start

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
so alright so after the dyno test we

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.280 
so alright so after the dyno test we
decided<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.829> use<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.610> AMM<00:02:32.060> one<00:02:32.269> with<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> 4<00:02:33.079> ohm

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
decided to use the AMM one with a 4 ohm

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.500 
decided to use the AMM one with a 4 ohm
subwoofer<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.610> can<00:02:34.760> see<00:02:34.970> here<00:02:35.209> with<00:02:35.390> the

subwoofer you can see here with the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.190 
subwoofer you can see here with the
pyramid<00:02:35.989> we<00:02:36.260> got<00:02:36.670> 217<00:02:37.670> watts<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
pyramid we got 217 watts and with the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.880 
pyramid we got 217 watts and with the
lands<00:02:39.560> are<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:39.829> got<00:02:40.090> 299<00:02:41.090> watts<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:41.900> hope<00:02:42.769> you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
lands are we got 299 watts so hope you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.949 
lands are we got 299 watts so hope you
