00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.180
 Yes, I mean , let's try to pull that little solo guitar again today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.300
 I think 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:19.939
 The music piece is called but it is old but it is a good song by Otsuka Ai 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.020
 I only know about the plantarium and cherry blossoms in the song of using the planetarium 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.660
 But 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.740
 Plaintive melody this something sister of that planetarium 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.180
 Melody that invites a little beautiful tears out of the story 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.750
 Right 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:40.240
 Hey 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:45.410
 The contents of the lyrics are a little painful or important people are gone 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:50.079
 Kedomo ne variety but it is I think that the singing probably also come head I can the company 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.930
 Only Kana of the fact I that four days ago in April 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.780
 That Well Kedomo Is not it possible to say such a thing 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.850
 I kept it for 13 years 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.850
 I love that dog too 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 The morning on the first day of April has been a little gone 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 I wonder what 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 Until now I'm also 30,637 but I've been living for 37 years and I guess it's just like that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:24.130
 It is said that it is sad phase or say goodbye with people, but still it is relatives or anything within the house 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.180
 Well Toka oh well with Grandma Toka this grandpa Toka your grandpa 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.370
 I'm gone, but 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.050
 It may be an unscrupulous way, but it is one in my life 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:40.760
 It came to the general kick ass 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:46.700
 After all 13 years is not that one's own child, but also it feels like Imasho 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.960
 But there are also together to Tteyuu his pet loss by I damaged another other for the first time it 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.290
 I feel like I understand 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.890
 In Kedomo I think that people also are full of suffering from it 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.920
 I 2 days it has Shikotama mainland about two days 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.570
 It became like a waterfall 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:11.000
 In Well now Upon exiting the Well I forever talking about because I no longer ginger that 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.930
 After all, I think that it is correct that dog monneun is right, and let's try to keep good spirits 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.549
 I'm talking in my family but 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.880
 But even wonder if pet loss and one of the feelings a little understood 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:26.540
 Hmm 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.490
 In the end of the night when the planter's staff happened to be missing, there are many snacks at the end of the night 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.150
 If you go to buy 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.870
 That flowed convenience store day 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:42.450
 On the spot that I thought what that it breaks down crying and Japan 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.319
 Well , today I see that plastic board flow is going to dedicate a little bit to my dog 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.069

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:53.359

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:58.470
 By'm got caught in there a little Toka unreasonable is it fingering 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:00.180
 Well Well Datte only tried a little this way and it by ear but I know my arrangements 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.770
 In that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.250
