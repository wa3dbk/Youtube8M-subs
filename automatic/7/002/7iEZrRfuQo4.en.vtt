00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
think that they wouldn't do that so it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.459 
think that they wouldn't do that so it
wasn't<00:01:56.759> really<00:01:57.030> an<00:01:57.149> unexpected<00:01:57.780> thing<00:01:58.079> are

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
wasn't really an unexpected thing are

wasn't really an unexpected thing are
you<00:01:58.619> very<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.040> expecting<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you very much expecting them to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
once that it doesn't really have a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.119 
once that it doesn't really have a
lasting<00:02:20.060> effect<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.569> me<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.709> games<00:02:21.950> that

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
lasting effect on me the games that

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.770 
lasting effect on me the games that
meant<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.430> most<00:02:22.549> to<00:02:22.730> me<00:02:22.849> were<00:02:23.239> red<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.599> blue

which<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.349> one<00:02:24.499> of<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.650> reasons<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.069> really

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
which is one of the reasons I really

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.289 
which is one of the reasons I really
really<00:02:25.879> loved<00:02:26.150> leaf<00:02:26.450> green<00:02:26.750> but<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:28.299> don't
