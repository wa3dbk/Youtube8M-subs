00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello dear friends with you block 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.330
 auto mps 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:13.290
 I am Igor Sirin and I drive slightly 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:16.220
 updated mazda cx-5 find out it is stable 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.770
 it won't be easy for you outside 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 be sure to look closely 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.019
 horizontal lamella on radiator 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 lattice be sure to look at 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.779
 Salon in particular appeared here like 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.920
 soft plump lining which is not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.100
 lacked a little changed setting 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.489
 multimedia 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 all the differences are exceptional nuances 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.140
 changed the form selector automaton me 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.079
 there was a separate switch which 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.879
 includes sport mode and in addition 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.090
 there is a manual switch 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 full of happiness might not suffice 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.100
 paddles but their boots x 5 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.360
 you can not order even for extra charge 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.300
 the fact that we have a car in maximum 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.280
 complete set 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 active city stop system is provided 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.530
 which itself can slow down the car 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119
 at low speeds 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.869
 road marking control for 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.780
 dead zones rear view camera 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.909
 slightly modified insulation are those 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.189
 little things fans should find 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.509
 previous cx-5 just people who 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.479
 love mazda and they understand that they 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.729
 took care look at cx-7 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.610
 it was divinely beautiful 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.720
 car but it turned out enough 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 heavy 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.350
 not too spacious but thanks 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 powerful motor surprisingly fast but 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.630
 while gluttonous when he appeared 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.420
 cx-5 creators were quite complicated 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.850
 the job was important for them to get a car 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.869
 with similar ride quality the same 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.329
 exactly the same perfectly controlled but 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.979
 while a demolish in less powerful 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.500
 motor in 1 went to lower 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.429
 fuel consumption and honestly do not cook 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.510
 needed 240 strong car segment 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.569
 crossovers you are surprised but not enough for everyone 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.569
 This failed the basic version with motor 2 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.239
 liter 150 horsepower I have a little 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.629
 more powerful 2-bedroom task 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:29.430
 that 92 strength is absolutely enough 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.340
 ordinary poison is not your one and a half to two thousand 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.319
 revolutions and I completely miss no 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.930
 no complaints about the dynamics of this 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.530
 car while fuel consumption at 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.349
 quiet ride fit in seven seven 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.530
 and a half liters and despite all 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.780
 fears that risk creators had 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.599
 active motor with increased degree 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.040
 compression engine works fine 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.420
 our fuel and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.780
 and strangers who are reseeding from cx-7 to 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.569
 cx-5 already managed to roll more than two hundred 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.409
 thousand kilometers never collided 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.510
 with problems with fuel quality let's say 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.409
 with the problems of the fact that this engine is not 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.780
 wants to digest domestic fuels 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.700
 motor works great 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.280
 have established themselves including 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.650
 reliability plan is also great to work 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.950
 new 6-speed gearbox 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.560
 which cx exactly apply 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.519
 despite the reduction in external dimensions 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.150
 in the cabin five more spacious than the shop was 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:40.680
 7 increased trunk and even became easier 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.750
 the car that always always goes to him 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.430
 favor 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.709
 trunk volume are you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.569
 relatively modest in contemporary 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:54.769
 standards 400 3 liters but they can be easily 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.919
 markedly noticeable increase for this 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.919
 the trunk 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:03.470
 special levers are provided 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:06.440
 so it increases to 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.200
 one and a half cubic meters 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.890
 backseat here is exactly as much as 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.430
 need for mid-size car 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.440
 with my knees I do not rest my feet 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.000
 the tunnel is placed not too big but 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.300
 cross your legs 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.090
 do not give the ceiling to the head 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.729
 there is a central armrest and when 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.599
 desired central including seat 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.030
 can be folded 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.800
 before the formation of a completely flat sex 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.379
 pine same he got if you fold 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.840
 all seats are the only maximum possible 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:41.360
 would quibble this lack 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.400
 ventilation or asus and for example preheating 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.780
 rear seats that are in some 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.389
 competitor I myself was a long time 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.280
 I was the owner of Mazda Six 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.720
 the first generation who bought almost 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.750
 ten years ago 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.569
 I just really liked how mazda 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.449
 It looks like I'm sorry that now is new 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.319
 The six in Russia remained only with 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.280
 sedan 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:10.699
 not the most convenient option and it is cx-5 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.879
 It seems to me a worthy alternative is not 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.419
 only crossovers but also family 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:19.539
 car people who want to get 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.800
 universal in every sense of the car 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.770
 look at him quite decent 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.599
 dynamics are very modest fuel consumption 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.960
 even with a 2 shift engine 77 liter plans 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.849
 liters of gasoline I fit without much 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.550
 labor and both on the highway and in 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.800
 city this machine with a gun with a full 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.400
 driven with the heaviest 19-inch 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.930
 wheels with the highest possible set 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.830
 electric sheep driver 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.660
 armchairs a great deal all that 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.140
 may need a city 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.850
 mobile middle class electronic mass 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.810
 more often with which part is needed 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.190
 honestly in my opinion absolutely 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.320
 extra 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:10.890
 For example, the number of extra options I would attribute 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:13.620
 19-inch wheels yes take off the cx-5 rides 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.640
 cool but even on standard 17 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.070
 inch wheels 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.430
 I have no control over cx-5 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.410
 absolutely no complaints proper 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.630
 well tuned chassis honest 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.090
 independent rear suspension and strut 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:32.820
 mcpherson front allow you to drive on 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.810
 asphalt and even in the middle gouging 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.080
 sti country road 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.330
 famously enough despite the large 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.570
 ocean oshima for new wheels would be 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.560
 even better all-wheel drive him rather for 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:48.900
 sure to start in the winter on 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.290
 slippery coating but either sneak 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.450
 somewhere to the dacha settlement hardly 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.400
 more serious not for this car then 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.710
 it's better to look serious 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.710
 SUVs or large pickup 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:06.019
 at first glance it may seem that 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:09.169
 cx-5 there is absolutely no uniqueness 

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:12.199
 and it is no different from most 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.869
 crossovers on the market however look 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.549
 removed almost no one left 

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:19.339
 honest automatic transmissions 

00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:23.269
 which is optimal for the city 

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:24.889
 and for country driving and even for rare 

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:27.919
 off-road outings 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:30.969
 because the variators and even more so 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:34.399
 clutch boxes 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:34.999
 significant not resistant to serious 

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:40.219
 loads 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:43.189
 mazda has kept honestly and automatic and 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:45.469
 Of course for me the main value of cx-5 

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:48.469
 it is of course controllability this feeling 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:52.039
 car no crossover in this 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:55.909
 price range in this class so 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:08:00.049
 nice not going to have a nice day yet 

00:07:55.909 --> 00:08:05.049
 and look for new issues on site out 

00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:05.049
 mts.ru or in our blog youtube
