have<00:00:00.539> you<00:00:00.630> have<00:00:00.900> you<00:00:00.989> played<00:00:01.170> with<00:00:01.199> set<00:00:01.860> linear

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
have you have you played with set linear

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.720 
have you have you played with set linear
velocity<00:00:02.970> at<00:00:03.030> all<00:00:03.120> like<00:00:03.540> like<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.110> get<00:00:04.730> yeah

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
velocity at all like like to get yeah

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.700 
velocity at all like like to get yeah
it's<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.000> great<00:00:06.180> way<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.390> handle<00:00:06.720> physics<00:00:07.589> if

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
it's a great way to handle physics if

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.169 
it's a great way to handle physics if
you<00:00:07.799> don't<00:00:07.980> want<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.519> transition

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
you don't want to have to do transition

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.680 
you don't want to have to do transition
to<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:10.290> simply<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:11.179> forceful<00:00:12.179> push

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
to just simply do a forceful push

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.930 
to just simply do a forceful push
basically<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:13.740> you're<00:00:13.889> doing<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
basically is what you're doing for the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.369 
basically is what you're doing for the
character<00:00:15.299> you're<00:00:15.480> giving<00:00:15.690> them<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.929> push<00:00:16.139> off

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
character you're giving them a push off

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.510 
character you're giving them a push off
and<00:00:16.710> then<00:00:17.670> using<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:19.340> gravity<00:00:20.340> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
and then using the the gravity of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.240 
and then using the the gravity of
physics<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.660> handle<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.020> rest<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
physics to handle the rest of it you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.439 
physics to handle the rest of it you
don't<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.580> keep<00:00:23.730> track<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> anything

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
don't have to keep track of anything

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.029 
don't have to keep track of anything
after<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.750> now<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:25.740> would<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
after that now what would be the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.519 
after that now what would be the
difference<00:00:26.369> between<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.970> mean<00:00:27.529> you've

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
difference between I mean you've

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.080 
difference between I mean you've
mentioned<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.099> transition<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.789> couple<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
mentioned to transition to a couple of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.700 
mentioned to transition to a couple of
times<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.480> why<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:31.019> would<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
times so why what would be the the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.220 
times so why what would be the the
benefit<00:00:32.040> over<00:00:32.189> doing<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.550> over<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> other

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
benefit over doing one over the other

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.840 
benefit over doing one over the other
set<00:00:34.230> linear<00:00:34.649> velocity<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> allow

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
set linear velocity is going to allow

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
set linear velocity is going to allow
other<00:00:36.360> physics<00:00:36.899> happenings<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> continue<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
other physics happenings to continue to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.869 
other physics happenings to continue to
impact<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.629> environment<00:00:40.190> whereas<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
impact the environment whereas the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760 
impact the environment whereas the
transition<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> try<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

complete<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.309> entire<00:00:44.399> transition<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.480> said

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
complete the entire transition if I said

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.010 
complete the entire transition if I said
move<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.590> Y<00:00:47.190> location<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.000> 10<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> Y

pushes whatever is going on can continue
to<00:01:11.880> happen<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.750> good<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> handle<00:01:13.530> this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to happen it's a good way to handle this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.310 
to happen it's a good way to handle this
kind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.400> event<00:01:14.490> okay<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.689> oh<00:01:15.810> okay<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
kind of an event okay so from oh okay I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
kind of an event okay so from oh okay I
got<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.060> again<00:01:18.439> set<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> linear<00:01:19.770> velocity

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
got you so again set of linear velocity

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.499 
got you so again set of linear velocity
really<00:01:20.640> sounds<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.240> physics<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:23.369> know

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
really sounds like of physics you know

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.960 
really sounds like of physics you know
is<00:01:24.509> using<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.049> physics<00:01:25.580> engine<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.110> push<00:01:28.110> off

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
is using the physics engine to push off

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.520 
is using the physics engine to push off
right<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.780> makes<00:01:30.960> sense<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.409> you're

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
right so so that makes sense that you're

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.870 
right so so that makes sense that you're
just<00:01:31.680> saying<00:01:31.860> hey<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.189> gonna<00:01:32.310> push<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
just saying hey I'm gonna push you in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
just saying hey I'm gonna push you in
this<00:01:33.030> direction<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.020> whatever<00:01:34.350> happens

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this direction and then whatever happens

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
this direction and then whatever happens
after<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
after that is just you know it's just

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.370 
after that is just you know it's just
physics<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.990> what<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.049> gonna<00:01:40.140> say

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
physics right so right what we gonna say

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
physics right so right what we gonna say
it<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.579> ask<00:01:41.909> Brian<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.570> question<00:01:44.329> this

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it I was gonna ask Brian a question this

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.910 
it I was gonna ask Brian a question this
I<00:01:45.630> mean<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:45.990> an<00:01:46.079> interesting<00:01:46.200> question<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I mean it's an interesting question you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.580 
I mean it's an interesting question you
raised<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.090> mixing<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> transition

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
raised the mixing of the transition

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.730 
raised the mixing of the transition
library<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:51.380> physics<00:01:52.380> movement<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> um<00:01:55.530> he

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
library with physics movement and um he

this<00:02:05.490> discussion<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:08.149> used<00:02:09.149> both<00:02:09.899> physics

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this discussion but I used both physics

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.229 
this discussion but I used both physics
and<00:02:10.619> transitions<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.370> different<00:02:11.760> parts<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
and transitions for different parts of

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.790 
and transitions for different parts of
the<00:02:12.360> movement<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.050> originally<00:02:13.530> I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the movement so originally I

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.500 
the movement so originally I
to<00:02:14.040> use<00:02:14.190> physics<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> gem<00:02:15.240> drops<00:02:16.040> but

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
to use physics for the gem drops but

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.690 
to use physics for the gem drops but
box2d<00:02:18.510> has<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> sort<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.770> little<00:02:20.310> bounciness

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
box2d has a sort of a little bounciness

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.540 
box2d has a sort of a little bounciness
to<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.210> even<00:02:21.510> when<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.750> set<00:02:22.230> bounce<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.160> not

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
to it even when you set bounce to it not

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.730 
to it even when you set bounce to it not
bouncing<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.210> like<00:02:24.630> compression<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
bouncing but like compression of the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.620 
bouncing but like compression of the
bodies<00:02:26.070> if<00:02:26.370> they<00:02:26.580> drop<00:02:26.820> on<00:02:27.000> top<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.330> each<00:02:27.420> other

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
bodies if they drop on top of each other

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.080 
bodies if they drop on top of each other
and<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:28.740> wasn't<00:02:29.160> happy<00:02:29.490> with<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.060> I

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and I just wasn't happy with that so I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.660 
and I just wasn't happy with that so I
mixed<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.930> did<00:02:31.530> some<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.800> my<00:02:31.920> movements<00:02:32.520> with

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
mixed and did some of my movements with

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.430 
mixed and did some of my movements with
transitions<00:02:33.270> which<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.290> can

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
transitions which you are you can

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.310 
transitions which you are you can
control<00:02:34.860> very<00:02:35.360> specifically<00:02:36.360> yeah<00:02:37.080> very

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
control very specifically yeah very

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.340 
control very specifically yeah very
precise<00:02:37.740> control<00:02:37.950> over<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:39.570> specific<00:02:39.810> amount

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
precise control over a specific amount

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.490 
precise control over a specific amount
of<00:02:40.500> time<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:42.090> what<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.270> wanted<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.660> say<00:02:42.870> was<00:02:43.110> is

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
of time but what I wanted to say was is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.460 
of time but what I wanted to say was is
if<00:02:44.430> somebody<00:02:44.850> who's<00:02:45.510> loosing<00:02:45.960> killer<00:02:46.230> says

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
if somebody who's loosing killer says

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.290 
if somebody who's loosing killer says
well<00:02:46.770> I've<00:02:47.040> got<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.430> game<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.030> I've<00:02:48.120> got

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
well I've got this game and I've got

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.780 
well I've got this game and I've got
complicated<00:02:48.720> movements<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.710> some<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.580> them

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
complicated movements and some of them

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.360 
complicated movements and some of them
are<00:02:51.660> very<00:02:51.780> straightforward<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.980> other<00:02:53.160> ones

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
are very straightforward and other ones

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.180 
are very straightforward and other ones
I<00:02:53.550> want<00:02:53.790> them<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.120> be<00:02:54.300> controlled<00:02:54.870> by<00:02:55.190> physics

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
I want them to be controlled by physics

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.930 
I want them to be controlled by physics
or<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.640> want<00:02:57.210> them<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:58.520> what<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.760> what's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
or I want them to be what is it what's

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.550 
or I want them to be what is it what's
the<00:03:00.090> word<00:03:00.120> I'm<00:03:00.390> looking<00:03:00.420> for<00:03:00.690> when<00:03:01.350> something

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
the word I'm looking for when something

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.790 
the word I'm looking for when something
travels<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.310> path<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.770> affected<00:03:04.770> by

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
travels in a path and it's affected by

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.940 
travels in a path and it's affected by
gravity<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:06.800> trajectory<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.560> world<00:03:10.740> come

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
gravity it's a trajectory the world come

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.860 
gravity it's a trajectory the world come
to<00:03:11.040> me<00:03:11.160> afterwards<00:03:11.520> anyway<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.210> point<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.570> is

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
to me afterwards anyway the point is is

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.740 
to me afterwards anyway the point is is
you<00:03:13.800> can<00:03:13.860> pause<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.640> physics<00:03:15.030> engine<00:03:15.150> any

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
you can pause the physics engine any

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.110 
you can pause the physics engine any
time<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:16.680> use<00:03:16.950> transitions<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.910> take

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
time and then use transitions to take

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.970 
time and then use transitions to take
over<00:03:18.420> part<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.810> movement<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.410> then

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
over part of the movement and then

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.270 
over part of the movement and then
unpause<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.700> physics<00:03:21.330> engine<00:03:21.480> yes<00:03:22.410> or

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
unpause the physics engine yes or

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.540 
unpause the physics engine yes or
restart<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.140> actually<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.980> got<00:03:26.459> an

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
restart it and I actually I got an

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.130 
restart it and I actually I got an

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
and whatever you know forget that just

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.349 
and whatever you know forget that just
turn<00:04:16.830> off<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.160> physics<00:04:17.519> engine<00:04:17.640> for<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.060> minute

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
turn off the physics engine for a minute

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.099 
turn off the physics engine for a minute
and<00:04:18.510> then<00:04:18.870> use<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.109> transition<00:04:19.590> yeah<00:04:20.549> I

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
and then use a transition yeah I

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.380 
and then use a transition yeah I
completely<00:04:22.109> agree
