00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.550 
brick for Spartan just gonna move him
over<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.600> see<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.990> detail<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:21.180> much

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
over so you can see the detail is much

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.720 
over so you can see the detail is much
much<00:02:23.560> better<00:02:23.800> on<00:02:24.420> Tyler's<00:02:25.420> version<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.730> yeah

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
much better on Tyler's version so yeah

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.130 
much better on Tyler's version so yeah
it<00:02:30.850> doesn't<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.330> weird<00:02:31.569> stud<00:02:31.990> on<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
it doesn't have that weird stud on the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.130 
it doesn't have that weird stud on the
back<00:02:32.349> either<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.700> that's<00:02:34.450> pretty<00:02:34.750> much<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.019> for

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
back either so that's pretty much it for

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.500 
back either so that's pretty much it for
this<00:02:35.230> review<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.860> would<00:02:36.370> highly<00:02:37.060> recommend

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
this review I would highly recommend

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.150 
this review I would highly recommend
this

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
this

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.440 
this
and<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:39.000> think<00:02:39.600> Tyler's<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.590> much<00:02:40.860> because<00:02:41.700> he

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and I think Tyler's so much because he

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.710 
and I think Tyler's so much because he
lets<00:02:43.350> me<00:02:43.500> have<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.310> figure<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.510> not<00:02:45.690> to

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
lets me have this figure for that not to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.650 
lets me have this figure for that not to
figure<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.290> torso<00:02:46.950> armor<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.970> helmet<00:02:48.330> for

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
figure the torso armor and helmet for

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.980 
figure the torso armor and helmet for
low<00:02:49.590> cost<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.610> review<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:53.630> highly<00:02:54.630> recommend

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
low cost of a review so highly recommend

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.640 
low cost of a review so highly recommend
it<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.260> I'm<00:02:55.800> not<00:02:55.980> being<00:02:56.220> biased<00:02:56.400> because<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
it and I'm not being biased because I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.380 
it and I'm not being biased because I
got<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.830> from<00:02:58.860> him<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.760> an<00:02:59.910> honest<00:03:00.210> review

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
all the reviews I do or be honest so

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.880

it's<00:03:05.490> trash<00:03:05.910> I'll<00:03:06.210> talk<00:03:07.050> bad<00:03:07.260> about<00:03:07.290> it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
it's trash I'll talk bad about it

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.330 
it's trash I'll talk bad about it
because<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.640> don't<00:03:08.700> want<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.030> let<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.540> guys

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
into bad products so yeah this is the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.180 
into bad products so yeah this is the
figure<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.460> let's<00:03:17.460> go<00:03:17.580> on<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.970> conclusion

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
figure and let's go on to the conclusion

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.440
