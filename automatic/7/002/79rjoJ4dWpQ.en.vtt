unit and to turn it on you go to the end

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.960 
unit and to turn it on you go to the end
here<00:00:24.170> in<00:00:24.320> quill<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:24.920> got<00:00:25.550> to<00:00:25.640> have<00:00:25.760> some

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
here in quill you got to have some

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.420 
here in quill you got to have some
thumbs<00:00:26.240> for<00:00:26.510> this<00:00:26.660> there<00:00:27.650> now<00:00:27.980> that's<00:00:28.220> been

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
thumbs for this there now that's been

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.009 
thumbs for this there now that's been
turned<00:00:28.670> on<00:00:28.820> now<00:00:29.449> that's<00:00:29.539> going<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.869> go<00:00:29.990> through

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
turned on now that's going to go through

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.750 
turned on now that's going to go through
like<00:00:30.619> this<00:00:31.090> self-test<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.070> it<00:00:34.070> shows<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.610> all

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
like this self-test and it shows you all

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.100 
like this self-test and it shows you all
the<00:00:35.290> LEDs<00:00:36.290> there<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:36.830> looks<00:00:37.519> like<00:00:37.670> it's<00:00:37.820> got<00:00:38.110> 87

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
the LEDs there it looks like it's got 87

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.149 
the LEDs there it looks like it's got 87
percent<00:00:39.530> battery<00:00:39.710> power<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.870> 1.1<00:00:42.530> is<00:00:42.769> the

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
percent battery power and the 1.1 is the

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.450 
percent battery power and the 1.1 is the
firmware<00:00:43.580> version<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.449> now<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:46.100> can<00:00:46.250> see

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
firmware version and now you can see

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.340 
firmware version and now you can see
that<00:00:47.299> it's<00:00:47.449> kind<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.720> pulsing<00:00:48.140> that's

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
that it's kind of pulsing that's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.469 
that it's kind of pulsing that's
indicating<00:00:48.979> that<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.400> is<00:00:49.430> sending<00:00:50.119> a<00:00:50.269> signal

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
indicating that it is sending a signal

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.149 
indicating that it is sending a signal
and<00:00:51.820> one<00:00:52.820> might<00:00:53.030> even<00:00:53.409> imagine<00:00:54.409> that<00:00:54.619> it's<00:00:54.799> in

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
and one might even imagine that it's in

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.240 
and one might even imagine that it's in
sync<00:00:55.549> here<00:00:56.239> when<00:00:56.690> it's<00:00:56.900> putting<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.619> out<00:00:57.680> and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
sync here when it's putting that out and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.280 
sync here when it's putting that out and
if<00:00:58.580> that's<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.909> case<00:00:59.089> this<00:00:59.449> is<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.629> fairly<00:01:00.049> wide

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
if that's the case this is a fairly wide

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.020 
if that's the case this is a fairly wide
pulse<00:01:01.659> signal<00:01:02.659> that<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.869> sends<00:01:03.170> out<00:01:03.460> now<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.879> go

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
pulse signal that it sends out now to go

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.650 
pulse signal that it sends out now to go
into<00:01:05.920> search<00:01:06.920> mode<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.940> just<00:01:07.970> go<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.450> top

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
into search mode you just go to the top

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.350 
into search mode you just go to the top
here<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:09.260> again<00:01:10.190> with<00:01:10.370> your<00:01:10.460> thumbs<00:01:10.790> pull

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
here and again with your thumbs pull

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.820 
here and again with your thumbs pull
those<00:01:11.630> two<00:01:11.810> arrows<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.230> then<00:01:12.350> you'll<00:01:12.530> see

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
those two arrows and then you'll see

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.770 
those two arrows and then you'll see
that<00:01:13.100> pops<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.720> now<00:01:15.550> it's<00:01:16.570> looking<00:01:17.570> and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
that pops up and now it's looking and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.310 
that pops up and now it's looking and
thinking<00:01:19.330> wow<00:01:20.330> there's<00:01:20.930> two<00:01:21.170> different

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
thinking wow there's two different

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.950 
thinking wow there's two different
signals<00:01:21.890> there<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.330> looks<00:01:23.510> like<00:01:23.690> maybe

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
signals there so it looks like maybe

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.470 
signals there so it looks like maybe
there's<00:01:24.290> two<00:01:24.710> beacons<00:01:25.250> one<00:01:25.970> that's<00:01:26.270> about

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
there's two beacons one that's about

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.240 
there's two beacons one that's about
three<00:01:26.810> meters<00:01:27.110> away<00:01:27.140> oh<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.830> can<00:01:27.980> see

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
three meters away oh and you can see

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.700 
three meters away oh and you can see
down<00:01:29.150> there<00:01:29.480> there's<00:01:29.780> two<00:01:30.140> little<00:01:30.560> guys

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
down there there's two little guys

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.860 
down there there's two little guys
laying<00:01:31.250> down<00:01:32.020> prepared<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.170> die<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.870> looks

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
laying down prepared to die and looks

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.810 
laying down prepared to die and looks
like<00:01:36.170> there's<00:01:36.590> one<00:01:37.010> signal<00:01:37.550> that<00:01:37.700> it's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
like there's one signal that it's

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.960 
like there's one signal that it's
focusing<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.570> okay<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:39.800> that's<00:01:40.010> great<00:01:40.400> if<00:01:40.610> I

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
focusing on okay so that's great if I

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.520 
focusing on okay so that's great if I
press<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.510> flag<00:01:41.810> button<00:01:42.200> here<00:01:42.409> this

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
press this flag button here this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.240 
press this flag button here this
membrane<00:01:42.890> button<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:45.080> just<00:01:45.110> marked<00:01:45.710> one<00:01:45.800> okay

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
membrane button it just marked one okay

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.649 
membrane button it just marked one okay
so<00:01:46.310> now<00:01:46.640> there's<00:01:46.909> another<00:01:47.210> one

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
so now there's another one

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.360 
so now there's another one
okay<00:01:48.530> which<00:01:49.310> we<00:01:49.610> kind<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:49.940> knew<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:51.070> it's<00:01:52.070> off

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
okay which we kind of knew and it's off

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.510 
okay which we kind of knew and it's off
to<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.909> left<00:01:53.290> now<00:01:54.290> let's<00:01:54.560> see<00:01:54.740> if<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:55.010> can<00:01:55.220> mark

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
to the left now let's see if I can mark

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.330 
to the left now let's see if I can mark
that<00:01:56.140> just<00:01:57.140> because<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.470> knows<00:01:57.920> it's<00:01:58.130> there

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
that just because it knows it's there

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.860 
that just because it knows it's there
see<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.090> only<00:01:59.120> other<00:01:59.420> one<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.600> there

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
see it's the only other one that there

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:07.630 
see it's the only other one that there
is

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.639 

now<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.819> looks<00:02:09.030> lucky<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> race<00:02:09.629> them<00:02:09.929> so

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
now it looks lucky to race them so

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.089 
now it looks lucky to race them so
here's<00:02:11.640> what<00:02:11.849> I'm<00:02:12.000> pretty<00:02:12.330> certain<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.230> can

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
here's what I'm pretty certain of I can

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.490 
here's what I'm pretty certain of I can
mark<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> first<00:02:14.819> one<00:02:15.030> again<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.569> I'll<00:02:16.319> bet

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
mark that first one again and I'll bet

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.410 
mark that first one again and I'll bet
if<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.709> get<00:02:16.920> close<00:02:17.370> enough<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.940> 5<00:02:18.180> meters

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
