00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.800 
crossing and then before the pedestrian
crossing<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.030> where<00:04:03.240> they<00:04:03.360> are<00:04:03.540> double

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
crossing that is where they are double

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.630 
crossing that is where they are double
parked<00:04:03.840> they<00:04:04.740> are<00:04:04.890> hoping<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.250> get<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.520> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
parked they are hoping to get on the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.430 
parked they are hoping to get on the
rank<00:04:05.820> about<00:04:06.150> there<00:04:06.420> causing<00:04:06.900> chaos<00:04:07.110> because

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
rank about there causing chaos because

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.809 
rank about there causing chaos because
it's<00:04:07.620> only<00:04:07.800> single<00:04:08.160> lane

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
it's only single lane

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.580 
it's only single lane
so<00:04:10.360> all<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.599> counts<00:04:10.900> are<00:04:10.959> having<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.260> part<00:04:11.439> us

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
so all the counts are having to part us

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.589 
so all the counts are having to part us
on<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.799> wrong<00:04:11.980> side<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.400> road<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:13.450> get

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
on the wrong side of the road to get

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:24.390 
on the wrong side of the road to get
past<00:04:13.840> them

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.100 

just<00:04:25.400> before<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.940> pedestrian<00:04:26.449> crossing<00:04:30.250> I

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
just before the pedestrian crossing I

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:46.189
