going to show you a lovely recipe first
of<00:00:15.320> all<00:00:15.470> I<00:00:15.680> would<00:00:16.099> keep<00:00:16.699> your<00:00:16.849> eggs<00:00:17.119> out<00:00:17.390> of<00:00:17.449> the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
of all I would keep your eggs out of the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.640 
of all I would keep your eggs out of the
fridge<00:00:18.789> mainly<00:00:19.789> for<00:00:20.119> not<00:00:20.779> just<00:00:21.020> this<00:00:21.230> recipe

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
fridge mainly for not just this recipe

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.950 
fridge mainly for not just this recipe
but<00:00:21.800> for<00:00:22.100> baking<00:00:22.670> if<00:00:23.300> you<00:00:23.480> put<00:00:23.660> them<00:00:23.779> in<00:00:23.869> the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
but for baking if you put them in the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.769 
but for baking if you put them in the
fridge<00:00:24.140> they<00:00:24.350> get<00:00:24.529> too<00:00:24.770> cold<00:00:25.100> and<00:00:25.630> they<00:00:26.630> can

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
fridge they get too cold and they can

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.800 
fridge they get too cold and they can
often<00:00:27.189> make<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:28.490> curdled<00:00:28.970> cakes<00:00:29.240> remove<00:00:29.660> like

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
often make the curdled cakes remove like

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.630 
often make the curdled cakes remove like
that<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.170> I<00:00:30.199> tend<00:00:30.410> to<00:00:30.500> keep<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.949> eggs<00:00:31.100> out<00:00:31.310> of

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
that so I tend to keep the eggs out of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.910 
that so I tend to keep the eggs out of
the<00:00:31.699> fridge<00:00:31.939> and<00:00:32.680> there<00:00:33.680> are<00:00:33.739> several

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
the fridge and there are several

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.950 
the fridge and there are several
different<00:00:34.280> ways<00:00:34.430> of<00:00:34.730> doing<00:00:35.120> soft-boiled<00:00:35.630> eggs

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
different ways of doing soft-boiled eggs

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.710 
different ways of doing soft-boiled eggs
some<00:00:36.620> people<00:00:36.950> put<00:00:37.250> them<00:00:37.430> into<00:00:37.640> cold<00:00:37.790> water<00:00:38.120> and

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
some people put them into cold water and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.410 
some people put them into cold water and
bring<00:00:38.780> them<00:00:39.020> up<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.290> boil<00:00:39.469> and<00:00:40.270> try<00:00:41.270> and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
bring them up to the boil and try and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.389 
bring them up to the boil and try and
time<00:00:41.690> them<00:00:41.930> from<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.230> time<00:00:42.500> with<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.219> water

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
time them from the time with the water

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.880 
time them from the time with the water
boils<00:00:43.880> but<00:00:44.690> if<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.870> like<00:00:45.050> me<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:45.500> walk<00:00:45.649> away

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
boils but if you like me you walk away

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.520 
boils but if you like me you walk away
from<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.340> stove<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:47.809> don't<00:00:48.020> see<00:00:48.290> when

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
from the stove and you don't see when

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.470 
from the stove and you don't see when
the<00:00:48.620> water<00:00:48.710> starts<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.219> boil<00:00:49.489> anyway<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:49.940> I

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
the water starts to boil anyway so I

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.930 
the water starts to boil anyway so I
like<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.110> boil<00:00:51.500> water<00:00:51.680> first<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.610> put<00:00:52.820> the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
like to boil water first and I put the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.810 
like to boil water first and I put the
egg<00:00:53.059> in<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.690> time<00:00:54.110> exactly<00:00:54.670> one<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
egg in and time exactly one of the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.240 
egg in and time exactly one of the
difficulties<00:00:56.420> with<00:00:56.960> boiling<00:00:57.559> eggs<00:00:57.920> to

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
difficulties with boiling eggs to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.779 
difficulties with boiling eggs to
exactly<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.059> right<00:00:59.440> doneness<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.610> all

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
exactly the right doneness is that all

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.060 
exactly the right doneness is that all
the<00:01:02.000> eggs<00:01:02.149> different<00:01:02.570> sizes<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.590> if<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:03.860> buy

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
the eggs different sizes and if you buy

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.459 
the eggs different sizes and if you buy
a<00:01:04.309> box<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.699> medium<00:01:05.119> eggs<00:01:05.299> they'll<00:01:05.929> range<00:01:06.200> from

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
a box of medium eggs they'll range from

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.459 
a box of medium eggs they'll range from
about<00:01:06.590> 55<00:01:07.249> grams<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:07.850> 75<00:01:08.359> grams<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.439> it's

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
about 55 grams to 75 grams so it's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.419 
about 55 grams to 75 grams so it's
always<00:01:10.279> slightly<00:01:10.579> in<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:11.090> exact<00:01:11.450> science

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
always slightly in in exact science

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.340 
always slightly in in exact science
so<00:01:13.729> I'm<00:01:13.819> going<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:13.999> take<00:01:14.240> what<00:01:14.810> I<00:01:14.840> think<00:01:15.170> is<00:01:15.319> a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
so I'm going to take what I think is a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.749 
so I'm going to take what I think is a
medium-sized<00:01:16.069> egg<00:01:16.719> and<00:01:18.130> I've<00:01:19.130> got<00:01:19.310> my<00:01:19.549> water

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
medium-sized egg and I've got my water

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.669 
medium-sized egg and I've got my water
boiling<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.450> want<00:01:20.569> enough<00:01:20.869> water<00:01:21.109> in<00:01:21.349> the<00:01:21.469> pan

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
boiling you want enough water in the pan

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.769 
boiling you want enough water in the pan
so<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.459> the<00:01:22.520> egg<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.849> completely<00:01:22.999> covered

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
so that the egg is completely covered

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:27.339 
so that the egg is completely covered
with<00:01:23.959> the<00:01:24.109> water<00:01:24.349> if<00:01:25.189> you've<00:01:25.729> got<00:01:26.029> an<00:01:26.359> egg<00:01:26.779> pick

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:27.349 
with the water if you've got an egg pick

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:30.249 
with the water if you've got an egg pick
you<00:01:27.619> can<00:01:27.649> just<00:01:28.179> punch<00:01:29.179> a<00:01:29.389> little<00:01:29.479> hole<00:01:29.689> in<00:01:30.169> the

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
you can just punch a little hole in the

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.199 
you can just punch a little hole in the
bottom<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.709> egg<00:01:30.859> and<00:01:31.099> that<00:01:31.549> helps<00:01:31.909> some<00:01:32.149> of

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
bottom of the egg and that helps some of

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:33.580 
bottom of the egg and that helps some of
the<00:01:32.299> air<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.840> come<00:01:33.020> out<00:01:33.079> of<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.469> egg

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
the air to come out of the egg

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.199 
the air to come out of the egg
particularly<00:01:34.459> if<00:01:34.549> they're<00:01:34.669> not<00:01:34.759> very<00:01:34.909> fresh

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
particularly if they're not very fresh

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.239 
particularly if they're not very fresh
eggs<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:35.719> far<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.229> if<00:01:36.829> you're<00:01:37.069> doing

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
eggs so far you if you're doing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:38.919 
eggs so far you if you're doing
soft-boiled<00:01:37.729> eggs<00:01:37.999> make<00:01:38.299> sure<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.599> eggs<00:01:38.779> are

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
soft-boiled eggs make sure the eggs are

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.359 
soft-boiled eggs make sure the eggs are
really<00:01:39.139> fresh<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.740> haven't<00:01:40.009> got<00:01:40.159> that

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
really fresh that you haven't got that

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.669 
really fresh that you haven't got that
air<00:01:40.609> in<00:01:40.999> there<00:01:41.619> by<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.679> water's<00:01:43.130> boiling

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
air in there by the water's boiling

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.129 
air in there by the water's boiling
quite<00:01:45.679> hard<00:01:46.009> put<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.029> eggs<00:01:47.209> in<00:01:47.419> gently<00:01:47.899> don't

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
quite hard put the eggs in gently don't

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:50.200 
quite hard put the eggs in gently don't
let<00:01:48.739> them<00:01:48.919> drop

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
let them drop

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.240 
let them drop
because<00:01:51.080> you'll<00:01:51.230> crack<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.620> shells<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.100> then

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
because you'll crack the shells and then

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.000 
because you'll crack the shells and then
half<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.670> egg<00:01:52.790> will<00:01:52.940> come<00:01:53.120> out<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.860> then

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
half the egg will come out and then

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.650 
half the egg will come out and then
we're<00:01:58.130> going<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.280> time<00:01:58.610> these<00:01:58.910> for<00:01:59.180> about<00:01:59.330> five

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
we're going to time these for about five

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.760 
we're going to time these for about five
and<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.870> half<00:01:59.900> minutes<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.020> just<00:02:03.260> keep<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
and a half minutes and just keep the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.010 
and a half minutes and just keep the
heat<00:02:04.280> underneath<00:02:04.790> them<00:02:05.180> it's<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.780> fairly

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
heat underneath them it's a fairly

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.900 
heat underneath them it's a fairly
medium<00:02:06.500> heat<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:07.160> it's<00:02:07.310> not<00:02:07.430> really

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
medium heat so it's not really

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.310 
medium heat so it's not really
ferociously<00:02:08.570> boiling<00:02:08.929> because<00:02:08.990> again

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
ferociously boiling because again

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.140 
ferociously boiling because again
that'll<00:02:10.009> make<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.250> eggs<00:02:10.429> move<00:02:10.759> around<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
that'll make the eggs move around the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.270 
that'll make the eggs move around the
pan<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.510> they'll<00:02:11.630> smash<00:02:11.959> together<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.950> crack

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
pan and they'll smash together and crack

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.210 
pan and they'll smash together and crack
the<00:02:13.520> shells<00:02:14.350> sometimes<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.590> air<00:02:15.709> coming<00:02:16.070> out

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
the shells sometimes the air coming out

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.820 
the shells sometimes the air coming out
of<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.459> shell<00:02:16.700> anyway<00:02:17.420> with<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.870> heat<00:02:18.380> makes

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
of the shell anyway with the heat makes

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.400 
of the shell anyway with the heat makes
the<00:02:19.100> air<00:02:19.280> expand<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.900> might<00:02:21.140> crack<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the air expand so it might crack the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.170 
the air expand so it might crack the
shell<00:02:21.740> but<00:02:21.980> that's<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.340> kind<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.790> luck<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
shell but that's just kind of luck the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.870 
shell but that's just kind of luck the
drawer<00:02:23.390> really<00:02:25.300> got<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.570> different<00:02:27.020> slightly

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
drawer really got to different slightly

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.110 
drawer really got to different slightly
and<00:02:28.880> sized<00:02:29.300> eggs<00:02:30.190> that's<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.370> smaller<00:02:31.670> one<00:02:31.910> so

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and sized eggs that's the smaller one so

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.010 
and sized eggs that's the smaller one so
we'll<00:02:32.239> have<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> look<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.660> see<00:02:32.720> how<00:02:32.959> that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
we'll have a look to see how that

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:48.710 
we'll have a look to see how that
compares<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:35.000> larger<00:02:35.450> one

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.750 

and<00:02:49.720> inside<00:02:50.110> have<00:02:50.380> got<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> perfectly<00:02:51.070> cooked

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
and inside have got a perfectly cooked

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
and inside have got a perfectly cooked
dippy<00:02:52.600> egg<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.960> have<00:02:53.110> with<00:02:53.350> some<00:02:53.700> soldiers<00:02:54.700> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
dippy egg to have with some soldiers and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.260 
dippy egg to have with some soldiers and
have<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> look<00:02:56.680> at<00:02:56.800> this<00:02:56.920> one

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.090 

the<00:02:59.900> same<00:03:00.140> again<00:03:00.350> with<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.590> slightly<00:03:00.770> larger

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
the same again with a slightly larger

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.030 
the same again with a slightly larger
egg<00:03:01.460> still<00:03:01.930> nice<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.230> gooey<00:03:03.440> in<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:03.800> center

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
egg still nice and gooey in the center

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.360 
egg still nice and gooey in the center
so<00:03:04.640> perfect<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:06.830> how<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.100> make

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
so perfect and that's how to make

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.710 
so perfect and that's how to make
soft-boiled<00:03:07.910> eggs

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.780
