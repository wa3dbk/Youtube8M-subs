represent notes like for example in the
key<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> C<00:00:21.480> that's<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.080> sixth<00:00:22.769> note<00:00:23.130> that's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
key of C that's the sixth note that's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.670 
key of C that's the sixth note that's
this<00:00:24.529> two<00:00:25.529> note<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.060> five<00:00:27.359> note<00:00:27.779> but

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
this two note that's the five note but

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.590 
this two note that's the five note but
the<00:00:28.710> numbers<00:00:29.220> also<00:00:29.519> represent<00:00:31.340> chords<00:00:34.370> so

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the numbers also represent chords so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.160 
the numbers also represent chords so
here's<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> three<00:00:37.140> note<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.579> three<00:00:39.270> chord

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
here's a three note but a three chord

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.940 
here's a three note but a three chord
will<00:00:41.129> involve<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.059> note<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> more<00:00:43.290> notes

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
will involve a three note and more notes

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
will involve a three note and more notes
added<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> three<00:00:45.120> note<00:00:45.329> does<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.750> make

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
added to the three note does that make

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.470 
added to the three note does that make
sense<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:48.920> here's<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> sixth<00:00:50.550> note<00:00:50.910> right

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
sense so here's the sixth note right

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
sense so here's the sixth note right
here<00:00:51.800> but<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> sixth<00:00:53.399> chord<00:00:54.090> has<00:00:55.020> notes<00:00:55.680> built

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
here but a sixth chord has notes built

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.500 
here but a sixth chord has notes built
off<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.350> sixth<00:00:58.350> note<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.300> kind

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
off of that sixth note but it can kind

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720 
off of that sixth note but it can kind
of<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.660> confusing<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.250> need<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> know

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
of get confusing you just need to know

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.630 
of get confusing you just need to know
that<00:01:03.030> when<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> say<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> number<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.799> could<00:01:04.920> also

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that when you say a number it could also

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.560 
that when you say a number it could also
represent<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.350> note<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.860> well<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> chord

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
represent the note as well as the chord

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.649 
represent the note as well as the chord
okay<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> an<00:01:11.159> example<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:12.180> how<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.450> works

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
okay and an example of how that works

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.940 
okay and an example of how that works
and<00:01:13.439> when<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.310> come<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.950> type

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and when that would come up in this type

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
and when that would come up in this type
of<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.530> know<00:01:19.560> cording<00:01:20.189> would<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
of you know cording would be when you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
of you know cording would be when you
encounter<00:01:21.990> chords<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> slash<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
encounter chords that have a slash in it

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.490 
encounter chords that have a slash in it
like<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.509> let's<00:01:24.900> say<00:01:25.070> like<00:01:26.509> one<00:01:27.509> over<00:01:28.170> three

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
like this let's say like one over three

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.609 
like this let's say like one over three
is<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.799> common<00:01:29.280> chord<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> lesson<00:01:31.439> on

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
is a common chord now I have a lesson on

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.020 
is a common chord now I have a lesson on
slash<00:01:32.070> chords<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> you'll<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
slash chords that you'll want to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.300 
slash chords that you'll want to
definitely<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.060> nutshell

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
definitely go see but in in a nutshell

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
definitely go see but in in a nutshell
the<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.850> number<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> left<00:01:42.780> represents

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the the number on the left represents

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.120 
the the number on the left represents
the<00:01:43.590> chord<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:46.110> number<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> bottom

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the chord and the number on the bottom

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.600 
the chord and the number on the bottom
or<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.119> bottom<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.960> right<00:01:49.610> represents

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
or on the bottom or the right represents

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
or on the bottom or the right represents
the<00:01:51.030> note<00:01:51.860> C<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> you'd<00:01:54.600> play<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.229> chord

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the note C so you'd play a one chord

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
the note C so you'd play a one chord
which<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.540> one<00:01:57.540> three<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.020> five<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:59.450> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
which is one three and five and you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.359 
which is one three and five and you
would<00:02:00.570> play<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.290> bass<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.920> third<00:02:02.490> note

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
would play on the bass the third note

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.599 
would play on the bass the third note
okay<00:02:05.179> so<00:02:05.570> that's<00:02:05.869> when<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.950> would<00:02:07.130> start

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
okay so that's when you would start

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.690 
okay so that's when you would start
needing<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.300> know<00:02:08.509> what<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:08.959> means

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
needing to know what this means

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.559 
needing to know what this means
also<00:02:11.620> songs<00:02:12.620> typical<00:02:13.280> worship<00:02:13.730> songs<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.390> not

also songs typical worship songs and not
just<00:02:14.930> worship<00:02:15.410> but<00:02:16.450> songs<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.690> are<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.840> major

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
just worship but songs that are in major

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.150 
just worship but songs that are in major
keys<00:02:19.180> usually<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.390> chords<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.349> are<00:02:21.500> common

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
keys usually have chords that are common

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.000 
keys usually have chords that are common
that<00:02:22.580> come<00:02:23.269> up<00:02:23.390> frequently<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.410> what<00:02:24.980> I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
that come up frequently and what I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.830 
that come up frequently and what I
wanted<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> do<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.790> tell<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.120> what<00:02:26.150> those<00:02:26.510> are

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
wanted to do is tell you what those are

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.430 
wanted to do is tell you what those are
because<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.910> should<00:02:29.209> learn<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.170> memorize

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
because you should learn and memorize

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.610 
because you should learn and memorize
these<00:02:31.010> chords<00:02:31.370> kind<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:31.879> order<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:33.319> of

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
these chords kind of in order because of

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.030 
these chords kind of in order because of
the<00:02:33.890> frequency<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.730> they'll<00:02:35.150> come<00:02:35.420> up<00:02:35.480> and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
the frequency that they'll come up and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.530 
the frequency that they'll come up and
if<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.670> you'll<00:02:37.970> be<00:02:38.150> able<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.390> get

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
if you know that you'll be able to get

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.500 
if you know that you'll be able to get
to<00:02:38.780> playing<00:02:39.019> songs<00:02:39.380> quicker<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:43.900> chords<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
to playing songs quicker so chords and

to playing songs quicker so chords and
songs<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:50.799> would<00:02:51.799> say<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:53.239> most<00:02:53.450> common<00:02:53.569> chord

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
songs I would say the most common chord

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.569 
songs I would say the most common chord
that<00:02:54.440> you're<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.829> see<00:02:55.069> is<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.370> one

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
that you're going to see is the one

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.259 
that you're going to see is the one
chord<00:02:55.910> that's<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:56.870> home<00:02:57.140> chord<00:02:57.769> okay<00:02:58.640> the

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
chord that's the home chord okay the

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.539 
chord that's the home chord okay the
song<00:02:59.540> had<00:02:59.780> only<00:02:59.989> one<00:03:00.379> chord<00:03:00.769> in<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.069> major

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
song had only one chord in it major

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.470 
song had only one chord in it major
song<00:03:02.379> it<00:03:03.379> would<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.799> one<00:03:03.950> chord<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:05.150> next

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
song it would be the one chord the next

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.050 
song it would be the one chord the next
chord<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.620> would<00:03:06.769> encounter<00:03:07.280> probably

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
chord that you would encounter probably

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.160 
chord that you would encounter probably
would<00:03:08.269> be<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.810> five<00:03:09.650> chord<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.900> then<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.019> one

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
would be the five chord and then the one

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.250 
would be the five chord and then the one
after<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.730> would<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.180> four<00:03:14.690> chord<00:03:15.049> and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
after that would be the four chord and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.590 
after that would be the four chord and
that<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.950> why<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.130> taught<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.850> one<00:03:17.090> four

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
that is why I taught you the one four

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.009 
that is why I taught you the one four
and<00:03:17.870> five<00:03:18.430> first<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.849> those<00:03:20.180> are<00:03:20.359> all<00:03:20.540> three

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
and five first and those are all three

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.690 
and five first and those are all three
major<00:03:21.440> chords<00:03:23.319> probably<00:03:24.319> after<00:03:24.590> these<00:03:25.220> three

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
major chords probably after these three

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.370 
major chords probably after these three
the<00:03:25.940> next<00:03:26.420> chord<00:03:26.750> you're<00:03:26.930> going<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.079> encounter

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
the next chord you're going to encounter

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
the next chord you're going to encounter
is<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:29.630> sixth<00:03:30.109> chord<00:03:30.410> which<00:03:30.859> is<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:31.069> minor

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
is the sixth chord which is a minor

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400 
is the sixth chord which is a minor
chord<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.959> one<00:03:33.260> five<00:03:33.919> four<00:03:34.609> six<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:36.260> know

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
chord but one five four six you know

chord but one five four six you know
there<00:03:36.859> I<00:03:37.299> mean<00:03:38.299> there's<00:03:38.810> probably<00:03:39.530> tens<00:03:40.280> of

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
there I mean there's probably tens of

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.580 
there I mean there's probably tens of
thousands<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.269> songs<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.690> just<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.230> those

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
thousands of songs that just have those

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.470 
thousands of songs that just have those
four<00:03:42.919> chords<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.489> it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
four chords in it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.220 
four chords in it
tons<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.590> worship<00:03:46.010> songs<00:03:46.310> I<00:03:46.700> would<00:03:47.480> say<00:03:47.720> you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
know half of them those are the only

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.839 
know half of them those are the only
chords<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.079> need<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.349> know<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.849> then

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
chords that you need to know and then

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.280 
chords that you need to know and then
after<00:03:53.269> six<00:03:53.599> I<00:03:53.959> would<00:03:54.950> say<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.519> two<00:03:56.109> which<00:03:57.109> is

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
after six I would say the two which is

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.039 
after six I would say the two which is
also<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.709> minor<00:03:58.069> chord<00:03:58.489> you'll<00:03:59.180> see<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.750> from

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
also a minor chord you'll see that from

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.190 
also a minor chord you'll see that from
time<00:04:00.319> to<00:04:00.470> time<00:04:00.639> okay<00:04:01.639> so<00:04:02.299> if<00:04:02.419> you<00:04:02.569> learn<00:04:02.810> these

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
time to time okay so if you learn these

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.559 
time to time okay so if you learn these
five<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.889> memorize<00:04:04.280> these<00:04:04.489> five<00:04:04.790> you're

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
five and memorize these five you're

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.839 
five and memorize these five you're
probably<00:04:05.840> going<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.200> be<00:04:06.290> able<00:04:06.349> to<00:04:06.470> play<00:04:06.650> about

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
probably going to be able to play about

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.059 
probably going to be able to play about
90%<00:04:07.849> of<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.389> modern<00:04:08.870> worship<00:04:09.200> songs<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.950> are

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
90% of the modern worship songs that are

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.089 
90% of the modern worship songs that are
out<00:04:10.190> there<00:04:11.290> alright<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.469> third<00:04:12.739> thing

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
out there alright and the third thing

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.910 
out there alright and the third thing
that<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:14.090> wanted<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.540> tell<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.019> about<00:04:15.230> using

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
that I wanted to tell you about using

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.370 
that I wanted to tell you about using
this<00:04:16.219> system<00:04:16.430> is

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
this system is

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.890 
this system is
up<00:04:17.470> until<00:04:17.680> now<00:04:17.890> we<00:04:18.880> haven't<00:04:19.239> talked<00:04:19.450> anything

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
up until now we haven't talked anything

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.520 
up until now we haven't talked anything
else<00:04:20.380> other<00:04:20.739> than<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:22.270> correct<00:04:22.750> notes<00:04:23.230> to

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
else other than the correct notes to

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.060 
else other than the correct notes to
play<00:04:23.860> for<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.580> courts<00:04:24.940> that's<00:04:25.630> it<00:04:25.900> we<00:04:26.890> didn't

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
play for the courts that's it we didn't

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.700 
play for the courts that's it we didn't
talk<00:04:27.220> anything<00:04:27.550> about<00:04:27.790> rhythm<00:04:28.450> which<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:28.900> so

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
talk anything about rhythm which is so

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.370 
talk anything about rhythm which is so
important<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.490> it's<00:04:30.790> probably<00:04:31.090> more

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
important that it's probably more

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.200 
important that it's probably more
important<00:04:32.380> than<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:33.460> courts<00:04:36.030> having<00:04:37.030> good

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
important than the courts having good

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.600 
important than the courts having good
rhythm<00:04:37.660> timing<00:04:38.230> those<00:04:38.470> things<00:04:38.800> we<00:04:39.430> also

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
rhythm timing those things we also

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.090 
rhythm timing those things we also
didn't<00:04:39.910> talk<00:04:40.030> about<00:04:40.270> dynamics<00:04:40.960> which<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.470> one

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
didn't talk about dynamics which is one

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.990 
didn't talk about dynamics which is one
of<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.250> most<00:04:42.630> powerful<00:04:44.100> tools<00:04:45.100> we<00:04:45.340> can<00:04:45.580> use<00:04:45.850> in

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
of the most powerful tools we can use in

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.540 
of the most powerful tools we can use in
worship<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:46.960> but<00:04:47.140> dynamics<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:47.980> what<00:04:48.160> moves

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
worship and but dynamics is what moves

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.850 
worship and but dynamics is what moves
people<00:04:49.110> we<00:04:50.110> didn't<00:04:50.320> talk<00:04:50.380> anything<00:04:50.560> about

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
people we didn't talk anything about

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.600 
people we didn't talk anything about
voicings<00:04:51.760> yet<00:04:52.800> we<00:04:53.800> will<00:04:54.100> get<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.460> that

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
voicings yet we will get to that

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.820 
voicings yet we will get to that
probably<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:55.240> our<00:04:55.300> next<00:04:55.690> lesson<00:04:55.900> but<00:04:56.350> that's

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
probably in our next lesson but that's

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.220 
probably in our next lesson but that's
being<00:04:57.580> able<00:04:57.730> to<00:04:57.880> play<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.210> same<00:04:58.660> chord<00:04:59.080> in

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
being able to play the same chord in

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.320 
being able to play the same chord in
multiple<00:04:59.650> different<00:04:59.800> ways<00:05:00.010> all<00:05:00.700> throughout

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
multiple different ways all throughout

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.720 
multiple different ways all throughout
the<00:05:01.510> keyboard<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.200> makes<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:03.100> sound<00:05:03.460> a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
the keyboard that makes it sound a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.790 
the keyboard that makes it sound a
little<00:05:04.000> different<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:04.870> even<00:05:05.170> fuller<00:05:05.470> and

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
little different and even fuller and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.060 
little different and even fuller and
sometimes<00:05:06.670> just<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.480> basic<00:05:07.900> way<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:08.950> we

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
sometimes just the the basic way but we

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.170 
sometimes just the the basic way but we
didn't<00:05:09.250> talk<00:05:09.370> about<00:05:09.430> any<00:05:09.850> of<00:05:09.940> those<00:05:10.120> things

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
didn't talk about any of those things

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.440 
didn't talk about any of those things
which<00:05:10.960> really<00:05:11.260> is<00:05:11.590> what<00:05:11.860> makes<00:05:12.220> music<00:05:12.640> music

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
which really is what makes music music

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.290 
which really is what makes music music
and<00:05:13.690> so<00:05:14.350> don't<00:05:14.590> think<00:05:14.860> just<00:05:15.190> knowing<00:05:15.670> this<00:05:16.090> is

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
and so don't think just knowing this is

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.360 
and so don't think just knowing this is
going<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.540> you<00:05:16.990> know<00:05:17.110> allow<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.830> master

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
going to you know allow you to master

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.280 
going to you know allow you to master
how<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.030> play<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:19.720> it's<00:05:19.810> going<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.050> sound

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
how to play and it's going to sound

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.220 
how to play and it's going to sound
great<00:05:20.650> because<00:05:21.220> it's<00:05:21.430> probably<00:05:21.820> won't<00:05:22.510> do

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
great because it's probably won't do

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.120 
great because it's probably won't do
that<00:05:23.700> you're<00:05:24.700> going<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:24.910> have<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.300> learn<00:05:26.130> not
