00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hi everyone guys according to gameplay by 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.050
 darksiders ii comment on the live e 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.370
 now I'm facing the dear one 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.750
 war and you will wonder but this 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.849
 sir is facing war 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 in fact, brethren is not war 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 boys and a war copy created by 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.369
 the great father body an old man who 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.180
 thanks to a talisman he knows all the secrets 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 and created this war copy him 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.740
 it turned into war and is there 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.140
 addressing 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.630
 we are now facing and while 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.950
 I face it I will tell you a few words a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.750
 about this game 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.510
 you need to know the kids that will be there 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:50.879
 lots of boss fight and tacen were there 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:54.239
 lots of boss fight and it's practically 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.219
 I'd like you to show me how 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.140
 all the boss fight in this game 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.270
 all the boys guys 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.600
 in my opinion, obviously without 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.640
 spoil you in this in every 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.460
 video tell you something new 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.280
 tell you some new impression of mine 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 game maybe a little colder a little more 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.960
 at hot of penn 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.240
 in this video just tell you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.420
 something about the new one 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 gdr components in this game is 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.830
 basically guys i have to say they have 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 added a gbr componentry 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.000
 quite articulated makes the game 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.100
 much more interesting and in my opinion 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.520
 in fact guys like the first one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.329
 you could see from the first video 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.430
 this much we say this 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.460
 clash here is trivial because I see that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.880
 this character is very weak 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.100
 anyway I said that they added 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 this gdr components like tv are 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 the movies you can collect 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 hammers shoulder straps how many scythe armors 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.630
 and you can really gather them 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.680
 many but many but many and this guys 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.890
 makes the game absolutely more 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.789
 more intriguing plus the real thing 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.460
 which makes this game in quotes 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.500
 gdr because it is not gdr an action however the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.930
 g.br components in my opinion is given 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.300
 almost especially from the fact that the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.450
 dead character at a leveling 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.100
 so the more you go on, the more you do 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.060
 instead they will face the more they buy 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.070
 you buy and experience points and the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.350
 character level 6 level rises 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.590
 therefore it increases life to grow 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.450
 ability all the strength and beyond 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.110
 this every level guys you go up 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.970
 death will acquire skill points e 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.970
 these skill points can be used 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.280
 to acquire new skills from one 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 sort of final fantasy style grid x a 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.100
 names so vast where they will be able indeed 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.750
 unblock these the stability which 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.160
 allende this game much more than 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.989
 euro compared to the first before was not 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.280
 absolutely will declare a classic 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.830
 action 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.080
 this is in my opinion an action with one 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.970
 very small dietary components 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.100
 for this video guys all there 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.780
 I thank you, however, they have seen I greet you 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.890
 I leave you at the end of the dexter video 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.890
 it's all goodbye
