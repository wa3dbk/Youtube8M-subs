the<00:04:19.989> trick<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.530> now<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.609> expand<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.270> beyond<00:04:22.570> 13

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
the trick is now to expand it beyond 13

will need 50 vehicles they'll have more

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.790 
will need 50 vehicles they'll have more
