00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
going to be difficult but I had a little
bit<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.069> experience<00:02:14.490> doing<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.030> CGI<00:02:15.390> stuff

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
for the movie called Ted and then I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.960 
for the movie called Ted and then I
realized<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.930> prefer<00:02:19.650> working<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.160> CGI
