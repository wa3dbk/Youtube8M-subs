always<00:00:26.630> delete<00:00:27.199> are<00:00:27.589> all<00:00:28.579> the<00:00:28.970> application

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:29.569 
always delete are all the application

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:31.419 
always delete are all the application
because<00:00:30.050> sometimes<00:00:30.409> applications<00:00:31.009> leave

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
because sometimes applications leave

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.819 
because sometimes applications leave
small<00:00:31.789> files<00:00:32.090> behind<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.689> stuff<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.710> if<00:00:33.770> you
