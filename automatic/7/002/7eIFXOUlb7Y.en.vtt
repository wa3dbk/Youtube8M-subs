00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.679 

make<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.279> any<00:00:20.550> color<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.270> doesn't<00:00:21.449> really

okay<00:00:58.600> now<00:00:59.600> up<00:01:00.410> here<00:01:01.210> hit<00:01:02.210> f4<00:01:02.870> on<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.739> actual

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
okay now up here hit f4 on the actual

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.280 
okay now up here hit f4 on the actual
layer<00:01:04.339> itself<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.119> drop<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:06.229> down<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.740> add

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.260 

if<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.350> go<00:01:12.530> back<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.220> white<00:01:13.399> arrow<00:01:13.640> you

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
if you go back to the white arrow you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.620 
if you go back to the white arrow you
have<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.570> ability<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:14.990> stretch<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:15.710> out<00:01:16.630> this

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
have the ability to stretch it out this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.450 
have the ability to stretch it out this
makes<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.110> nice<00:01:18.700> smooth<00:01:20.140> looking<00:01:21.140> light<00:01:21.979> for

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
makes a nice smooth looking light for

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.990 
makes a nice smooth looking light for
your<00:01:22.610> scene<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.149> can<00:01:23.479> place<00:01:23.659> anywhere<00:01:25.000> also

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
your scene you can place anywhere also

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.960 
your scene you can place anywhere also
you<00:01:26.570> can<00:01:26.780> use<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.229> make<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:27.649> little<00:01:27.970> point

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
you can use it to make like little point

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.410 
you can use it to make like little point
lights

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
lights

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.240 
lights
I<00:01:30.789> usually<00:01:31.789> boost<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.479> light<00:01:32.720> with<00:01:32.929> another

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
I usually boost this light with another

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.809 
I usually boost this light with another
another<00:01:34.250> layer<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:37.250> can<00:01:37.280> be<00:01:37.550> very

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
another layer and you can be very

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.680 
another layer and you can be very
inventive<00:01:38.149> with<00:01:38.569> that<00:01:38.750> also<00:01:38.960> like<00:01:39.560> let's<00:01:39.860> say

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
inventive with that also like let's say

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.600 
inventive with that also like let's say
you<00:01:41.690> can<00:01:41.840> go<00:01:42.050> in<00:01:42.200> here<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.530> take<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.069> one<00:01:43.369> and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
you can go in here and take this one and

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.529 
you can go in here and take this one and
duplicate<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:46.700> will<00:01:46.880> see<00:01:47.240> ctrl<00:01:47.750> V<00:01:49.420> make<00:01:50.420> it

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
duplicate it it will see ctrl V make it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:59.280 
duplicate it it will see ctrl V make it
a<00:01:50.630> little<00:01:50.869> bit<00:01:51.110> smaller

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.770 

now<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.340> see<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.670> inner<00:02:00.910> aura<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:04.450> top

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
now you can see that inner aura that top

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.280 
now you can see that inner aura that top
one

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
one

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.550 
one
if<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.650> mess<00:02:05.860> around<00:02:05.890> with<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.930> mask<00:02:07.930> let's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
if you mess around with the mask let's

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.610 
if you mess around with the mask let's
say<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.399> feathering<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:10.720> can<00:02:10.930> get<00:02:11.350> different

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
say the feathering you can get different

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.690 
say the feathering you can get different
types<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.250> auras

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.290 

you<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.880> also<00:02:16.120> mess<00:02:16.510> around<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
you can also mess around with this the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.740 
you can also mess around with this the
transform<00:02:20.280> opacity<00:02:24.030> again<00:02:25.030> different<00:02:25.540> types

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
transform opacity again different types

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:36.690 
transform opacity again different types
of<00:02:25.960> looks<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:34.110> one<00:02:35.110> more<00:02:35.350> thing<00:02:35.710> if<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.490> go

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
of looks and one more thing if you go

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.860 
of looks and one more thing if you go
into<00:02:37.030> solid<00:02:37.750> settings<00:02:38.170> for<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.070> top<00:02:39.310> one

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
into solid settings for the top one

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.120 
into solid settings for the top one
let's<00:02:40.870> say<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.170> change<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> different

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
let's say you change it to a different

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.200 
let's say you change it to a different
color<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:47.130> instead<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.250> going<00:02:48.580> into<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
color and instead of going into the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.560 
color and instead of going into the
mid-tone<00:02:50.140> range<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.459> go<00:02:51.580> into<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.120> super

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
mid-tone range you can go into the super

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.550 
mid-tone range you can go into the super
saturated<00:02:53.050> range<00:02:54.600> or<00:02:55.600> if<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.200> want<00:02:56.380> that

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
saturated range or if you want that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.310 
saturated range or if you want that
burning-hot<00:02:57.070> effect<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.940> go<00:02:59.310> over<00:03:00.310> to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
burning-hot effect you can go over to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:12.199 
burning-hot effect you can go over to
the<00:03:02.320> more<00:03:02.650> tinted<00:03:03.430> range<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.910> things

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.470 

so<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.049> lot<00:03:13.349> of<00:03:13.500> control<00:03:13.890> here<00:03:14.219> you<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.150> got<00:03:15.329> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
so a lot of control here you just got to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:24.649 
so a lot of control here you just got to
use<00:03:15.629> your<00:03:15.659> imagination<00:03:23.030> okay<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.239> like<00:03:24.510> the

mask myself now if you wanted the one to

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.030 
mask myself now if you wanted the one to
move<00:03:35.760> with<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> other<00:03:36.439> you<00:03:37.439> could<00:03:37.590> always<00:03:37.739> set

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
move with the other you could always set

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.899 
move with the other you could always set
