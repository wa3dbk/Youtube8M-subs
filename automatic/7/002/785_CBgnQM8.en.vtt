Ron<00:02:00.719> Paul<00:02:02.030> yeah<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> mean<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.659> you

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
Ron Paul yeah I mean I think it's you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.569 
Ron Paul yeah I mean I think it's you
know<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:03.899> very<00:02:04.170> possible<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.009> I'll<00:02:05.369> you

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
know it's very possible but I'll you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.550 
know it's very possible but I'll you
know<00:02:05.610> harken<00:02:06.060> back<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.509> fact<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.899> this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
know harken back to the fact that this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
know harken back to the fact that this
is<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.849> opinion<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.390> tough

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
is going to be in my opinion a tough

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.100 
is going to be in my opinion a tough
record<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> run<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:12.090> much<00:02:12.360> support<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
record to run on so as much support that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.000 
record to run on so as much support that
he<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.440> put<00:02:13.620> together

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
he can put together

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160 
he can put together
in<00:02:14.459> order<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.849> deliver<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.450> message<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.049> he

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
in order to deliver the message that he

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.839 
in order to deliver the message that he
wants<00:02:16.530> delivered<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:18.360> probably<00:02:18.959> not<00:02:19.849> not

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
wants delivered is probably not not

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.399 
wants delivered is probably not not
smart<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.420> his<00:02:21.450> part<00:02:21.629> it's<00:02:21.989> probably

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
smart on his part it's probably

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.490 
smart on his part it's probably
relatively<00:02:23.370> smart<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:25.170> know<00:02:25.230> when<00:02:25.470> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
relatively smart I just you know when I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.960 
relatively smart I just you know when I
look<00:02:25.739> at<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:25.980> record<00:02:26.370> from<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.640> numbers

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
look at this record from a numbers

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.319 
look at this record from a numbers
perspective<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.230> know<00:02:29.329> delivering

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
perspective I see you know delivering

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.140 
perspective I see you know delivering
worldwide<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.290> needs<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.680> take<00:02:31.709> place<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.549> see

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
worldwide that needs to take place I see

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.680 
worldwide that needs to take place I see
muted<00:02:33.569> Western<00:02:34.560> economic<00:02:34.799> growth<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.209> high

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
muted Western economic growth and a high

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.569 
muted Western economic growth and a high
unemployment<00:02:37.049> rate<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.799> quite<00:02:38.099> frankly<00:02:38.280> i

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
unemployment rate that I quite frankly i

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.089 
unemployment rate that I quite frankly i
think<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> lot<00:02:40.440> higher<00:02:40.650> than<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
think is is a lot higher than the

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.470 
think is is a lot higher than the
numbers<00:02:41.430> are<00:02:41.720> suggesting<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:45.239> know<00:02:45.329> this

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
numbers are suggesting so you know this

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.710 
numbers are suggesting so you know this
might<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:46.079> way<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.760> try<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.790> get<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.510> word

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
might be a way to try and get the word

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.099 
might be a way to try and get the word
out<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.140> street<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.739> order<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.959> get<00:02:51.959> him

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
out on the street in order to get him

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.809 
out on the street in order to get him
re-elected<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.129> you<00:02:53.190> talked<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.609> lot<00:02:53.760> about

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
re-elected so you talked a lot about

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.309 
re-elected so you talked a lot about
what<00:02:54.690> these<00:02:55.220> truth<00:02:56.220> tellers<00:02:56.879> won't<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:58.019> saying

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
what these truth tellers won't be saying

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.220 
what these truth tellers won't be saying
well<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.220> do<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.400> expect<00:02:59.430> them<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.389> to<00:03:00.930> say

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
well what do you expect them to to say

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.550 
well what do you expect them to to say
what<00:03:01.470> message<00:03:01.859> do<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.069> expect<00:03:02.400> them<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.700> grab

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
what message do you expect them to grab

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.629 
what message do you expect them to grab
it's<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.680> great<00:03:04.859> question<00:03:05.040> i<00:03:05.280> think<00:03:05.519> that

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
it's a great question i think that

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.099 
it's a great question i think that
they'll<00:03:05.790> talk<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> little<00:03:06.299> bit<00:03:06.480> about<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.870> fact

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
they'll talk a little bit about the fact

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.129 
they'll talk a little bit about the fact
that<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.409> unemployment<00:03:07.560> rate<00:03:08.040> has<00:03:08.280> come<00:03:08.370> down

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
that the unemployment rate has come down

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.500 
that the unemployment rate has come down
in<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.290> last<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.920> know<00:03:10.980> 12<00:03:11.310> months<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.849> 8.3

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
in the last you know 12 months to 8.3

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.640 
in the last you know 12 months to 8.3
percent<00:03:12.959> i<00:03:13.170> think<00:03:14.129> he'll<00:03:14.310> talk<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.639> lot<00:03:15.000> about

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
percent i think he'll talk a lot about

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.589 
percent i think he'll talk a lot about
job<00:03:16.650> growth<00:03:16.680> which<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.519> my<00:03:17.670> opinion<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.209> mostly

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
job growth which in my opinion is mostly

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.300 
job growth which in my opinion is mostly
been<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.079> public<00:03:19.260> sector<00:03:19.680> when<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.129> look

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
been in the public sector when you look

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.509 
been in the public sector when you look
deep<00:03:20.970> within<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.449> numbers<00:03:21.810> i<00:03:22.410> think<00:03:23.160> one<00:03:23.489> of

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
deep within the numbers i think one of

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.640 
deep within the numbers i think one of
the<00:03:23.730> things<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.299> know<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.379> have<00:03:25.500> to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the things that you know and you have to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.050 
the things that you know and you have to
give<00:03:25.769> credit<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:26.099> some<00:03:26.370> things<00:03:26.639> i<00:03:26.790> mean<00:03:26.940> it

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
give credit to some things i mean it

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.210 
give credit to some things i mean it
it's<00:03:27.389> not<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.599> i'm<00:03:27.750> an<00:03:27.870> obama<00:03:28.169> hater<00:03:28.530> i<00:03:28.650> think

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
it's not like i'm an obama hater i think

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.800 
it's not like i'm an obama hater i think
that<00:03:29.340> he's<00:03:29.459> done<00:03:29.609> you<00:03:30.090> know<00:03:30.209> from<00:03:30.449> from<00:03:30.690> an

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that he's done you know from from an

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.839 
that he's done you know from from an
international<00:03:31.169> perspective<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.129> reality<00:03:32.639> is

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
international perspective the reality is

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.470 
international perspective the reality is
on<00:03:33.209> his<00:03:33.569> watch<00:03:34.699> Qaddafi<00:03:35.699> has<00:03:35.790> been<00:03:36.269> eliminated

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
on his watch Qaddafi has been eliminated

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.559 
on his watch Qaddafi has been eliminated
we<00:03:37.019> have<00:03:37.199> Osama<00:03:37.590> bin<00:03:37.889> Laden<00:03:38.419> eliminated<00:03:39.419> and

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
we have Osama bin Laden eliminated and

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.720 
we have Osama bin Laden eliminated and
and<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:41.099> know<00:03:41.160> these<00:03:41.310> are<00:03:41.370> these<00:03:41.669> are

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
and you know these are these are

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.170 
and you know these are these are
important<00:03:42.629> critical<00:03:43.549> international<00:03:44.549> feats

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
important critical international feats

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.789 
important critical international feats
that<00:03:45.329> he's<00:03:45.569> accomplished<00:03:46.169> under<00:03:46.290> his<00:03:46.560> watch

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
that he's accomplished under his watch

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.400 
that he's accomplished under his watch
so<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.010> think<00:03:47.250> he'll<00:03:47.370> he'll<00:03:47.879> focus<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.569> on<00:03:48.900> some

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
so I think he'll he'll focus on on some

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.580 
so I think he'll he'll focus on on some
of<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:50.569> still<00:03:51.569> believe<00:03:51.840> he<00:03:52.019> thinks<00:03:52.260> that

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
of that I still believe he thinks that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.140 
of that I still believe he thinks that
this<00:03:52.709> Obamacare<00:03:55.010> plan<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.489> something<00:03:57.000> that

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
this Obamacare plan is something that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.920

three<00:04:52.700> years<00:04:53.000> ago<00:04:53.530> do<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:54.650> think<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:55.220> what

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
three years ago do you think that what

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.780 
three years ago do you think that what
he<00:04:56.330> has<00:04:56.540> in<00:04:56.780> place<00:04:57.050> currently<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.919> came<00:04:58.639> out

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
he has in place currently I came out

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.430 
he has in place currently I came out
with<00:04:58.940> some<00:04:58.970> budget<00:04:59.419> talks<00:04:59.630> recently<00:05:00.260> is<00:05:00.410> that

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
with some budget talks recently is that

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.430 
with some budget talks recently is that
something<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:01.220> believe<00:05:01.370> in<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.440> and

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
something that you believe in and and

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.280 
something that you believe in and and
and<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.460> think<00:05:05.150> it's<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.450> little<00:05:05.570> audacious

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
and so I think it's a little audacious

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.800 
and so I think it's a little audacious
to<00:05:06.530> think<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:07.100> it's<00:05:07.970> going<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.270> be<00:05:08.419> an<00:05:08.570> easy

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
to think that it's going to be an easy

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.070 
to think that it's going to be an easy
re-election<00:05:09.380> for<00:05:10.010> him<00:05:10.450> where<00:05:11.450> you're<00:05:11.630> correct

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
re-election for him where you're correct

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.290 
re-election for him where you're correct
and<00:05:12.350> I<00:05:12.440> think<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:12.860> he's<00:05:13.010> hoping<00:05:13.430> he<00:05:14.030> will<00:05:14.180> be

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
and I think that he's hoping he will be

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.150 
and I think that he's hoping he will be
very<00:05:14.330> effective<00:05:14.960> is<00:05:15.290> in<00:05:15.470> that<00:05:15.650> you<00:05:15.860> know<00:05:15.979> that

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
very effective is in that you know that

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.510 
very effective is in that you know that
youth<00:05:16.460> area<00:05:16.940> where<00:05:17.660> people<00:05:18.160> they<00:05:19.160> might<00:05:19.370> not

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
youth area where people they might not

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.060

of<00:05:22.190> us<00:05:22.310> older<00:05:22.700> people<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.380> he<00:05:24.380> can<00:05:24.560> be

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
of us older people and he can be

influential charismatic creative and he

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.529 
influential charismatic creative and he
definitely<00:05:27.740> can<00:05:28.220> run<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.430> rock<00:05:28.760> star<00:05:29.030> campaign

it'll<00:05:32.000> be<00:05:32.030> very<00:05:32.479> interesting<00:05:32.660> and<00:05:33.200> by<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.410> way

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
especially compared to other tactics

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.080 
especially compared to other tactics
like<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:54.080> super<00:05:54.500> PACs<00:05:54.770> that<00:05:55.190> are<00:05:55.400> being

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
like the super PACs that are being

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.140 
like the super PACs that are being
funded<00:05:56.450> very<00:05:56.930> generously<00:05:57.560> on<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.400> other<00:05:58.520> side

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
look we live in a different generation

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.100 
look we live in a different generation

with this stuff I have four and a half

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.779 
with this stuff I have four and a half
year<00:06:09.740> old<00:06:09.770> triplets<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:10.370> they're<00:06:10.520> on<00:06:10.639> the

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
year old triplets and they're on the

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.370 
year old triplets and they're on the
iPad<00:06:11.210> buzzing<00:06:11.570> around<00:06:11.690> all<00:06:11.990> these<00:06:12.139> different

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
iPad buzzing around all these different

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.050 
iPad buzzing around all these different
places<00:06:12.680> I<00:06:13.100> don't<00:06:13.520> even<00:06:13.610> know<00:06:13.789> what<00:06:13.940> they're

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
places I don't even know what they're

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.779 
places I don't even know what they're
doing<00:06:14.450> but<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:15.169> this<00:06:15.919> is<00:06:16.070> definitely<00:06:16.310> a<00:06:16.639> new

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
doing but so this is definitely a new

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.760 
doing but so this is definitely a new
generation<00:06:17.180> of<00:06:17.479> creativity<00:06:18.169> in<00:06:18.260> terms<00:06:18.470> of<00:06:18.620> how

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
generation of creativity in terms of how

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.010 
generation of creativity in terms of how
to<00:06:18.830> get<00:06:19.010> the<00:06:19.190> word<00:06:19.370> out<00:06:19.580> how<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.240> fund<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:20.840> word

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
to get the word out how to fund the word

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.129 
to get the word out how to fund the word
and<00:06:21.350> how<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:21.889> make<00:06:22.760> sure<00:06:23.030> that<00:06:23.389> the<00:06:23.600> election

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
and how to make sure that the election

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.150 
and how to make sure that the election
cycle<00:06:25.100> and<00:06:25.280> campaign<00:06:25.729> is<00:06:25.940> run<00:06:27.160> aggressively

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
cycle and campaign is run aggressively

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.100 
cycle and campaign is run aggressively
and<00:06:28.400> definitely<00:06:28.970> differently<00:06:29.510> so<00:06:29.750> it's<00:06:29.960> it's

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
and definitely differently so it's it's

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.719 
and definitely differently so it's it's
kind<00:06:30.320> of<00:06:30.380> cutting<00:06:30.620> edge<00:06:30.830> stuff<00:06:31.100> in<00:06:31.310> my<00:06:31.430> opinion

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
kind of cutting edge stuff in my opinion

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.630 
kind of cutting edge stuff in my opinion
i'm<00:06:31.940> watching<00:06:32.300> very<00:06:32.479> closely<00:06:32.950> but<00:06:33.950> again<00:06:34.159> i

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
i'm watching very closely but again i

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.670 
i'm watching very closely but again i
think<00:06:34.729> it's<00:06:34.970> going<00:06:35.090> to<00:06:35.150> be<00:06:35.240> a<00:06:35.330> tough<00:06:36.169> sell<00:06:36.470> with

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
think it's going to be a tough sell with

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.940 
think it's going to be a tough sell with
respect<00:06:37.159> to<00:06:37.280> his<00:06:37.430> wreck

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
respect to his wreck

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.920

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
unless things dramatically change before

unless things dramatically change before
