00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
never mind now I'm just gonna give some

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.180 
never mind now I'm just gonna give some
ideas<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:01.390> how<00:01:01.449> I<00:01:01.690> might<00:01:02.019> start<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.650> try<00:01:02.860> to<00:01:02.890> fix

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
ideas of how I might start to try to fix

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:12.280 
ideas of how I might start to try to fix
it

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.310 

see<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:16.970> is<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.540> biggest

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
see that right there is the biggest

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.570 
see that right there is the biggest
thing<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:21.300> can't<00:01:22.080> find<00:01:22.370> I'm<00:01:23.370> gonna

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
thing that I just can't find I'm gonna

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.540 
thing that I just can't find I'm gonna
go<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:25.320> when<00:01:25.770> she<00:01:25.979> first<00:01:26.190> feels

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
go with that but when she first feels

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.300 
go with that but when she first feels
that<00:01:26.820> pressure<00:01:27.380> whether<00:01:28.380> laterally<00:01:29.160> or

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that pressure whether laterally or

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.640 
that pressure whether laterally or
vertically<00:01:30.350> that's<00:01:31.350> her<00:01:31.680> first<00:01:32.360> inclination

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
vertically that's her first inclination

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
vertically that's her first inclination
and<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.830> I've<00:01:35.010> got<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.310> reprogram<00:01:35.760> her<00:01:36.300> say<00:01:37.050> hey

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and so I've got to reprogram her say hey

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.190 
and so I've got to reprogram her say hey
there's<00:01:37.350> no<00:01:37.470> answers<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:39.869> from

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
there's no answers up there and so from

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
there's no answers up there and so from
doing<00:01:40.380> knives<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> thousands<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> different

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
doing knives and thousands of different

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.260 
doing knives and thousands of different
scenarios<00:01:42.110> maybe<00:01:43.110> begin<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> understand

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
scenarios maybe begin to understand

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.310 
scenarios maybe begin to understand
blinking<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.390> nose<00:01:45.690> up<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> air

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
blinking that nose up in the air

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.950 
blinking that nose up in the air
whenever<00:01:46.740> she<00:01:46.920> feels<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.369> pressure

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
whenever she feels a little pressure

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
whenever she feels a little pressure
it's<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.440> answer<00:01:55.220> coming<00:01:56.220> again<00:01:56.600> oh<00:01:58.250> yeah

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's not the answer coming again oh yeah

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.040 
it's not the answer coming again oh yeah
yeah<00:01:59.640> there's<00:01:59.850> no<00:01:59.910> sense<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.210> trying<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.539> you

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
yeah there's no sense of trying to you

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.609 
yeah there's no sense of trying to you
don't<00:02:01.140> hear<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.470> frame<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:01.979> elope<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:03.619> you

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
don't hear to frame up and elope it you

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.669 
don't hear to frame up and elope it you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.770 

did<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.150> her<00:02:12.239> Richard<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
did I do that to her Richard is that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.190 
did I do that to her Richard is that
just<00:02:13.140> kind<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.379> hurt<00:02:13.500> propensity<00:02:17.540> well<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
just kind of hurt propensity well it's a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.190 
just kind of hurt propensity well it's a
little<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.739> both<00:02:19.769> what<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.939> did<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.510> what<00:02:22.049> we

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
little of both what we did and what we

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.880 
little of both what we did and what we
didn't<00:02:22.409> do

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
didn't do

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.910 
didn't do
you<00:02:23.549> know<00:02:24.200> probably<00:02:25.200> there<00:02:25.349> were<00:02:25.439> times<00:02:25.709> when

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
you know probably there were times when

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.160 
you know probably there were times when
our<00:02:26.040> timing<00:02:26.459> was<00:02:26.489> right<00:02:26.909> right<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.599> there<00:02:28.049> was

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
our timing was right right and there was

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.170 
our timing was right right and there was
a<00:02:28.200> misunderstanding<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.549> things<00:02:29.879> that<00:02:30.060> we

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
a misunderstanding and so things that we

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.770 
a misunderstanding and so things that we
did<00:02:30.439> and<00:02:31.439> then<00:02:32.099> there<00:02:32.489> was<00:02:32.640> times<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.450> she

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
did and then there was times that she

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.020 
did and then there was times that she
threw<00:02:34.439> her<00:02:34.560> head<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.950> air<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.549> didn't

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
threw her head in the air and we didn't

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.349 
threw her head in the air and we didn't
listen<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:37.379> know<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.489> proper<00:02:38.879> time<00:02:39.150> you

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
listen you know with the proper time you

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.380 
listen you know with the proper time you
feel<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:40.019> balance<00:02:40.859> so<00:02:41.159> it's<00:02:41.549> what<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
feel and balance so it's what we do and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.970 
feel and balance so it's what we do and
what<00:02:42.599> we<00:02:42.659> don't<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:45.260> mean<00:02:46.260> they're<00:02:46.379> just<00:02:46.409> horses

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
what we don't I mean they're just horses

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.670 
what we don't I mean they're just horses
and<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:48.510> know<00:02:48.599> they<00:02:48.780> were<00:02:48.870> born<00:02:49.170> with<00:02:49.349> this<00:02:49.470> in

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and you know they were born with this in

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.170 
and you know they were born with this in
their<00:02:49.769> mouths<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.730> weren't<00:02:50.879> born

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
their mouths and they weren't born

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.640 
their mouths and they weren't born
knowing<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.870> then<00:02:51.959> when<00:02:52.049> they<00:02:52.170> filled<00:02:52.379> up<00:02:52.500> in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
knowing and then when they filled up in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.619 
knowing and then when they filled up in
their<00:02:52.859> mouth<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.430> their<00:02:53.549> head<00:02:53.760> down<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.060> in

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
their mouth with their head down and in

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.410 
their mouth with their head down and in
so<00:02:55.159> either<00:02:56.159> we<00:02:56.489> have<00:02:56.519> taught<00:02:56.879> them<00:02:56.909> to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
so either we have taught them to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.530 
so either we have taught them to
understand<00:02:58.409> how<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.310> we<00:03:00.060> haven't<00:03:00.359> or

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
understand how to get or we haven't or

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.770 
understand how to get or we haven't or
we've<00:03:01.079> just<00:03:01.819> thought<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.299> works<00:03:03.540> up

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
we've just thought that it works up

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.619 
we've just thought that it works up
