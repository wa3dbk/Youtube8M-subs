00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 such a kind of face of the week I show 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.670
 Get my make-up routine all over 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.320

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.719
 only the products used for it 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.370
 reasonably cheap you will find 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 the products and the prices all below 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.590
 in the infobox and I hope the make-up 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 I like you so I'll start with you 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.490
 I use this today 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.910
 the kath resort place foundation 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 i take that right two wings 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.340
 out and use my make up around the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.670
 foundation to apply middle 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.480
 opacity opaque I do not think strong 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.280
 I like that very much 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.870
 next i use concealer and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.370
 Although I have the concealer from here 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 maybelline i believe a lot of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.280
 you also like that totally in the color 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.379
 15 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 and I wear this under the eyes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.480
 generous 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.149
 I like to say that and again 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.729
 the make-up I with the pointed side 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.729
 and the eye and bandage the concealer 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 so that the whole thing reasonably well now 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.080
 i keep using brother i use that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.300
 he will mineral powder in 0 1 percent 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
 and most importantly do not forget yours 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.450
 to cool again 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.400
 if I forget that and here too 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.320
 under the eye then I have later 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.300
 everywhere maskawa during the day and 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.910
 only the powder prevents that 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.390
 good trick partie statement ashton for 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.180
 I do not brow her eyebrows too much 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.020
 Actually, I actually extend it 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.020
 just a little bit 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.860
 and then we come to my eyes 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.840
 use dalai lama today and that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.460
 Of course you could also get black here 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.520
 brown or gray or so use all the way 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.250
 how walt meier comes from maybelline and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 that's the yale one him 07 black crow 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.190
 of course, then I use mascara and 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.470
 before I bring my eyelashes with the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.000
 waltz reform, it is actually a 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.890
 Do not walk quietly anymore 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.959
 a little bit of time I think that is 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.880
 that it makes a real big difference 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.000
 May the eyelashes now stop in well 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.260
 have been brought or not 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.140
 at least one bucket ok, you see 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.720
 difference 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.970
 I hope my mascara con of l'oreal 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.310
 and that is the volume of the schisma stara 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.840
 if i am my darling but i sit 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.590
 think she defines the ball dreamlike 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.769
 beautiful 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.209
 and that is the pressure I am today 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.209
 would like to give so 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.180
 and next comes that's handy 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.830
 the look i make red 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.630
 lipstick on and mine 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.150
 most adorable red lipstick all 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.530
 times that of maybelline in the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.700
 color 547 pleads a great word and 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.040
 I just wear it uncomplicated 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:30.690
 out of the tube is definitely not the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.489
 most professional artist to walk because 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.870
 it works and last time wear 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.209
 I have a little something on the cheeks 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.330
 on and two things first of 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.739
 reval enough the way highlight 100 and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.269
 210 essens kita stand the color 50 me 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.570
 why do this at the moment quite like 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.280
 in the end, because I really only completely 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.050
 little rouge would like to wear and little 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.790
 highlighter I think the lips are 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.620
 really in the foreground with this look 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.269
 and I just like it a bit 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.239
 easier to estimate how much of that 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.120
 Call me when the rest is ready 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.209
 as a first book really only a small one 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.209
 little 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:21.570
 and in highlight is questionable as such 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.770
 a bit further up here in such a 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.450
 reform 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.430
 Do you see that I hope I hope and yes 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.520
 we finished today was completely 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.350
 honestly I think every time you really 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.320
 so loudly wearing dark lipstick 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.970
 this totally upsets the entire make-up 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.710
 So you saw that was not now 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.530
 so super elaborate just a bit 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.090
 make-up and eyelashes with little red 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.370
 lipstick berti and I think it looks 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.630
 a lot more work from each of my 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.480
 you just really loud 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.770
 I think wearing lipstick brings that 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.330
 whole somehow to another level 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.980
 I like to write in the 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.390
 comments what you think of the look 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.580
 and whether you like it or not 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.960
 thank you for watching and until the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.370
 next time something is not right 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.370
 not my voice at the moment
