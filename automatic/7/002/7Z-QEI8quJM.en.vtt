00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.919
 hello everyone learn not all cases 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.180
 in the Alps swell in bmw back on 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.350
 our fetish circuit of pride 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.170
 left-handed with nine homemade pilots 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.550
 sunny israel hello hello so 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.570
 Spring is good because 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.160
 it's the beginning of the season 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.290
 automobile and how is its 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.989
 members microwave for you then it 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.909
 will be loaded because I had two 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.100
 championships business will do so we 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.540
 there is a fairy tale started so 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.510
 that occurred at hellemmes 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.829
 the international mans cup 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.899
 so I roll on behalf of 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.780
 the signature stable for publishing 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.510
 so this is the proto the proto lmp2 the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.119
 new proto lmp2 oreca with an engine 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.210
 nissan besides 10 years our big 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.789
 partners and that 's fine 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.429
 started because we went to 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.869
 séverine gallais to these bricks we did 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.340
 pole indeed the whole race start 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.800
 in the lead after we had two small three 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.590
 glitches with the out of the box 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.909
 speeds but we only have one 2d client and 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.310
 scored big points for the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.619
 championship and rmc and so that's it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.580
 good start of the year already the languages ​​has not 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.840
 that it signed a little new 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.030
 of Estonia so that's me I 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.340
 a lot of new things this season 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.070
 will ride on beautiful rails so 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.439
 I will soon drag the new 458 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.719
 gt2 european japanese camp escape 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.549
 a landmark the gt open and continue 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.810
 sané for the beautiful season with a 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.520
 car that made a lot of talking 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.829
 of her during a patrick trip 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.110
 garcia this is the subaru sti stg 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.149
 behind us the main novelty of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.990
 this subaru sti is and the appearance 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.280
 of a chest since the impreza wrx sti 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
 so do not go for a pass of 1st 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.000
 generation and attention it's more of a 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.240
 a price that's a double risk is 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.229
 that they removed the prayssas and which one 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.670
 still find everyone is 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.459
 very characteristic a front shield 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.750
 super naughty an air intake level 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.340
 the front cover and especially the famous 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.760
 pie shovel the return of the shovel to 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.799
 pie 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.090
 So we find you I really like 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:25.430
 his muscles and salt and well bodybuilder 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.760
 and that's why these facts 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.980
 ie the rally the race so 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.630
 to see what it's worth about on the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.790
 track a little hints it's when 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.200
 even 300 horses and four times 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.340
 [Music] 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.300
 inside it's 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.220
 and clean simple we do not know 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.340
 extraordinary materials but hey it's 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.280
 clean but not much to say 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.069
 the seats maintain moderately for 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.320
 a car of this type there but they are 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.430
 beautiful and it's okay when m 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.430
 [Music] 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.650
 the Trebéens self is that we can 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.319
 can settle 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.930
 we can adjust the dif so here we go 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.250
 so put sport mode 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.550
 we are already in sport mode but 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.170
 were receiving sharp sport mode and after 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.550
 the diffon can fix it 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.180
 so it's 50 50 at the beginning and we can 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.400
 to go we can go down to 65 to 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.950
 the back and and 35 at the front 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.569
 so that's fine so it allows 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.930
 when one is using circuit or 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.610
 so a little tortuous we need 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.850
 of the engine that pivots although they have to 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.470
 little fun out to do that to 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.569
 of excess of estro one passes the dif 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.700
 nobi must block the 550 it's still 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.470
 the most effective is really it's 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.269
 true it works really well the car 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.370
 so in his behavior is the team 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.730
 is a little pain 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:06.610
 waiting for them we can make it come a little 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:12.010
 returned but it's not the age tend to 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.480
 understeer and I put myself in 65 mode 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.489
 65 40 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.700
 so I have more at the back than at 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.700
 front 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.409
 I 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:26.539
 it's not it's not so synonymous 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:29.090
 trigger the only thing I blame 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.629
 never car a little more player 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.699
 making very fine between and after with 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.159
 frames or that would have caught up with any 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.419
 way we would have shown parents are going to either 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.120
 not reported sweaty but well 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.490
 balanced and effective has already shown 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.479
 to find with a little too much angle 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.550
 flying is so it's really 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.979
 although really on the track on the 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.879
 pool bend or that it was better 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.830
 good self but that's not the temperament 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.770
 sports one could expect the 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.729
 Car 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.729
 dream cars 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.759
 [Music] 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.870
 here is our day with this subaru 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:17.210
 sti ends your usual this 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:19.850
 model then it's me I liked the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.500
 car then she has some flaws in 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.810
 the big flaws started up again by 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.890
 the things that annoy 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.050
 I do not like the driving position am 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.970
 never got to see where people well 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.170
 placed or hands well not all 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.640
 together the hands and the legs is 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.830
 not possible is where one or the other 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.050
 to make a compromise 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.220
 the crankset it's not bad the pedal of 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.330
 brake and a bit low compared to 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.070
 the accelerator to make talent in 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.530
 tip is complicated we even 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.830
 many a lot of operators and the 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.650
 pedal is long enough 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.260
 after the brakes I did not find that very 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.540
 enduring go a little cheap and a little 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.160
 too under-tacky at the entrance game the 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.350
 behavior middle to lot of the turn 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.510
 it's really good 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.930
 attacking management is possible to 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.410
 inside with with the management of 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.210
 self-locking differential forgiveness that's 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.860
 it's very good we can be sure that it 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.240
 percent behind and car is good 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.250
 balanced out it's just 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.310
 the entry when we register nature a 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.020
 turn she's a bit a bit slow she 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.640
 is a little under virile especially apart 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.360
 this is a car that is very very 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.690
 well hung big engine that picks 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.919
 from very low a beautiful length 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.830
 almost no turbo effect ie 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:35.180
 the response time if zero gasy so 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.100
 it works very well and after good 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.280
 the general lines nature I like 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.380
 well his muscles and good after the tastes 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.360
 and the colors 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.830
 I like it here it reminds me 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.660
 reminds me of the first and I find that 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.940
 they did well to go back to three 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.669
 volumes 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.780
 good and now there is that color 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.280
 we read it so much with 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.110
 gendarmeries that one that is struggling to 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.110
 see them again in this color and north 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:29.269
