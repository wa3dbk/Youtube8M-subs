represents everything that he's supposed

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.620 
represents everything that he's supposed
to<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:19.920> at<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> most<00:04:20.310> basic<00:04:20.489> level<00:04:20.730> I<00:04:21.269> mean<00:04:21.480> you

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
to do at the most basic level I mean you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.110 
to do at the most basic level I mean you
really<00:04:21.750> only<00:04:22.019> need<00:04:22.170> fists<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.760> order<00:04:24.000> to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.350 

and<00:04:36.890> while<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.280> hope<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.730> perhaps<00:04:37.940> black

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
and while I hope that perhaps black

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.120 
and while I hope that perhaps black
mites<00:04:38.720> come<00:04:39.170> with<00:04:39.290> something<00:04:39.470> like<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> bonus

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130
