 environment are two trends in high in 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.830
 fitur 2014 well you know it debuted a 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.710
 company dedicated to the construction of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
 ecological wood houses with us 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 is the founder daniel mallo that such 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.679
 hello good afternoon very well thank you 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.990
 What are the novelties presented 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.169
 this year at the fair we 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.739
 We present as the unique project and 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.529
 different 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.159
 in the exploitation of tourism in the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.279
 natural environment 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:35.250
 we are a technology a patent based 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.410
 in sustainable homes that are assembled and that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.050
 they dismantle are the closest thing to a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.390
 tent but in wood we are 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.850
 an initiative or a solution but 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.830
 ecological impact and also with glamor 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.370
 not because it's like going camping but 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.170
 with exact glamor at the end is let's say 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.870
 the logistics of a tent 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.430
 mountable removable but with all the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.960
 comforts of the best room 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.300
 hotel we have taken care of all the details 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070
 we have taken care of all the qualities for 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.730
 that in a very respectful way with the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 environment 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.080
 we say we put in instead of 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 affect him 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 and we allow the client or the tourist that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 enjoy an experience 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.770
 completely different in addition to other 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.930
 What's new here at the fair 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.690
 we bring as a great novelty a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.980
 accommodation of 35 square meters that 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.990
 we are able to ride in a day and 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.610
 disassemble on a day that comes with all 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 the sustainable technology that we can 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.820
 imagine to be self-sufficient 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.140
 dry bath solar circuit circuits 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 Cross ventilation incidence of the sun 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.260
 we have everything controlled from the point 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.090
 of sustainability so that the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.400
 interior thermal comfort be the best 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 possible what the objectives have been 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.360
 that you have marked yourself within fitur 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.210
 good to us today what 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.120
 we want is more than anything to evangelize or 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.010
 teach this concept in Spain because 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.260
 it is a concept to the high the concept 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.910
 glamping let's say grows to 20 by 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.880
 hundred percent in the rest of the world there are 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.770
 more than 45 thousand accommodations and in Spain 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.210
 one of the countries that has two of the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.280
 more abundant resources and from the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.410
 resources on which glamping is based 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.700
 tourism and nature has not yet 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.130
 entered with strength and it is an opportunity 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.360
 of business that many good people 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.290
 is discovering us here in 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.790
 fitur 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.250
 well we are also saying that it is very 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.319
 important to send out that is the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.540
 export the know- how we have in 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 Spain to other countries but I see that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.400
 It is also very important to export 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.500
 others and asia dock it to our 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.060
 country true of course in the end the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.609
 Tourism for the economy of Spain is 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.980
 one of the most important pillars and 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.260
 good must continue to innovate not 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.750
 we can stay a hotel offer 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 very traditional as good we have 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.980
 known in the last 30 or 40 years 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 but you have to go on trends and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.670
 trends and the public that comes from 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.750
 foreigner looking for things that is so good 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.280
 in growth that are completely 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.950
 different in the end you have to leave what 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.870
 everyday going to offer different things 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.099
 we are going to stay with the experiences 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.810
