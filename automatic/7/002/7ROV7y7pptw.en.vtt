00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
endpoint is directly above the camera

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810 
endpoint is directly above the camera
right<00:00:18.330> now<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.810> I'm<00:00:19.380> about<00:00:19.740> 10<00:00:20.160> or<00:00:20.340> 15<00:00:20.520> feet

right now and I'm about 10 or 15 feet
out<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.580> I<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> come<00:00:24.330> back<00:00:24.359> down

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
out on this one I want to come back down

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.779 
out on this one I want to come back down
so<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.439> hanging<00:00:25.769> directly<00:00:25.920> below<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
so that I'm hanging directly below the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.640 
so that I'm hanging directly below the
Thai<00:00:27.000> endpoint<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.660> descend<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> ground

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
Thai endpoint and descend to the ground

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.620 
Thai endpoint and descend to the ground
but<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.429> kind<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> slippery<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.480> see

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
but it's kind of slippery you can see

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
but it's kind of slippery you can see
there's<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:30.869> some<00:00:31.140> algae<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.679> moths<00:00:31.890> or

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
there's like some algae or moths or

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.389 
there's like some algae or moths or
something<00:00:32.460> growing<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> branches<00:00:34.399> so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
something growing on the branches so

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
something growing on the branches so
rather<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.329> walking<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.020> may<00:00:37.140> be

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
rather than just walking in and may be

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
rather than just walking in and may be
slipping<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> show<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
slipping I'm going to show you a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360 
slipping I'm going to show you a
technique<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.570> use<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.680> tail<00:00:40.920> end<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
technique to use the tail end of the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.790 
technique to use the tail end of the
rope<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:42.120> anchor<00:00:42.570> yourself<00:00:42.719> use<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> Munter

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
rope to anchor yourself use a Munter

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.790 
rope to anchor yourself use a Munter
hitch<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.309> guide<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.329> descent<00:00:45.750> slowly<00:00:46.469> out

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
hitch and guide your descent slowly out

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.830 
hitch and guide your descent slowly out
to<00:00:47.190> your<00:00:47.430> plumb<00:00:47.670> line<00:00:47.879> directly<00:00:48.300> below<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to your plumb line directly below the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.170 
to your plumb line directly below the
the<00:00:49.710> tie-in<00:00:50.070> point<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> first<00:00:50.910> thing<00:00:51.000> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the tie-in point so the first thing you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.819 
the tie-in point so the first thing you
need<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.870> course<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.320> lanyard<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
need to do is of course get lanyard it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
need to do is of course get lanyard it
in<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.250> you're<00:00:53.489> safe<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.809> pull<00:00:55.260> all

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in so that you're safe and then pull all

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
in so that you're safe and then pull all
this<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.860> until<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.850> tail<00:00:57.149> end<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this up until you get the tail end of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.709 
this up until you get the tail end of
your<00:00:57.690> rope<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.770> mine<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.609> right<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.449> ever

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
your rope which mine is right here ever

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
your rope which mine is right here ever
so<00:01:00.899> conveniently<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> need<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> find

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so conveniently now you need to find

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.530 
so conveniently now you need to find
yourself<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.359> convenient<00:01:03.809> cross<00:01:05.540> something

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
yourself a convenient cross something

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
yourself a convenient cross something
that's<00:01:06.720> about<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.439> guess<00:01:08.310> I'd<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> 90<00:01:08.880> degree

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that's about I guess I'd be a 90 degree

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.940 
that's about I guess I'd be a 90 degree
angle<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.479> tighter<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.110> tighter<00:01:10.619> but

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
angle or tighter a little tighter but

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.670 
angle or tighter a little tighter but
not<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.400> really<00:01:12.000> tight<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.479> crushed<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> have

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
not up really tight be crushed so I have

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.820 
not up really tight be crushed so I have
one<00:01:13.950> right<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.290> what<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> do
