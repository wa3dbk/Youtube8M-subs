bass
so<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.920> start<00:00:26.130> off<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> know

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
so to start off with just so you know

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.370 
so to start off with just so you know
it's<00:00:27.090> supposed<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.510> sound<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.140> long<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
it's supposed to sound like as long as I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.240 
it's supposed to sound like as long as I
don't<00:00:28.439> screw<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.859> up

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
don't screw this up

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.939 
don't screw this up
it's<00:00:29.869> pretty<00:00:30.869> much<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.109> all<00:00:31.470> purposes<00:00:31.679> are

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
it's pretty much for all purposes are

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's pretty much for all purposes are
just<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> minor<00:00:32.850> scale<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.360> it's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
just going to do a minor scale and it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
just going to do a minor scale and it's
a<00:00:34.290> hammering<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.600> literally<00:00:36.600> sweeping

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
a hammering on and literally sweeping

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.299 
a hammering on and literally sweeping
across<00:00:37.260> each<00:00:37.500> string<00:00:37.739> hitting<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.129> string

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
across each string hitting this string

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700 
across each string hitting this string
one<00:00:38.489> time<00:00:38.899> in<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:39.989> case<00:00:40.170> beating<00:00:40.530> three

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
one time in this case beating three

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.860 
one time in this case beating three
notes<00:00:40.890> per<00:00:41.100> string<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> sound

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
notes per string so it's going to sound

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.100 
notes per string so it's going to sound
like<00:00:47.180> like<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> sounds

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
like like that I know it sounds

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
like like that I know it sounds
ridiculous<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.770> bass<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.489> would<00:00:51.059> actually

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
ridiculous on bass but would actually

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.660 
ridiculous on bass but would actually
put<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.960> musical<00:00:52.530> form<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:53.129> fits<00:00:53.399> you're

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
think so how to do this to practice is

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.760 
think so how to do this to practice is
will<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> filthy<00:01:17.869> that<00:01:18.869> guy<00:01:19.080> over<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
will do that filthy that guy over and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.899 
will do that filthy that guy over and
over<00:01:20.040> again<00:01:20.100> we're<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> play<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

over again we're not going to play that
fast<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.630> doesn't<00:01:22.259> make<00:01:22.350> sense<00:01:22.560> so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
