they're<00:01:00.830> going<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.250> become<00:01:01.610> inefficient<00:01:02.619> so

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
they're going to become inefficient so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.109 
they're going to become inefficient so
you'll<00:01:03.860> have<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.159> do<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.430> as<00:01:04.610> quickly<00:01:04.790> as<00:01:05.089> you

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
you'll have to do that as quickly as you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.910 
you'll have to do that as quickly as you
can<00:01:05.740> this<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:07.070> your<00:01:07.600> 500cc<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.869> there's<00:01:09.289> 50<00:01:09.890> of

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
can this is your 500cc and there's 50 of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.429 
can this is your 500cc and there's 50 of
them<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.490> here<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.030> these<00:01:11.509> will<00:01:11.719> last<00:01:11.929> a<00:01:12.200> long

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
them in here and these will last a long

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.679 
them in here and these will last a long
time<00:01:12.500> but<00:01:13.039> you<00:01:13.189> can<00:01:13.369> see<00:01:13.609> there<00:01:13.820> they're<00:01:14.329> quite

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
time but you can see there they're quite

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.749 
time but you can see there they're quite
a<00:01:14.719> bit<00:01:14.990> bigger<00:01:15.289> than<00:01:15.649> these<00:01:16.219> smaller<00:01:16.609> ones

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
a bit bigger than these smaller ones

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.020 
a bit bigger than these smaller ones
here<00:01:17.090> these<00:01:17.659> are<00:01:17.929> just<00:01:18.170> tiny<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.979> then<00:01:19.850> we

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
here these are just tiny and then we
