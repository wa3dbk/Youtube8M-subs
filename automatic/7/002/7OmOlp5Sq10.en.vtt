00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 and immense everyone is distracted by a new 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.240
 information and good is filtered what 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.670
 would be the first avant - garde dlc already 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 you know that they showed it a long time ago 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 they said he was going to take it four times 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.660
 As you already know, they said the names of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.960
 the same and good in it you see 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.210
 filtered the poster image of this 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920
 dlc does not come out the poster comes out you have it in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.930
 the description by the way simply 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.630
 you have to open it there is a link that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.310
 put an image or something like that and there you have the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 link to see the poster do not put it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.790
 in the background since I could get a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 extra and surely then as I say 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 you already have there in the description so that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 take a look at this image is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 totally real so nothing goes there 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.700
 I'm going to tell you a little about what you have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.590
 this image what is going to bring you are 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.030
 quite a few things but as I'm seeing 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.100
 in the background this game is a game that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.530
 I was already started I was playing a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 duel by team with the vall 27 and good 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 is a game has been pretty fast 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.160
 that I bring you that in the end pretty well 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.109
 since it was started and in the end 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.430
 get a good rachaita and I do not know 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.420
 This game was molded and I say here the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 you have since it is an information 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.739
 pretty short because this game 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.299
 it's perfect for what 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.950
 while in the background while you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.110
 I comment this is having goals too 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.689
 look at what the image will be but 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.610
 well I tell you , this dlc would come out on the 27th 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.340
 January 2015 you know what they said 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 that we would have this DLCI in 2015 in January 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.539
 the first of all but they told us the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.979
 date exactly and with this picture what 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.659
 we can see then on the other hand also 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.330
 we would have what would be the new mode the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.310
 ex or zombies that we put a small 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.200
 image that the truth that pretty cool 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.479
 if the image looks much better 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.830
 it would be amazing nice has enough 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.500
 good looking east way of texas 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.780
 zombies then on the other hand we have 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.459
 down what would be the weapon that you already know 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.100
 that this weapon came out about two 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.200
 weeks for those who have if they are peace 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.700
 in xbox one then I guess it will come out 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.679
 for playstation 4 if it has not already come out 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.299
 I suppose so 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.640
 then below as I say we have the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.860
 four maps that will be this dlc 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.990
 that would be the first all south then 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.259
 On the other hand , the core drive and the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.539
 of urban does not put anything else of these maps 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.689
 simply put a small picture of 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.489
 this map that good as we can not 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.079
 see it very well since there is the image to 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.430
 through a glass this image is 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.909
 taken on the street 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.650
 in some store it will be put then in 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.680
 the background or something because I know I was 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.120
 glass or you see do all this and yes 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.250
 that looks pretty good not about 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.290
 everything what the maps would be has 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.780
 well liked some of the core and sil 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.819
 drive is cool to me, not the core one 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.920
 It seems that this is how a house 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.329
 abandoned or something like that but it's that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.989
 as I say you can not see very very well 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.000
 this this map why is it like this 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.590
 like glass and it looks reflected but 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.840
 do have quite appetizing as well 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.579
 that nothing is too small for 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.709
 come this date so we can 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.109
 try those those zombies mont that now 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.090
 with this leak they will surely come out 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.489
 as a trailer or anything besides 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.230
 they are showing each one as if already 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.419
 it has been filtered and the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.400
 image since as I say it is put in 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.200
 some store or anything and it's not 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.319
 an image that has been edited or 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.030
 nothing so nothing to wait for it to come out 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.730
 this dlc you already know that you will have it in the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.290
 channel then I guess a game goes up 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.629
 with the soul is that he has not been able to climb 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.939
 still but I guess in the next 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.859
 days you will have it in the channel so 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.020
 nothing if you liked this information 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.150
 to subscribe 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.410
 to no more video and see you in the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.410
 next until after
