choice<00:02:29.030> I'm<00:02:29.870> choosing<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.350> go<00:02:30.380> for<00:02:30.680> more<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:30.890> a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
choice I'm choosing to go for more of a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.980 
choice I'm choosing to go for more of a
little<00:02:31.250> swirl<00:02:31.640> design<00:02:32.090> on<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.569> first<00:02:32.780> nail

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
little swirl design on the first nail

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.500 
little swirl design on the first nail
that<00:02:33.110> we're<00:02:33.260> working<00:02:33.560> with<00:02:34.390> we're<00:02:35.390> just

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
that we're working with we're just

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600 
that we're working with we're just
swirling<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.230> then<00:02:36.410> we're<00:02:36.740> wiping<00:02:37.280> on<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
swirling and then we're wiping on the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.490 
swirling and then we're wiping on the
paper<00:02:37.790> towel<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.780> doesn't<00:02:38.959> glob<00:02:39.290> up

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
paper towel so that it doesn't glob up

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.650 
paper towel so that it doesn't glob up
on<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.800> tip<00:02:40.010> there<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.459> just<00:02:41.150> make<00:02:41.360> sure<00:02:41.540> not

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
on the tip there and just make sure not

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.680 
on the tip there and just make sure not
to<00:02:41.720> grab<00:02:42.110> from<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.410> outmost<00:02:43.040> rim<00:02:43.490> of<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
to grab from the outmost rim of the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.600 
to grab from the outmost rim of the
Polish<00:02:45.080> design<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.250> usually<00:02:46.580> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
Polish design because it's usually the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.640 
Polish design because it's usually the
first<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.060> dry<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.840> tug<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.319> it'll

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
first to dry and if you tug on it it'll

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
first to dry and if you tug on it it'll
tug<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.130> whole<00:02:49.310> entire<00:02:49.640> design<00:02:50.000> with<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.450> and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
tug the whole entire design with it and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.650 
tug the whole entire design with it and
you<00:02:50.930> won't<00:02:51.050> be<00:02:51.230> able<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.500> use<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.860> your<00:02:51.950> nail

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
you won't be able to use it on your nail

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.339 
you won't be able to use it on your nail
so<00:02:53.660> we're<00:02:53.840> just<00:02:53.870> swirling<00:02:55.870> making<00:02:56.870> all<00:02:56.990> kinds

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
so we're just swirling making all kinds

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.140 
so we're just swirling making all kinds
of<00:02:57.410> weird<00:02:57.560> little<00:02:57.890> designs<00:02:58.220> there<00:02:58.489> whatever

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150

and then making sure to wipe off the
excess<00:03:05.120> from<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.810> tip<00:03:06.020> on<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.440> paper<00:03:06.650> towel

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
excess from the tip on the paper towel

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.270 
excess from the tip on the paper towel
now<00:03:08.540> once<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.900> see<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.110> start<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.800> lift<00:03:10.070> up

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
now once you see it start to lift up

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.030

like<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.700> little<00:03:10.880> bit<00:03:11.770> you're<00:03:12.770> going<00:03:12.980> to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
like that a little bit you're going to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.740 
like that a little bit you're going to
want<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.310> stop<00:03:13.640> making<00:03:14.000> designs<00:03:14.300> see<00:03:14.570> how<00:03:14.720> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
want to stop making designs see how I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.970 
want to stop making designs see how I
almost<00:03:14.990> pulled<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.470> whole<00:03:15.590> thing<00:03:15.860> right

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
almost pulled the whole thing right

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.100 
almost pulled the whole thing right
there<00:03:16.450> that's<00:03:17.450> how<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:17.660> know<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:17.990> getting

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
there that's how you know it's getting

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.320 
there that's how you know it's getting
dry<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.340> should<00:03:19.550> go<00:03:19.730> ahead<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.120> start

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
dry and you should go ahead and start

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.020 
dry and you should go ahead and start
finding<00:03:21.040> which<00:03:22.040> design<00:03:22.460> you<00:03:22.580> want<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.850> go<00:03:22.940> on

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
finding which design you want to go on

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.720
