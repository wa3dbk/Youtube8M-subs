technology connected one of the great
things<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:11.610> attending<00:00:12.120> CES<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:12.990> you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
things about attending CES is that you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.509 
things about attending CES is that you
get<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.469> sample<00:00:13.920> some<00:00:14.099> things<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.460> you

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
get to sample some things that you

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.820 
get to sample some things that you
probably<00:00:14.880> would<00:00:15.330> never<00:00:15.480> actually<00:00:15.990> expect<00:00:16.560> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
probably would never actually expect and

one of the great things that we're

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.210 
one of the great things that we're
seeing<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.720> some<00:00:18.980> amazing<00:00:19.980> high

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220

HiFi<00:00:21.960> cans<00:00:23.039> we<00:00:23.250> saw<00:00:23.430> some<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.939> Sennheiser<00:00:24.480> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
HiFi cans we saw some at Sennheiser and

HiFi cans we saw some at Sennheiser and
now<00:00:24.990> we're<00:00:25.170> actually<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.769> Stax<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.460> one

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
now we're actually here at Stax and one

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.279 
now we're actually here at Stax and one
thing<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.510> tell<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.080> these

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
thing that we can tell you is that these

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.919 
thing that we can tell you is that these
are<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> most<00:00:29.130> real<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.000> airy<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
are some of the most real and airy and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.709 
are some of the most real and airy and
concise<00:00:31.640> set<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.820> headphones<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.570> have

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
concise set of headphones that I have

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.590 
concise set of headphones that I have
ever<00:00:34.110> tried<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.010> they<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.850> by<00:00:36.059> far<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> most

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
ever tried on they are by far the most

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.209 
ever tried on they are by far the most
premium<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.350> I've<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.070> my

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
premium that I've actually put on my

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.650

head and that includes the Orpheus I

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.380 
head and that includes the Orpheus I
actually<00:00:39.840> am<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> huge<00:00:40.440> fan<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.610> specific

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
actually am a huge fan of this specific

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.209 
actually am a huge fan of this specific
technology<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.890> explained<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
technology now what it was explained to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.770 
technology now what it was explained to
me<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.329> are

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
me is that there they are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840 
me is that there they are
high<00:00:45.960> voltage<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.710> basically<00:00:47.039> means<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
high voltage which basically means that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.139 
high voltage which basically means that
the<00:00:48.719> actual<00:00:49.170> system<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> fed<00:00:50.340> into<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.730> very

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the actual system is fed into a very

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.510 
the actual system is fed into a very
thin<00:00:51.239> set<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.930> foil<00:00:52.260> which<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.920> packed<00:00:53.129> between

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
thin set of foil which is packed between

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.330 
thin set of foil which is packed between
a<00:00:53.550> couple<00:00:54.030> pieces<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.480> metal<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:55.500> it's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
a couple pieces of metal now it's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.560 
a couple pieces of metal now it's
similar<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:56.879> other<00:00:57.000> people<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.449> doing

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
similar to what other people are doing

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
similar to what other people are doing
but<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> foil<00:00:58.590> vibrates<00:00:59.100> with

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
but the way that the foil vibrates with

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.099 
but the way that the foil vibrates with
these<00:00:59.460> guys<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.120> vibrates<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.719> very

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
these guys is that it vibrates very very

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.139 
these guys is that it vibrates very very
tightly<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.160> gonna<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> tight<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
tightly so you're gonna get a tight and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.810 
tightly so you're gonna get a tight and
real<00:01:03.690> sound<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.530> comparison<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.250> other<00:01:05.460> people

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
real sound in comparison to other people

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670 
real sound in comparison to other people
where<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.240> very<00:01:06.270> there's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.530> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
where it's a very there's a lot of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
where it's a very there's a lot of
movement<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.430> necessarily<00:01:09.000> as

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
movement so it's not necessarily as

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.020 
movement so it's not necessarily as
accurate<00:01:09.960> these<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.860> an<00:01:11.070> incredible<00:01:11.729> sound

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
