look<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.739> decimal<00:00:34.739> places<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.640> millions<00:00:36.739> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
look at decimal places to millions the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.229 
look at decimal places to millions the
first<00:00:37.980> place<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> right<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> decimal

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
first place to the right of the decimal

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.590 
first place to the right of the decimal
is<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> tenants<00:00:40.760> then<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> hundreds

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
is the tenants then we have the hundreds

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900 
is the tenants then we have the hundreds
then<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> thousands<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.789> have

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
then we have the thousands then we have

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
then we have the thousands then we have
the<00:00:45.059> ten<00:00:45.300> thousands<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.320> hundred<00:00:46.649> thousands

the ten thousands the hundred thousands
and<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.550> millions<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.649> number<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
and the millions so this number is

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
and the millions so this number is
39,000<00:00:52.789> 475<00:00:53.840> million's<00:00:56.300> now<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.360> are<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
39,000 475 million's now we are going to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.220 
39,000 475 million's now we are going to
read<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> write<00:00:58.620> decimal<00:00:59.609> numbers<00:01:00.230> let's

look at the following exercise 20.9 03

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.960 
look at the following exercise 20.9 03
let's<00:01:06.150> write<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.860> using<00:01:07.860> our<00:01:08.250> decimal

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
let's write that using our decimal

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
let's write that using our decimal
places<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.530> 20<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:18.530> 903<00:01:28.340> since

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
places this will be 20 and 903 since

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
places this will be 20 and 903 since
hundreds<00:01:29.880> thousands<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.659> three<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
let's read this number nine and three

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.050 
let's read this number nine and three
hundred<00:01:46.049> eight<00:01:46.259> ten<00:01:46.619> thousandths<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.549> let's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
hundred eight ten thousandths and let's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.569 
hundred eight ten thousandths and let's
write<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> decimal<00:01:48.979> we<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> whole

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
write it as a decimal we have a whole

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.649 
write it as a decimal we have a whole
number<00:01:50.790> nine<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> decimal<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:54.450> have

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
number nine and is a decimal we have

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.450 
number nine and is a decimal we have
three<00:01:55.170> hundred<00:01:55.950> eight<00:01:56.130> ten<00:01:57.320> thousandths<00:01:58.460> so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
three hundred eight ten thousandths so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.780 
three hundred eight ten thousandths so
to<00:01:59.520> have<00:02:00.030> ten<00:02:00.479> thousandths<00:02:01.259> place<00:02:01.579> we<00:02:02.579> need<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
to have ten thousandths place we need to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.719 
to have ten thousandths place we need to
go<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.450> fourth<00:02:03.840> decimal<00:02:04.259> spot<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
go to the fourth decimal spot so this

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.559 
go to the fourth decimal spot so this
will<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.979> three<00:02:07.979> hundred<00:02:08.660> eight<00:02:10.069> ten

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
will be three hundred eight ten

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.800 
will be three hundred eight ten
thousandths

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
thousandths

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.680 
thousandths
now<00:02:14.110> let's<00:02:14.380> look<00:02:14.560> at<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.830> steps<00:02:15.220> for<00:02:16.150> rounding

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
now let's look at the steps for rounding

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.089 
now let's look at the steps for rounding
decimals<00:02:18.270> step<00:02:19.270> one<00:02:19.510> find<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.500> place<00:02:20.739> to

the place to which you have rounded now
let's<00:03:01.120> look<00:03:01.330> at<00:03:01.480> some<00:03:01.720> examples<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.470> rounding

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
let's look at some examples of rounding

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.809 
let's look at some examples of rounding
decimals<00:03:04.349> now<00:03:05.349> let's<00:03:05.620> round<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.400> decimal

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
decimals now let's round this decimal

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.809 
decimals now let's round this decimal

thousandth to round this number to the
nearest<00:03:17.470> tenth<00:03:18.160> we<00:03:18.880> would<00:03:19.060> look<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.930> right

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
nearest tenth we would look to the right

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.610 
nearest tenth we would look to the right
of<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:21.310> tenths<00:03:22.000> place<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.720> we<00:03:23.170> would<00:03:23.320> see

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
of the tenths place and we would see

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.710 
of the tenths place and we would see
that<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.400> digit<00:03:24.940> immediately<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.630> right

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
that this digit immediately to the right

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.890 
that this digit immediately to the right
of<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.049> tenths<00:03:26.410> place<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.920> not<00:03:27.820> five<00:03:28.540> or

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
of the tenths place is not five or

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.130 
of the tenths place is not five or
larger<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.730> tens<00:03:31.000> place<00:03:31.090> will<00:03:31.690> not<00:03:31.900> go

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
larger and so the tens place will not go

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.680 
larger and so the tens place will not go
up<00:03:32.380> into<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:33.130> nearest<00:03:33.340> tenth<00:03:33.700> this<00:03:34.269> number

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.930 
the right of the hundreds place we will
see<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.250> this<00:03:48.549> digit<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.410> 5<00:03:50.410> or<00:03:50.739> larger<00:03:51.250> so

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
see that this digit is 5 or larger so

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.590 
see that this digit is 5 or larger so
our<00:03:52.269> hundreds<00:03:52.900> place<00:03:53.200> has<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.220> go<00:03:54.370> up<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:54.910> so

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
our hundreds place has to go up and so

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.440 
our hundreds place has to go up and so
this<00:03:56.049> number<00:03:56.530> rounded<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.340> nearest

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
the nearest dollar so to round to the

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.210 
the nearest dollar so to round to the
nearest<00:05:27.010> dollar<00:05:27.840> we<00:05:28.840> would<00:05:29.080> look<00:05:29.380> in<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.860> one

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
nearest dollar we would look in the one

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.820 
nearest dollar we would look in the one
dollar<00:05:30.760> place<00:05:31.330> we<00:05:31.690> will<00:05:31.840> see<00:05:32.050> that<00:05:32.080> this<00:05:32.380> digit

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
dollar place we will see that this digit

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.469 
dollar place we will see that this digit
is<00:05:32.950> 5<00:05:33.160> or<00:05:33.400> greater<00:05:33.550> so<00:05:33.940> this<00:05:34.540> would<00:05:34.750> become<00:05:35.370> one

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
is 5 or greater so this would become one

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.570 
is 5 or greater so this would become one
whole<00:05:37.479> dollar<00:05:39.840> 233<00:05:40.840> dot<00:05:41.050> eighty<00:05:41.620> six<00:05:41.979> cents<00:05:42.370> to

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
whole dollar 233 dot eighty six cents to

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.840 
whole dollar 233 dot eighty six cents to
the<00:05:42.729> nearest<00:05:43.090> dollar<00:05:43.900> we<00:05:44.740> will<00:05:44.890> look<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.729> the

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
the nearest dollar we will look to the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.150 
the nearest dollar we will look to the
right<00:05:46.000> of<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.300> dollars<00:05:46.840> place<00:05:47.169> this<00:05:47.590> has<00:05:47.950> to

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
right of the dollars place this has to

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.400 
right of the dollars place this has to
go<00:05:48.310> up<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:48.729> two<00:05:48.940> hundred<00:05:48.970> and<00:05:49.630> thirty<00:05:49.990> four

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
go up to two hundred and thirty four

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.210 
go up to two hundred and thirty four
dollars<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:51.539> so<00:05:52.539> here<00:05:53.200> we're<00:05:53.770> going<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:53.950> round

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
dollars and so here we're going to round

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.790 
dollars and so here we're going to round
to<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.460> nearest<00:05:54.820> dollar<00:05:55.630> we<00:05:56.140> look<00:05:56.440> to<00:05:56.680> the

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
to the nearest dollar we look to the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.430 
to the nearest dollar we look to the
right<00:05:56.950> of<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:57.340> dollars<00:05:57.820> place<00:05:58.120> this<00:05:58.810> digit

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
right of the dollars place this digit

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.250 
right of the dollars place this digit
remains<00:05:59.860> the<00:06:00.100> same<00:06:00.370> because<00:06:00.940> this<00:06:01.630> digit<00:06:02.080> is

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
remains the same because this digit is

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.500 
remains the same because this digit is
not<00:06:02.500> 5<00:06:02.860> or<00:06:03.160> greater<00:06:03.280> so<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.300> nearest

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
dollar this will be 8260 three dollars

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.930 
dollar this will be 8260 three dollars
in<00:06:10.660> this<00:06:10.870> section<00:06:11.169> we<00:06:11.830> have<00:06:11.860> looked<00:06:12.310> at<00:06:12.550> the
