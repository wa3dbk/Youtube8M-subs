00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Catatonic Society - Mandrake

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Released Feb 3, 2015 on End Times Records

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
From the debut album, "Baptistina", out March 10, 2015

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.400
An unnamed shadow moves across this land

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.520
Whispered rumors, curses from the hidden hand

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.160
Red horizon tells of days to come

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.980
No turning back, some things cannot be undone

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.360
And I will stand and speak this truth to you

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.600
Prepare for war

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.860
You dulled my senses, drove stakes through my spine

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.060
Your words are poison, hidden in a bitter wine

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.360
You move in darkness, I still see your face

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.960
I cast you out, now I know your name

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.720
And I see that you think you'll walk away

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.280
Prepare for war

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.700
Draw breath and pull back and take aim and never question why

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.140
Take steel and rise up and swing down and come around again

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.000
I'm truth and I'm death and I've come for those who think you're conquered me

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.580
I am the tide

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.020
I am the sky
