00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this case I've got the construction

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
this case I've got the construction
workers<00:01:56.759> they're<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.509> targets<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.770> going

so just push a and that's going to
murder<00:02:05.520> those<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.330> those<00:02:06.540> characters<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.470> now

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
murder those so those characters are now

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.919 
murder those so those characters are now
out<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> game<00:02:08.479> what<00:02:09.479> you'll<00:02:09.569> notice<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
out of the game what you'll notice is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.360 
out of the game what you'll notice is
that<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.350> run<00:02:10.920> into<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> these

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that if I run into one of these

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.550 
that if I run into one of these
characters<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.970> let<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:13.020> bit<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> an<00:02:13.380> OOP

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
characters I let a little bit of an OOP

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.559 
characters I let a little bit of an OOP
sound<00:02:13.860> which<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.060> know<00:02:15.180> who<00:02:15.420> my

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
sound which is just you know who my

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.340 
sound which is just you know who my
targets<00:02:15.959> are<00:02:17.510> now<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> crowd<00:02:19.319> of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
targets are now if I'm in a crowd of

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.259 
targets are now if I'm in a crowd of
people<00:02:19.739> like<00:02:20.100> here<00:02:20.370> then<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.209> to

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
people like here then it's going to

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.780 
people like here then it's going to
depend<00:02:21.420> on<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.380> know<00:02:22.500> where<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:22.769> was<00:02:23.489> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
depend on you know where I was and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.360 
depend on you know where I was and
moving<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.530> which<00:02:25.739> direction<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
moving as to which direction of it a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.860 
moving as to which direction of it a
stab<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:28.860> pushing<00:02:29.430> down<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.750> know

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
stab so if I'm pushing down you know

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.509 
stab so if I'm pushing down you know
against<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.319> character<00:02:31.709> then<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.459> to

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
against the character then it's going to

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.580 
against the character then it's going to
murder<00:02:32.730> them<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.600> moving<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.140> know<00:02:34.260> in

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
murder them if I'm moving you know in

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.570 
murder them if I'm moving you know in
the<00:02:34.709> opposite<00:02:34.950> direction<00:02:35.069> it's<00:02:35.400> going<00:02:35.430> to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the opposite direction it's going to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.100 
the opposite direction it's going to
murder<00:02:35.760> whoever's<00:02:36.239> closest<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
murder whoever's closest and in that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.559 
murder whoever's closest and in that
direction<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.880> i<00:02:38.940> murder<00:02:39.090> someone<00:02:39.450> who's

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
direction so if i murder someone who's

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.960 
direction so if i murder someone who's
not<00:02:39.660> my<00:02:39.810> target<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.410> leave<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.100> trail<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.519> bloody

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
not my target I leave a trail of bloody

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.690 
not my target I leave a trail of bloody
footprints<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.510> monomial<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.610> I'll<00:02:44.670> just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
footprints a monomial so I'll just

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.150 
footprints a monomial so I'll just
finish<00:02:44.970> off<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.480> kill<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.200> last<00:02:46.410> building

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
finish off and kill the last building

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.270 
finish off and kill the last building

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
targets as move so when I play the game

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.390 
targets as move so when I play the game
I've<00:02:57.180> gotta<00:02:57.360> watch<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:57.810> those<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:59.130> if<00:02:59.310> I

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.240 
playing a little bit faster than normal
what<00:06:42.169> I'll<00:06:42.259> do<00:06:42.409> is<00:06:42.500> I'll<00:06:42.560> skip<00:06:42.860> this<00:06:42.979> for<00:06:43.189> now
