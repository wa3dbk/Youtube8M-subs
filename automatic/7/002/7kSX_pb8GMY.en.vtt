last<00:00:55.829> movement<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> also<00:00:57.000> divided<00:00:57.329> into<00:00:57.719> three

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
last movement is also divided into three

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.260 
last movement is also divided into three
parts<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.649> interestingly<00:00:59.309> they're<00:01:00.030> they're

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
parts and interestingly they're they're

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
parts and interestingly they're they're
too<00:01:00.510> big<00:01:01.109> stops<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> last<00:01:02.579> movement<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
too big stops in the last movement and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.950 
too big stops in the last movement and
the<00:01:04.019> theme<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> comes<00:01:04.680> after<00:01:05.250> each<00:01:05.400> stop<00:01:05.960> is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the theme that comes after each stop is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.910 
the theme that comes after each stop is
gradually<00:01:07.799> transforming<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> by<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> end

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
gradually transforming and by the end

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
gradually transforming and by the end
after<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.310> second<00:01:11.760> stop<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> third<00:01:12.600> part

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
Mozart and vapor and with it is that I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.610 
Mozart and vapor and with it is that I
think<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.760> Schumann<00:02:48.620> Schumann's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
think that that Schumann Schumann's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.080 
think that that Schumann Schumann's
music<00:02:50.340> directly<00:02:51.530> alludes<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.700> many<00:02:53.819> other

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
music directly alludes to so many other

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.680 
music directly alludes to so many other
types<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.780> music<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.950> particular<00:02:56.459> piece

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
types of music and this particular piece

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.240 
types of music and this particular piece
does<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:57.900> even<00:02:58.230> more<00:02:58.380> strongly<00:02:58.709> than<00:02:58.920> other

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
does so even more strongly than other

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.309 
does so even more strongly than other
works<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.760> Shuman<00:03:00.209> with<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.079> obviously<00:03:01.920> old

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
works of Shuman with the obviously old

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.979 
works of Shuman with the obviously old
old-fashioned<00:03:04.319> counterpoint<00:03:05.069> Bach<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.720> sort

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
old-fashioned counterpoint Bach the sort

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.819 
old-fashioned counterpoint Bach the sort
of<00:03:07.079> forward-looking<00:03:08.690> melodic<00:03:09.690> elements<00:03:09.930> that

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
of forward-looking melodic elements that

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.009 
of forward-looking melodic elements that
that<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:11.670> Faber<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.329> picked<00:03:12.569> up<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
that I think Faber and picked up the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.069 
that I think Faber and picked up the
concert<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> whole<00:03:13.829> will<00:03:14.130> will<00:03:14.930> present<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
concert as a whole will will present a

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.190 
concert as a whole will will present a
kind<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.410> story<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.329> I<00:03:18.329> think<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.720> audiences

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
kind of story that I think the audiences

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.520 
kind of story that I think the audiences
will<00:03:19.410> will<00:03:19.709> understand<00:03:21.019> very<00:03:22.019> much<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
will will understand very much in the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.809 
will will understand very much in the
way<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.010> symphony<00:03:23.400> itself<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.790> a

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
way that the symphony itself is a

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.549 
way that the symphony itself is a
microcosm<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:25.170> series<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.069> stories
