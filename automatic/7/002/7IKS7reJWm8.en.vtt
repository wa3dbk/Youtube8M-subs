wasting any more time let's start the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
wasting any more time let's start the
video<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.270> starting<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> bottom<00:00:33.989> we

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
video so starting from the bottom we

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.830 
video so starting from the bottom we
have<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.620> very<00:00:34.860> popular<00:00:35.160> lithium<00:00:35.910> card<00:00:36.239> this

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
have the very popular lithium card this

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.020 
have the very popular lithium card this
is<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> perfect<00:00:37.530> sized<00:00:38.010> portable<00:00:38.640> charger

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
is the perfect sized portable charger

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
is the perfect sized portable charger
for<00:00:39.210> anyone<00:00:39.510> who<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> always<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
for anyone who is always on the go and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
for anyone who is always on the go and
he's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> slight<00:00:41.640> charge<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.239> survive<00:00:42.629> until

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
he's a slight charge to survive until

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660 
he's a slight charge to survive until
they<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.290> home<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.340> about<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
they get home but I like about the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.610 
they get home but I like about the
charger<00:00:45.090> besides<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.690> super<00:00:46.020> thin<00:00:46.200> profile

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
charger besides it's super thin profile

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.319 
charger besides it's super thin profile
is<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> fact<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.399> comes<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> cable

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is the fact that it comes with the cable

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
is the fact that it comes with the cable
tucked<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> side<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:50.129> need

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
tucked in on the side so you don't need

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
tucked in on the side so you don't need
to<00:00:50.340> carry<00:00:50.579> around<00:00:50.730> extra<00:00:51.000> cables<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:52.320> does

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to carry around extra cables it does

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
to carry around extra cables it does
come<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.770> several<00:00:53.070> different<00:00:53.190> colors<00:00:53.760> and

come in several different colors and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.850 
come in several different colors and
there<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> microUSB<00:00:54.809> version<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.739> Android

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there is a microUSB version for Android

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
charging and that I mentioned it's super

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
charging and that I mentioned it's super
thin<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.439> practically<00:01:19.920> fit<00:01:20.250> inside<00:01:20.580> a
