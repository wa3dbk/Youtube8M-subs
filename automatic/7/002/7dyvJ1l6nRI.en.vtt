 We are talking that there is no 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:59.300
 It's a different place that will be doing radio as it is 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.570
 I mentioned at that time gradually gradually 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:08.840
 It will be something that I can not imagine 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.230
 a is what Jojo I, which started from so it is 1987, but I was addicted smash 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.720
 Is a college student 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:20.310
 May be Monroe Part 3 The number of this Stardust crusader has been serialized 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.280
 Not yet at that time but to say time is I think to be a much junior high school students 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.970
 Jojo's goodness 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:33.520
 It was not a year when I could not say that I did not understand the wonder of this human anthem 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:37.450
 It seems that some sort of writer was a great addict, from that time on 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.700
 I keep buying jumps all the time and it is expensive now 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:46.510
 I'm wonder if you're doing Jojo's program I'm I'm I also that so to those not mention the old days Museum 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.960
 And you are the one who moves your life 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.890
 I was kind of it because 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.780
 In Chiba, we really say that we are involved in this program 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.530
 It is a little fluffy Datte body is bracing think of you I'm something a little now 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.409
 gate 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.359
 It does not come with feet on the ground 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:08.060
 Really when the university is my mon Well I I think that's why not scale too love 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:13.610
 At that time it's already over 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:19.400
 Comics went to choose from the first part of it is the I listed but it is do universal 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.400
 So at that time I wasn't determined to be a college student or to be a voice actor 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.000
 Rather I 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:32.610
 Yes, it's a composition writer, a director, a filmmaker, and so on 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.530
 It says so Nde wanted to be still I staff I went to college I wanted involved 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.370
 Become a star now 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:45.430
 No way I 'm going to play Sora Jotaro 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:50.410
 I didn't really think of it, but it was true that I loved my life and moved it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.310
 To send you in the Mole to say that life is gradually snuggled and on the radio staff Contact 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.520
 Send 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:00.680
 Because You're too little love I think that in a radio 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.450
 Nechotto will come with it is though there may be a nifty too also part that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.160
 I think that it seems like 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.060
 Though it is broadcast every week from April of the story of TV animation third book which is on the air now 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.510
 Part 1 and Part 2 are also animated and lyrical 0 d, which will be the predecessor of Matsu 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.250
 Inherit the here and I want to do my best heard It's Tet 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.340
 I think on the way 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:28.120
 I knew that I was in series at Moss at the time of the university of this work, and I was going a long way 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:35.080
 However I was not addicted though I'm from the middle 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:38.240
 An'nani 5 gradually determined by the gradual guidance of life addicted Gattsuri aware of the charm of Jojo 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.590
 I asked if it was a minute 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.670
 I'm addicted to that time, but I'll tell you if it really is 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.150
 Well from now on 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:55.670
 As there are people who read it, maybe the main theme for 5 minutes is important and only the result is important. 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.569
 It is what story Tteyuu the process it is important to get there without 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:04.200
 Hey it 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:08.730
 That's because it's so detailed and it's a 5 minute talk 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.370
 Sleeping in the middle of talking about it to do it this way Jojo that 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:17.560
 It is also the role of a stand that my mind stops when it turns into miso 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.020
 That child production board is I will Hyoro properly ask from 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.550
 Well, you know that Anne's who knows the existence of Jojo is quite recent 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.760
 It came from the anime 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.870
 Seeing from the third part, you are also and I love places from a long time ago and I gradually overflowed with love 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.580
 You too 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:41.379
 I 'm aiming for such a program that everyone can love Jojo more deeply 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.940
 Because I want to make it a pattern to be a bridge connecting Jojo and you . 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:48.660
