point where you've gone through a couple

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
point where you've gone through a couple
of<00:01:26.670> nights<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> feel<00:01:27.570> pretty<00:01:27.840> good<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
of nights and you feel pretty good and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.130 
of nights and you feel pretty good and
then<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.490> start<00:01:29.729> creeping<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.270> around<00:01:30.509> 2<00:01:31.110> or

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
then they start creeping up around 2 or

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
then they start creeping up around 2 or
3<00:01:31.350> a.m.<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:32.520> when<00:01:32.729> you're<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
3 a.m. that's when you're gonna want to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.810 
3 a.m. that's when you're gonna want to
close<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> doors<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:35.250> only<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> little

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
close the doors but only for a little

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
close the doors but only for a little
while<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.140> leave<00:01:37.290> them<00:01:37.409> close

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
while because if you leave them close

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
while because if you leave them close
too<00:01:37.799> long<00:01:38.070> whoops<00:01:38.729> run<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> power<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.360> are

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
too long whoops run out of power and are

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.679 
too long whoops run out of power and are
like<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.810> said<00:01:40.020> before<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.939> really

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
like I said before so it's really

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.020 
like I said before so it's really
difficult<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.170> first<00:01:43.409> time<00:01:43.680> around<00:01:44.030> but

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
difficult the first time around but

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300 
difficult the first time around but
after<00:01:45.360> playing<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.720> few<00:01:45.960> times<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.860> start<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
after playing a few times you start to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.460 
after playing a few times you start to
understand<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> never<00:01:48.899> stops<00:01:49.350> being

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
understand it but it never stops being

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.539 
understand it but it never stops being
creepy<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.950> look<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.460> her

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
creepy so right now I just look at her

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
creepy so right now I just look at her
in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> room<00:01:53.939> nothing<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.659> seems<00:01:54.960> bad<00:01:55.290> yet

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
in the room nothing really seems bad yet

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.940 
in the room nothing really seems bad yet
it's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> lot<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> creepy<00:01:57.420> stuff<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.950> different

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it's a lot of creepy stuff in different

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.840 
it's a lot of creepy stuff in different
rooms<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.549> no<00:02:00.270> one's<00:02:00.450> stunned<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.960> attack

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
but once they do you think you know
