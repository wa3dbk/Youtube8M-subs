friends<00:01:03.690> check<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.559> my<00:01:04.680> s3<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.309> do

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
friends check out what my s3 can do

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.380 
friends check out what my s3 can do
something<00:01:08.040> ourselves<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.580> there<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.150> frame

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
something ourselves in there the frame

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600 
something ourselves in there the frame
rate<00:01:09.570> does<00:01:09.780> dip<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> drop<00:01:10.830> every<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.430> often

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
rate does dip and drop every so often

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
rate does dip and drop every so often
but<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.590> needs<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.830> bit

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
but I think it really just needs a bit

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.890 
but I think it really just needs a bit
of<00:01:14.010> optimization<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.600> extra

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
of optimization really a bit of extra

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.920 
of optimization really a bit of extra
optimization<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.450> most<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> time

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
optimization you can see most the time

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
optimization you can see most the time
the<00:01:18.990> frame<00:01:19.229> rates<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.890> solid<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> does

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the frame rates really solid but it does

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
the frame rates really solid but it does
have<00:01:21.210> its<00:01:21.360> odd<00:01:21.479> moments<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> will

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
have its odd moments where it will

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.940 
have its odd moments where it will
judder<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> little<00:01:23.850> bit<00:01:24.710> especially<00:01:25.710> when

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
judder out a little bit especially when

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.050 
judder out a little bit especially when
there's<00:01:26.100> lot<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.250> action<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
there's lot of action going on on the

there's lot of action going on on the
