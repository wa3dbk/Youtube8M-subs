00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.790 
it last night the axles are in great
shape<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:09.390> swing<00:02:09.690> arms<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.110> great<00:02:10.289> shape<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
shape this swing arms in great shape and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.839 
shape this swing arms in great shape and
this<00:02:10.979> ball<00:02:11.220> joints<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> great<00:02:11.910> shape

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
this ball joints in great shape

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.170 
this ball joints in great shape
the<00:02:13.629> bearings<00:02:14.080> on<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.470> side<00:02:14.909> one<00:02:15.909> so<00:02:16.060> if<00:02:16.120> you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the bearings on that side one so if you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.819 
the bearings on that side one so if you
can<00:02:16.360> see<00:02:16.959> probably<00:02:17.110> won't<00:02:17.349> be<00:02:17.439> able<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.590> sorry

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
can see probably won't be able to sorry

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.380 
can see probably won't be able to sorry
I'm<00:02:17.920> shaking<00:02:18.099> so<00:02:18.280> much<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:18.909> the<00:02:19.060> bearings

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
I'm shaking so much but the bearings

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.520 
I'm shaking so much but the bearings
they<00:02:20.049> just<00:02:20.379> grind<00:02:20.890> ever<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:21.730> slightly<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
they just grind ever so slightly and you

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.710 
they just grind ever so slightly and you
know<00:02:23.620> bearings<00:02:23.950> are<00:02:24.129> cheap<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:25.090> figured<00:02:25.659> I'd

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
know bearings are cheap so I figured I'd

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.170 
know bearings are cheap so I figured I'd
go<00:02:25.870> ahead<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.110> replace<00:02:26.409> them<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.970> other

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
go ahead and replace them on the other

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.930 
go ahead and replace them on the other
side<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.590> bearings<00:02:33.280> I'm<00:02:33.519> gonna<00:02:33.670> go<00:02:33.790> ahead

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
side the the bearings I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.490 
side the the bearings I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:34.060> replace<00:02:34.269> them<00:02:34.540> too<00:02:34.720> since<00:02:35.019> it's<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.290> cheap

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and replace them too since it's a cheap

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.030 
and replace them too since it's a cheap
thing<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.769> do<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:37.019> but<00:02:38.019> but<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.530> ball<00:02:38.709> joint

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
thing to do and but but the ball joint

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.149 
thing to do and but but the ball joint

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
itself is jacked up on the other side

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.770 
itself is jacked up on the other side
and<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.329> thing<00:02:43.599> is<00:02:43.810> riveted<00:02:44.379> to<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.859> a<00:02:45.780> arm
