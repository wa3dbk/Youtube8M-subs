finished up my second two barrel
aquaponic<00:02:11.239> system<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.489> true<00:02:13.790> quarter

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
aquaponic system it's a true quarter

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.860 
aquaponic system it's a true quarter
barrel<00:02:14.329> if<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:15.560> look<00:02:15.709> down<00:02:15.890> at<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.190> bottom<00:02:16.400> of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
barrel if you look down at the bottom of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.140 
barrel if you look down at the bottom of
the<00:02:17.870> barrel<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.260> cut<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.799> at<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.120> at<00:02:20.120> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the barrel we cut just at the at the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.020 
the barrel we cut just at the at the
bottom<00:02:20.569> edge<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.220> first<00:02:22.220> line<00:02:22.489> there<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
bottom edge of that first line there the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.589 
bottom edge of that first line there the
first<00:02:23.569> little<00:02:23.750> bulge<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.400> made<00:02:25.400> made<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.390> two

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
first little bulge and made made the two

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.330 
first little bulge and made made the two
sections<00:02:27.310> we've<00:02:28.310> made<00:02:28.489> some<00:02:28.640> improvements

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
sections we've made some improvements

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.129 
sections we've made some improvements
now<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> have<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.850> design<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.720> quite

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.139 
now I have in the design it's quite

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.620 
now I have in the design it's quite
similar<00:02:33.620> but<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.030> couple<00:02:35.209> things<00:02:35.420> we

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
similar but just a couple things we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.680 
similar but just a couple things we
wanted<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.290> extra<00:02:36.440> space<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:38.239> grow<00:02:38.420> beds

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
wanted the extra space in the grow beds

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.490 
wanted the extra space in the grow beds
for<00:02:39.079> root<00:02:39.560> depth<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.989> were<00:02:42.079> able<00:02:42.230> this

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
for root depth and we were able this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.059 
for root depth and we were able this
time<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:43.549> find<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.910> smaller<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.769> smaller

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
time to find the smaller the smaller

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.020 
time to find the smaller the smaller
gravel<00:02:46.970> our<00:02:47.239> smaller<00:02:47.600> lava<00:02:48.530> rock<00:02:48.769> gravel<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
gravel our smaller lava rock gravel the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.780 
gravel our smaller lava rock gravel the
other<00:02:50.150> was<00:02:50.329> just<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.540> little<00:02:50.660> bit<00:02:50.840> too<00:02:50.989> large<00:02:51.200> I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
other was just a little bit too large I

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.059 
other was just a little bit too large I
also<00:02:52.790> change<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.810> plumbing<00:02:54.319> just<00:02:54.829> a<00:02:54.920> little

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
also change the plumbing just a little

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.949 
also change the plumbing just a little
bit<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.579> one<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:57.370> everything<00:02:58.370> is

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
bit in this one and that everything is

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.830 
bit in this one and that everything is
inside<00:02:59.959> here<00:03:01.120> instead<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.180> anything<00:03:02.660> being

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
inside here instead of anything being

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.750 
inside here instead of anything being
out<00:03:02.989> here<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.470> leaves<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.769> very<00:03:04.040> nice<00:03:04.280> open

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
out here so it leaves a very nice open

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.720 
out here so it leaves a very nice open

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
am using 11 drain hole now in case

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.770 
am using 11 drain hole now in case
anything<00:03:12.019> if<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.130> goes<00:03:13.310> out<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:14.299> power<00:03:14.510> goes

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
anything if it goes out the power goes

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.110 
anything if it goes out the power goes
out<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.260> dead<00:03:15.560> will<00:03:15.799> drain<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:16.970> leave

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
out the dead will drain and just leave

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.460 
out the dead will drain and just leave
the<00:03:17.209> moisture<00:03:17.569> for<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.810> plants<00:03:18.109> but<00:03:18.260> without

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
the moisture for the plants but without

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.970 
the moisture for the plants but without
drowning<00:03:18.739> them<00:03:20.319> also<00:03:21.319> quite<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.680> bit<00:03:21.859> more

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
drowning them also quite a bit more

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.379 
drowning them also quite a bit more
elegant<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:23.450> design<00:03:24.970> figured<00:03:25.970> out<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.269> we

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
elegant in design figured out that we

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.809 
elegant in design figured out that we
really<00:03:26.750> didn't<00:03:26.989> need<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.230> two<00:03:27.410> at<00:03:27.650> all<00:03:27.819> just

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
really didn't need the two at all just

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.129 
really didn't need the two at all just
kind<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.090> balancing<00:03:29.540> thing<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:29.930> we<00:03:30.019> just

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
kind of a balancing thing but we just

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.759 
kind of a balancing thing but we just
have<00:03:30.349> one<00:03:30.700> one<00:03:31.700> valve<00:03:32.000> now<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.660> we're<00:03:33.590> using

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
have one one valve now and we're using

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.120 
have one one valve now and we're using
half<00:03:34.129> inch

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
half inch

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.290 
half inch

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
up on top coming from the pump and into

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.540 
up on top coming from the pump and into

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
into the beds as you can see half inch

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.140 
into the beds as you can see half inch
tubing<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:46.650> only<00:03:46.830> thing<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.220> kept<00:03:47.520> really

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
tubing the only thing that I kept really

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.210 
tubing the only thing that I kept really
quite<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.540> same<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:50.040> still<00:03:50.310> am<00:03:50.520> using<00:03:50.850> the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
quite the same is I still am using the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.730 
quite the same is I still am using the
standard<00:03:53.220> water<00:03:53.670> hose<00:03:53.910> attachment<00:03:54.690> for<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
standard water hose attachment for the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.140 
standard water hose attachment for the
siphon<00:03:56.370> loop<00:03:56.580> as<00:03:56.930> it<00:03:57.930> comes<00:03:58.170> down<00:03:59.000> inside<00:04:00.000> of

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
siphon loop as it comes down inside of

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.240 
siphon loop as it comes down inside of
there<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.570> little<00:04:00.900> difficult<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.470> see<00:04:01.710> and<00:04:02.160> it

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
there a little difficult to see and it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.210 
there a little difficult to see and it
goes<00:04:03.380> into<00:04:05.720> water<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.840> we're<00:04:07.530> using<00:04:07.710> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
goes into water and we're using the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.820 
goes into water and we're using the
one-inch<00:04:08.840> as<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.050> can<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:11.510> PVC<00:04:12.510> tubing<00:04:13.160> for

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
one-inch as you can see PVC tubing for

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.410 
one-inch as you can see PVC tubing for
each<00:04:16.830> drain<00:04:17.480> so<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:20.040> really<00:04:20.190> keeps<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.180> lot<00:04:21.330> of

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
each drain so that really keeps a lot of

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.850 
each drain so that really keeps a lot of
the<00:04:21.480> problems<00:04:21.840> now<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.200> drains<00:04:22.530> very

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
the problems now that drains very

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.370 
the problems now that drains very
effectively<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.400> quickly<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.230> fills<00:04:25.230> up

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
effectively and quickly and fills up

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.160 
effectively and quickly and fills up
slowly<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:28.100> looks<00:04:29.100> as<00:04:29.280> if<00:04:29.310> with<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.170> lava

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
slowly so it looks as if with the lava

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.880 
slowly so it looks as if with the lava
rock<00:04:31.470> in<00:04:31.620> place<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.100> displaces<00:04:33.620> quite<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> bit

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
rock in place it displaces quite a bit

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.410 
rock in place it displaces quite a bit
these<00:04:35.850> are<00:04:37.160> goes<00:04:38.160> up<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.460> about<00:04:38.490> 15<00:04:39.000> gallons

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
these are goes up to about 15 gallons

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.440 
these are goes up to about 15 gallons
and<00:04:39.570> that's<00:04:39.690> where<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:39.990> have<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.260> set<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:42.090> 15

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
and that's where we have it set the 15

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.570 
and that's where we have it set the 15
gallon<00:04:42.810> mark<00:04:42.960> if<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.040> look<00:04:44.220> at<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.340> water

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
gallon mark if you look at the water

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.260 
gallon mark if you look at the water
level<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.630> other<00:04:45.780> things<00:04:46.520> but<00:04:47.520> each<00:04:47.790> 15

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
level and the other things but each 15

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.810 
level and the other things but each 15
gallons<00:04:48.750> with<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.170> rocks<00:04:49.440> in<00:04:49.710> place<00:04:49.980> it's

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
gallons with the rocks in place it's

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:00.740 
gallons with the rocks in place it's
only<00:04:52.160> displacing<00:04:54.110> right<00:04:55.110> at<00:04:57.560> 10<00:04:58.560> gallons<00:04:59.750> it's

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
only displacing right at 10 gallons it's

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.350 
only displacing right at 10 gallons it's
50<00:05:01.140> gallons<00:05:01.500> at<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.980> moment<00:05:02.310> full<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:03.060> it

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
50 gallons at the moment full and it

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.780 
50 gallons at the moment full and it
goes<00:05:03.510> down<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.720> about<00:05:04.170> 40<00:05:05.780> about<00:05:06.780> 40<00:05:07.110> gallons

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
goes down to about 40 about 40 gallons

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.200 
goes down to about 40 about 40 gallons
as<00:05:08.790> it<00:05:09.000> drops<00:05:09.240> down<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.250> still<00:05:11.580> leaving<00:05:11.880> 40

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
as it drops down and so still leaving 40

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.230 
as it drops down and so still leaving 40
gallons<00:05:12.540> each<00:05:12.720> cycle<00:05:13.230> for<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.980> fish<00:05:14.240> inside

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
gallons each cycle for the fish inside

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.780 
gallons each cycle for the fish inside
so<00:05:15.900> that's<00:05:16.080> working<00:05:16.380> really<00:05:16.500> well<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:17.010> cycles

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
so that's working really well it cycles

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.850 
so that's working really well it cycles
about<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.120> every<00:05:18.390> 11<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:19.080> 12<00:05:19.320> minutes<00:05:19.560> I

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
about it every 11 to 12 minutes I

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.350 
about it every 11 to 12 minutes I
believe<00:05:20.130> that<00:05:20.160> was<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.490> time<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:21.060> got<00:05:21.210> on

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
believe that was the time that I got on

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.010 
believe that was the time that I got on
it<00:05:21.480> so<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.650> flood<00:05:22.860> drain<00:05:23.130> cycle<00:05:23.370> of<00:05:23.640> every<00:05:24.020> 11

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
it so the flood drain cycle of every 11

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.540 
it so the flood drain cycle of every 11
to<00:05:25.080> 12<00:05:25.290> minutes<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:27.830> soda<00:05:28.830> siphon<00:05:29.190> Lucas

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
to 12 minutes and soda siphon Lucas

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.679 
to 12 minutes and soda siphon Lucas
comes

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:30.689 
comes

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.669 
comes
in<00:05:30.959> the<00:05:31.110> back<00:05:31.349> and<00:05:31.679> we<00:05:32.189> put<00:05:32.759> just<00:05:32.969> a<00:05:33.059> simple

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:33.679 
in the back and we put just a simple

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:38.509 
in the back and we put just a simple
connector<00:05:34.679> there<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:35.689> conduit<00:05:36.689> holder<00:05:37.309> just<00:05:38.309> to

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:38.519 
connector there a conduit holder just to

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.169 
connector there a conduit holder just to
set<00:05:39.119> the<00:05:39.149> level<00:05:39.599> of<00:05:40.279> everything<00:05:41.279> packed

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:42.179 
set the level of everything packed

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:45.589 
set the level of everything packed
that's<00:05:42.389> about<00:05:42.629> to<00:05:42.809> go<00:05:43.579> and<00:05:44.579> you'll<00:05:45.149> see<00:05:45.329> how<00:05:45.479> it

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
that's about to go and you'll see how it

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:54.249 
that's about to go and you'll see how it
starts<00:05:50.179> does<00:05:51.179> it's<00:05:51.389> a<00:05:51.479> little<00:05:52.099> trickle<00:05:53.099> thing

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
starts does it's a little trickle thing

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.549 
starts does it's a little trickle thing
and<00:05:55.259> it<00:05:55.559> takes<00:05:55.769> it<00:05:55.889> just<00:05:55.919> a<00:05:56.189> little<00:05:56.219> dip<00:05:57.559> and

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 
and it takes it just a little dip and

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:03.109 
and it takes it just a little dip and
keep<00:05:59.219> watching<00:05:59.399> this<00:05:59.610> and<00:05:59.879> go<00:06:00.089> to<00:06:01.079> edit<00:06:01.469> I<00:06:02.119> know

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:03.119 
keep watching this and go to edit I know

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:05.139 
keep watching this and go to edit I know
this<00:06:03.449> is<00:06:03.599> kind<00:06:03.809> of<00:06:03.839> like<00:06:03.929> wanting<00:06:04.379> watching

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:05.149 
this is kind of like wanting watching

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.919 
this is kind of like wanting watching
water<00:06:06.149> boil<00:06:06.449> in<00:06:07.079> the<00:06:07.289> pot<00:06:07.529> on<00:06:07.769> the<00:06:07.919> stove<00:06:08.129> but

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:08.929 
water boil in the pot on the stove but

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.209 
water boil in the pot on the stove but
just<00:06:09.929> to<00:06:10.050> show<00:06:10.079> you<00:06:10.289> how<00:06:10.529> long<00:06:10.709> it<00:06:10.860> really<00:06:11.069> does

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
just to show you how long it really does

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:12.529 
just to show you how long it really does
think<00:06:11.429> easily<00:06:11.819> when<00:06:11.969> it's<00:06:12.089> set<00:06:12.269> correctly

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
think easily when it's set correctly

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.100 
think easily when it's set correctly
there<00:06:12.869> it<00:06:12.959> went<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:14.099> now<00:06:14.339> we<00:06:15.239> have<00:06:15.269> really<00:06:15.869> hot

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
there it went so now we have really hot

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.879 
there it went so now we have really hot
ice<00:06:16.289> cream<00:06:16.589> and<00:06:16.860> that<00:06:17.819> is<00:06:18.289> both<00:06:19.289> aerating

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
ice cream and that is both aerating

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.149 
ice cream and that is both aerating
really<00:06:20.159> really<00:06:20.429> nicely<00:06:20.639> as<00:06:20.909> you<00:06:20.999> can<00:06:21.269> see<00:06:22.159> the

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
really really nicely as you can see the

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.009 
really really nicely as you can see the
fish<00:06:23.369> and<00:06:23.759> small<00:06:23.969> systems<00:06:24.479> like<00:06:24.599> this<00:06:24.809> is

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:25.019 
fish and small systems like this is

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.109 
fish and small systems like this is
really<00:06:25.439> a<00:06:25.679> lot<00:06:26.009> of<00:06:26.249> water<00:06:26.459> movement<00:06:26.729> and

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:27.119 
really a lot of water movement and

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.389 
really a lot of water movement and
aeration<00:06:27.449> and<00:06:27.779> so<00:06:28.769> that's<00:06:28.979> what<00:06:29.159> I'm<00:06:29.249> not

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:29.399 
aeration and so that's what I'm not

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:31.909 
aeration and so that's what I'm not
tempting<00:06:29.729> to<00:06:29.759> do<00:06:29.969> also<00:06:30.689> put<00:06:31.019> an<00:06:31.110> aerator<00:06:31.469> in

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
tempting to do also put an aerator in

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:37.549 
tempting to do also put an aerator in
these<00:06:32.189> and<00:06:32.749> they<00:06:33.749> set<00:06:34.429> underneath<00:06:36.319> in<00:06:37.319> this

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:37.559 
these and they set underneath in this

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:41.029 
these and they set underneath in this
area<00:06:37.919> here<00:06:38.659> so<00:06:39.659> you<00:06:39.749> can<00:06:39.989> see<00:06:40.019> run<00:06:40.739> in<00:06:40.860> there

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
area here so you can see run in there

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.589 
area here so you can see run in there
the<00:06:42.409> air<00:06:43.409> pump<00:06:43.789> and<00:06:44.789> will<00:06:44.909> be<00:06:44.999> hooking<00:06:45.269> up<00:06:45.389> that

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
the air pump and will be hooking up that

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.079 
the air pump and will be hooking up that
a<00:06:45.839> little<00:06:46.709> bit<00:06:46.769> later<00:06:46.979> today<00:06:47.219> so<00:06:47.819> it's<00:06:47.969> going
