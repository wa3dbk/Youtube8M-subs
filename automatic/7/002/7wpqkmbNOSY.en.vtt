00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:09.730
 Ze's Hello Hello everyone Long time no see So also new Curse this time 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:15.219
 I think that I want to do that constructs related 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:19.449
 First of all, I would like to create a topic and pickle this time and carry out recovery of obsidian stones . 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.510
 Speaking of which , some diamonds were mined in the last part 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.350
 That's right 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.380
 I just want to add a fast hand to industrialization but the Nether opening 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.550
 Until the lava removal work by the pump starts 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.200
 Since the industrial Mod thing is like that you might not touch 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 The audience who is looking forward to the industrial mod will wait a little more 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:45.410
 Yes yes then look at the screen what are you doing now 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.410
 I 'm making a pickaxe with Cobble only. 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.550
 It was possible 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.630
 Oh yeah this red colored book is like a detailed recipe when creating various tools 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.040
 Thing 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:04.890
 Although translated into Japanese in some places, it is difficult to understand 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:09.150
 The contents described are what tools have what kind of performance or which materials 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.370
 What kind of effect can you get if you add it? 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.840
 There are many other things in addition to the effect that can be obtained that is described below 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:23.689
 Thank you for watching wiki 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 Well then , I would like to make a solid ball using the solid waste collected last time 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:31.939
 It seems that it is the material of the additional effect that I wrote earlier and completed it 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.360
 I think you can see who you saw 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.830
 Jasper has the effect of auto repairing tools 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.350
 There is no need to remake 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.350
 Do you mean it it's fine in luxury 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.790
 Because there is too much iron ore, it is made into ingot &amp; block 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.840
 It would be pretty easy if we could automate this smelting furnace 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840
 It is really so 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:06.780
 I upgraded my pool station because I had enough time to make a glimpse 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.940
 Three metal block four Koike brick block is what you need 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.970
 It is Foods station 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 Or immediately installed and what kind of tool was completed will take a look at what has been added 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:25.790
 Oh-some oddly shaped tools have been added 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.790
 The cost of the necessary materials is also large , so I want to make something quickly 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.349
 Then do you make an iron crane bridge 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.349
 And square and craft an iron ingot 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.910
 Metal-based Speaking Aso there can not be why processing is I did I make in the way of refining furnace 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.910
 Exchange one 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.640
 Installation 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:58.500
 I wonder if not melt still early'll not solved does not come out 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.420
 As iron ore melted, we made shape of material of Tsuruhashi 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.040
 Production stage 's a stability of cut 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.250
 done 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.909
 Well then, this iron only jade on Tsuruhashi 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.950
 Add 3 effects of Red Stone Diamond 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:20.560
 I Redstone has increased eggs and mining level of mining rate was increased 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.849
 That's right I forgot, but you can only add up to three effects per tool 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.030
 Probably 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.940
 If there is no limit 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.620
 Because it is a cheat tool 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:34.780
 I do not know in detail, but there seems to be a way to increase the effect slot 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.760
 Well one to be worried is to talk to please try to take the confirmation in reference to the wiki 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.080
 It was completed at home 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.890
 What is this feeling of goodness 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:47.450
 Then we went to branch mining behavior and arrived 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.660
 Do you want to recover one pattern of obsidian ? 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.090
 I'll tell you earlier but I won't push anything 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.620
 a completely it because Marisa is not not is Ne unwillingly also want the viewer's boring 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.930
 so 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.209
 Hey Is 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.900
 Finally we were able to recover , or did obsidian correspond to my all? 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:10.049
 Well I think I'm comfortable this person is able to recover to gulp 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.450
 Or even not you have collected 34 pieces at once 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.199
 Will need more tools to create a picture is still less by Pinker construct 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.920
 Because 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.800
 Let's make it black 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.800
 It is the case of place only, but only I love it 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:32.310
 It is quite small, but if it is not enough again, I should come back to the collection so I can not go home 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.200
 me 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:43.230
 I will use this piece of obsidian to make a mouth . 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:46.380
 House it can be drilled if I put 3've got something that was said of the block at a time 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.490
 A perfect tool for branch mining fabrics 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.300
 Method Yes I wonder it's fine to use likely tool 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.509
 So this time obsidian only 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.750
 I want to make a bloody aka hammer 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.750
 It's a place that is processed into parts to be the material is now 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.450
 You consumed 24 hammers of obsidian 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:13.040
 This hurts and it is certainly expensive 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:18.610
 It was 27 consumption that was not made Aeno part 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.610
 Either way, it's expensive so line up the parts 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.780
 It is good 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.610
 Add jasper red stone to hammer 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:34.800
 This will increase the level 3 mining speed for this hammer 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:39.330
 And a quick change to the branch mining dedicated hammer got the automatic repair function 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.830
 Tsuruhashi will not be used if it goes out of use 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:48.070
 Maybe the hammer comes with my all feature 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:51.190
 I think there is no such thing or something config if I can cope 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.970
 I think that I want to stay as it is now because it is too Ze 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.970
 got it 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.660
 me 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.050
 Then the basement expansion double speed 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.470
 I would like to make a comment barbs Well then 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.860
 With the power of the show of the whole series 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:14.169
 Also try to put a mod you can use this time 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.800
 I do not know because mods such as Arsmagika have not introduced and experienced by myself yet 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.200
 Ne 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.370
 today 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:23.810
 It is an editing group that I would like to introduce if the sea side 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.900
 Me went also seen the future ze I thank you I support you 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.889
 Followed by the industrialization mod Honyarara 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.430
 Who are the ones who bought in the previous series ? 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.969
 It's different. It 's about the jade that came out in this video 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.779
 Hmm 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:43.729
 I made an Arai list and I made it 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:48.619
 Look at the result , it's 2nd edition The growth of editing technology is great 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:54.990
 Straw I'm slowly doing Sabo music so I just edit 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:58.680
 Thank you also recently posted another series of videos I support you 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:02.370

 I've been waiting for you Enca Constructed and put a Micra Crash 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:14.670
 That the remaining I N'o waiting to and we gave up without luck try please the other Mod influence was 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.009
 Because there is also a thing, it seals 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.830
