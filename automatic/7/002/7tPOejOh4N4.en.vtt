00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.820 

the<00:00:03.360> log<00:00:03.540> here<00:00:03.780> poses<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.200> great<00:00:04.440> bit<00:00:04.649> more

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
the log here poses a great bit more

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.230 
the log here poses a great bit more
difficulty<00:00:05.430> than<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.609> culprit<00:00:05.970> we<00:00:06.060> just

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
difficulty than the culprit we just

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.480 
difficulty than the culprit we just
rolled<00:00:06.420> over<00:00:06.689> the<00:00:07.319> biggest<00:00:07.649> problem<00:00:07.979> is<00:00:08.160> it's

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
rolled over the biggest problem is it's

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.030 
rolled over the biggest problem is it's
unsupported<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.650> higher<00:00:10.650> off<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.889> ground

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
unsupported it's higher off the ground

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.860 
unsupported it's higher off the ground
and<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> be<00:00:12.299> pretty<00:00:12.389> slippery

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
and it's going to be pretty slippery

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.010 
and it's going to be pretty slippery
because<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.200> organic<00:00:13.589> so<00:00:14.809> we<00:00:15.809> need<00:00:15.929> to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
because it's organic so we need to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.710 
because it's organic so we need to
assess<00:00:16.350> how<00:00:16.860> to<00:00:16.920> get<00:00:17.100> over<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.510> lease

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
assess how to get over it with the lease

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.609 
assess how to get over it with the lease
you<00:00:19.050> know<00:00:20.210> possibility<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.390> Smashing<00:00:22.349> or<00:00:22.470> bike

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you know possibility of Smashing or bike

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.040 
you know possibility of Smashing or bike
against<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:24.300> know<00:00:24.330> slipping<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
against it and you know slipping out and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
against it and you know slipping out and
falling<00:00:25.289> over<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.429> obvious<00:00:26.550> line

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
falling over so the obvious line

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.160 
falling over so the obvious line
straight<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> middle<00:00:27.509> but<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.019> much

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
straight down the middle but it's much

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
straight down the middle but it's much
higher<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.769> much<00:00:29.220> less<00:00:29.670> supported<00:00:30.119> there

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
higher not much less supported there

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
higher not much less supported there
than<00:00:30.509> it<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.660> over<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> side<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:31.859> sides

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
than it is over to the side the sides

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
than it is over to the side the sides
still<00:00:32.310> on<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> trail<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.910> well<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.990> what<00:00:34.140> we're

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
still on the trail as well so what we're

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
still on the trail as well so what we're
going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.560> is<00:00:34.680> we're<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.130> up<00:00:35.450> go

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
going to do is we're going to go up go

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.700 
going to do is we're going to go up go
over<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.840> side<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.540> safely<00:00:40.500> clean

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
over the side and you know safely clean

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.050 
over the side and you know safely clean
this<00:00:40.830> object<00:00:41.220> that<00:00:41.310> otherwise<00:00:41.640> would<00:00:41.820> force

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
this object that otherwise would force

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.770 
this object that otherwise would force
us<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> walk<00:00:43.220> to<00:00:44.220> roll<00:00:44.490> up<00:00:44.720> try<00:00:45.720> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
us to have to walk to roll up try to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.150 
us to have to walk to roll up try to
make<00:00:45.900> sure<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.110> hit<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.410> 90<00:00:46.680> degree<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
make sure we hit it at 90 degree if you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160 
make sure we hit it at 90 degree if you
pick<00:00:47.790> up<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> front<00:00:48.180> wheel<00:00:48.420> pick<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:48.990> back

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
pick up the front wheel pick up the back

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.300 
pick up the front wheel pick up the back
wheel<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:50.460> we're<00:00:50.580> on<00:00:50.670> our<00:00:50.790> way<00:00:50.900> so<00:00:52.100> if<00:00:53.100> we're

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
wheel and we're on our way so if we're

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.650 
wheel and we're on our way so if we're
faced<00:00:53.490> with<00:00:53.610> an<00:00:53.880> obstacle<00:00:54.150> like<00:00:54.330> this<00:00:54.510> going

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
faced with an obstacle like this going

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
faced with an obstacle like this going
downhill<00:00:55.370> we<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.490> some<00:00:56.760> added<00:00:57.210> options

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
downhill we have some added options

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.560 
downhill we have some added options
because<00:00:57.990> we<00:00:58.110> have<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.260> momentum<00:00:59.570> going

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
because we have more momentum going

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
because we have more momentum going
downhill<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.320> might<00:01:02.040> be<00:01:02.220> you<00:01:02.610> know<00:01:02.700> best<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
downhill it might be you know best to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.990 
downhill it might be you know best to
just<00:01:03.450> lean<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.070> bit<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.729> even

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
just lean back a little bit and not even

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.789 
just lean back a little bit and not even
let<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> front<00:01:06.420> wheel<00:01:06.600> hit<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.929> to<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.619> pop

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
let the front wheel hit it to just pop

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.410 
let the front wheel hit it to just pop
over<00:01:08.009> it<00:01:08.219> if<00:01:08.609> you<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.149> have<00:01:09.179> to<00:01:09.299> be

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
over it if you do that you have to be

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.990 
over it if you do that you have to be
prepared<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.899> back<00:01:10.079> wheel<00:01:10.289> picking<00:01:10.619> up

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
prepared for the back wheel picking up

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
prepared for the back wheel picking up
but<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> also<00:01:12.270> gives<00:01:12.509> us<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.840> bit<00:01:13.020> more

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
but it also gives us a little bit more

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.679 
but it also gives us a little bit more
momentum<00:01:13.460> rolling<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.700> momentum<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.299> always

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
momentum rolling over momentum is always

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.289 
momentum rolling over momentum is always
our<00:01:15.840> friends<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.350> long<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.429> we<00:01:17.609> just<00:01:17.850> keep<00:01:18.119> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
our friends as long as we just keep in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.020 
our friends as long as we just keep in
mind<00:01:18.710> where<00:01:19.710> our<00:01:19.859> Center<00:01:20.159> masses<00:01:20.670> in

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
mind where our Center masses in

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
mind where our Center masses in
relations<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> wheels<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.859> if<00:01:22.950> we're

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
relations to the wheels so if we're

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.069 
relations to the wheels so if we're
coming<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.969> want<00:01:24.719> to<00:01:24.780> move<00:01:24.929> my

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
coming down this I want to move my

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.919 
coming down this I want to move my
weight<00:01:26.039> back<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.170> down<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.929> logs

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
weight back and down because that logs

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.620 
weight back and down because that logs
gonna<00:01:31.109> try<00:01:31.319> to<00:01:31.409> kick<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.920> front<00:01:32.159> end<00:01:32.249> up<00:01:32.630> so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
gonna try to kick my front end up so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.410 
gonna try to kick my front end up so
roll<00:01:34.469> at<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.859> once<00:01:35.700> again<00:01:35.819> over<00:01:36.149> here<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.359> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
roll at it once again over here on the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.599 
roll at it once again over here on the
side<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:40.969> we've<00:01:41.969> basically<00:01:42.179> just<00:01:42.630> completely

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
side and we've basically just completely

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.459 
side and we've basically just completely
completely<00:01:44.609> cleared<00:01:44.999> the<00:01:45.240> obstacle<00:01:45.719> we<00:01:46.350> have

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
completely cleared the obstacle we have

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.330 
completely cleared the obstacle we have
very<00:01:46.859> minimal<00:01:47.429> input<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.479> right<00:01:49.409> over<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
very minimal input just right over and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
very minimal input just right over and
you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.579> I'm<00:01:50.850> prepared<00:01:51.240> I'm<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.810> sort
