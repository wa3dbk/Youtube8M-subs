00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.970
 new road video with 'la yo hoy 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.000
 I'm here to talk about attention 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.019
 when it comes to buying facial cosmetics 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.969
 of buying facial care and I thought 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 very interesting this topic and as I already know 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.960
 had advance in other videos had 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.880
 I want to do it and I'm going to do it from 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 our point of view as clients 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.560
 since good has been a little bit more 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.330
 popular and I think it's very 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.330
 important many times when we go to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.309
 buy a facial cosmetic product 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.840
 and we do not want that product later 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.450
 we realize that she does not like us 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.980
 when we get home we tend to blame 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.770
 to the person who sells us good many 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 Sometimes it's us because sometimes 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.760
 when we go to buy facial cosmetics 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.489
 we are not clear when we explain 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.879
 our needs or we do not clarify 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.550
 or many times we do not have enough 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.410
 left hand to say what 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.629
 we want and what we do not want and many 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 times like we get carried away by the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.410
 person who sells us and later is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.180
 when we realize this product 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.090
 It's not what I want or what I do 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.770
 I need so good it 's important that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.359
 let's know that it's us who 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 we pay and it is us who 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.130
 we will have to have control of that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 sale to not take us then so many 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 arrests and as to how should 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.020
 should be treated as operating a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.179
 correct recommendation I 'm going to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 talk about the ideal conditions is 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.409
 say of those conditions in which 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.289
 we have time the person who 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 It sells us there is time there are many 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.759
 products available so that we can 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.700
 prove there are samples of course and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.039
 also and we know more or less 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.929
 what we want in the first place the 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.239
 person who sells us should be very 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.039
 willing to listen to us and should not 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:50.489
 take note in writing but good to take 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.819
 mental note of many data that we give him 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:55.409
 to make a correct recommendation in 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.119
 first place I think it's very 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.219
 important to ask the person 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.890
 on his skin I think that at first glance 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.379
 it is impossible to know what a skin looks like 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.629
 because the skin changed a lot changes to 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:08.970
 throughout the day it changes according to what 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:11.880
 that we apply and change 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.220
 with the state of the year with the weather with 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.960
 thousands of reasons therefore it is 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.870
 important to ask the client is 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.490
 important to ask us 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.130
 what kind of skin do we have if we do not 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.950
 we know some questions that can 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.510
 do or what they should do to us is when 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.660
 we make up how much they take in 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.660
 appear brightness or after leaving 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.000
 from the shower to what extent can we 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.760
 hold on to the skin without it 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.820
 too tight for example they would not be 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.890
 a series of important questions to the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.209
 Time to meet our type of skin 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.520
 next question that I think is 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.410
 very very important is to ask ourselves what 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.600
 we are worried about our skin or what 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.250
 needs we want to cover for example 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.010
 may be the expression lines 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.110
 may be the spots may be missing 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.720
 of luminosity we may have a 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.060
 acne we may have skin very 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.030
 dry and descamada this is very important 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.330
 because depending on that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.970
 will direct the sale and will direct the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.170
 recommendation so I think it's very 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.569
 important that 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.489
 and we are able to express what they are 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.080
 our needs and what worries us 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.150
 of our skin the next question 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.970
 that I think is very very important is 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.340
 ask us what is our routine 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.290
 facial is to say what products we use 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.709
 whether they are from the brand that they are 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.069
 selling or not as much cleaners as 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.380
 exfoliating masks serum creams their 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.900
 contours of eyes is very important that 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.180
 let's say everything we use everything 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.800
 that we have that we do not use everything 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.720
 that we have used that has not 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.120
 liked what kind of textures we 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.239
 interesting what kind of textures do we not 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.760
 like for nothing and in that way that 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.830
 person may be discarding products 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.860
 that we do not like or that we do not need or 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.500
 others so that it is not so long and it does not 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.480
 dilate so much the process is to say when 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.940
 we explain correctly how 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 It is our routine and what products do not we 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.019
 like we are saving time to the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.209
 person who is selling us another topic 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.190
 that I think is very important is that 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.750
 We ask for our lifestyle 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.419
 that is, what kind of food 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.410
 we do if we take some complement 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.480
 food 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.730
 if we take any medication that can 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.350
 affect our skin or how it reacts 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.570
 Our skin 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.090
 if we have some pathology 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.550
 disease that can be reflected in 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.250
 symptoms on our skin that's very 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.440
 important and also that we talk about 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.690
 allergies or if any product has given us 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.480
 reaction so that person can 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.390
 avoid this type of products or if by 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.580
 example there are certain medications 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.310
 that compel us to use protection 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.080
 solar well that way that way 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.790
 person could recommend us by 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.370
 example a moisturizer with a good 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.320
 good sun protection well once 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.690
 the person who is selling us has 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.790
 all that information knows more or less 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.220
 our skin type knows more or less 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.710
 what concerns and needs do you have 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.290
 our skin knows more or less what 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.270
 we use and we do not like and in addition 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.340
 know our lifestyle how we 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.380
 we feed how they affect us 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.300
 hormones and others it 's important to talk 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.550
 of the budget it is important to talk about 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.530
 how much money do we spend on creams and 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.720
 how much money do we want to invest in a 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.780
 new treatment a new product 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.150
 often people ask me if he deserves 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.880
 It's worth spending a lot of money a cream 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.660
 or not good I always compare the 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.400
 facials with cars 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.490
 Obviously it is not the same to have a 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.030
 bmw latest model with all the extras 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.010
 to have a seat panda from the 70s 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.080
 Good thing it has no closure 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.820
 centralized the two will take us to 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.580
 the sites are both going to serve us 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.530
 two can move around a city but 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.840
 each one will bring us different 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.940
 things and with the creams it happens a bit 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.920
 similar and many times if we're 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.410
 accustomed to a certain range a 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.720
 very high range we will find it strange 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.820
 or we're not going to like using a 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.460
 lower range so good I always 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.400
 I say that to cover needs a little 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.990
 any type of range is useful but not 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.540
 has nothing to do with using a range 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.640
 high with using a low range is a 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.280
 little the philosophy that I have with many 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.250
 exceptions and of course with many 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.050
 buts but good in general terms I 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.849
 I compare a bit with that because I think 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.649
 which is the easiest to understand 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.719
 and here the video I think is very 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:36.509
 important that we know how to 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.709
 consumers what is the information that 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.559
 the person who is not selling 

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:42.330
 have to have to be able to sell us the 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:45.569
 correct products for our skin 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.969
 even so many times for very well that 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.589
 recommend us and no matter how good it is 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.839
 that product for our skin may 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:53.219
 it does not work for us, it may serve us 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.080
 may even give us reaction 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:57.499
 allergic that of course is not the fault of 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.849
 no one is simply that each skin 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:02.939
 reacts in a concrete way and 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:05.159
 different and nothing else I hope that I have 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:07.830
 it seemed interesting the video leave me in 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:09.689
 comments that you have found if you 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.429
 usually tend in this way are usually 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.789
 ask these kinds of questions when you go 

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:17.039
 to buy cosmetics and nothing else I send you 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:20.269
 a very strong kiss and see you in the 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.269
 next video see you later
