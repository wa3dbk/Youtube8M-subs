00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
upgraded adder now because the journey

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.749 
upgraded adder now because the journey
is<00:02:01.619> blocking<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> door<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:02.610> going

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
to see an animation so you will spawn

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780

up and down the road and nighttime you
will<00:02:23.190> eventually<00:02:23.430> find<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.720> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
will eventually find one and then of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
will eventually find one and then of
course<00:02:24.840> when<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.350> do<00:02:25.470> find<00:02:25.770> one<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> next

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
course when you do find one the next

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.800 
course when you do find one the next
step<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.610> simply<00:02:27.000> drive<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.540> her<00:02:27.660> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
step is to simply drive up to her and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.630 
step is to simply drive up to her and
then<00:02:27.960> beep<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.530> her<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.190> she<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:29.430> get

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
then beep at her and then she would get

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.760 
then beep at her and then she would get
into<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.240> vehicle<00:02:30.420> now<00:02:31.260> when<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
hooker inside of the vehicle the next

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.420 
hooker inside of the vehicle the next
step<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.960> turn<00:02:34.350> back<00:02:34.620> around<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.280> want

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
step is to turn back around and you want

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.910 
step is to turn back around and you want
to<00:02:35.490> drive<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> exact<00:02:36.480> location<00:02:36.740> that<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:37.770> am

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
can see the haka will still be inside

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.760 
can see the haka will still be inside
from<00:03:09.660> there<00:03:09.810> simply<00:03:10.080> shoot<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> hooker<00:03:10.650> in

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
from there simply shoot the hooker in

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.290 
from there simply shoot the hooker in
the<00:03:10.800> head<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.250> she<00:03:11.370> would<00:03:11.490> die<00:03:11.670> then<00:03:12.030> get<00:03:12.180> back

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
the head and she would die then get back

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.750 
the head and she would die then get back
into<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.780> vehicle<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.280> act<00:03:14.550> as

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
into the vehicle and this one now act as

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.000 
into the vehicle and this one now act as
a<00:03:14.940> second<00:03:15.420> player<00:03:15.630> as<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.170> see<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.770> dead

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
a second player as you can see the dead

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.530 
a second player as you can see the dead
hooker<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.459> still<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> vehicle<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.450> you

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
hooker is still in the vehicle so you

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.270 
hooker is still in the vehicle so you
can<00:03:18.660> simply<00:03:18.840> drive<00:03:19.290> into<00:03:19.620> your<00:03:19.740> garage<00:03:19.860> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
can simply drive into your garage and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.340 
can simply drive into your garage and
she<00:03:20.820> will<00:03:21.000> still<00:03:21.240> be<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.720> vehicle<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
she will still be in the vehicle so that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.920 
she will still be in the vehicle so that
basically<00:03:22.620> acts<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.520> second<00:03:24.480> player<00:03:24.660> so

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
basically acts as a second player so

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.210 
basically acts as a second player so
from<00:03:25.110> there<00:03:25.290> when<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.560> were<00:03:25.650> inside<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:26.040> your

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
from there when you were inside of your

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.160 
from there when you were inside of your
garage<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.880> hooker<00:03:27.300> will<00:03:27.480> still<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.930> inside

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
garage the hooker will still be inside

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.780 
garage the hooker will still be inside
of<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.560> vehicle<00:03:28.770> which<00:03:29.070> means<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.580> go

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
of the vehicle which means you can go

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.850 
of the vehicle which means you can go
over<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> vehicle<00:03:31.260> management<00:03:31.440> screen

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
over to the vehicle management screen

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.440 
over to the vehicle management screen
which<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.340> blue<00:03:32.550> corner<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.120> floor

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
which is the blue corner on the floor

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.570 
which is the blue corner on the floor
then<00:03:34.020> select<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.680> adder<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.190> was<00:03:35.340> in

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
then select the adder that you was in

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.310 
then select the adder that you was in
and<00:03:35.790> then<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.300> can<00:03:36.450> simply<00:03:36.570> replace<00:03:37.080> that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
and then you can simply replace that

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.840 
and then you can simply replace that
with<00:03:37.440> an<00:03:37.560> energy<00:03:37.740> which<00:03:38.100> would<00:03:38.280> duplicate<00:03:38.490> the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
with an energy which would duplicate the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.610 
with an energy which would duplicate the
adder<00:03:39.030> as<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.720> guys<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.050> now<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:40.440> when<00:03:40.560> I

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
adder as you guys can now see when I

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.170 
adder as you guys can now see when I
click<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> energy<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.550> replace<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:42.060> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
click on the energy to replace it it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.330 
click on the energy to replace it it
will<00:03:42.390> no<00:03:42.540> duplicate<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.230> adder<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
will no duplicate the adder because the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.729 
will no duplicate the adder because the
haka<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.760> still<00:03:45.180> inside<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> vehicle<00:03:45.959> from

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
haka is still inside of the vehicle from

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.199 
haka is still inside of the vehicle from
there<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.010> can<00:03:47.040> press<00:03:47.280> B<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.459> quit<00:03:47.820> then<00:03:48.090> you

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
there you can press B to quit then you

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.610 
there you can press B to quit then you
can<00:03:48.330> get<00:03:48.450> back<00:03:48.630> into<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.020> original<00:03:49.110> vehicle

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
can get back into the original vehicle

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500 
can get back into the original vehicle
