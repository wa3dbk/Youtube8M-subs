called the PX 750 the PX 850 and being
released<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.020> even<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.650> speak<00:00:52.890> as

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
released right now even as we speak as

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.380 
released right now even as we speak as
the<00:00:53.400> PX<00:00:53.970> 780<00:00:55.310> they<00:00:56.310> all<00:00:56.579> share<00:00:56.880> one<00:00:57.150> thing<00:00:57.180> in

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the PX 780 they all share one thing in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.780 
the PX 780 they all share one thing in
common<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> couple<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
common and are actually a couple of

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.430 
common and are actually a couple of
things<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.120> common<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.450> one<00:01:00.780> big<00:01:01.079> thing<00:01:01.290> is

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
things in common but one big thing is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
things in common but one big thing is
the<00:01:01.560> new<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> IR<00:01:02.280> sound<00:01:03.120> source<00:01:03.360> technology<00:01:04.020> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the new a IR sound source technology and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
the new a IR sound source technology and
basically<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.759> IR<00:01:06.149> sound<00:01:06.450> source

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
basically the a IR sound source

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
basically the a IR sound source
technology<00:01:07.350> utilizes<00:01:08.160> three<00:01:08.369> times<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
technology utilizes three times the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
technology utilizes three times the
sampling<00:01:09.300> memory<00:01:09.630> especially<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.649> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sampling memory especially for the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.620 
sampling memory especially for the
pianos<00:01:13.310> then<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.700> had<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.060> our<00:01:15.330> other

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pianos then what we had in our other

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.540 
pianos then what we had in our other
units<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.470> know<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> previous<00:01:17.040> units<00:01:17.490> like

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
units you know the previous units like

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.749 
units you know the previous units like
the<00:01:17.700> px<00:01:17.970> 130<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.690> 330<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:20.280> addition<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the px 130 and the 330 in addition to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.160 
the px 130 and the 330 in addition to
that<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.090> also<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.540> something<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:22.140> called

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that you also have something now called

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
that you also have something now called
damper<00:01:22.890> resonance<00:01:23.399> which<00:01:23.910> allows<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
damper resonance which allows you to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.850 
damper resonance which allows you to
hear<00:01:24.780> string<00:01:25.110> resonance<00:01:25.560> when<00:01:25.740> you're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
hear string resonance when you're

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.940 
hear string resonance when you're
playing<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.429> also<00:01:27.119> even<00:01:27.869> even<00:01:28.319> down<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.830> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
playing and also even even down to the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
playing and also even even down to the
detail<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.550> up<00:01:29.819> hearing<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.270> damper<00:01:30.600> lifts

key range velocity in addition to that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550 
key range velocity in addition to that
we've<00:01:47.610> also<00:01:47.729> redesigned<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.899> try<00:01:49.110> sensor

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
we've also redesigned the try sensor

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.820 
we've also redesigned the try sensor
hammer<00:01:50.099> scale<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.440> action

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
hammer scale so that so that your action

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.499 
hammer scale so that so that your action
feels<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.130> lot<00:01:53.280> more<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.670> an<00:01:53.940> acoustic<00:01:54.179> piano

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
feels a lot more like an acoustic piano

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.609 
feels a lot more like an acoustic piano
and<00:01:54.959> in<00:01:55.560> addition<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.220> we<00:01:56.479> actually

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
and in addition to that we actually

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.499 
and in addition to that we actually
simulated<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.709> ivory<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.190> ebony<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.849> piano

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
simulated the ivory and ebony on piano

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.900 
simulated the ivory and ebony on piano
keys<00:02:00.599> this<00:02:01.259> has<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.470> lot<00:02:01.679> more<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:02.429> texture

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
keys this has a lot more more texture

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.139 
keys this has a lot more more texture
than<00:02:03.090> than<00:02:03.390> any<00:02:03.599> of<00:02:03.750> our<00:02:03.959> previous<00:02:04.229> models<00:02:04.830> and

than than any of our previous models and
again<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.450> prevalent<00:02:06.840> throughout<00:02:07.080> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
again this is prevalent throughout the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.580 
again this is prevalent throughout the
