00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the staff are warmly welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.309
 channel for today's subject matter is 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.519
 to surmise it has two attributes 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.980
 two main functions to one is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.440
 reduce the volume of the violin for example 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.029
 the study turbines that are only 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.880
 type here that can be rubber 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.010
 metal they are meant to do 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.680
 less noise even to not disturb 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.230
 others you need to study the night 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.390
 any apartment and then you use it 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 this kind of coming up does not bother 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.930
 so much 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.520
 or the muted when used in 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 orchestra or a repertoire 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.399
 that the objective is to change the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.789
 violin timbre make a more timbre 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.610
 sweeter velvety and achieve a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.989
 different effect I'll show you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.890
 you for example try to show this 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.890
 effect on the violin 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.059
 for example I have here a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.510
 subordinate that this girl who only has the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.729
 change the team and not to stifle the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.729
 volume as suppose 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:30.280
 if I put surdina mainly in the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.200
 has a very differentiated effect on the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.970
 another type of study swine 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.940
 it can be debated metal as it already 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.560
 I said and we put on everything 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:47.080
 and you will see that the difference 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.080
 Sound is stupid so big. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.500
 this study insulin I do not recommend 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.600
 If you can not if you can 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.490
 not use her help better because she 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.570
 changes a little after all are the violins 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.270
 they all the notes that you put 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.270
 let's talk a little lower than 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.880
 they really ought to be yours because of 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.290
 surgery then I assumed I had to study 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.870
 something we use only when we have 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.959
 need you should not use 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.540
 her to study because type 'if you 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.280
 Are you sure you do not have any problems with? 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.490
 neighbors nor the apartment then the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 music comes up in a study only when there is 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.130
 need 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.070
 Good, I hope you liked it. 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.450
 the surgeries in general costs do not know 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.070
 that the existence of various 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.700
 rubber are cheaper than 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.070
 metal for example surge does not exist 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.610
 appeared the rounds since people 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.410
 buy ten real time is very cheap 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.650
 even a guy but in case I think today 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.260
 should cost about 50 reais per 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.260
 there it is even more explosive than this 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.340
 rubber but the chance of rubber 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.440
 alluring enough volume but 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.120
 This depends on the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.980
 need you have you do not have 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.980
 need to download the student buy only 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.720
 the little ones are emerging to use 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.630
 in orchestras using repertoire as 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.760
 ask or else these nails of study 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.920
 here if you go in apartments 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.440
 neighbors or ChÃ¡vez these things 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.900
 I hope that if I liked, forget it. 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.900
 of enjoyment seen on the channel and even
