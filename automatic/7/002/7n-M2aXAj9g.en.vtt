00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
see on the show and one thing that I

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.700 
see on the show and one thing that I
think<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.479> us<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.869> realized

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
think all of us have realized

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.200 
think all of us have realized
who's<00:02:10.890> had<00:02:11.010> a<00:02:11.040> chance<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.520> into<00:02:11.670> Blacksburg

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
who's had a chance to go into Blacksburg

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.750 
who's had a chance to go into Blacksburg
and<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:13.560> me<00:02:13.680> personally<00:02:13.890> I've<00:02:14.250> probably<00:02:14.460> been

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and for me personally I've probably been

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.790 
and for me personally I've probably been
there<00:02:14.940> 15<00:02:15.480> or<00:02:15.600> 20<00:02:15.870> times<00:02:16.050> over<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.470> course<00:02:16.500> of

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
there 15 or 20 times over the course of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.130 
there 15 or 20 times over the course of
the<00:02:16.890> last<00:02:17.070> 12<00:02:17.370> years<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:19.020> were

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the last 12 years and I think we were

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.780 
the last 12 years and I think we were
all<00:02:19.260> shocked<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.890> would<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.130> shocking<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.700> it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
all shocked it would be shocking if it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.460 
all shocked it would be shocking if it
happened<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.150> any<00:02:21.360> campus<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> fact<00:02:22.320> that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
happened on any campus but the fact that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.910 
happened on any campus but the fact that
did<00:02:22.680> happen<00:02:23.040> there<00:02:23.480> was<00:02:24.480> almost<00:02:25.140> surreal<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
did happen there was almost surreal and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.310 
did happen there was almost surreal and
very<00:02:26.640> difficult<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.630> think<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> lot<00:02:28.170> of

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
very difficult I think for a lot of

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440 
very difficult I think for a lot of
people<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.280> put<00:02:29.430> our<00:02:29.550> hands<00:02:29.790> around<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.420> I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
people to to put our hands around so I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.410 
people to to put our hands around so I
think<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.710> opinion<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:33.120> one

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
think and in my opinion you know in one

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.970 
think and in my opinion you know in one
hand<00:02:33.690> you're<00:02:33.930> you're<00:02:34.380> honoring<00:02:34.800> and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
hand you're you're honoring and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.400 
hand you're you're honoring and
recognizing<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.810> people<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.290> were

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
recognizing the people that were

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.990 
recognizing the people that were
involved<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> incident<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.820> same

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
involved in the incident and at the same

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.450 
involved in the incident and at the same
time<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.330> think<00:02:39.570> for<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.960> lot<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> fans<00:02:40.500> it's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
time I think for a lot of the fans it's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.130 
time I think for a lot of the fans it's
a<00:02:41.550> celebration<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.480> celebration<00:02:42.510> that
