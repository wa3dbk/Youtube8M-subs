00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.470
 well today we end up with a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.089
 any new video that was asked of me 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.410
 by one of my subscribers and wanted 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.760
 know what I was using 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.080
 daily fist in the face 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.090
 in the evening when I go back I get rid 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.730
 and I always start with the eyes and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.830
 with a flat cotton when a disc of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.590
 cotton like this i use the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 make-up remover from gemey maybelline 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.560
 it's just an ankle that's the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.810
 best makeup remover I used 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.279
 since luc years makeup is a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.279
 makeup in fact it's a makeup 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 excuse me made a makeup remover for 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.040
 for all types of makeup 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 waterproof and it's for the eyes 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.370
 sensitive 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 so it's just really a killing 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.219
 I love what I do, it's me 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.270
 invite him to a cotton and I leave 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.250
 a few seconds like at least 20 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 seconds like this by doing some 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 small circular motions and all 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.219
 without attacking it is useless to put 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.420
 the cotton on your eye and shoot 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.770
 like a brute and besides it's just okay 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.120
 weakened your your eyelid and that's 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.890
 not what we are looking for so really 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.930
 you do in front of small movements 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 circular like these slowly 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 and after when you remove the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.490
 makeup always down eh ben 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.350
 it removes almost all of a sudden it's 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.030
 really really really a very very 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 good cleanser so frankly I 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840
 you really recommend it they listen 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.880
 kind 3 euros and a few in large 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 surface so that's okay enough 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.090
 reasonable and it lasts long enough 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 we plan to use wipes 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 simple make-up removers and once 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.770
 I finished in May really cleansing 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.030
 the face uses my micellar name 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.840
 dechy bioderma that I already had you 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.409
 shown in the video 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.479
 Favorites of summer 2013 I like the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.979
 always love the awesome and maquis 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.679
 super good takes off a lot of small 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.590
 residues and in general I do not use after 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.259
 to be cleansed and also after 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.909
 to wash my face because he has this 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.709
 small residue day and frankly 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.259
 it's great once I'm fine 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.140
 to make up the face I clean myself the 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.759
 face with a gel from at derma for 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.240
 sensitive skin that you can 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.709
 find in pharmacy for that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.049
 depends it depends on the pharmacies you 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.280
 can find for 7 euros or 14 euros 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:13.060
 I have had them for 12 euros I think 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.160
 and it's a gene or it's soap-free 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.629
 and that really softens the push for 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.220
 sensitive skin the pink is for 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.000
 sensitive skin and glass is for 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.260
 the combination to oily skin and it's for 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.849
 the face and the body but I use 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.200
 than for the face so that tell me 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.030
 really really really long 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.579
 I use my cleansing gel with my 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.120
 pair made breach you already did 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.129
 review 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.130
 if you have not seen the magazine yet 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.329
 you put it in link in the notation and 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.959
 I would put the share of information 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.430
 also so it's actually a variant to 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.500
 the unique crisis for all those who 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.480
 do not want to buy or who do not have 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.560
 the budget to buy the sonic class 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.040
 and well you can buy yourself this 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.880
 variant is at the sonic class on agnès 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.370
 b I think 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.989
 agnès b and I had bought it in 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.090
 promo for 15 euros I think now 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.530
 and costs 20 or 30 euros I do not know 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.669
 but I do not know you're saying anything 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.169
 what but me I saw to buy it in 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.720
 promo and she was 15 euros 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.540
 so here I use every two days 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.130
 because otherwise it is for my skin 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.410
 early i was however i was all 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.910
 happy I used every day and 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.620
 in fact it just attacked me and 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.599
 weaken the skin so that's why 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.010
 that now I use both 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.959
 days now we will go to 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.989
 scrubs and masks then for the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.569
 scrub I use this scrub from 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.000
 cartier which is white clay 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.950
 in fact I'm using more as 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.810
 mask because since it's a scrub 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.299
 to clay I leave more as 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.400
 mask I let rest and then 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.060
 when I come to reims and ben there I 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.150
 make small circular motions 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.099
 on my skin and 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.260
 so here's this one I use them 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.489
 really not often often it's 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.170
 really when I more when I have 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.970
 skin problems of small 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.819
 hesitations it really really works 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.470
 well I bought the monoprix really 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.730
 cheap I know more how much but I 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.920
 so much holy flour that's for sure and 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.470
 sure it's really for everything 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 skin type and it's great it's a 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.370
 facial scrub that matifies in 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.540
 make your skin me I have dry skin 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.000
 but at times I have skin a little 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.220
 thanks especially to the level of the nose and 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.840
 frankly it's really very very 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.069
 handy it really works hunger 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.560
 Anyway me for me for my part 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.690
 works very well and in fact it tightens 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.580
 the pores airlock has reduced the brilliance and 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.580
 it feels great band So here I 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.610
 bought in supermarkets for 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.560
 almost 4 euros after to hide them 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.610
 I use a mask I bought at 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.020
 at monoprix like this one must also 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.229
 that we buy we are almost more and 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.789
 a green clay that I use a one 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.870
 I really use it once 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:49.169
 per week this one I use in this 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.550
 moment I use two or three times by 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.199
 week 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.460
 this one it is rare that finally I use 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.830
 not often but when I use in 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.949
 general it's once a week otherwise 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.380
 sometimes I use these two products 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.449
 from the rock-posay then this one 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.650
 it's for corrections 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.729
 enough for wii when you have some 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.059
 small buttons and small tasks 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.499
 it is without paraben it works very well 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.909
 in fact when you have that buttons 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.529
 who actually quotes me the thing is that 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.120
 I really liked that about 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.629
 imperfections I do not put on your tone 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.979
 face 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.330
 I 'm really not even if I have a 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.699
 button on the cheek and ben I 'm going to put 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.599
 this product but just on the button not 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.059
 especially my face 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.099
 so really it really works 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:29.580
 really good is this wind in 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:31.680
 pharmacy or drugstore and the 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.589
 sitap last is actually for skins 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.339
 irritated gers and wise uses more in 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.749
 winter in celebration 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:40.080
 but right now I'm starting to 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:41.789
 use it a little bit and that's 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.539
 important that I put it on the set 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.339
 of my face and applied morning and 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.039
 evening but me in general when I use 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:52.020
 these two products I use more in the evening 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.120
 otherwise I use these two creams while in 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.449
 do I swatch between the two in this 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.379
 moment I use more sensitivity in 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.719
 that you have already shown in my 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:03.360
 previous video of the best products 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.249
 Summer or topi in dermis 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.279
 this one but this one I use a little 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:10.879
 less because reflection made it 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:13.110
 moisturizes well but not enough 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.149
 this one she is really very fat 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.479
 and since I have super dry skin 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:20.729
 this one prefers her so here I am you 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.560
 recommend it and this one 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.110
 as well 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.159
 so here before putting the creams 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.599
 once I'm fine but my 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.639
 face that I did but surely and 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.529
 everything and everything I use when I have 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.509
 imperfections not all the time my water 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.520
 spa of wide possesses I had 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.650
 a thermal water in fact before 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:43.050
 amen and 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.759
 in fact how do you say in the long run 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.470
 she was not walking at all is at 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:48.240
 contrary to my pimples 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.410
 so I recommend you 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.940
 rock-posay frankly I find this is 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.070
 the best brand by celebrating its ranks 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.400
 the future mark you can find in 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:58.560
 drugstore or finally massy a lot m 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.169
 had but I was wrong and that my 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.910
 skin does not really work the 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.070
 war at rock-posay it's really 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.600
 the best the best for my skin so in 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.070
 it's a cream france between 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.110
 excuse me it's no thermal for them 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.760
 sensitive skin and it softens your skin 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.150
 and when you have hesitations of 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.070
 little buttons you really spray 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.990
 like this to a few cents is a 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.570
 not all ready really you
