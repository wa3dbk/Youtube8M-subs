00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:17.509
 fear in reality no fear lives in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.119
 one corner in our thoughts about the future 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:24.809
 fear is a figment of our imagination he 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.790
 makes us afraid of that which is not and 

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.790
 probably will never happen 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.070
 it's pure madness you just understand 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.950
 me right danger is real 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.950
 fact but fear is your choice 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.640
 I will say that the world is not news for you 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.820
 not so sunny and affable it 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.920
 very dangerous tough place if only 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.930
 give the slack he will upset with such force 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.480
 that you no longer get up 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.269
 you are not me no one in the world beats like that 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.019
 much like life does n't matter how you 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.360
 will hit 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.830
 and it is important what blow you hold as 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.050
 moving forward 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.220
 will you go go if you don't frighten 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.570
 wrap it up the only way to win if 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.550
 you know what you stand go beat your 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 they pay and say 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.630
 what did not achieve because 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.259
 the scientist do not panic we have this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.259
 already
