ways<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.709> said<00:02:48.920> there<00:02:49.040> were<00:02:49.130> three<00:02:49.160> rates

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
ways like I said there were three rates

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.620

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
but there's two other ways deciding

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.960

challenges to obtain them the other way

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.270 
challenges to obtain them the other way
is<00:02:53.330> through<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.810> surreal<00:02:54.140> fortune<00:02:54.680> now<00:02:55.100> I've

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
is through the surreal fortune now I've

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.180 
is through the surreal fortune now I've
already<00:02:55.430> done<00:02:55.580> my<00:02:55.730> spins<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.630> got<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:58.130> know

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
already done my spins and I got you know

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.220 
already done my spins and I got you know
nothing<00:02:58.640> obviously<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.810> can<00:02:59.959> get<00:03:00.110> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
nothing obviously but you can get the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.710 
nothing obviously but you can get the
spin<00:03:00.470> tickets<00:03:00.950> from<00:03:01.430> doing<00:03:02.000> combat<00:03:02.480> and

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
spin tickets from doing combat and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.610 
spin tickets from doing combat and
stealing

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
stealing

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.040 
stealing
they're<00:03:04.160> obviously<00:03:04.760> randomly<00:03:05.480> given<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.930> you

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
they're obviously randomly given to you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.100 
they're obviously randomly given to you
so<00:03:07.040> every<00:03:07.519> spin<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.180> chance<00:03:08.690> for<00:03:08.780> black

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
so every spin is a chance for black
