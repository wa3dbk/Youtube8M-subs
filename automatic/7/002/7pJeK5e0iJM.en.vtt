I've<00:00:13.259> recently<00:00:13.950> bought<00:00:14.700> I've<00:00:15.120> had<00:00:15.389> two<00:00:15.509> hair

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

think<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.529> loose<00:00:20.310> wave<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.510> when<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> had

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
think it's a loose wave and when I had

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.259 
think it's a loose wave and when I had
it<00:00:22.080> before<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.439> had<00:00:22.769> French<00:00:23.070> Way<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.029> kind<00:00:24.240> of
