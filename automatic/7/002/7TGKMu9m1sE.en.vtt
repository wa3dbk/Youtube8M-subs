00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.750 

because<00:00:05.080> of<00:00:05.170> the<00:00:05.259> fact<00:00:05.470> that<00:00:05.590> one<00:00:06.250> like<00:00:06.460> I<00:00:06.550> said

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:06.760 
because of the fact that one like I said

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.430 
because of the fact that one like I said
we<00:00:06.850> have<00:00:06.939> to<00:00:06.970> put<00:00:07.149> everything<00:00:07.240> together<00:00:07.630> too<00:00:08.170> I

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
we have to put everything together too I

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.730 
we have to put everything together too I
really<00:00:09.219> got<00:00:09.400> a<00:00:09.430> great<00:00:09.760> understanding<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:11.260> what

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
really got a great understanding of what

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.709 
really got a great understanding of what
makes<00:00:11.889> people<00:00:12.070> move<00:00:12.580> on<00:00:12.850> a<00:00:12.879> dance<00:00:13.180> floor<00:00:13.299> or

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
makes people move on a dance floor or

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.630 
makes people move on a dance floor or
the<00:00:14.320> the<00:00:14.709> real<00:00:15.250> purpose<00:00:15.670> of<00:00:15.820> music<00:00:16.330> I<00:00:17.640> think

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
the the real purpose of music I think

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.220 
the the real purpose of music I think
that<00:00:18.760> helps<00:00:19.060> a<00:00:19.119> lot<00:00:19.270> because<00:00:19.539> once<00:00:19.869> you<00:00:19.990> once

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
that helps a lot because once you once

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.320 
that helps a lot because once you once
you<00:00:20.289> get<00:00:20.560> into<00:00:20.740> it<00:00:20.890> and<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.279> get<00:00:21.429> trained<00:00:21.880> and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
you get into it and you get trained and

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.230 
you get into it and you get trained and
you<00:00:22.419> learn<00:00:22.660> all<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.929> rules<00:00:23.230> and<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.820> is<00:00:24.999> this

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
you learn all the rules and this is this

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.419 
you learn all the rules and this is this
chord<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:25.749> this<00:00:25.869> is<00:00:26.019> that<00:00:26.230> cord<00:00:26.589> and<00:00:26.859> you<00:00:27.310> know

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
chord and this is that cord and you know

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.140 
chord and this is that cord and you know
sometimes<00:00:27.970> you<00:00:28.089> can<00:00:28.269> get<00:00:28.390> so<00:00:28.689> trapped<00:00:29.050> into

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
sometimes you can get so trapped into

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.330 
sometimes you can get so trapped into
learning<00:00:31.150> that<00:00:31.839> you<00:00:32.050> forget<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:33.190> whole

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
learning that you forget the whole

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.700 
learning that you forget the whole
purpose<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.970> vibration<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.170> make<00:00:35.320> someone

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
purpose is vibration is to make someone

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.680 
purpose is vibration is to make someone
else<00:00:35.890> move<00:00:36.160> or<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.970> give<00:00:37.150> someone<00:00:37.360> else<00:00:37.540> of

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
else move or to give someone else of

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.720 
else move or to give someone else of
feeling<00:00:38.110> so<00:00:38.590> I<00:00:38.860> think<00:00:38.980> that<00:00:39.310> was<00:00:39.430> one<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.640> the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
feeling so I think that was one of the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.240 
feeling so I think that was one of the
best<00:00:40.060> things<00:00:40.180> that<00:00:40.660> I<00:00:40.900> learned<00:00:41.620> during<00:00:41.980> that

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
best things that I learned during that

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.120 
best things that I learned during that
time<00:00:42.490> period<00:00:42.520> of<00:00:43.090> DJing<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.500> really<00:00:44.800> led

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
time period of DJing and it really led

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.290 
time period of DJing and it really led
to<00:00:45.430> me<00:00:46.270> understanding<00:00:46.990> how<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.940> sonically<00:00:48.940> put

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
to me understanding how to sonically put

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.960 
to me understanding how to sonically put
together<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.690> record<00:00:50.200> so<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.470> affects<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.190> mood

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
together a record so that affects a mood

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.930 
together a record so that affects a mood
of<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.300> certain<00:00:52.660> person<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:54.520> everything

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
of a certain person because everything

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.510 
of a certain person because everything
can<00:00:55.090> be<00:00:55.120> interpreted<00:00:55.420> differently<00:00:56.050> yeah<00:00:56.560> not

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
can be interpreted differently yeah not

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.490 
can be interpreted differently yeah not
to<00:00:57.700> downplay<00:00:57.970> technical<00:00:58.810> learning<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.230> think

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
to downplay technical learning I think

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.800 
to downplay technical learning I think
that<00:00:59.680> people<00:01:00.130> should<00:01:00.160> learn<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:01.510> know<00:01:01.630> the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
that people should learn you know the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.229 
that people should learn you know the
rules<00:01:02.080> it's<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.710> say<00:01:02.890> hey<00:01:03.160> you<00:01:03.820> know<00:01:03.850> this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
rules it's to say hey you know this

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.929 
rules it's to say hey you know this
music<00:01:04.960> music<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.680> general<00:01:05.860> sound<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.909> know

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
music music in general sound you know

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.099 
music music in general sound you know
that<00:01:07.150> was<00:01:07.240> one<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.509> greatest<00:01:07.720> things<00:01:08.020> that

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:08.109 
that was one of the greatest things that

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.480 
that was one of the greatest things that
my<00:01:08.289> teachers<00:01:08.619> taught<00:01:08.859> me<00:01:09.009> was<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.189> stop

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
my teachers taught me was to stop

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.190 
my teachers taught me was to stop
thinking<00:01:09.789> about<00:01:09.850> music<00:01:10.390> it's<00:01:10.509> just<00:01:10.659> music<00:01:10.899> and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
thinking about music it's just music and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.779 
thinking about music it's just music and
think<00:01:11.350> about<00:01:11.590> being<00:01:12.039> a<00:01:12.130> practitioner<00:01:12.759> of

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
think about being a practitioner of

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.260 
think about being a practitioner of
audio<00:01:13.210> just<00:01:13.630> period<00:01:14.249> but<00:01:15.249> once<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.549> learn<00:01:15.850> all

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
audio just period but once you learn all

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.440 
audio just period but once you learn all
these<00:01:16.509> rules<00:01:16.869> for<00:01:17.200> music<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:18.490> kind<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.999> get

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
these rules for music you kind of get

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.539 
these rules for music you kind of get
stuck<00:01:19.869> into<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.319> same<00:01:20.590> thing<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.009> this<00:01:21.249> goes

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
stuck into the same thing that this goes

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.010 
stuck into the same thing that this goes
with<00:01:21.789> this<00:01:21.999> and<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.780> natural

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
with this and this is this natural

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.069 
with this and this is this natural
progression<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.799> there<00:01:23.950> really<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.369> no<00:01:25.079> there

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
progression and there really is no there

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.069 
progression and there really is no there
are<00:01:26.229> no<00:01:26.380> rules<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:27.549> once<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.539> figure<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.020> out

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
are no rules so once you figure that out

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.919 
are no rules so once you figure that out
you<00:01:29.289> kind<00:01:30.159> of<00:01:30.249> need<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.520> study<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.539> always<00:01:31.719> say

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
you kind of need to study I always say

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.629 
you kind of need to study I always say
you<00:01:31.990> kinda<00:01:32.289> need<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.409> study<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.069> learn<00:01:33.100> the

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:33.639 
you kinda need to study and learn the

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:35.459 
you kinda need to study and learn the
rules<00:01:33.819> first<00:01:34.179> that<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.569> can<00:01:34.689> learn<00:01:34.869> how<00:01:35.409> to

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
rules first that you can learn how to

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.459 
rules first that you can learn how to
break<00:01:35.829> them<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.359> need<00:01:37.389> that<00:01:37.719> foundation

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
break them but you need that foundation

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.289 
break them but you need that foundation
in<00:01:38.679> order<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.100> even<00:01:39.280> have<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.609> conversation

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
in order to even have the conversation

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.669 
in order to even have the conversation
with<00:01:40.450> someone<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.899> say<00:01:41.049> I'm<00:01:41.109> stepping<00:01:41.530> outside

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
with someone to say I'm stepping outside

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.620 
with someone to say I'm stepping outside
of<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.159> norm<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.639> what<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.210> normally<00:01:43.389> should

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
of the norm of what it normally should

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.020 
of the norm of what it normally should
be<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:44.950> all<00:01:45.249> that<00:01:45.490> comes<00:01:45.729> back<00:01:45.969> to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
be that and all that comes back to

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.719 
be that and all that comes back to
feeling<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:46.899> know<00:01:47.049> I<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.829> say<00:01:48.369> this<00:01:48.520> all<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
feeling you know I I say this all the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.539 
feeling you know I I say this all the
time<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:49.240> when<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.810> are<00:01:50.139> a<00:01:50.219> person<00:01:51.219> that's

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
time that when you are a person that's

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.340
