00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.589 
tell me a little bit about some of the
specs<00:01:50.530> like<00:01:50.739> the<00:01:50.920> flight<00:01:51.250> time<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.849> all<00:01:51.910> right

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
specs like the flight time and all right

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.889 
specs like the flight time and all right
so<00:01:52.810> we<00:01:53.020> actually<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.530> for<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:53.950> class<00:01:54.280> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
so we actually have for this class the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.300 
so we actually have for this class the
industry's<00:01:55.899> longest<00:01:56.319> flight<00:01:56.470> time<00:01:56.619> about<00:01:56.860> 23

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
industry's longest flight time about 23

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.580 
industry's longest flight time about 23
minutes<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:58.000> reason<00:01:58.479> for<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:58.869> we

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
minutes the reason for that is we

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.199 
minutes the reason for that is we
actually<00:01:59.709> come<00:02:00.130> out<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.610> business<00:02:01.000> of

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
actually come out of a business of

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.089 
actually come out of a business of
making<00:02:01.420> electric<00:02:02.200> aviation<00:02:02.739> you'll<00:02:02.890> see

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
making electric aviation you'll see

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.850 
making electric aviation you'll see
later

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
later

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.130 
later
logo<00:02:04.700> there<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.240> we<00:02:05.360> actually<00:02:05.660> make<00:02:05.810> man

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
logo there so we actually make man

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.410 
logo there so we actually make man
aircraft<00:02:06.770> armed<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.190> electrically<00:02:07.820> aircraft

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
aircraft armed and electrically aircraft

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.719 
aircraft armed and electrically aircraft
1<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:08.929> 2<00:02:09.050> seed<00:02:09.259> aircraft<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.190> we<00:02:10.340> spent<00:02:10.640> about

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
1 and 2 seed aircraft so we spent about

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.060 
1 and 2 seed aircraft so we spent about
10<00:02:11.450> years<00:02:11.630> started<00:02:12.080> out<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.230> 1999<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.890> more

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
10 years started out in 1999 to more

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.340 
10 years started out in 1999 to more
than<00:02:13.100> 10<00:02:13.490> years<00:02:13.600> perfecting<00:02:14.600> all<00:02:14.960> kinds<00:02:15.320> of

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
than 10 years perfecting all kinds of

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.290 
than 10 years perfecting all kinds of
electric<00:02:15.710> aviation<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:17.030> sort<00:02:17.240> of

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
electric aviation and this sort of

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.210 
electric aviation and this sort of
consumer<00:02:17.810> drone<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.410> one<00:02:18.650> aspect<00:02:18.680> of

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
consumer drone is just one aspect of

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.850 
consumer drone is just one aspect of
what<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.400> do<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.880> this<00:02:20.000> area<00:02:20.300> nice<00:02:20.840> now<00:02:21.380> 23

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
what we do in this area nice now 23

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.200 
what we do in this area nice now 23
minutes<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.250> flight<00:02:22.430> time<00:02:22.460> is<00:02:22.700> awesome

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
minutes of flight time is awesome

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.520 
minutes of flight time is awesome
because<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.450> lot<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.660> times<00:02:23.930> you've<00:02:24.290> got<00:02:24.440> to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
because a lot of times you've got to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.570 
because a lot of times you've got to
kind<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.680> set<00:02:24.860> up<00:02:24.980> figure<00:02:25.250> where<00:02:25.370> you're<00:02:25.460> going

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
kind of set up figure where you're going

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.790 
kind of set up figure where you're going
to<00:02:25.640> go<00:02:25.700> take<00:02:26.240> off<00:02:26.450> fly<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.320> location<00:02:27.770> you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
to go take off fly to the location you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.920 
to go take off fly to the location you
want<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.250> actually<00:02:28.460> film<00:02:29.000> at<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.570> by<00:02:29.750> that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
want to actually film at and by that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.570 
want to actually film at and by that
time<00:02:29.990> with<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> lot<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.709> drones<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.220> I've<00:02:31.340> flown

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
time with a lot of drones and I've flown

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.040 
time with a lot of drones and I've flown
I've<00:02:31.880> only<00:02:32.120> got<00:02:32.300> about<00:02:32.360> eight<00:02:32.600> minutes<00:02:32.810> there

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
I've only got about eight minutes there

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.140 
I've only got about eight minutes there
so<00:02:33.200> having<00:02:33.500> 23<00:02:34.100> minutes<00:02:34.370> really<00:02:34.670> gives<00:02:35.030> you

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
so having 23 minutes really gives you

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.850 
so having 23 minutes really gives you
that<00:02:35.330> set<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:35.959> time<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.290> make<00:02:36.440> sure<00:02:36.470> because

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
that set up time to make sure because

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.290 
that set up time to make sure because
I'm<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.130> film<00:02:37.310> industry<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.090> need<00:02:38.240> to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
I'm in the film industry and I need to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.120 
I'm in the film industry and I need to
get<00:02:38.390> multiple<00:02:38.630> takes<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.350> same<00:02:39.560> thing<00:02:39.800> so

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
get multiple takes and the same thing so

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.230 
get multiple takes and the same thing so
that's<00:02:40.190> gonna<00:02:40.370> let<00:02:40.550> me<00:02:40.610> let's<00:02:40.790> talk<00:02:40.850> about<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
that's gonna let me let's talk about the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.640 
that's gonna let me let's talk about the
camera<00:02:41.630> that's<00:02:41.750> included<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.350> okay

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
camera that's included with this okay

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.620 
camera that's included with this okay
yeah<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.340> we're<00:02:43.489> come<00:02:43.670> we<00:02:43.880> have<00:02:44.000> two<00:02:44.209> cameras

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
yeah so we're come we have two cameras

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.520 
yeah so we're come we have two cameras
we<00:02:44.780> have<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.709> sea<00:02:45.890> go<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.640> plus<00:02:46.940> which<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> 2k

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
we have the sea go to plus which is a 2k

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.580 
we have the sea go to plus which is a 2k
1080p<00:02:49.190> camera<00:02:49.430> we<00:02:50.000> also<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.420> 4k<00:02:50.780> camera<00:02:51.440> I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
1080p camera we also have a 4k camera I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.380 
1080p camera we also have a 4k camera I
think<00:02:52.070> that's<00:02:52.190> where<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.580> industry<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.060> going

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
think that's where the industry is going

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.790 
think that's where the industry is going
whereas<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.110> lot<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.440> people<00:02:54.560> don't

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
whereas a lot of people don't

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800 
whereas a lot of people don't
necessarily<00:02:54.920> have<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.280> 4k<00:02:55.550> TV<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:56.209> lot<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.600> people

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
necessarily have a 4k TV a lot of people

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.199 
necessarily have a 4k TV a lot of people
want<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.080> be<00:02:57.170> able<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.440> shoot<00:02:57.620> 4k<00:02:57.920> video<00:02:58.310> what

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
want to be able to shoot 4k video what

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.850 
want to be able to shoot 4k video what
we've<00:02:59.390> done<00:02:59.540> with<00:02:59.720> both<00:02:59.959> of<00:02:59.989> our<00:03:00.200> cameras<00:03:00.680> is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
we've done with both of our cameras is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.040 
we've done with both of our cameras is
we<00:03:01.220> have<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> industry<00:03:01.850> widest<00:03:02.360> wide<00:03:02.630> angle

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
we have the industry widest wide angle

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.350 
we have the industry widest wide angle
at<00:03:03.260> 115<00:03:03.890> degrees<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.459> think<00:03:04.880> for<00:03:05.030> people<00:03:05.180> who

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
at 115 degrees I think for people who

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.780 
at 115 degrees I think for people who
are<00:03:05.450> into<00:03:05.690> video<00:03:05.930> that's<00:03:06.200> important<00:03:06.790> we're

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
are into video that's important we're

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.220 
are into video that's important we're
over<00:03:07.940> 100<00:03:08.330> degrees<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:08.810> it's<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.989> true

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
over 100 degrees so it's a true

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.530 
over 100 degrees so it's a true
wide-angle<00:03:09.950> lens<00:03:10.580> on<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.820> camera<00:03:10.910> look<00:03:11.420> at

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
wide-angle lens on the camera look at

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.270 
wide-angle lens on the camera look at
nice<00:03:11.720> now<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.230> noticed<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.620> also<00:03:12.860> have<00:03:12.950> another

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
nice now I noticed you also have another

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.949

agriculture power line inspection that
is<00:03:26.630> going<00:03:26.959> into<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.170> drone<00:03:27.410> business<00:03:27.799> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
is going into the drone business and

what<00:03:28.459> you're<00:03:28.610> seeing<00:03:28.850> is<00:03:29.209> we're<00:03:29.930> coming<00:03:30.230> out

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
what you're seeing is we're coming out

what you're seeing is we're coming out
with<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.500> couple<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.830> different<00:03:31.160> models<00:03:31.640> within

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
with a couple of different models within

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.500 
with a couple of different models within
that<00:03:32.200> we<00:03:33.200> have<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:34.010> model<00:03:34.519> that's<00:03:34.670> more<00:03:35.150> for

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
that we have a model that's more for

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.710 
that we have a model that's more for
inspection<00:03:36.440> or<00:03:36.709> security<00:03:37.519> which<00:03:37.790> has<00:03:37.940> 18<00:03:38.390> zoom

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
inspection or security which has 18 zoom

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.900 
inspection or security which has 18 zoom
camera<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.440> what<00:03:39.920> we're<00:03:40.040> doing<00:03:40.370> for<00:03:40.519> all<00:03:40.730> of

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
camera on it what we're doing for all of

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.820 
camera on it what we're doing for all of
these<00:03:41.060> models<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:42.500> doesn't<00:03:42.799> matter

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
these models and it doesn't matter

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.620 
these models and it doesn't matter
whether<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.940> smaller<00:03:44.209> ones<00:03:44.420> bigger

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
whether it's the smaller ones bigger

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.680 
whether it's the smaller ones bigger
ones<00:03:44.840> we're<00:03:45.260> always<00:03:45.500> including<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.690> steady

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
ones we're always including a steady

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.810 
ones we're always including a steady
grip<00:03:47.930> or<00:03:48.110> some<00:03:48.260> kind<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.530> ground<00:03:48.799> system<00:03:49.400> it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
grip or some kind of a ground system it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.340 
grip or some kind of a ground system it
may<00:03:49.970> be<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.120> more<00:03:50.390> professional<00:03:50.720> two-handed

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
may be a more professional two-handed

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.470 
may be a more professional two-handed
system<00:03:51.620> but<00:03:52.070> our<00:03:52.400> belief<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.970> same<00:03:53.150> camera

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
system but our belief is the same camera

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.030 
system but our belief is the same camera
should<00:03:53.660> be<00:03:53.810> able<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.170> taken<00:03:54.500> off<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.769> drone

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
should be able to be taken off the drone

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.920 
should be able to be taken off the drone
and<00:03:55.250> used<00:03:55.489> on<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.820> ground<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.330> it<00:03:56.720> really

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
and used on the ground and it really

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.630 
and used on the ground and it really
shouldn't<00:03:57.230> matter<00:03:57.350> where<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.310> are<00:03:58.489> and

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
shouldn't matter where you are and

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640 
shouldn't matter where you are and
should<00:03:58.790> have<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:59.030> solution

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
should have a solution

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.530 
should have a solution
oh<00:03:59.709> yeah<00:04:00.549> now<00:04:00.760> that's<00:04:00.849> the<00:04:00.970> most<00:04:01.120> important

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
oh yeah now that's the most important

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.030 
oh yeah now that's the most important
thing<00:04:01.569> people<00:04:01.930> want<00:04:02.019> good<00:04:02.319> stable<00:04:02.769> footage

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
thing people want good stable footage

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.130 
thing people want good stable footage
and<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.250> most<00:04:03.970> important<00:04:04.420> thing<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.659> ease<00:04:04.900> of

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
and the most important thing is ease of

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.319 
and the most important thing is ease of
use<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.470> mean<00:04:05.620> I've<00:04:05.950> flown<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.489> lot<00:04:06.939> of<00:04:07.090> different

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
use I mean I've flown a lot of different

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.550 
use I mean I've flown a lot of different
drones<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.689> we<00:04:07.780> try<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:07.989> get<00:04:08.200> up<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.439> air

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
drones and we try to get up in the air

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.259 
drones and we try to get up in the air
sometimes<00:04:08.739> we<00:04:09.040> went<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:09.250> Napa<00:04:09.400> Valley<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
sometimes we went to Napa Valley and the

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.089 
sometimes we went to Napa Valley and the
drone<00:04:10.480> we<00:04:10.659> took<00:04:10.810> with<00:04:10.959> us<00:04:11.049> we<00:04:11.379> just<00:04:11.560> couldn't

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
drone we took with us we just couldn't

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.979 
drone we took with us we just couldn't
get<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.549> work<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:13.000> way<00:04:13.150> we<00:04:13.180> wanted<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.840> and

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
get it to work the way we wanted to and

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.300 
get it to work the way we wanted to and
that's<00:04:14.470> some<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.709> most<00:04:14.890> disappointing

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
that's some of the most disappointing

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.949 
that's some of the most disappointing
things<00:04:15.610> so<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.209> consumer<00:04:16.509> side<00:04:16.690> you're

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
things so on the consumer side you're

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.449 
things so on the consumer side you're
going<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.169> want<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.470> have<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.709> ease<00:04:18.009> of<00:04:18.250> use

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
going to want to have that ease of use

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.610 
going to want to have that ease of use
and<00:04:18.489> tell<00:04:19.150> me<00:04:19.269> about<00:04:19.359> what<00:04:20.049> people<00:04:20.380> are<00:04:20.470> saying

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
about this drone yeah so I think people

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.390 
about this drone yeah so I think people
like<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.930> they<00:04:23.199> like<00:04:23.410> one<00:04:24.039> of<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.190> things<00:04:24.310> I

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.100 
like it they like one of the things I
like<00:04:24.490> about<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.789> you<00:04:24.850> can<00:04:25.000> not<00:04:25.389> here<00:04:25.660> behind<00:04:25.840> us

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
like about it you can not here behind us

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.700 
like about it you can not here behind us
it's<00:04:26.320> super<00:04:26.800> quiet<00:04:27.009> so<00:04:27.820> we<00:04:28.300> designed<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.530> in

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
it's super quiet so we designed that in

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.800 
it's super quiet so we designed that in
because<00:04:29.919> if<00:04:30.280> you're<00:04:30.400> flying<00:04:30.759> you<00:04:31.509> don't<00:04:31.660> want

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
because if you're flying you don't want

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.150 
because if you're flying you don't want
to<00:04:31.900> be<00:04:31.960> bothering<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.440> people<00:04:32.680> around<00:04:32.889> you

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
to be bothering the people around you

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680 
to be bothering the people around you
right<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:33.550> we've<00:04:33.669> made<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.030> very<00:04:34.060> quiet

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
right so we've made it a very quiet

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.719 
right so we've made it a very quiet
throne<00:04:35.110> another<00:04:35.979> thing<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.250> we've<00:04:36.699> done

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
throne another thing that we've done

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.520 
throne another thing that we've done
just<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.419> make<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.630> easy<00:04:37.840> is<00:04:38.050> we<00:04:38.229> always

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
just to make it easy is we always

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.290 
just to make it easy is we always
include<00:04:38.680> two<00:04:39.039> batteries<00:04:39.490> with<00:04:39.729> everything<00:04:40.210> we

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
include two batteries with everything we

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.480 
include two batteries with everything we
ship<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.260> generally<00:04:41.740> what<00:04:41.860> we're<00:04:42.039> doing<00:04:42.310> is

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
ship so generally what we're doing is

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.320 
ship so generally what we're doing is
we're<00:04:43.389> trying<00:04:43.570> our<00:04:43.930> best<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.789> make<00:04:45.789> think

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
we're trying our best to make think

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.090 
we're trying our best to make think
about<00:04:46.539> what<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.750> consumer<00:04:47.169> needs<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.650> make<00:04:47.860> it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
about what the consumer needs to make it
