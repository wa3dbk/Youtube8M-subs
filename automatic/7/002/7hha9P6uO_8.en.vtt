well<00:00:43.500> well<00:00:44.129> we're<00:00:44.340> running<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:44.850> games<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
well well we're running out two games so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.560 
well well we're running out two games so
obviously<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:47.399> was<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> same<00:00:48.090> last<00:00:48.329> week

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
obviously if that was the same last week

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.080 
obviously if that was the same last week
if<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> lost<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:50.520> sit<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:50.850> then

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
if it lost that one to sit here then

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.729 
if it lost that one to sit here then
would<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.390> been<00:00:51.510> more<00:00:51.660> difficult<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.410> speak

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
would have been more difficult to speak

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.080 
would have been more difficult to speak
to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.949> Lance<00:00:53.219> after<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> game<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:53.940> have

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
to the Lance after the game would have

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
to the Lance after the game would have
been<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.629> difficult<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.160> up

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
been a lot more difficult so now it's up

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000 
been a lot more difficult so now it's up
to<00:00:56.280> us<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.180> there<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.660> give<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.829> good

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
to us to go out there and give it a good

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.039 
to us to go out there and give it a good
shot<00:00:59.250> give<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:02.570> do<00:01:03.570> what<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
shot give it a go and do what we can to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
get those three points every pair no

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.080 
get those three points every pair no
it's<00:01:06.390> an<00:01:06.750> important<00:01:07.470> game<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.880> what

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it's an important game and we know what

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
if we lose what if then what so that's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.149 
if we lose what if then what so that's
up<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> me<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> find<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.740> players<00:01:52.950> I

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
up to me then to find the players I

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.679 
up to me then to find the players I
think's<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:53.909> mentality<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.570> this

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
think's for the right mentality for this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.959 
think's for the right mentality for this
game<00:01:54.840> inference<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.860> used<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.310> white<00:01:56.670> black

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
game inference I used to be white black

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.819 
game inference I used to be white black
or<00:01:57.180> centre-backs<00:01:57.869> different<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> game

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
or centre-backs different of the game

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.600 
or centre-backs different of the game
depend<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.899> didn't<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.610> player

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
depend of if we didn't have a player

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.800 
depend of if we didn't have a player
injured<00:02:02.909> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
injured so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.859 
injured so
