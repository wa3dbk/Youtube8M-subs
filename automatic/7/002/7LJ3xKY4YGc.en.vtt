those<00:00:45.850> simple<00:00:46.239> steps<00:00:46.269> even<00:00:47.260> if<00:00:47.409> all<00:00:47.710> the

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
those simple steps even if all the

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.979 
those simple steps even if all the
lessons<00:00:48.190> are<00:00:48.249> driving<00:00:48.670> has<00:00:49.030> been<00:00:49.269> reasonably

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
lessons are driving has been reasonably

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.379 
lessons are driving has been reasonably
faultless<00:00:50.639> so<00:00:51.639> while<00:00:51.819> we<00:00:51.969> talking<00:00:52.359> about

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
faultless so while we talking about

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.889 
faultless so while we talking about
we're<00:00:53.229> talking<00:00:53.379> about<00:00:53.589> a<00:00:53.739> five-point<00:00:54.399> check
