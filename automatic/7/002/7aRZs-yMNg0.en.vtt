00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.780
 and good to everyone here in front of me 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.389
 commenting and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.880
 I've seen my videos that was wrong 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.800
 done it was worth two videos one that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.470
 many of you know that it is the file tubing port 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.990
 and another that is the fix fix 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.179
 press a key to continue good 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.659
 so I fixed myself I 've been seeing the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.910
 videos that I had and is that they are the same and 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.770
 Of course I said how can this be the same 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.530
 we are going to record immediately another 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.039
 video to fix this and well then because 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.449
 I'm recording it and we're going to see the 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.420
 different types of mistakes that can 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.670
 give the person I have to continue 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.410
 good 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.570
 first mistake that he can press the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.290
 key to continue having here 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290
 this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.730
 that is, it has to have this name 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.140
 in the chromebook it opens and tells us 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.059
 is a person to continue because 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.059
 can not find this file 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.040
 what we have to do is remove that 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.550
 one in parentheses and leave him alone 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.550
 until the end of r 1.0 we execute 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.860
 and you see us perfectly next 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.980
 error that can give this 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.470
 in which shit to see that on the bus that 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.600
 we have instead of 1 in parentheses 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.670
 I hope we get both at once 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.800
 we give it to run and it comes out again 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.280
 press key to continue 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.720
 what to do then we return the same 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 we change and remove that point jar 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 we execute and we will go perfectly now 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.630
 errors related to the code of the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.570
 bat 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.040
 for example the code that we have copied 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.530
 is not right or from other bits another 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 java is worth that error that error is very 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.780
 frequent among people who do not know what 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.560
 bit how many bits and what java has good 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.110
 Well what we have to do is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 get into a video that I have how 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380
 make a server bukit for any 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.120
 version 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.530
 and I explain perfectly how to put 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.650
 how to know what java do you have and how many 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.750
 bits you have on the computer good that's 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.870
 one error and the next one inside this 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.320
 code can be the following here to the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.080
 end puts the name of the file worth 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.730
 it may be that the name is wrong and that 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.340
 you have copied a code from others 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.640
 authority that is outdated is worth and by 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.170
 example, what do I know? 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 10.1 I oppose another number here and another 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.829
 version is ok and I copied yes yes 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.219
 you will say what can not be found 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.980
 this file well what would it have 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:55.769
 what to do is change this blog in 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.739
 run the dot bat you click 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.269
 right edit the vice here and we have 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:09.060
 that change this ere 0.1 by this ere 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:11.819
 1.0 or you put ere 1.0 and leave it 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.609
 you keep 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.990
 and now you will go perfectly applies to us 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.550
 it will go perfectly 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.400
 and good guys, these are the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.250
 mistakes that usually come up with the with the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.450
 bat and then good if you have already as I have 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.930
 said before wrong copied the code 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.720
 your effort the problem and not you 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.280
 problems of that from the computer not much 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.060
 less good is a problem that should be 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.310
 copied plus the code 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.660
 well then 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.930
 I hope you liked this video 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.930
 give you like favorites and see you in the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.410
 next tutorial for minecraft until the
