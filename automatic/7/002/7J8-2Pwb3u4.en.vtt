00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.950
 we have that too yes 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.950
 start from 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.800
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.840
 further consequence without job 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.669
 In any case, you should now 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.939
 again new friends or float 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.939
 bring 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.680
 The last time I have that very fun 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.059
 a lot of fun and that's why 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.000
 I just wanted to do it for zero 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.429
 adjust now determines determined 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.440
 there are still the two maps 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.149
 So nothing has changed except 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.780
 that cooling system because I'll give you the same 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.780
 explain 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 also faxes directly but also only 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.839
 because that can happen very fast 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.249
 to change 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.899
 it always gives me the 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:59.909
 two middle and places 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.839
 In any case, there is now that 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:14.520
 skillsystem will explain you now 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:17.220
 in which we have yet come where 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.890
 the wm shot that's you i see 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.380
 I'm just the second I have 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.810
 just five kills you have to stop at the end 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.520
 most kills have the matter yes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.530
 actually explained very simply because of that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.909
 This is quite short and sweet 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.100
 and happy and I also was 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.260
 spinner bockhorn a bit not okay 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.800
 In any case, then than now would be 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.350
 has most kills is the game continued 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.880
 so far and now is the gameplay 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.770
 has become much more aggressive and allowed her 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.420
 not so retire that way 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.229
 do not recognize that you can not do that now 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.729
 must now do more to be aggressive 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.860
 and try the most kills too 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.210
 I now have it pretty short 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.030
 have a moment 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:15.600
 or still come yes that comes 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:20.459
 i do not disconnect no such a osburg 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:26.310
 and now it complicity of their years 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:30.030
 comeback me but he always has many 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.459
 These watches made fear with 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.080
 his little red i thought it 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.930
 But then he was later where 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.769
 I hit it 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:44.540
 okay two arrows go on the hammer 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.489
 continue next 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.670
 there we have the next 1 against 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.980
 one stops it again against the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.209
 set direction gone 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.160
 okay but we can do that people who 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.989
 second one has just six kills though 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.350
 survive well now and still at least 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.510
 two three or one more idea at the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.700
 second work relatively large distance 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.820
 now we are used ice cold but 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.640
 not that bad because we just 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.489
 eleven kids have eleven kills but that 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.420
 not so much but to win here with the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.370
 hill 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.159
 is that enough 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.829
 I'm from 20 years old 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.640
 right off yes well I'm covered that 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:34.510
 is very nice 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:36.250
 The voice google news has it in mushroom 7 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.680
 seconds and are now over fresh 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.359
 People are running like that again 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.359
 good gameplay a second now stands 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.389
 and that's why I would say 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.909
 make the next round directly 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.439
 postage we go straight to a perfect one 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.810
 match rhine were also few 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.819
 seconds and that's why I would 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.859
 just say wish you either 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.819
 with andy webb places not presented 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.129
 always a bit quick 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.299
 Change because it is only at the moment 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.519
 There are two maps and yes definitely 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.079
 we will try as well too 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.489
 be like before because of round 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.319
 I 'm just picked up the garbage 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.720
 we are just the kings despite 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.419
 admission 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.110
 but ballack if I'm on everyone 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.740
 case with the multi-fighters makes a lot 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.210
 fun 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.380
 We have the dog, too 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.360
 no i just try everybody 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.680
 tailor dream told mouse 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.630
 but not so bad 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:46.520
 come no 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:46.520
 comdirect have taken away even if loud 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.990
 bekke is coming now now brought in 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.540
 bit meckel thing but that did not 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.570
 so bad because we already have one 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.700
 won round and if you can 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.440
 you just no the ones in the chats 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.550
 or so I come not write something 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.380
 Believe comes easy shoot comes 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.080
 hard to do 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.250
 probably and also at 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.920
 Boys are so good and fun 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.510
 I fight like that and that too in 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:33.350
 I was able to scratch 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:35.910
 really just everyone goes off 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.860
 yes that's the girl on every franc 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.960
 directly although it is first with the 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.960
 Michel's children did not have to be wrong 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:52.230
 also kills e commerce handed out 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.050
 good enough 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.610
 no just fucking a jerk in any case 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.540
 have died now but that does it 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:06.270
 nothing if you want more you can 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.960
 like to just in the comments 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.990
 write 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.780
 if you were so in the 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.280
 chamber gameplay has fallen against 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.870
 every case a positive rating there 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.090
 are is me on infra very excited 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.420
 we just went bad in the 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.140
 won first round and here has 13 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.580
 just so that does not like about now 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.050
 I 've got it, I already have it 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.990
 also managed to have 27 times without 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.670
 But that's because you have to 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.700
 I also expect so 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.530
 people yes then I would say at the end 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.270

 very small recording not so small 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.510

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.520
