00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.380
 the concept of atypicality was coined for 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.750
 unlink the clinical effect of 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.510
 Classical induction antipsychotics 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.940
 of extrapyramidal symptoms during 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.070
 50s and 60s the emergence of this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.970
 symptomatology was considered the indicator 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.859
 more viable that the drug worked 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.199
 the introduction of clozapine the 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.570
 first atypical antipsychotic I end up with 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.250
 this belief was just as effective 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.410
 about the positive symptoms that the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.050
 classic and did not produce its effects 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.050
 adverse characteristics but what is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.860
 must this feature 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.720
 fundamentally to his antagonism 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.190
 preferred of button receivers 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.230
 energetic 5hp things on the fingers in 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.820
 normal conditions the function of the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.559
 serotonin is to inhibit activity at 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.290
 dopaminergic in certain areas 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.439
 encephalic any antagonist of the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.960
 5h t2a receivers will favor the action 

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:59.269
 of dopamine we see the influence of 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 this serotoninergic antagonism about 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.660
 the range of characteristic symptoms 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.300
 schizophrenia 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.190
 I feel more positive all 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.650
 antipsychotics both classical and 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.850
 atypical act in one way or another on 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.920
 receivers d2 the lock 5h t2a no 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.640

 inhibitors 5h t2 to power the action 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 dopaminergic and reduces the symptomatology 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.580
 negative extrapyramidal symptoms the

 antagonist about 5 h 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.430
 but sanz at this level however the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.140
 Typicity can also be associated with 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.479
 dissociation speed of the receiver 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 dopaminergic most of the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.780
 atypicals are quickly separated from the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.340
 receiver once the effect has 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.840
 anti psychotic 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 this fast union is insufficient 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.580
 to trigger micro adverse effects 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.470
 spy such on the contrary the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.390
 classic antipsychotics stay 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.190
 exerting its effects during the time 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 it occupies in the receiver so it 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.660
 cause extrapyramidal symptoms

 fundi bula the antagonism 5 h prose 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.840
 divides the increase in prolactin and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.470
 decreases the incidence of effects 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.870
 undesirable affective symptoms near the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.520
 40 percent of schizophrenics 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.020

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.280
 other mechanisms have also been proposed 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.959
 specific to each drug the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.840
 continued administration of atypical 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.269
 produces an increase of 5 hp 2 receptors 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.780
 a 2 ce similar to that of antidepressants 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.450
 and this is the agonist drugs

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.640
 favors reception by 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.659
 the neurons of the signals 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.280
 serotoninergic cognitive deficit a 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.079
 cause of the excessive reduction of 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.359
 Dopaminergic activity in the month or 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.909
 cortical classic antipsychotics 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.290
 first the cognitive functions 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.090
 especially at high doses 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.290
 atypical antipsychotics do not have this 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.269
 effect neither at low doses nor at high doses 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.159
 however, atypicality is not an effect 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.170
 exclusive lock of 5h t2 still 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.750
 There are different ways to reach the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.250
 typicality each atypical antipsychotic 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.530
 presents a receiver profile and the

 exclusive the final clinical effect 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.510
 It will depend on the balance between all
