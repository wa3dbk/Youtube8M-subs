00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.820

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.030
 clara thanks you can see the new one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.980
 range rover evoque sure come thank you yes 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.859
 is approaching the most popular car 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 of the moment start from the front that is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.070
 characterized by the connotation 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.990
 decidedly sporty 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.820
 these new optical groups with 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.250
 the insertion of LED headlights starts 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 lateral that the characteristic 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.960
 let's say design more important than 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.180
 range rover evoque the air vents 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 this streamlined line that closes like this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.050
 like the back with these 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.690
 metal inserts with a connotation 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.670
 decidedly sporty despite being a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 off-road in every way 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.539
 like all the range rover also i 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 security concepts are exasperated and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.600
 reached the 5-star eurocup for the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.610
 safety 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 the interiors use materials 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 precious like leather and inserts in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.210
 wood metals both in regards to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.120
 external colors 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.699
 we have possible variants either 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.460
 clearly for the interiors they are 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.350
 characterized by skins in the various 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.750
 color combinations each range rover 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 evoque is unique I think that however for 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.570
 better appreciate the qualities of this 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.710
 reading would be worth a try 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.630
 on the road 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.790
 the driving of this is really exciting 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.729
 range rover evoque in the engines 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.590
 diesel we have a 150 horsepower than that 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.200
 what we are trying is a 190 horses 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 while the 2000 engine instead 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 gasoline the authorization much more 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.189
 performance 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 I have a feeling that everything is 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.729
 really handy even on the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.710
 flying all these buttons these 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.049
 absolutely true driving position 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.509
 sporting and dominant allows however also 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.009
 to have all the commands within reach 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.039
 hand be those you find on the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.280
 steering wheel than those found in the display 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.049
 7 inch touch screen by driving 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.630
 however, a real off-roader 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.130
 but I have the paddles like a sporty guide 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.869
 for the change 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.250
 if these are the makes of the steering wheel that you 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.469
 allow you to intervene manually 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.599
 on the changed then in any 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.759
 condition even now if you want can 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.799
 try to climb gear with the fathers of 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.549
 left while instead with the father of 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.009
 right 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.590
 the march is on the increase and instead these 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.819
 what buttons you need 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.709
 this is the terrain response a 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.959
 feature of all members can 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.360
 switch between normal driving as now 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.110
 moving the levers on the right has a guide 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.780
 on ice snow to a guide on mud 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.430
 a guide on the blood then to form 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.140
 on any road surface in 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.750
 better judgment then a true e 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.000
 just off-road a vehicle to everything 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.769
 terrain this is a feature of 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.049
