00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.750
 Today I am going to bring you as 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.150
 they saw another mobile because in they integrate 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.180
 upload a few photos and you like that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.770
 like ok you do not need to make another 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.650
 video better and although I wanted to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.350
 resist to try because I feel that no 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 I'm flooding them with house I said ok 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.910
 my orders could not reach the best 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.369
 moment of truth because already the spring 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.500
 is here and I am happy because at 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 less today with nice day we were like 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 at 50 degrees fahrenheit us centigrade 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.670
 what did I do is the day was beautiful like that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.370
 that really put me in so much humor 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.230
 make them this spring and good car 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 let's start and good if listening 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 background music please do not get angry 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 with me I usually like to have it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.750
 but now I want to have 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.940
 something in the background because then I feel that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.090
 all this is very quiet in the end he 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.850
 I feel that this hall test them 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.890
 it is with this precious that is of 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.720
 daisies and of course I love the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.550
 detail of the flowers we put is a 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.670
 sin that is spring and that no 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.560
 we add flowers in our clothes and good 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.740
 Mexican also the fact that it's like 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.930
 type broken as well as worn out in what 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.119
 is the sleeves and also in the part of 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.890
 down I am fascinated by this type of sweaters and 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.080
 The time is super super light but 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.479
 at the same time it warms you up if you're 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.700
 climbing a climate that is as cold I 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.560
 I was sure this was a dress 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.410
 but then I realized that when I 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.119
 I put it too short but it is 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.649
 too much of something to make a blouse 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.320
 The truth is that I can not lie to myself 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.960
 love the print I love that is 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.540
 butcher type the super cotton fabric 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.540
 fresh super breathable the next one is 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.670
 a real obsession for me and it is this 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.800
 skirt that really nothing if I could 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.660
 choose a garment to describe my 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.460
 style in all my closet 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.140
 I think it would probably be this 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.210
 skirt I know I told them I was very 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.729
 nice the day of truth is that 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.830
 the weather here in chicago is bipolar up 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.569
 and come down every day we open here 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.200
 they return us until as per may 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.959
 Believe me it's a real madness but 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.860
 Well, I loved it because it's a cat 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.860
 and the most 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.770
 I took his tail and his little ball fascinated me 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.630
 I loved reading that the kitten is made 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.910
 lace and well I 'm not a fan of 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.680
 put me such fat things in the street 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 but the truth is that the dress is 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.330
 beautiful the pattern is amazing and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.760
 well i'm 5 feet 4 inches which is 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.340
 164 Mexico so that you have a 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.630
 idea is worth me as half of the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.460
 museum that again is also that my 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.370
 style and my way of choosing the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.040
 clothes is super super cheesy and this is 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.070
 loose I loved it because it's that fabric 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.350
 although vaporous has some accounts here 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.630
 in the front is I do not know in carving you a 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.460
 little more and this one I thought I was going 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.350
 to stay for all I stay above the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.600
 knee which I'm super happy because 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.420
 these dresses are super practical Off 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.270
 you can put and with about 30 and rates and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.100
 golden I do not know or neutral color you see 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.900
 very very presentable but at the same time 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.270
 super comfortable and I love the fact 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.450
 that he brings as his own accessory and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.520
 good the hosel cuffs and for 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.080
 Of course that kind of clothes is perfect 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.600
 for when you leave I do not know 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.250
 when you want to be a little bit more 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.500
 formal but at the same time you want to have 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.140
 pretty colors nice clothes me 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000
 I usually do not look at the measures of 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.760
 the shoulders simply took into account 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.440
 the measure of what the bust is but 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.510
 now after I stay a little 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.040
 tight of tapes and like I do not know no 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.810
 I am very good the truth but what 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.940
 well enough to put me 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.100
 the best thing I do not know to make videos something 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.800
 so this color you know that the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.950
 radiant orchid year color or 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.940
 bright radiant a / rosita and violet 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.730
 but the truth is that it is difficult 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.890
 find the exact color so I said 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.560
 well I will look for the colors that are 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.540
 the more you are closer to the color of the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.880
 year to start incorporating it into 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.790
 microsoft is like fabrics and type t- shirts 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.490
 super super comfortable super cool and the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.590
 fact that it's line to also I 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.049
 fascinates is more circular than line I 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.940
 I think this is doing is like point 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.440
 I do not know if I get to see there but 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.049
 have as he hears 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.260
 I knew I needed it in my closet so 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.770
 Do not hesitate to order it and of course 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.570
 water color I love the color you 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.130
 goes well to my skin color too 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.200
 because that also sometimes you have to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.200
 take into account the colors that look 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.460
 always keep in mind your skin color 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.229
 when you order things or when you're 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.360
 buying clothes I know that sounds 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.220
 quite obvious but many times there 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.470
 people who did not take it into account and I was 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.009
 one of them I never before of the 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.380
 I never noticed what kind of colors 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.479
 they went to my skin tone I grabbed them 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.910
 what I liked this is also 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.220
 of ciÃ¨ncies follows from the whole game what 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.410
 which are the earrings the bracelet the necklace 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.330
 obviously all of the same color is a 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.009
 game but the truth is that I do not 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.560
 like to put everything has been at the same 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.289
 supercombined time to my son be 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.090
 true that it may not be already outdated 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.250
 but I love the pieces separately 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.620
 I feel that it looks very pretty in 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.110
 instagram I uploaded a photo and I told them 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.720
 that had come to me this said be this 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.780
 mass came with his dustbag 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.909
 that I have an excellent detail 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.340
 because environmental do not spend 500 or 2 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.080
 thousand dollars in your bag that does not want 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.970
 say that you do not want to take care of them but 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.800
 If I take care of my bags, it does not matter 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.990
 how much they cost me I will leave 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.190
 the link to the direct website if it is 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.450
 they want to go see 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.860
 they have to make an account just 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.450
 to see things but that does not want 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.910
 say that they are going to charge you absolutely 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.470
 I did not do anything, so I had it for 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.770
 a lot of time before I 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.260
 I will animate ordering the lining I kill myself for 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.570
 If I could not love him and warn the 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.610
 shoes feel super solid super 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.220
 well constructed that is to say that I have 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.940
 ordered to remove all of the stores from 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.790
 Chinese and do not feel so well made 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.250
 Like this, I look at those things a lot 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.310
 and good and clear that has this detail 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.350
 here of the closing as I told you I am 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.720
 trying to incorporate the color of the year 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.940
 in my new clothes so do not hesitate 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.730

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.890

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.570
