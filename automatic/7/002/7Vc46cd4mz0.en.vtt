00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
milk here and that will give us probably

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.609 
milk here and that will give us probably
about<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> cup<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.840> beautiful<00:00:19.350> cheese

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it around a little bit so I can see that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
it around a little bit so I can see that
that<00:00:43.290> has<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.800> started<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.309> simmer<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> boil

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
juice in here which is just separate the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.709 
juice in here which is just separate the
curds<00:00:53.039> from<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> whey<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.600> gonna

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
curds from the whey and it's gonna

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
curds from the whey and it's gonna
curdle<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.379> love<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.250> usually

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
curdle and I love this because usually

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.189

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
in cooking you're trying to get things

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.950 
in cooking you're trying to get things
not<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> curdle<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.789> situation<00:01:00.059> we

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
not to curdle but in this situation we

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
not to curdle but in this situation we
want<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> curdle<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.550> keep<00:01:02.789> adding<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

that asset you can see those curds

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.690 
that asset you can see those curds
forming<00:01:06.330> straightaway<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.430> I've

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
forming straightaway so now that I've

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
forming straightaway so now that I've
got<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> separation<00:01:09.540> between<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.990> cooed<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
got a separation between my cooed and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
got a separation between my cooed and
that<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> liquid<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.610> called<00:01:11.820> whey

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that kind of liquid which is called whey

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
that kind of liquid which is called whey
is<00:01:12.299> slightly<00:01:12.630> green<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> color<00:01:13.350> don't<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.950> put

is slightly green and color don't be put

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.710 
is slightly green and color don't be put
off<00:01:14.159> by<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.760> need<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> separate<00:01:15.479> those<00:01:15.659> two

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
off by that I need to separate those two

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.890 
off by that I need to separate those two
out<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:17.460> lining<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> colander<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
out just lining a colander here with a

quite a fanty-tale or a piece of muslin

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.590 
quite a fanty-tale or a piece of muslin
and<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.350> pour<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.979> under<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and we can just pour this under here and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.499 
and we can just pour this under here and
then<00:01:27.900> gather<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.350> your<00:01:28.560> cloth<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.240> see

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
that all that way is just draining out

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.880 
that all that way is just draining out
and<00:01:32.810> people<00:01:33.810> who<00:01:33.900> are<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.200> patient<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.770> to

lean and therefore you don't want it to
dry<00:02:39.540> out<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.379> very<00:02:41.010> slow<00:02:41.579> slow

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
and that heats gonna build obviously the

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.960 
and that heats gonna build obviously the
bottom<00:05:34.650> one<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:34.950> will<00:05:35.070> Brown<00:05:35.400> a<00:05:35.430> little<00:05:35.850> bit

and then I'll just flip my stack over
and<00:05:37.410> just<00:05:37.530> change<00:05:37.830> them<00:05:38.039> around<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.340> little<00:05:38.400> bit

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
and just change them around a little bit

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.790 
and just change them around a little bit
saves<00:05:39.180> heaps<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.720> time<00:05:39.870> rather<00:05:40.229> than<00:05:40.380> doing

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
saves heaps of time rather than doing

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.980 
saves heaps of time rather than doing
them<00:05:40.919> one<00:05:41.010> at<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.190> time<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.940> now<00:05:42.479> I<00:05:42.510> think<00:05:42.720> my
