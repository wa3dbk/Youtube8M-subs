the ox bra pop up slingshot crossbow
hopefully<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.840> time<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.500> able

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
hopefully this time I'm going to be able

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.019 
hopefully this time I'm going to be able
to<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> up<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.400> stage<00:00:26.609> where<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.880> can

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to get it up to the stage where I can

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.490 
to get it up to the stage where I can
put<00:00:27.210> some<00:00:27.359> bands<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.960> that'll<00:00:28.410> be

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
put some bands on it and that'll be

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.669 
put some bands on it and that'll be
really<00:00:28.619> good<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.689> I<00:00:30.689> called<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> designs<00:00:31.410> for

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
really good so I called the designs for

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740 
really good so I called the designs for
the<00:00:31.800> stirrup<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.610> top<00:00:32.820> bit<00:00:33.030> cut<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the stirrup and the top bit cut out and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
the stirrup and the top bit cut out and
all<00:00:34.230> I've<00:00:34.350> got<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.770> cut<00:00:34.980> them<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.160> of

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
all I've got to do is cut them out of

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.389 
all I've got to do is cut them out of
plywood<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.940> file<00:00:36.540> them<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.190> going

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
plywood and file them so what I'm going

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860 
plywood and file them so what I'm going
to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.579> first<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.000> I'm<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.450> drill<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
to do first is I'm going to drill the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.740 
to do first is I'm going to drill the
holes<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.100> pivots<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> trick

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
holes for the pivots to be on the trick

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.470 
holes for the pivots to be on the trick
mechanism<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> pivot<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
mechanism so for the pivot I'm going to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.029 
mechanism so for the pivot I'm going to
be<00:00:45.570> using<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.989> nail<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.770> four

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
be using this nail which is four

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
be using this nail which is four
millimeters<00:00:47.520> thick<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> be

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
millimeters thick so I'm going to be

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.600 
millimeters thick so I'm going to be
drilling<00:00:49.350> onto<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> scrap<00:00:49.950> piece<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> wood<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
drilling onto a scrap piece of wood to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.480 
drilling onto a scrap piece of wood to
stop<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.090> splintering<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> back

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.040 

you

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.140 

all<00:01:04.950> right<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.190> this<00:01:05.340> is<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.730> first<00:01:05.970> nail

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
all right so this is what the first nail

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.570 
all right so this is what the first nail
through<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.620> pivots<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.370> really

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
through and it pivots really really

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.980 
through and it pivots really really
nicely

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.330 

you

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.800 

right<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.579> now<00:01:26.789> I've<00:01:26.909> got<00:01:27.090> both<00:01:27.270> nails<00:01:27.569> in

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
right so now I've got both nails in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.319 
right so now I've got both nails in
place<00:01:28.109> and<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.920> both<00:01:29.219> pivot<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:30.119> really

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
place and they both pivot really really

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.760 
place and they both pivot really really
well<00:01:31.579> also<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.390> I've<00:01:33.810> put<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
well also as you can see I've put in a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.639 
well also as you can see I've put in a
little<00:01:34.920> nail<00:01:35.219> here<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.700> stop<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:36.649> trigger

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
little nail here to stop the trigger

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.510 
little nail here to stop the trigger
from<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.159> too<00:01:38.369> far<00:01:38.609> back<00:01:40.219> right<00:01:41.219> okay<00:01:41.459> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
from going too far back right okay so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.580 
from going too far back right okay so
now<00:01:42.329> I've<00:01:42.810> added<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:44.219> string<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.000> paracord

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
now I've added the string the paracord

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.089 
now I've added the string the paracord
to<00:01:46.590> connect<00:01:47.280> both<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> trigger<00:01:47.969> mechanism

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
to connect both the trigger mechanism

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.830 
to connect both the trigger mechanism
bits<00:01:50.099> together<00:01:50.959> so<00:01:51.959> it<00:01:52.490> works<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
bits together so it works like that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.190 
bits together so it works like that
and<00:01:55.759> I've<00:01:56.759> also<00:01:56.939> drilled<00:01:57.329> holes<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:58.020> these

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and I've also drilled holes in these

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.219 
and I've also drilled holes in these
plate<00:01:58.619> bits<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.179> they<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.689> go<00:02:00.929> over<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
plate bits so that they can go over the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.719 
plate bits so that they can go over the
front<00:02:01.379> like<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:02.280> I've<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.459> got<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
front like that now I've just got to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.839 
front like that now I've just got to
screw<00:02:03.000> them<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:04.159> right<00:02:05.159> okay<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.399> now<00:02:05.700> I've

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
screw them in right okay so now I've

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.300 
screw them in right okay so now I've
screwed<00:02:06.239> in<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.770> screws<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> plates

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
screwed in the screws for the plates

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
screwed in the screws for the plates
that<00:02:08.459> cover<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> trigger<00:02:09.119> mechanism<00:02:09.329> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that cover up the trigger mechanism and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
that cover up the trigger mechanism and
I<00:02:10.110> thought<00:02:10.319> I'd<00:02:10.440> videoed<00:02:10.799> me<00:02:10.979> doing<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> but

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
I thought I'd videoed me doing it but

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.030 
I thought I'd videoed me doing it but
the<00:02:12.030> camera<00:02:12.390> ran<00:02:12.569> out<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.750> memory<00:02:13.049> which<00:02:13.560> sucks

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
the camera ran out of memory which sucks

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.520 
the camera ran out of memory which sucks
and<00:02:14.160> I've<00:02:14.790> also<00:02:15.120> super<00:02:15.480> glued<00:02:15.690> these<00:02:15.900> nails<00:02:16.200> in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and I've also super glued these nails in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.199 
and I've also super glued these nails in
on<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:17.310> side<00:02:17.609> so<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:18.900> they<00:02:19.440> will<00:02:19.769> come<00:02:20.010> out

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
on this side so now they will come out

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.220 
on this side so now they will come out
now<00:02:21.209> I'm<00:02:21.299> just<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.599> cut<00:02:21.810> these<00:02:21.930> nails

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
now I'm just going to cut these nails

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.380 
now I'm just going to cut these nails
off<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.739> all<00:02:23.609> right<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.879> I've<00:02:23.970> cut<00:02:24.180> off<00:02:24.269> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
off here all right so I've cut off the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.729 
off here all right so I've cut off the
nails<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.290> how<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.470> trigger

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
nails and this is how the trigger

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.190 
nails and this is how the trigger
mechanism<00:02:25.950> looks<00:02:26.849> now<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.599> when<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> pull<00:02:28.079> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
mechanism looks now so when you pull the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.970 
mechanism looks now so when you pull the
trigger<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.889> and<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:30.630> pushes<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.739> up

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
trigger like that and it pushes that up

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.589 
trigger like that and it pushes that up
so<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.799> haven't<00:02:35.790> attached<00:02:36.299> any

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
so like that and I haven't attached any

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.690 
so like that and I haven't attached any
rubber<00:02:36.900> inside<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.620> pull<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:37.920> back<00:02:38.040> down<00:02:38.370> just

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
rubber inside to pull it back down just

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.750 
rubber inside to pull it back down just
because<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:40.019> couldn't<00:02:40.709> find<00:02:40.919> any<00:02:41.130> lastic<00:02:41.519> bands

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
because I couldn't find any lastic bands

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.879 
because I couldn't find any lastic bands
and<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.599> couldn't<00:02:42.840> find<00:02:43.079> anywhere<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.470> attach

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
and I couldn't find anywhere to attach

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.990 
and I couldn't find anywhere to attach
it<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.730> inside

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.730 

so<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> next<00:02:48.900> step<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.620> be

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
so the next step is going to be

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.370 
so the next step is going to be
attaching<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.580> small<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.630> mighty<00:02:51.810> magnet

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
attaching this small but mighty magnet

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.200 
attaching this small but mighty magnet
which<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.860> easily<00:02:53.220> hold<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.550> 15<00:02:53.910> millimeter

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
which can easily hold a 15 millimeter

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.310 
which can easily hold a 15 millimeter
steel<00:02:54.630> ball<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.520> it's<00:02:56.520> pretty<00:02:56.790> strong<00:02:57.320> so

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
steel ball and it's pretty strong so

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320 
steel ball and it's pretty strong so
what<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:58.740> going<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.190> is<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.820> bit<00:03:03.030> here

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
what I'm going to do is in this bit here

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.180 
what I'm going to do is in this bit here
I'm<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.170> drill<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.380> hole<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.680> then<00:03:04.980> put

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
I'm going to drill a hole and then put

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.580 
I'm going to drill a hole and then put
the<00:03:05.280> magnet<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:07.230> will<00:03:07.320> hold<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
the magnet in here and it will hold the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.650 
the magnet in here and it will hold the
ball<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:07.860> place<00:03:08.070> while<00:03:08.280> I'm<00:03:08.400> reloading

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:27.670 

you

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.550 

okay<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.269> glue<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.690> dried<00:03:29.989> on<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.200> market

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
okay so the glue is dried on the market

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.610 
okay so the glue is dried on the market
net<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.519> just<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:33.440> ball

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
net and it's just in that and the ball

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.220 
net and it's just in that and the ball
goes<00:03:33.830> in<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.069> fine<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.780> even<00:03:35.780> if<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.989> shake<00:03:36.170> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
goes in it fine and even if you shake it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.990 
goes in it fine and even if you shake it
it<00:03:36.470> doesn't<00:03:36.620> come<00:03:36.769> out<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.489> then<00:03:37.730> when<00:03:37.879> you

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
it doesn't come out and then when you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.149 
it doesn't come out and then when you
pull<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.269> trigger<00:03:38.299> it<00:03:38.840> pushes<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.860> ball<00:03:40.010> off

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
pull the trigger it pushes the ball off

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.110 
pull the trigger it pushes the ball off
fine<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.620> now<00:03:43.129> I'm<00:03:43.280> going<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.519> cut<00:03:43.700> out<00:03:43.849> this

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
that goes all the way through to the top

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.680 
that goes all the way through to the top
and<00:05:52.130> then<00:05:52.220> I<00:05:52.280> grind<00:05:52.520> at<00:05:52.640> the<00:05:52.730> top<00:05:52.910> off<00:05:53.090> and<00:05:53.300> a

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
and then I grind at the top off and a

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.690 
and then I grind at the top off and a
thinner<00:05:53.900> screw<00:05:54.140> that<00:05:54.260> goes<00:05:54.410> there<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:55.460> lot

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
thinner screw that goes there and a lot

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.210 
thinner screw that goes there and a lot
of<00:05:55.760> epoxy<00:05:56.180> resin<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:56.840> now<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.800> weapons

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
of epoxy resin and now the weapons

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.409 
of epoxy resin and now the weapons
finished<00:06:00.040> obviously<00:06:01.040> later<00:06:01.820> on<00:06:02.090> I'm<00:06:02.210> going<00:06:02.360> to

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
finished obviously later on I'm going to

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
like paint it and then add something to

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.010 
like paint it and then add something to
stop<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:04.880> bands<00:06:05.090> from<00:06:05.300> falling<00:06:05.720> off<00:06:05.840> every

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
stop the bands from falling off every

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.590 
stop the bands from falling off every
shot<00:06:06.410> but<00:06:07.130> it's<00:06:07.370> ready<00:06:07.669> to<00:06:07.730> shoot<00:06:07.940> for<00:06:08.210> now<00:06:08.300> so

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
shot but it's ready to shoot for now so

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.180 
shot but it's ready to shoot for now so
I'm<00:06:08.690> going<00:06:08.870> to<00:06:08.930> put<00:06:09.140> some<00:06:09.350> thera-band<00:06:09.590> gold<00:06:09.980> on

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
I'm going to put some thera-band gold on

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.360 
I'm going to put some thera-band gold on
it<00:06:10.310> now<00:06:11.080> so<00:06:12.080> I've<00:06:12.200> banded<00:06:12.530> it<00:06:12.620> up<00:06:12.710> with<00:06:12.950> two

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
it now so I've banded it up with two

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.190 
it now so I've banded it up with two
layers<00:06:13.550> of<00:06:13.700> thera-band<00:06:14.030> gold<00:06:14.419> each<00:06:14.600> side<00:06:14.930> and

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
layers of thera-band gold each side and

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.080 
layers of thera-band gold each side and
these<00:06:15.860> are<00:06:16.010> really<00:06:16.280> tapered<00:06:16.669> bands<00:06:16.970> as<00:06:17.060> well

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
these are really tapered bands as well

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.880 
these are really tapered bands as well
so<00:06:17.450> I'll<00:06:17.600> shoot<00:06:17.840> really<00:06:18.200> really<00:06:18.410> fast

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
so I'll shoot really really fast

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.100 
so I'll shoot really really fast
these<00:06:19.400> bands<00:06:19.640> also<00:06:19.910> pretense<00:06:20.630> so<00:06:20.930> that

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
these bands also pretense so that

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.620 
these bands also pretense so that
already<00:06:21.350> under<00:06:21.890> pressure<00:06:22.220> so<00:06:23.060> then<00:06:23.270> pulling<00:06:23.480> a

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
already under pressure so then pulling a

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.270 
already under pressure so then pulling a
black<00:06:23.840> sort<00:06:24.140> of<00:06:24.230> here<00:06:24.380> you<00:06:24.590> get<00:06:24.740> a<00:06:24.770> lot<00:06:25.100> of

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
black sort of here you get a lot of

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.300 
black sort of here you get a lot of
force<00:06:26.050> I've<00:06:27.050> had<00:06:27.260> to<00:06:27.440> wrap<00:06:27.560> a<00:06:27.740> bit<00:06:28.010> of<00:06:28.100> duct

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
force I've had to wrap a bit of duct

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.470 
force I've had to wrap a bit of duct
tape<00:06:28.340> around<00:06:28.730> the<00:06:28.910> bit<00:06:29.090> where<00:06:29.210> the<00:06:29.300> bands

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
tape around the bit where the bands

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.870 
tape around the bit where the bands
attached<00:06:29.870> because<00:06:30.260> it<00:06:30.620> was<00:06:30.740> firing<00:06:31.160> so<00:06:31.370> faster

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
attached because it was firing so faster

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.350 
attached because it was firing so faster
the<00:06:32.000> band's<00:06:32.180> kept<00:06:32.510> dripping<00:06:32.750> here

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
the band's kept dripping here

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.480 
the band's kept dripping here
and<00:06:34.720> then<00:06:34.840> we<00:06:34.990> firing<00:06:35.230> 15<00:06:35.770> millimeter<00:06:36.220> steel

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
and then we firing 15 millimeter steel

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.280 
and then we firing 15 millimeter steel
ball<00:06:36.790> at<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.480> Orangina<00:06:37.900> can<00:06:38.200> over<00:06:38.650> there<00:06:40.290> all

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
ball at the Orangina can over there all

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.960 
ball at the Orangina can over there all
right<00:06:41.380> so<00:06:41.620> this<00:06:41.860> is<00:06:41.920> how<00:06:42.160> you<00:06:42.220> load<00:06:42.490> the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
right so this is how you load the

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.530 
right so this is how you load the
slingshot<00:06:43.780> you<00:06:44.470> put<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.770> ball<00:06:44.980> in<00:06:45.250> there<00:06:45.730> then

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
slingshot you put the ball in there then

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.690 
slingshot you put the ball in there then
you<00:06:46.690> put<00:06:46.870> your<00:06:46.960> foot<00:06:47.170> on<00:06:47.200> it<00:06:47.440> there<00:06:47.590> and<00:06:48.490> then

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
you put your foot on it there and then

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.380 
you put your foot on it there and then
grab<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.870> pulse<00:06:50.110> here<00:06:50.440> and<00:06:50.790> then<00:06:51.790> you<00:06:51.910> pull<00:06:52.210> it

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
grab the pulse here and then you pull it

00:06:52.390 --> 00:07:00.630 
grab the pulse here and then you pull it
up<00:06:53.220> and<00:06:54.220> over<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:55.780> ball<00:06:58.890> it's<00:06:59.890> it's<00:07:00.370> pretty

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
up and over the ball it's it's pretty

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.420 
up and over the ball it's it's pretty
cold<00:07:00.910> out<00:07:01.120> here<00:07:01.390> so<00:07:01.450> the<00:07:01.750> bands<00:07:01.960> on<00:07:02.230> and<00:07:02.500> doing
