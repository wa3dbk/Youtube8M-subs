00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
cut it with a topcoat about divested
carbon<00:01:06.509> and<00:01:06.719> that<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.079> create<00:01:07.469> an<00:01:07.679> inert

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
carbon and that will create an inert

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.999 
carbon and that will create an inert
atmosphere<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.819> there<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.799> give<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009

graphene coated sound once you've done

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.899 
graphene coated sound once you've done
that<00:01:13.289> you<00:01:13.619> repeat<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.009> process<00:01:14.219> again<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.819> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that you repeat the process again so you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
that you repeat the process again so you
get<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.270> layers<00:01:15.539> of<00:01:15.810> graphene<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.560> sound

is<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.060> he<00:01:39.240> did<00:01:39.450> without<00:01:40.319> its<00:01:40.709> amorphous

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
is just he did without its amorphous

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.769 
is just he did without its amorphous
covering<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> will<00:01:41.939> reduce<00:01:42.299> back<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:42.779 
covering and it will reduce back to

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:45.379 
covering and it will reduce back to
graphene<00:01:43.109> dealers<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.909> spread<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:44.999> out<00:01:45.119> and

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
it back now and so as I say it is so

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.249

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
we're going about doing it now if you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.560 
we're going about doing it now if you

want to give it really powerful
antibacterial<00:02:36.870> logical<00:02:37.710> properties<00:02:37.980> what

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
antibacterial logical properties what

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.780 
antibacterial logical properties what
you<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.150> mix<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:39.980> silver<00:02:40.980> nitrate<00:02:41.010> so

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
you do is mix it with silver nitrate so

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.760 
you do is mix it with silver nitrate so
you<00:02:41.850> mix<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.360> graphene<00:02:42.959> oxide<00:02:43.080> at<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> right

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
you mix the graphene oxide at the right

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.590 
you mix the graphene oxide at the right
concentration<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.910> some<00:02:45.090> silver<00:02:45.420> nitrate

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
concentration with some silver nitrate

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.220 
concentration with some silver nitrate
and<00:02:46.100> then<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.610> leave<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.880> alone<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.390> 24<00:02:48.870> hours

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and then you leave it alone for 24 hours

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.960 
and then you leave it alone for 24 hours
it's<00:02:49.410> some<00:02:49.560> sodium<00:02:49.920> borohydrate<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.850> that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
it's some sodium borohydrate and that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.420 
it's some sodium borohydrate and that
will<00:02:51.150> reduce<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.470> silver<00:02:52.800> nitrate<00:02:52.980> down

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
will reduce the silver nitrate down

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.220 
will reduce the silver nitrate down

you<00:03:00.690> then<00:03:00.900> Washington<00:03:01.500> centrifuge<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.160> so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
you then Washington centrifuge it so

I think a little involved and the silver
