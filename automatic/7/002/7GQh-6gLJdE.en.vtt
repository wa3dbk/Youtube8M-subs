00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.930
 toys and their themes apart from 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.760
 the classics have been 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.759
 evolving and adapting in each 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.160
 epoch but on some occasions like the 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.770
 that today I will show global trends 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.759
 they are not always the most appropriate for 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.390
 adapt them to children's games toys 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.390
 lethal 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.560

 alfred cartoon gilbert businessman and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 in addition American inventor was leader 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.170
 responsible for one of the companies of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.720
 most important toys world 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 acy gilbert company pioneer in toys 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.420
 very similar construction classics 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.940
 to the well-known mecano founded in 1909 in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.979
 westwood canary than the gilbert company 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.150
 opened its doors offering supplies 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.150
 for magic shows 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.390
 year after year it was gaining ground and 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.670
 using the range of products for 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.080
 attraction of new buyers who 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.290
 better than with making toys 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.720
 children were before the beginnings of 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.440
 the toy companies right there 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.310
 where child safety measures 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.310
 they were absent 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.350
 Gilbert was a revolutionary pioneer 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.119
 the toy industry and involved 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.950
 the children to a methodical in which they 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.899
 provided tools that helped 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.240
 to arouse the concern for 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.979
 I learned a way in which I achieved 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.380
 that the children will approach in a 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.990
 simple to science sciences that of 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.990
 some way a country moved forward 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.780
 the idea was always an idea 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.730
 remarkable and especially acceptable and more than 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.220
 Some of us will remember those 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.770
 classic toys those that brought 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.320
 I get a microscope with those packages 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.030
 20 x 30 centimeters full of fun 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.340
 with which we used to play suddenly 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.270
 we owe it to adults to be 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.270
 Mr. Gilbert 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.890
 Hayes and Gilbert was already a company 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.930
 recognized began the production of 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.450
 kits like the classic biology kit 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.269
 where they provided real insects 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.099
 for your analysis but one of the kits 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.950
 that more furor had among the children of the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.380
 era was named laboratory of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.380
 atomic energy gilbert and 238 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.049
 the name says it all a mini 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.049
 laboratory of chemical experiments 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.910
 it is then that advertising was not done 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.920
 wait and there was no toy catalog 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.849
 that included the announcement of the novelty 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.849
 laboratory 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.890
 descriptions like now you will see the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.019
 trajectories of electrons and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.209
 alpha particles that travel at speeds 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.209
 of more than 10,000 kilometers per second 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.480
 shortly afterwards the great 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.680
 controversial and this because the kit included 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.680
 radioactive components 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.120
 inside the kit we could find a 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.159
 Gain counter is a device for 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.819
 measure the radioactivity of an object 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.950
 Place 4 samples of uranium ore 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.530
 a camera of wilson also known 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.239
 as a fog camera which serves to 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.579
 detect radiation particles 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.010
 three ionizing radiation sources 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.159
 low level alpha particles of lead and 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.590
 polonium ruthenium beta particles and 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.930
 possibly zinc gamma particles 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.269
 that supposed game turned out to be 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.980
 extremely dangerous and it did not take long 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.469
 to position itself as one of the most 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.489
 dangerous in the world which was at 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:03.709
 sale only for one year of 1950 the 51 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.510
 since it was withdrawn from the market by the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.510
 clear risk to buyers 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.720
 something peculiar in this kit is a 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.239
 cartoon that came included titled 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.950
 that would divide the atom whose hyphen 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.480
 it was written with the help of the general 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.220
 leslie drops 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.830
 curiously the project director 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.440
 manhattan that project that culminated with 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.010
 the detonation of two atomic bombs a 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.590
 August 6, 1945 those that were 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.590
 detonated in Hiroshima and Nagasaki 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.690
 It should be clarified that this was not the only 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.300
 controversial toy of the time there was 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.039
 some others launched years ago in 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.960
 where the little ones could use lead 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.120
 cast 'to create their own soldiers 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.940
 but undoubtedly the appointed 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.729
 atomic energy lab was one 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.729
 of the most dangerous ever created 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.669
 do not 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.030
 and this is the world's good head 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.030
 nights
