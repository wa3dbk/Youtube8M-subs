00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.370 
but I don't know how honest that is
because<00:04:32.150> if<00:04:32.300> they<00:04:32.420> were<00:04:32.480> more<00:04:32.750> transparent

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
because if they were more transparent

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.450 
because if they were more transparent
there<00:04:33.500> would<00:04:33.650> be<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.770> lot<00:04:33.950> less<00:04:34.160> legal

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460

considering<00:05:01.640> SLV<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.240> would<00:05:02.900> wait<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.290> would

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
considering SLV I would wait I would

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.470 
considering SLV I would wait I would
look<00:05:04.100> at<00:05:04.250> some<00:05:04.430> strip<00:05:04.550> on<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:04.850> Canada<00:05:05.210> if<00:05:05.360> you

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
look at some strip on of Canada if you

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.120 
look at some strip on of Canada if you
can't<00:05:05.720> wait<00:05:05.840> too<00:05:05.990> much<00:05:06.020> longer<00:05:06.140> because<00:05:06.920> I

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
can't wait too much longer because I

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.670 
can't wait too much longer because I
think<00:05:07.310> they're<00:05:07.430> very<00:05:07.460> good<00:05:07.760> or<00:05:08.510> i<00:05:09.170> would

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
think they're very good or i would

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.140 
think they're very good or i would
definitely<00:05:09.890> wait<00:05:10.100> till<00:05:10.280> sports<00:05:10.580> physicals

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150

far the safer way to go you're going to

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.020 
far the safer way to go you're going to
be<00:05:15.290> paying<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.620> premium<00:05:15.830> but<00:05:16.640> that's<00:05:16.850> going<00:05:16.970> to

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
be paying a premium but that's going to

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.760 
be paying a premium but that's going to
be<00:05:17.150> including<00:05:17.600> insurance<00:05:17.930> costs<00:05:18.260> peace<00:05:18.620> of
