00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.880
 as for the early 80's the muriel 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.400
 moreno meeting daniel chair with the 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.460
 guitarist josÃ© tamarins who show a 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.080
 little group called the yellow shadow 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.790
 quickly the group will be called 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.460
 niagara in tribute to marilyn monroe 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.010
 since in fact muriel moreno it's 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.370
 the almost perfect anagram of bride 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.800
 mans and so it's in memory of the movie 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.899
 from henry hathaway niagara as europe 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.519
 call it like that 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.280
 remember that niagara has sold more than 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.210
 three million tell us that their 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.909
 clips made careers 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.120
 international and today the title 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:50.239
 that I chose I saw is a role that 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.859
 extraordinarily furiously influenced 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.050
 by the thorns listening right now 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.260
 and then we look like finally for 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.260
 to play 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.140
 directs the first internal funds 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.140
 miami 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.390
 he put in the busy 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.950
 but his keel 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.950
 it exists on him 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.390
 fifth in the cage would have 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.380
 7th 15 better and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.009
 umpteenth 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.009
 corner 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.800
 manitou 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080
 again 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.670
 and 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.670
 and there we change we go on the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.400
 fifth rope from there we come back on the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.560
 half rope to the 5th 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.440
 satyam 6th 5th and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.040
 third 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.119
 welcome 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.119
 in fact the whole 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.349
 I'm starting 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.010
 and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.010
 m 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.120
 I 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.230
 and we are kids we will put the 7th on the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:41.700
 rope from there we'll do a fifth 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:45.860
 body from there as to the rsa thoroughly each 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.860
 time is tempting but 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:55.490
 twice again then we do 7th 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:06.170
 strings of the golden rope does not come when 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.170
 you sleep and seventh dead alone 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.610
 giant orolia picks up the start 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.180
 m 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.730
 that's where the bottleneck comes in 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.879
 so be careful I remind you 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.860
 is a standard tuning ie 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.239
 that with the bottleneck we can not 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.049
 play all the strings as on a 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.099
 open tuning 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.370
 So here we are on it is to say that 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.370
 go do 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.960
 the first danger chord 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.129
 1 then we will go to the second 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.129
 agreement that will be the sign 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.910
 and before going back to the mile 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.329
 mount the chorus I will play 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.329
 basically about the position 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.489
 position of sight 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.130
 position from there 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.130
 position of the sones 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.490
 thousand
