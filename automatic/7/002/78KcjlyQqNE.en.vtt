he<00:02:01.530> wants<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.829> fight<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> champions<00:02:02.640> who

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
he wants to fight all the champions who

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
he wants to fight all the champions who
wants<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> clean<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> 126<00:02:04.259> division<00:02:04.710> and

he wants Walters next or any other

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.900 
he wants Walters next or any other
champion<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:11.400> that'd<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> good

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
champion so I think that'd be a good

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.280 
champion so I think that'd be a good
fight

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
fight

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.839 
fight
him<00:02:13.860> against<00:02:14.129> bringing<00:02:14.340> down<00:02:14.549> would<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
him against bringing down would be a

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.130 
him against bringing down would be a
good<00:02:15.000> fight<00:02:15.239> i'll<00:02:15.390> pick<00:02:15.599> along<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:15.930> chango
