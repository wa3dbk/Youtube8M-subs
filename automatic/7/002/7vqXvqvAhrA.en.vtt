00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.130 
overall from top to bottom that's going
to<00:00:40.920> provide<00:00:41.190> him<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.480> foremost<00:00:42.930> with

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
to provide him first and foremost with

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
to provide him first and foremost with
the<00:00:43.260> breathability<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.100> he<00:00:44.280> needs<00:00:44.489> while

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the breathability that he needs while

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.900 
the breathability that he needs while
he's<00:00:45.539> playing<00:00:46.070> second<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> we've<00:00:47.730> added

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
he's playing second to that we've added

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.889 
he's playing second to that we've added
an<00:00:48.390> underarm<00:00:48.989> mesh<00:00:49.500> gusset<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.629> we've<00:00:51.629> called

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
an underarm mesh gusset and we've called

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
an underarm mesh gusset and we've called
it<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.350> color<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.940> as

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it out in color so this is about as

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.209 
it out in color so this is about as
minimal<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.690> color<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.320> we've<00:00:55.559> ever<00:00:55.710> gone<00:00:55.949> on

minimal as color as we've ever gone on
the<00:00:56.370> garmin<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.120> that's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the garmin but really that's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
the garmin but really that's
highlighting<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> performance<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
highlighting the performance and the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790 
highlighting the performance and the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
actual benefit of the garment and that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.260 
actual benefit of the garment and that
where<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.129> need<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.309> most<00:01:02.609> you're<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
where you need it most you're going to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.570 
where you need it most you're going to
get<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> most<00:01:03.690> breathability<00:01:04.580> the

get the most breathability the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.880 
get the most breathability the
engineered<00:01:06.090> mesh<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:06.930> front

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
engineered mesh here that you see front

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
engineered mesh here that you see front
and<00:01:08.070> back<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> garment<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.260> constructed

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and back on the garment is constructed

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760 
and back on the garment is constructed
using<00:01:10.549> multi<00:01:11.549> rows<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.180> linear<00:01:12.770> different

weights of mesh and that was really

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.670 
weights of mesh and that was really
inspired<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.860> lines<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> court

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
inspired by the the lines of the court

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.440

the crew is here in the inner gusset for

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520 
the crew is here in the inner gusset for
breathability<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> short<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.020> then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
breathability on the short and then

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.010 
breathability on the short and then
finally<00:01:38.100> some<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:38.970> critical<00:01:39.420> seems<00:01:39.750> your

finally some of your critical seems your

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.219 
finally some of your critical seems your
side<00:01:40.320> seam<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.210> your<00:01:42.210> back<00:01:42.420> yoke<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.049> been

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
side seam and your back yoke have been

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.780 
side seam and your back yoke have been
bonded<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.950> again<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.610> zero

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
bonded and again that's a zero

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
bonded and again that's a zero
distraction<00:01:45.570> solution<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.619> bit<00:01:46.770> less

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
distraction solution a little bit less

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.420 
distraction solution a little bit less
thread<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> bulk<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:49.070> less<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.280> be

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
thread and bulk a little less to be

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.940 
thread and bulk a little less to be
worried<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.790> while<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> court

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
worried about while you're on the court

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
worried about while you're on the court
finally<00:01:52.950> we've<00:01:53.130> angled<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> side<00:01:53.880> seam<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
finally we've angled the side seam so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
finally we've angled the side seam so
that<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> falls<00:01:54.930> closer<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> front<00:01:55.979> that's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that it falls closer to the front that's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.760 
that it falls closer to the front that's
another<00:01:56.790> way<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> create<00:01:57.840> less<00:01:58.079> distraction

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
another way to create less distraction
