alright<00:00:07.290> let's<00:00:07.529> get<00:00:07.589> started<00:00:07.649> it's<00:00:08.189> important

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
alright let's get started it's important

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.700 
alright let's get started it's important
for<00:00:08.820> most<00:00:09.480> projects<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.200> especially<00:00:10.440> this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
for most projects and especially this

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.459 
for most projects and especially this
project<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.759> know<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.809> plausible<00:00:13.410> for

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
project to know what is plausible for

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.930 
project to know what is plausible for
the<00:00:13.740> effects<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.219> want<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.670> I'm<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the effects that you want to do I'm a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
the effects that you want to do I'm a
huge<00:00:15.179> fan<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.389> Ruby<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.199> would<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.440> liked

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
huge fan of Ruby and I would have liked

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.439 
huge fan of Ruby and I would have liked
to<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> lot<00:00:17.310> more<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.119> had<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> be

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to do a lot more but I had to be

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.240 
to do a lot more but I had to be
reasonable<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.170> flying<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.619> seattle<00:00:19.800> I

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
reasonable I was flying out to seattle I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.040 
reasonable I was flying out to seattle I
didn't<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> green<00:00:21.330> screen<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.689> didn't<00:00:21.930> have

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
didn't have a green screen I didn't have

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.870 
didn't have a green screen I didn't have
a<00:00:22.080> huge<00:00:22.410> crew<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> went<00:00:23.369> through<00:00:23.519> all<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
a huge crew so I went through all the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.910 
a huge crew so I went through all the
Ruby<00:00:24.150> trailers<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.960> found<00:00:25.109> effects<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
Ruby trailers and I found effects that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.650 
Ruby trailers and I found effects that
were<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.189> only<00:00:26.550> cool<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.210> effects<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
were not only cool and effects that I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.839 
were not only cool and effects that I
want<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> do<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.920> were<00:00:29.010> plausible<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
want to do but that were plausible and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.700 
want to do but that were plausible and
that<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> could<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.960> done<00:00:31.109> efficiently

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that I could get done efficiently

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.580 
that I could get done efficiently
without<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.910> lot<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> fancy<00:00:33.600> equipment<00:00:33.960> for

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
without a lot of fancy equipment for

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
without a lot of fancy equipment for
Weiss's<00:00:34.920> part<00:00:35.190> i<00:00:35.340> knew<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> i<00:00:35.880> wanted<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.329> add

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
Weiss's part i knew that i wanted to add

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.840 
Weiss's part i knew that i wanted to add
in<00:00:36.809> her<00:00:36.960> eyes<00:00:37.140> projectiles<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.070> appear<00:00:38.820> in

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
in her eyes projectiles that appear in

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.479 
in her eyes projectiles that appear in
the<00:00:39.149> trailer<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> had<00:00:40.890> our<00:00:40.980> cause<00:00:41.190> player

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the trailer so I had our cause player

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
the trailer so I had our cause player
act<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> similar<00:00:42.510> motion<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.100> tracked<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
act out a similar motion I tracked the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.400 
act out a similar motion I tracked the
footage<00:00:44.550> animated<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> added<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.140> these

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
footage animated and added in these

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.040 
footage animated and added in these
snowflakes<00:00:46.969> then<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.090> made<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> projectiles

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
snowflakes then I made the projectiles

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.709 
snowflakes then I made the projectiles
in<00:00:49.379> trapcode<00:00:49.980> particular<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.850> added<00:00:51.449> video

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
in trapcode particular and added video

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.069 
in trapcode particular and added video
copilot<00:00:51.960> optical<00:00:52.500> flares<00:00:53.100> over<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.809> then<00:00:54.809> I

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
copilot optical flares over that then I

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
copilot optical flares over that then I
added<00:00:55.230> another<00:00:55.620> set<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> particles<00:00:56.250> tracked

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
added another set of particles tracked

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.900 
added another set of particles tracked
the<00:00:57.360> generator<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.109> her<00:00:58.500> blade<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.699> in

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the generator to her blade and then in

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.189 
the generator to her blade and then in
effects<00:01:00.500> generate<00:01:01.500> cell<00:01:02.489> pattern<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
effects generate cell pattern you can

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.840 
effects generate cell pattern you can
change<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.739> pattern<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.220> crystallize<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
change your pattern to crystallize and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.050 
change your pattern to crystallize and
you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.570> frosty<00:01:07.290> ice<00:01:07.530> effect<00:01:08.070> added

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
you can get this frosty ice effect added

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
you can get this frosty ice effect added
a<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> motion<00:01:09.780> blur<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:09.990> top<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
a bit of motion blur on top of that and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.280 
a bit of motion blur on top of that and
we<00:01:11.280> had<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.610> solid<00:01:11.909> effect<00:01:15.290> after

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
we had a pretty solid effect after

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350 
we had a pretty solid effect after
watching<00:01:16.860> Blake's<00:01:17.340> trailer<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> noticed<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
watching Blake's trailer I noticed that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.300 
watching Blake's trailer I noticed that
she<00:01:18.570> gets<00:01:18.720> these<00:01:18.840> cool<00:01:19.140> purple<00:01:19.470> streaks<00:01:20.040> every

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
she gets these cool purple streaks every

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.760 
she gets these cool purple streaks every
time<00:01:20.549> she<00:01:20.729> slices<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> did<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> same

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
time she slices so I did that the same

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
time she slices so I did that the same
way<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> did<00:01:23.240> Weiss's<00:01:24.240> effects<00:01:24.600> which<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
way I did Weiss's effects which was in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
way I did Weiss's effects which was in
trapcode<00:01:25.560> particular<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> change

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
trapcode particular you have to change

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.760 
trapcode particular you have to change
the<00:01:27.299> parameters<00:01:27.720> round<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the parameters round a little bit to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
the parameters round a little bit to
make<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:29.040> look<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.490> streaks<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
make them look more like streaks and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.340 
make them look more like streaks and
less<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.689> frosty<00:01:31.229> particles<00:01:32.900> for<00:01:33.900> Ruby<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
less like frosty particles for Ruby I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.640 
less like frosty particles for Ruby I
wanted<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> add<00:01:35.220> her<00:01:35.549> iconic<00:01:35.909> red<00:01:36.299> petals<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
wanted to add her iconic red petals so I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.460 
wanted to add her iconic red petals so I
googled<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.549> photo<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.090> petals<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.200> stout

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
googled a photo of petals I'm a stout

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
googled a photo of petals I'm a stout
one<00:01:40.829> made<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.549> 3d<00:01:41.880> layer<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.420> then<00:01:42.810> changed

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
one made it a 3d layer and then changed

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.370

from there I animated it spinning a
little<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.130> pre-comp<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> layer

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
little bit and then pre-comp the layer
