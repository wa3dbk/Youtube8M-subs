00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.020
 Today I 'm going to teach you to do something that 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:08.570
 is super fashion that is super easy 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.389
 economical and is super fun to 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.070
 do are china paper pompoms or 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.620
 tissue paper and they are good so easy and 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.440
 they only need 8 to 10 sheets of 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.940
 Chinese paper or color tissue paper 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.550
 that you want scissors and a little bit 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.369
 of thread 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 first of all we are going to unfold the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.390
 sheets of paper 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.470
 since they are all folded in this case 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.730
 I have two types of blue so I'm going 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.930
 to interleave 1 and 11 clarito one dark 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.629
 one clarito one higher and so on 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.579
 that we have the eight sheets one on top 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.489
 of the other 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.890
 What is missing is to break it in half 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.320
 we just follow the line and what 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.739
 we doubled it in half and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.739
 ready 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.210
 since it 's folded in half that's 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.430
 the diameter that our 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.860
 pompom of this size is going to be 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.580
 and all you have to do is start 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.370
 to fold it in the form of a fan or 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.680
 accordion we bend for one side we bend 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.720
 for the other one side to the other and 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.720
 well up to fit with all the paper 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.729
 since we have done accordion we take 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.759
 through the center we cut a piece of thread 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.409
 and tie it up is all there is 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.409
 tie it in the center 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.090
 then we take our scissors and 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.400
 each end we cut in a curve 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.310
 or they can also cut it in the form of 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 peak but in this case I did it in 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.270
 curve shape they have to grab some 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.160
 pretty sharp scissors because they are 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.720
 many papers and then it costs a lot 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.360
 work if they are not well sharpened the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.970
 Scissors does not have to be like that either 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.000
 super perfect there are some like 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.360
 piquitos because they are many leaves is 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.770
 very thick but it does not matter because when 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.770
 make the flower you will not notice 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.820
 and well they will stay this way 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.220
 they will extend and will start 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.900
 separate very carefully and with 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.700
 patience every leaf 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.970
 in this way 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.190
 one by one space so you do not 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.830
 break, do not despair like me 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.430
 they were going to count just half in this 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.820
 case we use 8 sheets then like what 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.920
 we fold in half they 're going to be 16 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.510
 let's count 8 and we're going to dump the 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.549
 other side 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.980
 that is the secret so that it is well 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.959
 fluffy grandma 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.700
 that when we count 8 on one side what 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.209
 we turn and start to unfold 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.209
 other side 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.310
 and good when we finish 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.240
 all you have to do is flip and 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.760
 start unfolding on the other side already 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.470
 separate from the other side we count to 8 what 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.510
 we turn around and start doing 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.720
 for the opposite side and when we finish 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.610
 this unfolding process of separating 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.160
 each sheet of paper 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.320
 our ball is going to be and nothing 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.470
 more will be how to accommodate it 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:22.150
 little bit here a little here and now 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.310
 that I have a wonderful idea for 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.490
 decorate birthday you can even 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.560
 hang in your bedroom looks very father and 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.370
 You can combine all the colors that 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.020
 want 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.550
 and well there it is for my friends 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.550
 and that's all for now 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.020
 good and I forgot to tell you that 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.240
 they can also make pompoms of all 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.860
 the sizes only have to follow 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.930
 the rule that the size in which 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.090
 start making the accordion wide 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.610
 that is going to be the diameter of what is going 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.350
 to stay your pompom so if you want it 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.210
 make bigger what they will have to be 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.680
 would buy instead of 8 16 sheets and 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.010
 so they do not have to double by the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.470
 half and it will be longer and 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.100
 this is how a big soto pompon will look 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.980
 beautiful and the opposite if they want it 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.950
 make smaller cut in half of the 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.220
 sheet and so they will have a pompom more 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.680
 small the one I made are in size 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.270
 medium but just follow that simple rule 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.250
 and they will be able to make the pompoms of 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.250
 all the colors and sizes that you want
