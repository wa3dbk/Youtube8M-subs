a<00:00:24.510> groundbreaking<00:00:24.960> architectural<00:00:25.800> model

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
a groundbreaking architectural model

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
a groundbreaking architectural model
building<00:00:26.400> design<00:00:26.730> -<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.210> enables<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
building design - that enables you to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
building design - that enables you to
physically<00:00:28.289> bring<00:00:28.439> your<00:00:28.619> projects<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.220> life

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
physically bring your projects to life

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.600 
physically bring your projects to life
it's<00:00:30.240> based<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:31.289> real<00:00:31.380> modular<00:00:32.279> building

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
it's based on a real modular building

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
it's based on a real modular building
system<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.870> basically

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
system and so it's basically

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.549 
system and so it's basically
miniaturized<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:36.120> create<00:00:36.559> miniature

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
miniaturized to create miniature

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920 
miniaturized to create miniature

while<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:40.860> working<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.340> office<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.879> was

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
while I was working in my office I was

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170 
while I was working in my office I was
creating<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:43.140> modular<00:00:44.040> housing<00:00:44.309> system<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
creating a modular housing system that I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.910 
creating a modular housing system that I
thought<00:00:45.420> could<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.200> improvement<00:00:46.649> on

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
thought could be an improvement on

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
thought could be an improvement on
anything<00:00:47.190> else<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.910> there<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
anything else that was out there and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
anything else that was out there and
while<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.079> doing<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.739> started<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
while I was doing that I started to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.650 
while I was doing that I started to
create<00:00:51.420> models<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> my<00:00:52.949> idea<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.270> while<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> was

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
create models of my idea and while I was

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.830 
create models of my idea and while I was
creating<00:00:55.140> those<00:00:55.980> models<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.850> tried<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> find

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
creating those models I tried to find

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.360 
creating those models I tried to find
out<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.500> anything<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
out if there was anything out there that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.569 
out if there was anything out there that
could<00:00:59.879> allow<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:01.079> make<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> model<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
could allow me to make a model but that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
could allow me to make a model but that
I<00:01:02.760> could<00:01:02.940> reuse<00:01:03.300> again<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:04.080> opposed<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
I could reuse again as opposed to just

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.030 
I could reuse again as opposed to just
sticking<00:01:05.220> stuff<00:01:05.909> together<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.950> my

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
sticking stuff together with and to my

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
sticking stuff together with and to my
astonishment<00:01:08.310> there<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> absolutely<00:01:09.270> nothing

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
astonishment there is absolutely nothing

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.469 
astonishment there is absolutely nothing
I<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.500> all<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:10.650> direction<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.490> into<00:01:11.909> trying

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
I put all my direction then into trying

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
I put all my direction then into trying
to<00:01:12.510> create<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.320> series<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.430> components<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to create a series of components that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.649 
to create a series of components that
would<00:01:15.689> enable<00:01:15.900> me<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.850> make<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> model<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.450> also

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
would enable me to make a model but also

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.429 
would enable me to make a model but also
allow<00:01:19.810> me<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.819> modify<00:01:21.819> it<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.259> reuse<00:01:23.259> those

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
allow me to modify it and reuse those

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.719 
allow me to modify it and reuse those
components<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.159> order<00:01:24.249> to<00:01:24.399> create<00:01:24.700> a
