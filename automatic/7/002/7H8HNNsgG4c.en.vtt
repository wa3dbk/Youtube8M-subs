00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
be efficient with this weapon now I did

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.250 
be efficient with this weapon now I did
say<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> best<00:00:33.090> weapon<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.020> kind

say this was the best weapon and I kind

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.600 
say this was the best weapon and I kind
of<00:00:34.320> changed<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.649> mind<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.280> lot

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
of changed my mind about that a lot

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.370 
of changed my mind about that a lot
during<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> course<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> first<00:00:37.140> few

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
during the course of the first few

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200 
during the course of the first few
months<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> game<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:38.820> now<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> can

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
months of the game but right now I can

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
months of the game but right now I can
firmly<00:00:39.480> say<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> ak-12<00:00:40.410> rip<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
firmly say I think the ak-12 rip is the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.490 
firmly say I think the ak-12 rip is the
best<00:00:41.550> variant<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> ak-12<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.200> mean<00:00:43.350> look

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
best variant of the ak-12 I mean look

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130 
best variant of the ak-12 I mean look
the<00:00:43.620> recoil<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.520> almost<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.420> miniscule<00:00:45.960> it's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the recoil it's almost so miniscule it's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.400 
the recoil it's almost so miniscule it's
hard<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> even<00:00:47.340> tell<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.850> honest<00:00:48.239> downs<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
hard to even tell to be honest downs is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.990 
hard to even tell to be honest downs is
great<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.980> gonna<00:00:50.129> put<00:00:50.280> an<00:00:50.370> image<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
great I'm gonna put an image up of the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
great I'm gonna put an image up of the

still<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:27.299> low<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.140> normal

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
still really low because the normal

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.890 
still really low because the normal
ak-12<00:01:28.770> has<00:01:28.979> 45<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.759> extended<00:01:30.150> mags<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.479> it's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
still over the normal amount the ak-12

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.030 
still over the normal amount the ak-12
has<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.720> alec<00:01:34.170> cinematic<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
has with alec cinematic so that's a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520 
has with alec cinematic so that's a
definite<00:01:35.729> must<00:01:36.000> need<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.509> helps<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> win<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
definite must need it helps you win a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.710 
definite must need it helps you win a
lot<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.770> gunfights<00:01:38.310> secondly<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.090> recommend

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
lot more gunfights secondly I recommend

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
lot more gunfights secondly I recommend
the<00:01:39.780> silencer<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.130> for

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the silencer because you can see if for

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.830 
the silencer because you can see if for
some<00:01:41.340> reason<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.909> seems<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.689> know

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
some reason it seems like I know I know

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
some reason it seems like I know I know
this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.409> case<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.490> reason<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
this is the case but for some reason the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
this is the case but for some reason the
ak-12<00:01:45.119> seems<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> has<00:01:45.960> no<00:01:46.290> recoil<00:01:46.649> with

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
ak-12 seems like it has no recoil with

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.069 
ak-12 seems like it has no recoil with
the<00:01:46.979> silencer<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.659> head<00:01:48.869> thing

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the silencer it's it's just a head thing

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.630 
the silencer it's it's just a head thing
for<00:01:49.350> me<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> makes<00:01:49.680> me<00:01:49.829> play<00:01:50.220> better<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.549> don't

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
for me it makes me play better I don't

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.219 
for me it makes me play better I don't
know<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.479> case<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.869> guys<00:01:52.079> but

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
know if that's the case for you guys but

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319 
know if that's the case for you guys but
I<00:01:52.320> recommend<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> silencer<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.369> lastly<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
I recommend the silencer and lastly I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
I recommend the silencer and lastly I
recommend<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> stock<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.740> substitute

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
recommend the stock you can substitute

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039 
recommend the stock you can substitute
this<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> grip<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.060> want<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.780> find

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this for the grip if you want but I find

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109 
this for the grip if you want but I find
that<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> ak-12<00:01:58.619> rip<00:01:58.979> especially<00:01:59.640> has<00:01:59.790> no

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that the ak-12 rip especially has no

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.950 
that the ak-12 rip especially has no
recoil<00:02:00.890> whatsoever<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.810> like

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
recoil whatsoever so I really don't like

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
recoil whatsoever so I really don't like
to<00:02:04.079> run<00:02:04.259> grip<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.619> would<00:02:05.040> rather<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.310> able<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to run grip I would rather be able to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
to run grip I would rather be able to
move<00:02:05.820> more<00:02:06.329> side<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> side<00:02:07.079> when<00:02:07.229> I'm<00:02:07.290> aiming

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
move more side to side when I'm aiming

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.570 
move more side to side when I'm aiming
down<00:02:07.590> sights<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.009> helps<00:02:08.190> me<00:02:08.310> win<00:02:08.459> more

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
down sights that helps me win more

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.550 
down sights that helps me win more
gunfights<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.239> way<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> guys<00:02:10.259> might

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
gunfights that way but you guys might

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.960 
gunfights that way but you guys might
have<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.890> different<00:02:11.459> opinion<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.450> so
