and<00:03:43.790> then<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.720> one<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.139> Eva's<00:03:45.530> mousse<00:03:45.769> so

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
and then this one is Eva's mousse so

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.559 
and then this one is Eva's mousse so

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
looks like on and I have to say that I

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.140 
looks like on and I have to say that I
actually<00:04:54.620> like<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.370> color<00:04:55.669> I<00:04:55.789> would<00:04:56.060> have

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
actually like this color I would have

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.320 
actually like this color I would have
never<00:04:56.590> picked<00:04:57.590> this<00:04:57.740> up<00:04:57.919> on<00:04:58.159> my<00:04:58.250> own<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:59.090> only

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
never picked this up on my own the only

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.670 
never picked this up on my own the only
reason<00:04:59.599> I<00:04:59.659> picked<00:04:59.870> it<00:04:59.990> up<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.260> because<00:05:00.289> I

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
reason I picked it up is because I

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.500 
reason I picked it up is because I
wanted<00:05:01.010> to<00:05:01.070> swatch<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.820> entire<00:05:02.120> collection

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
wanted to swatch the entire collection

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.050 
wanted to swatch the entire collection
for<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.020> guys<00:05:03.229> but<00:05:03.830> ordinarily<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.700> is<00:05:04.849> not

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
for you guys but ordinarily this is not

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.810 
for you guys but ordinarily this is not
a<00:05:05.090> color<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:05.870> would<00:05:06.140> personally<00:05:06.610> pick<00:05:07.610> out

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
a color that I would personally pick out

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.080 
a color that I would personally pick out
for<00:05:08.510> myself<00:05:08.900> but<00:05:09.200> I<00:05:09.409> actually<00:05:09.880> really<00:05:10.880> like<00:05:11.060> it

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
for myself but I actually really like it

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.089 
for myself but I actually really like it
it's<00:05:11.360> something<00:05:11.599> different<00:05:12.200> I<00:05:12.409> think<00:05:12.979> it

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
it's something different I think it

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.980 
it's something different I think it
complements<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.700> blush<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.630> am<00:05:14.750> wearing

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
complements the blush that I am wearing

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.200 
complements the blush that I am wearing
right<00:05:15.320> now<00:05:15.380> really<00:05:15.919> well<00:05:16.099> which<00:05:16.370> is<00:05:16.610> the

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
right now really well which is the

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.330 
right now really well which is the
hourglass<00:05:17.719> mood<00:05:18.020> exposure<00:05:18.380> which<00:05:19.130> is<00:05:19.310> a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
hourglass mood exposure which is a

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.790 
hourglass mood exposure which is a
plummy<00:05:19.760> color<00:05:20.060> that's<00:05:21.050> what<00:05:21.229> I'm<00:05:21.320> using<00:05:21.530> to

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
plummy color that's what I'm using to

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.529 
plummy color that's what I'm using to
apply<00:05:22.070> my<00:05:22.310> lipstick<00:05:22.700> with<00:05:22.880> it's<00:05:23.360> what<00:05:23.450> it

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
apply my lipstick with it's what it

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.240 
apply my lipstick with it's what it
looks<00:05:23.690> like<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.349> feel<00:05:24.530> like<00:05:24.590> they

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
looks like and I feel like they

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.640 
looks like and I feel like they
complement<00:05:25.849> each<00:05:25.940> other<00:05:26.180> really<00:05:26.270> well<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:27.560> if

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
complement each other really well so if

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.500 
complement each other really well so if
you<00:05:27.740> guys<00:05:27.919> have<00:05:28.190> this<00:05:28.370> blush<00:05:28.729> and<00:05:29.090> your

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.490 
complexion is similar to mine this is
definitely<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.940> good<00:05:32.180> thing<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.780> match<00:05:33.200> that

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
definitely a good thing to match that

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.060 
definitely a good thing to match that
but<00:05:34.070> now<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.580> last<00:05:35.030> one<00:05:35.419> is<00:05:35.750> called<00:05:36.260> Lea's

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070
