00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.059
 I think the fair move day with one 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.109
 the debt freeze 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.679
 and that is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.839
 i'm quiet actually that doesn't turn on then the freeze at the club 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.070
 and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.909
 a debt freeze that is 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.749
 ten good solution 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.929
 For the future of the club that only ensures that there is 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.140
 the square or the bad situation will be in that we are now 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 actually is lokomotiv 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 but we have to reverse 0 a total, there must be one 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.250
 get rid of those debts 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.210
 otherwise it is not over then antwerp in future certainly with in mind 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.289
 that he is the new 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.800
 competition formula 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.220
 not according to the channel the nasdaq season 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.470
 I think that I am in another important way and antwerp to make sure they are 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.090
 those 8 clubs are in second class 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.460
 we must be better protected and have that chance 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.910
 fountain 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.690
 she made that promise go 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.330
 most important thing 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.880
 of our plan 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 there one can klinsi with a clean 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.000
 running sheet of paper can start building the club again 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.420
 to rebuild again focus on the sporting and the urgent task 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 the football club so it shouldn't be busy I think I was there 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.990
 in two months 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.620
 or maybe in three months 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.290
 around the us now and then the investments will have in this club 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 in history on the history that this is known 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.010
 I have not seen parties in such a short time 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.010
 having hidden so much money in the club 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.260
 I didn't come here with that 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.960
 ten years for beer 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.320
 in second class it became an offer to do 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.720
 unfortunately I cannot guarantee 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.080
 when we could go first class 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 in football we always need a little luck inside the post 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.779
 outside pole 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.839
 but I can say that 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.839
 Everything will be done 24 hours a day 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.799
 we got the players to the organization to the club 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.489
 to go first class 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.429
 you can not guarantee it and this after five years 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.999
 that will be five years that we will fight and have the ambition to 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.499
 go first class 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.819
 without that ambition to the first class I would never have seen animals again 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.029
 And I think everything is there to make that plan 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.790
 to realize so currently is the players budget 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 is in euro compartments 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.879
 already grabbed a paw door nsz a month 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.090
 so that's not just wages 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.519
 but at actually the total package is what that the players 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.879
 the club currently costs 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.269
 the red bulls also have all its meaning because this is included annually if their too 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.849
 interrogate 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.189
 core of the building is too simple 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.219
 should be possible 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.319
 shares offered 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.279
 without power 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.519
 who produced 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.629
 you think 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.579
 really a huge challenge 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.909
 is basically a sponsor 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.389
 4 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.009
 thanks for julien c 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:28.509
 fall under this 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.509
 after 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 the state all the fall 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:38.840
 the turnaround in the competition 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.199
 in the hands of a second 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.629
 supporters 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.299
 it's a party 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.609
 to make the recession and that is dangerous 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.519
 what a different one 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.359
 on the e3 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.759
 in the rapper's history 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.759
 they all want a place in it 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.679
 9 they steps we can take 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.679
 to read that message 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.739
 in September 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.589
 edit or shorten 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.589
 the blame lies behind us 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.799
 This year it is said says 33 topics 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.439
 the reconsiderations 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.340
 financial sector 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.090
 invest in the players group 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.300
 strangers 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.479
 the editors 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.909
 fourth place 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.259
 it's a chance if you offer them 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.199
 that exists of 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.509
 Yes and then 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.900
 reinforcement 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.020
 unilever 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.020
 could play unfortunately
