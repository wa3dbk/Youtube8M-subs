to<00:02:07.020> incorporate<00:02:07.530> rating<00:02:07.920> system<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> game

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
to incorporate rating system in the game

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.710 
to incorporate rating system in the game
I<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.330> should<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.539> between

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
I don't think it should be between

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.300 
I don't think it should be between
players<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
players I think it actually be like a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.369 
players I think it actually be like a
vendor<00:02:11.819> vendor<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.629> actually<00:02:12.959> trade<00:02:13.230> your

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
vendor vendor you actually trade your

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.910 
vendor vendor you actually trade your
exotics

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
exotics

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
exotics
and<00:02:14.040> he<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.370> give<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.610> strange<00:02:14.910> coins<00:02:15.209> I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and he would give you strange coins I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.120

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
think that would be more better and how

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.710 
think that would be more better and how
this<00:02:17.310> how<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.520> would<00:02:17.760> do<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.420> was<00:02:18.540> at

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
section we'll talk about it cuz I feel

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.370 
section we'll talk about it cuz I feel
like<00:04:59.970> destiny<00:05:00.360> shouldn't<00:05:00.750> put<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:00.930> in<00:05:01.230> it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
like destiny shouldn't put that in it

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.720 
like destiny shouldn't put that in it
but<00:05:01.530> if<00:05:01.650> they<00:05:01.770> did<00:05:02.010> they<00:05:02.040> should<00:05:02.310> do<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.520> my<00:05:02.700> way

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
but if they did they should do it my way
