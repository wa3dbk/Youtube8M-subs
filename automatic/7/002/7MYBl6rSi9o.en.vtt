any moisture that may have got stuck
inside<00:00:50.210> see<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.239> happens<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.899> when

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
inside see what happens is that when

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
inside see what happens is that when
these<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.440> placed<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.460> particular<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.149> was

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
these are placed this particular one was

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.279 
these are placed this particular one was
placed<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> four-wheeler<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.289> so

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
placed on the four-wheeler this way so

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.340 
placed on the four-wheeler this way so
you<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.680> hardcase<00:00:59.460> salt<00:00:59.910> shield<00:01:00.350> then

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you have this hardcase salt shield then

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.780 
you have this hardcase salt shield then
you<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.739> epoxy<00:01:02.370> based<00:01:02.960> substance<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
you have this epoxy based substance that

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.539 
you have this epoxy based substance that
keeps<00:01:05.790> everything<00:01:06.060> intact<00:01:07.340> well<00:01:08.340> what

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
keeps everything intact well what

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
keeps everything intact well what
happens<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> person<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.450> driving<00:01:09.600> they're

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
happens when a person is driving they're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.929 
happens when a person is driving they're
picking<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.890> moisture<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> whatnot<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> it's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
picking up moisture and whatnot and it's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 
picking up moisture and whatnot and it's
bouncing<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.439> trying<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
bouncing up there and like trying to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
bouncing up there and like trying to
devices<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:14.400> they're<00:01:14.549> working<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
devices when they're working this is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
devices when they're working this is
what<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.049> 20<00:01:16.470> bikes<00:01:16.650> they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
what this is it's like 20 bikes they

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.100 
what this is it's like 20 bikes they
they<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:18.119> got<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> heat<00:01:18.930> there

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
they they got a little bit of heat there

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
they they got a little bit of heat there
under<00:01:19.380> drawing<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> moisture<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.330> that

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
under drawing it moisture and when that

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.050 
under drawing it moisture and when that
moisture<00:01:21.810> cool<00:01:22.020> goes<00:01:22.200> inside<00:01:22.880> through<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
moisture cool goes inside through the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.359 
moisture cool goes inside through the
extremely<00:01:24.960> hairline<00:01:25.530> cracks<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.220> just

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
extremely hairline cracks that just

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
extremely hairline cracks that just
develops<00:01:26.759> over<00:01:27.000> age<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> can't<00:01:28.380> really

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
develops over age and you can't really

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.149 
develops over age and you can't really
see<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:29.869> then<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> moisture<00:01:31.170> gets<00:01:31.470> trapped

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
see them then the moisture gets trapped

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
see them then the moisture gets trapped
in<00:01:32.400> there<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.210> cannot<00:01:33.540> escape<00:01:33.840> because

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
in there and it cannot escape because

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.789 
in there and it cannot escape because
the<00:01:34.740> way<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.579> set<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:37.229> can't<00:01:37.470> escape

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the way this is set up you can't escape

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
the way this is set up you can't escape
through<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.340> Moisture<00:01:39.270> needs<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> evaporate

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
through here Moisture needs to evaporate

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.830 
through here Moisture needs to evaporate
upwards<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.850> case<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.329> cannot<00:01:42.630> do

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
upwards so in this case it cannot do

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.389 
upwards so in this case it cannot do
that<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.290> they<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:43.590> place<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.159> way

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that and they don't place it this way

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
that and they don't place it this way
because<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> opposite

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
because then that would be the opposite

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.810 
because then that would be the opposite
now<00:01:46.350> when<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:46.950> driving<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> trails

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
now when you're driving down the trails

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.370 
now when you're driving down the trails
and<00:01:48.060> whatnot<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.659> puddle<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> nut<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and whatnot just a puddle is a nut and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
and whatnot just a puddle is a nut and
whatever<00:01:49.619> else<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.640> water<00:01:50.850> comes<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.240> rests

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
whatever else the water comes and rests

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.060 
whatever else the water comes and rests
on<00:01:51.600> top<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.049> goes<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
on top of there and goes in and then a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.280 
on top of there and goes in and then a
definitely<00:01:53.399> can't<00:01:53.640> escape<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
definitely can't escape so it's kind of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.179 
definitely can't escape so it's kind of
a<00:01:57.439> well<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.829> those<00:01:58.950> things

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
a well it's just one of those things

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.679 
a well it's just one of those things
it's<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.670> one<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.969> those<00:02:00.030> things<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it's just one of those things not a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's just one of those things not a
whole<00:02:00.840> lot<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.649> over<00:02:01.920> time

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
whole lot you can do about it over time

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.639 
whole lot you can do about it over time
the<00:02:02.369> seal<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.820> kind<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.229> lets<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> little

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the seal here kind of lets go a little

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.990 
the seal here kind of lets go a little
bit<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.070> allows<00:02:05.250> moisture<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:05.850> in

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
bit and it allows moisture to go in

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.700 
bit and it allows moisture to go in
there<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.869> ends<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.110> happening<00:02:07.170> is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
there and then what ends up happening is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.199 
there and then what ends up happening is
that<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> electronics<00:02:08.489> with<00:02:08.580> inside<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that the electronics with inside this

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.670 
that the electronics with inside this
the<00:02:10.170> kind<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> malfunction<00:02:11.039> which

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the kind of malfunction which

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.830 
the kind of malfunction which
kind<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.069> make<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.400> bike<00:02:13.549> not<00:02:13.730> work<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.390> like

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
kind of make the bike not work and like

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.520 
kind of make the bike not work and like
I<00:02:14.930> say<00:02:15.110> about<00:02:15.730> 75%<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.849> time<00:02:17.090> all<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.230> takes

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
I say about 75% of the time all it takes

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.100 
I say about 75% of the time all it takes
is<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.739> good<00:02:19.010> heating<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.569> I<00:02:20.629> mean<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.810> good

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
is a good heating up and I mean a good

eating up you're not going to touch this

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.940 
eating up you're not going to touch this
when<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.360> remove<00:02:23.629> it<00:02:23.690> from<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.989> oven<00:02:24.019> you're

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
not going to be touching it even to this

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.839 
not going to be touching it even to this
point<00:02:26.540> right<00:02:26.659> now<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.140> barely<00:02:27.790> keep<00:02:28.790> my

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
fingers to it it's that hot and that's

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.610 
fingers to it it's that hot and that's
the<00:02:31.670> idea<00:02:31.940> folks<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.870> want<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.170> get<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.440> really

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
the idea folks you want to get it really

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.009 
the idea folks you want to get it really
hot<00:02:33.760> all<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:34.879> say<00:02:35.000> ten<00:02:35.239> minutes<00:02:35.269> there's<00:02:35.930> no

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
hot all right say ten minutes there's no

real timeframe you know I think nothing
melts<00:02:40.310> everything<00:02:40.940> stays<00:02:41.360> okay<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.230> little

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
melts everything stays okay all a little

melts everything stays okay all a little
pocket<00:02:42.769> plastic<00:02:43.430> connectors<00:02:44.360> they<00:02:44.480> fail<00:02:44.720> okay

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
pocket plastic connectors they fail okay

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.390 
pocket plastic connectors they fail okay
they<00:02:45.200> get<00:02:45.290> soft<00:02:45.590> look<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.980> see<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.190> want<00:02:46.340> to

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
they get soft look I see the want to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.420 
they get soft look I see the want to
squeeze<00:02:46.640> money<00:02:47.590> but<00:02:48.590> time<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:49.040> don't<00:02:49.160> want<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
squeeze money but time you don't want to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.580 
squeeze money but time you don't want to
go<00:02:49.579> overboard<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.540> either<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.500> know

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
go overboard with it either you know

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.619 
go overboard with it either you know
eventually<00:02:51.890> we'll<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.340> mounting<00:02:52.549> things<00:02:52.910> so

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
eventually we'll be mounting things so

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.910 
eventually we'll be mounting things so
you<00:02:53.690> don't<00:02:53.840> want<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.019> do<00:02:54.079> that<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.349> idea<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.709> to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
you don't want to do that the idea is to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.830 
you don't want to do that the idea is to
get<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.250> part<00:02:55.519> here<00:02:55.730> extremely<00:02:56.239> hot<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.450> any

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
get this part here extremely hot so any

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.229 
get this part here extremely hot so any
moisture<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:57.290> with<00:02:57.620> inside<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:58.370> can

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
moisture that's with inside this can

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.819 
moisture that's with inside this can
evaporate<00:02:59.569> through<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.140> little<00:03:00.230> cracks<00:03:00.620> that

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
evaporate through in little cracks that

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.789 
evaporate through in little cracks that
developed<00:03:01.220> over<00:03:01.459> time<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:03.019> then<00:03:03.349> after<00:03:03.680> that

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
developed over time and then after that

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.839 
developed over time and then after that
you<00:03:04.099> resell<00:03:04.579> it<00:03:04.700> reseal<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:06.079> top<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.849> you

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
you resell it reseal the top of this you

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.819 
you resell it reseal the top of this you
can<00:03:08.030> try<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:08.269> first<00:03:08.540> before<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.319> go<00:03:09.650> through

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
can try it first before you go through

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.949 
can try it first before you go through
the<00:03:09.890> houses<00:03:10.099> will<00:03:10.370> resealing<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.659> can<00:03:11.810> put

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the houses will resealing it you can put

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.619 
the houses will resealing it you can put
it<00:03:11.989> back<00:03:12.170> on<00:03:12.409> your<00:03:13.299> application<00:03:14.299> whatever<00:03:14.480> it

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
it back on your application whatever it

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.949 
it back on your application whatever it
may<00:03:14.750> be

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
may be

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.979 
may be
test<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:15.950> out<00:03:16.010> see<00:03:16.069> if<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.430> works<00:03:16.609> again<00:03:16.940> if<00:03:17.389> it

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
test it out see if it works again if it

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.610 
test it out see if it works again if it
does<00:03:18.200> then<00:03:18.980> we<00:03:19.669> seal<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.200> any<00:03:21.349> future

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
does then we seal this so any future

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.280 
does then we seal this so any future
moisture<00:03:22.160> cannot<00:03:22.549> get<00:03:22.730> back<00:03:22.880> inside<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.510> so

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
moisture cannot get back inside this so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.420 
moisture cannot get back inside this so
basically<00:03:24.470> what<00:03:24.799> you're<00:03:24.919> going<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.190> be<00:03:25.280> doing

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
basically what you're going to be doing

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.159 
basically what you're going to be doing
is<00:03:25.669> that<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.120> cracks<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.630> developed<00:03:27.079> over

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
is that the cracks that developed over

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.199 
is that the cracks that developed over
time<00:03:27.459> you're<00:03:28.459> basically<00:03:28.730> going<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:28.910> seal<00:03:29.060> them

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
time you're basically going to seal them

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.569 
time you're basically going to seal them
back<00:03:29.389> up<00:03:29.599> and<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:30.799> never<00:03:30.889> know<00:03:31.099> you<00:03:31.340> may<00:03:31.430> get

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
back up and you never know you may get

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.339 
back up and you never know you may get
another<00:03:31.700> ten<00:03:32.030> years<00:03:32.209> from<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.510> fluid<00:03:32.900> CD<00:03:33.169> box

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
another ten years from the fluid CD box

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.339 
another ten years from the fluid CD box
see<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.859> eye<00:03:33.889> box<00:03:34.220> it's<00:03:35.180> worth<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.419> try<00:03:35.629> this

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
see the eye box it's worth a try this

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.170 
see the eye box it's worth a try this
particular<00:03:36.620> box<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.220> about<00:03:37.400> two<00:03:37.879> hundred<00:03:37.970> and

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
particular box is about two hundred and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.960 
particular box is about two hundred and
fifty<00:03:38.480> dollars<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:39.859> mean<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.280> little<00:03:40.849> bit

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970
