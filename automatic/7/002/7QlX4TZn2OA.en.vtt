00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 felipe has ten tattoos scattered around 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.940
 body and already thinks about increasing this number 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.940
 today he does with the professional tattoo artist 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 who take due care but 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 first one was not like this 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.550
 then you discover that rather as 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.770
 really works 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.800
 I think I did not take the risk in case 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.590
 luckily it did not happen no 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.920
 problem but there are many risks in 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.560
 do the technique without taking precautions 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 according to this dermatologist the client 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.460
 should always look at the history of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.340
 tattoo artist job 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.800
 I usually say that the indication is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.680
 always good because most of the studios 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 tattoos are not 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 are duly monitored by the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 monitoring bodies 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.629
 sanitary 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 in addition the professional should use 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.930
 syringes and disposable materials for 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.920
 ensure process cleaning as soon as possible. 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.570
 important is the whole and then the donor 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 without harvesting the material that works with 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 disposables safe material 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 handling of the material and such 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.900
 and there to make the tattoo with the necessary 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 care will rarely occur 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.840
 complication 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.540
 but if the work is done without 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.700
 Caution Needed Both Tattoo Artist 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.369
 customers are at risk of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.720
 contracting infections and even 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.659
 hepatitis c 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.360
 hepatitis B has greatly increased the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.110
 incidence of these diseases and to the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.759
 hiv 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.829
 We have to be careful. Besides, it's 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 increased the number of cases in 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.350
 tattooed people who have had infection 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.600
 by a staphylococcus aureus bacterium 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.460
 that it is a bacterium that it is very 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.630
 resistant to the vast majority of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.329
 antibiotics 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.600
 so we are very afraid of the epd 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.670
 AIDS and not during the act the act 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.979
 dermatologist points out that people 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.009
 allergic and with 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.479
 should think well before 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.940
 get the tattoo 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.360
 already for those who did and repented there are 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.520
 methods for the removal of pigments yes 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.880
 nowadays 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.090
 we have some technologies that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.890
 can successfully remove a tattoo 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.220
 it's the lasers 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.010
 there are several types of laser and 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.760
 We even have to look at the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.980
 pigment that was used in the tattoo and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.230
 know exactly which laser we use 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.840
 we will use to remove the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.030
 tattoo on the streets the opinions on 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.030
 tattoos are different 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.580
 luciano does not have the courage to do 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.010
 I already I wanted to do and not today 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.710
 has more will because it is something that 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.560
 if you have to think a lot about your body and 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.030
 your version for me today I have one 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.830
 son and I do not want to give this 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.980
 example and in the future 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.190
 already leandro has several and wants more more 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.750
 three plus three current 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.490
 I think it beautified beauty was beautiful 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.200
 for everybody here like 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.660
 he does not like it but he makes a sudden 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.230
 brindley is pleased with what has already 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.160
 has its theme more than 20 in set up and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.610
 do more 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.400
 No, it's okay for me to come to 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.920
 dermatologist the person should think and 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.170
 long before deciding to make a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.050
 Tattoo has to decide at the moment 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.440
 of maturity has to be an attitude 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.440
 well thought out
