are<00:00:15.780> not<00:00:15.929> confirmed<00:00:16.410> by<00:00:16.560> any<00:00:16.740> means<00:00:16.949> it's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430

are not confirmed by any means it's
complete<00:00:17.760> speculation<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.390> my<00:00:18.480> part<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
complete speculation on my part but I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.240 
complete speculation on my part but I
think<00:00:19.590> there<00:00:19.710> might<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.920> little<00:00:20.010> bit<00:00:20.189> of

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
think there might be a little bit of

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.550 
think there might be a little bit of
evidence<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:21.359> know<00:00:21.449> maybe<00:00:21.689> maybe<00:00:22.199> not<00:00:22.320> for

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
evidence you know maybe maybe not for

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.779 
evidence you know maybe maybe not for
these<00:00:22.650> features<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.490> new<00:00:23.760> things

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
these features but like for new things

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.779 
these features but like for new things
coming<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.250> before<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.670> get

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

mojang<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> Minecraft<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.940> now<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
mojang now in Minecraft so so now that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
mojang now in Minecraft so so now that
they<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.780> charge<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.440> thinking

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
they are in charge of it I'm thinking

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
they are in charge of it I'm thinking
that<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> consoles<00:00:39.360> will<00:00:39.899> probably

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
that you know the consoles will probably

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.229 
that you know the consoles will probably
get<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:40.739> manpower<00:00:41.070> behind<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
get some more manpower behind them and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.209 
get some more manpower behind them and
we'll<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.780> some<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.680> these

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
we'll get some more you know like these

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.440 
we'll get some more you know like these

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
don't think well i don't i'm not sure if

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
don't think well i don't i'm not sure if
we'll<00:01:03.090> ever<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.600> those<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.140> console<00:01:04.710> because

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
we'll ever get those on console because

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
we'll ever get those on console because
it<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.129> seems<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.519> they're<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.000> taxing

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it just seems like they're really taxing

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.770 
it just seems like they're really taxing
on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> system<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.729> i<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.420> they

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
on the on the system but i do think they

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
on the on the system but i do think they
could<00:01:09.930> bring<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.740> things<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.850> know

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
could bring in little things you know

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
could bring in little things you know
that<00:01:12.240> would<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.840> spice<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> game<00:01:13.740> they

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
that would really spice up the game they

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
that would really spice up the game they
would<00:01:14.640> give<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.270> more<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:16.140> guess<00:01:16.920> not

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
would give it so much more I guess not

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
would give it so much more I guess not
playability<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.939> new<00:01:18.150> features<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
playability but like new features and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.200 
playability but like new features and
stuff<00:01:18.900> new<00:01:19.229> items<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.759> things<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.060> think

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
stuff new items and the things I think

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.609 
stuff new items and the things I think
they're<00:01:21.330> gonna<00:01:21.390> bring<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.840> or<00:01:22.170> error<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
they're gonna bring in or error that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
they're gonna bring in or error that
they<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.189> possibility<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.939> bringing<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
they as a possibility of bringing in is

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.679 
they as a possibility of bringing in is
rubies<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.310> rubies<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:27.360> could<00:01:27.509> get

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
rubies and then with rubies we could get

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
rubies and then with rubies we could get
uh<00:01:28.140> rubies<00:01:29.100> I'll<00:01:29.729> tell<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> other<00:01:30.060> thing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
uh rubies I'll tell you the other thing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
uh rubies I'll tell you the other thing
in<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> second<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.200> rawr<00:01:31.560> single<00:01:31.829> rubies

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
in a second but like rawr single rubies

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.270 
in a second but like rawr single rubies
they<00:01:32.340> could<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.579> rubies<00:01:32.970> weapons<00:01:33.840> Ruby<00:01:34.799> armor

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
they could do rubies weapons Ruby armor

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.270 
they could do rubies weapons Ruby armor
they<00:01:35.909> could<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.210> similar<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> diamonds<00:01:37.409> but

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
they could be similar to diamonds but

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.039 
they could be similar to diamonds but
maybe<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.090> worse<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.659> they

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
maybe like a little bit worse but they

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
maybe like a little bit worse but they
just<00:01:40.229> add<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.740> whole<00:01:41.040> new<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.850> maybe<00:01:42.090> maybe

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
just add in a whole new like maybe maybe

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.679 
just add in a whole new like maybe maybe
they're<00:01:43.409> armors<00:01:43.829> worse<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.299> mined

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
they're armors worse but like they mined

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.389 
they're armors worse but like they mined
faster<00:01:46.380> than<00:01:46.530> diamonds<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.040> something<00:01:47.310> i'm

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
faster than diamonds or something i'm

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.740 
faster than diamonds or something i'm
not<00:01:47.549> sure<00:01:47.759> exactly<00:01:47.939> how<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.420> could<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
not sure exactly how they could do it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
not sure exactly how they could do it
but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.380> it'd<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.619> cool<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.670> brought

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
but I think it'd be cool if they brought

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.359 
but I think it'd be cool if they brought
in<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.210> rubies<00:01:51.689> maybe<00:01:51.869> oh<00:01:52.079> maybe<00:01:52.409> rubies<00:01:53.159> have

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
in a rubies maybe oh maybe rubies have

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.760 
in a rubies maybe oh maybe rubies have
like<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.689> like<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.869> soon<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.259> crap<00:01:55.560> them

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
like a like as soon as you crap them

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.560 
like a like as soon as you crap them
they<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.070> random<00:01:56.670> enchantment<00:01:57.479> or

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
they get a random enchantment or

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.209 
they get a random enchantment or
something<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.020> would<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.170> cool<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.799> these

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
something that would be cool like these

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.410 
something that would be cool like these
kind<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.490> things<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.759> think<00:01:59.790> would<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.119> like

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
kind of things I think would be like

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
kind of things I think would be like
would<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.930> spice<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> game<00:02:01.710> bring<00:02:02.009> in

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
would really spice up the game bring in

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.399 
would really spice up the game bring in
so<00:02:02.340> much<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.240> variety<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> game

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so much you know variety to the game

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.679 
so much you know variety to the game
another<00:02:05.189> thing<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.610> thinking<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.060> so

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
another thing I was thinking is that so

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.389 
another thing I was thinking is that so
we<00:02:06.840> already<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.110> emeralds<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:07.799> what<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
we already have emeralds but what and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.130 
we already have emeralds but what and
everybody's<00:02:08.849> been<00:02:08.970> speculating<00:02:09.599> forever<00:02:09.959> in

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
everybody's been speculating forever in

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
everybody's been speculating forever in
a<00:02:10.200> day<00:02:10.229> pretty<00:02:10.619> much<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.160> we're<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a day pretty much that we're going to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.350 
a day pretty much that we're going to
get<00:02:11.819> emerald

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
get emerald

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.440 
get emerald
armor<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.050> emerald<00:02:13.680> tools<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.300> be

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
armor and emerald tools that would be

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.660 
armor and emerald tools that would be
amazing<00:02:15.630> also<00:02:16.230> i<00:02:16.260> mean<00:02:16.530> who<00:02:17.010> wouldn't<00:02:17.370> who

emeralds and rubies like rubies maybe

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.930 
emeralds and rubies like rubies maybe
they'd<00:02:24.180> become<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.980> know<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.670> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
they'd become you know like like a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.730 
they'd become you know like like a
trading<00:02:27.420> system<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.840> villagers<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.410> and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
trading system of the villagers to and

all is where I'm getting all this like
speculation<00:02:32.550> from<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.000> picture<00:02:33.240> right

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
speculation from is this picture right

here so in this picture you can see
right<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.880> down<00:02:36.660> I'll<00:02:36.930> awful<00:02:37.290> circle<00:02:37.650> it

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
right here a down I'll awful circle it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.690 
right here a down I'll awful circle it
is<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.150> red<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:40.140> weird<00:02:41.100> shaped

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
is that it's a red like weird shaped

thing<00:02:42.090> right<00:02:42.570> above<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.020> Emerald<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.650> this

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
thing right above the Emerald and this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.640 
thing right above the Emerald and this
picture<00:02:44.370> was<00:02:45.060> actually<00:02:45.450> found<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:46.140> while<00:02:46.620> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
picture was actually found a while a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.370 
picture was actually found a while a
while<00:02:47.190> back<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.600> code<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
while back like in the code of the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.890 
while back like in the code of the
console<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.430> there<00:02:50.700> like<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.360> don't<00:02:51.810> know

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
console like in there like I don't know

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
console like in there like I don't know
like<00:02:51.989> if<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.260> downloaded<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.950> program<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
like if you downloaded the program and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.150 
like if you downloaded the program and
went<00:02:54.390> through<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.750> files<00:02:55.050> like<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.070> know

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
went through all the files like you know

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.010 
went through all the files like you know
like<00:02:56.190> these<00:02:56.459> are<00:02:56.610> these<00:02:57.060> are<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
like these are these are like the the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.090 
like these are these are like the the
images<00:02:58.530> they<00:02:58.709> put<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.640> game<00:02:59.850> like<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.100> so

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
images they put in the game like so so

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.310 
images they put in the game like so so
why<00:03:02.310> would<00:03:02.489> they<00:03:02.520> have<00:03:02.790> rubies<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.480> there<00:03:03.690> or

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
why would they have rubies in there or

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.800 
why would they have rubies in there or
like<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> red<00:03:04.860> thing<00:03:05.250> if<00:03:05.610> they<00:03:06.600> weren't

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
like a red thing if they weren't

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.000 
like a red thing if they weren't
planning<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.170> doing<00:03:07.410> something<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.739> was<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
planning on doing something that was the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.620 
planning on doing something that was the
theory<00:03:08.220> back<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.730> day<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.510> we

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
theory back in the day and then we

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.790 
theory back in the day and then we
thought<00:03:09.810> they<00:03:09.989> were<00:03:10.050> gonna<00:03:10.170> bring<00:03:10.410> him<00:03:10.530> you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
thought they were gonna bring him you

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.550 
thought they were gonna bring him you
know<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> long<00:03:11.130> time<00:03:11.280> ago<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.480> still<00:03:13.320> think

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
know a long time ago but I still think

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.050 
know a long time ago but I still think
that<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.739> get<00:03:13.890> there<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.190> game<00:03:14.370> then

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
that I get there in the game then

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.190 
that I get there in the game then
there's<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.330> chance<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.750> could<00:03:15.959> bring<00:03:16.080> him

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
there's a chance that could bring him

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.020 
there's a chance that could bring him
forward<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.530> mean<00:03:16.650> they<00:03:16.709> have<00:03:16.860> said<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.850> they

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
forward I mean they have said that they

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.090 
forward I mean they have said that they
wanted<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.450> bring<00:03:18.630> exclusive<00:03:19.350> things<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.920> the

wanted to bring exclusive things to the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.890 
wanted to bring exclusive things to the
consoles<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.390> think<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.660> would<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.810> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
consoles so I think this would be a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.229 
consoles so I think this would be a
perfect<00:03:22.260> thing<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.680> bring<00:03:22.860> forward<00:03:23.130> tell<00:03:24.120> me
