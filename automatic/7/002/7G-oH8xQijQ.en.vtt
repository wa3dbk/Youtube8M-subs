 I show 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220

 and others not if they ask you to log in 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.670
 or create an account do not is very 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.429
 simple 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.289
 Once you have created your account, 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.210
 you do not even have to wait for 20 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.210
 seconds and then later 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.820
 and it's automatically going to start 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.070
 to download 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.490
 they will come out of their booklets which is the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.430
 winrar program will give you to extract here 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.500
 and automatically they will extract what 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.630
 they need forcefully because I will follow 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.950
 asking in the other episodes 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 look it up in google to download it 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.580
 after extracting it will not come out 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.550
 this disk and they will double click on it and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.860
 the game will automatically come out 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.680
 programs that are needed only 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.830
 erwin weird the booklets are for 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.140
 extracting it need it to 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.540
 Although in episode 2 they are not 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.290
 ask do not ask is the program in 3 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.200
 4 or 5 I will ask 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.450
 and also for episode 3 and in 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.270
 ahead they will need the credential 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.890
 but they will not be able to enter the institute itself 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.470
 what they need is only the number 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200
 of registration that small number and the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.630
 winrar program with that they can continue 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.660
 playing if they still have difficulties 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.540
 when downloading the game tell me and I will see 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.489
 another page where you can summarize them 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.530
 and the winrar can be found in google or 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.560
 buy it I could not tell you exactly 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.500
 but it 's easy and one tip is that what 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.170
 they need because it's not just for this 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.970
 if it does not serve you for many things even 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.540
 of computers and have no 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.060
 I understand why some do not 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.069
 institutes I thought they had been left 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.300
 Of course I explained them several times but 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.660
 good 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.170
 If you are a girl, you like him nowadays 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.470
 like to see handsome guys and all that 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.910
 go to these institutes in the other two 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.150
 you will not find any of that 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.890
 if you are a boy you like yuri te 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.980
 like the hentai the lecce 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.480
 go to these institutes because we 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.629
 two you will not find any of that 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.650
 understood and if I do not explain it to you from another 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:26.500
 way the game is unisex like they want 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.920
 to identify if you are male or female 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.510
 that's why the institutes are if you're 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.310
 girl you can not get into 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.610
 institutes of men because you do not 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.950
 will like your content 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.230
 If you are a boy, you can not get in 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.140
 the institutes of the girls because no 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.510
 you're going to like your content you're not going to 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.750
 find yaoi in the institute of 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.610
 guys because they do not like that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.500
 say institute of boys or girls not 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.560
 means that there are only men or 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.880
 women or so in all the colleges there are 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.380
 men and women simply to say 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.010
 option for boys and option for girls 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.260
 it's a way of identifying which person 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.470
 is playing and what content I have 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.770
 what to show so you like the game 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.040
 I wish it was already clear and following 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.549
 with the little institutes learn to 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.370
 read and listen without offending a rule 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.669
 was that they did not get into more than one 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.250
 institute and I've seen people who already 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.240
 they put two to three and they got into 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.820
 the 4 that offends me and makes me angry and if I continue 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.210
 watching this kind of people I'm going to 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.479
 despair and I can abandon the project 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.550
 I ask you respect in my work I'm not 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.100
 winning nothing and what I ask is 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.699
 single just choose an institute 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.349
 because two simple reasons are going to 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.009
 ruin surprises that I have for 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.410
 you and the second because they believe that 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.479
 I did four institutes if I had known 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.310
 they were going to get all of them then 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.289
 so that I strive to do so much 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.210
 I would have simply done one and I 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.970
 I save so much work 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.330
 I just got tired of one and now if 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.800
 they want to do funk fix of an art of the 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.340
 game does not bother me to the contrary 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.260
 thank you very much also thanks for 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.330
 all the publicity that they have done to me in 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.460
 serious means so much that more than a thousand 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.610
 people have played the first chapter 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.610
 and ask me for the second and third 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.760
 etcetera etcetera I do it with love in 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.850
 serious and also every time the 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.430
 chapters I really do not know right now 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.270
 I have many problems and if almost not 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.790
 I have time 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.530
 then hold on tanti all if 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.560
 have questions or questions leave it at 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.420
 comments if I read them all as per 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.340
 example here the animal answers all 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.520
 the doubts that had hello at least 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.830
 Most of you already know that my only payment is 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.540
 the ay that they seriously share many 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.120
 thank you for everything you have done 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.889
 I thought this game was so successful 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.409
 to be honest 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.110
 I leave my personal facebook and the one of the 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:12.030
 page and well thank you very much I hope that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.070

 great that you will love the chapter 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.770
 3 and it's going to be worth waiting for 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.750
 sorry if the 12 is short but as they 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.260
 I repeat now I do not have absolutely 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.330
 nothing time if I did it was because I saw 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.150
 that many people asked me and started 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.820
 have a pretty big success was 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.440
 thanks to people who shared it and then 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.420
 that motivated me to do faster 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.390
 of those then already saw that those 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.730
 shared and that they comment the game me 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.860
 A lot of help and post makes it faster 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.480
