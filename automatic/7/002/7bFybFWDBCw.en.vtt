original look quite cool but the biggest
problem<00:01:16.340> area<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.450> club<00:01:17.750> door<00:01:18.049> but<00:01:18.649> many

problem area is this club door but many

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.020 
problem area is this club door but many

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
people before me would have told you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.370 
people before me would have told you
that<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.240> actually<00:01:20.360> on<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.720> wrong<00:01:20.929> side<00:01:21.200> for

that it's actually on the wrong side for

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.169 
that it's actually on the wrong side for
the<00:01:21.470> UK<00:01:21.770> but<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:22.369> basically<00:01:22.580> just<00:01:22.670> an<00:01:22.909> extra

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
the UK but it's basically just an extra

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.510 
the UK but it's basically just an extra
slab<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.600> door<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.350> opens<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.950> lets<00:01:25.369> the

rear passengers get in and out of a lot
easier<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:27.619> don't<00:01:27.920> really<00:01:28.220> know<00:01:28.369> what<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
easier I don't really know what the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.800 
easier I don't really know what the
problem<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:29.000> because<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:29.330> not<00:01:29.450> as<00:01:29.539> if<00:01:29.659> the

problem is because it's not as if the

problem is because it's not as if the
other<00:01:29.960> side<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:30.289> impossible<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.830> get<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:30.979> load
