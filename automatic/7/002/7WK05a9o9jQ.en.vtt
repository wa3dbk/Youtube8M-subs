00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
be mine yeah it was the apparently

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
be mine yeah it was the apparently
they're<00:01:08.759> saying<00:01:09.000> processor<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
they're saying processor and that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
they're saying processor and that
computers<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.770> good<00:01:11.009> enough<00:01:11.039> to<00:01:11.340> do<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> at

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
computers is not good enough to do it at

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.420 
computers is not good enough to do it at
that<00:01:11.820> resolution<00:01:12.149> how<00:01:12.930> big<00:01:13.110> them<00:01:13.289> I<00:01:13.560> mean<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that resolution how big them I mean it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.980 
that resolution how big them I mean it
was<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> better<00:01:14.880> processor<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.750> could<00:01:15.869> probably

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
was a better processor we could probably

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
was a better processor we could probably
do<00:01:16.789> their<00:01:17.789> resolution<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.450> yeah<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:20.130> goes

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
do their resolution but yeah just goes

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.260 
do their resolution but yeah just goes
that<00:01:20.490> computer<00:01:20.869> cool<00:01:22.610> funny<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.819> don't<00:01:24.060> need<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that computer cool funny I don't need a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.490 
that computer cool funny I don't need a
good<00:01:24.420> resolution<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.140> do

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.040
