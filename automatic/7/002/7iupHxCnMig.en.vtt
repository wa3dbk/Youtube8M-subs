00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
a basically just like a 90 90 degree

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
a basically just like a 90 90 degree
angle<00:00:32.610> from<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:37.100> like<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> 90<00:00:38.399> degree<00:00:38.520> l<00:00:39.079> from

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
more probably a little more accurate in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.499 
more probably a little more accurate in
just<00:01:59.630> single<00:02:00.170> target<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:01.039> know<00:02:01.189> one<00:02:02.030> work<00:02:02.240> at

a time but when you have a good amount
coming<00:02:05.420> through<00:02:05.719> it's<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:06.020> lot<00:02:06.259> easier<00:02:06.289> just

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
coming through it's a lot easier just

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.400

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
hit that many just doing single shots

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.800 
hit that many just doing single shots
aiming<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:27.550> yeah<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.240> are<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.690> have

well the way I do it I'm going to have

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.590 
well the way I do it I'm going to have
to<00:02:36.350> go<00:02:36.620> ahead<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.010> get<00:02:37.220> some<00:02:37.459> but<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.030> have<00:02:38.480> to

spring traps imani use them eventually

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.630 
spring traps imani use them eventually
to<00:02:41.600> help<00:02:41.780> mitigate<00:02:42.200> any<00:02:42.650> overs<00:02:43.160> from<00:02:43.489> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
to help mitigate any overs from the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.030

you dude some if you do your buildable
different<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.690> probably<00:03:45.410> could<00:03:45.560> already

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
different you probably could already

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.350 
different you probably could already
have<00:03:45.920> fire<00:03:46.370> are<00:03:46.550> encouraged<00:03:46.790> by<00:03:46.850> this<00:03:47.000> round

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
have fire are encouraged by this round

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.720 
have fire are encouraged by this round
but<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:49.000> decided<00:03:50.000> not<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.210> do<00:03:50.300> that<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:51.020> I<00:03:51.730> love

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
but I decided not to do that so I love

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.290 
but I decided not to do that so I love
this

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.640 

so

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.770 

just<00:04:00.069> kind<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.280> letting<00:04:00.459> lend<00:04:01.209> things<00:04:01.420> happen

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
just kind of letting lend things happen

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:11.490 
just kind of letting lend things happen
get<00:04:01.930> my<00:04:02.079> defense<00:04:02.500> ready<00:04:02.709> for<00:04:02.980> some<00:04:03.129> ogres

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.550 

yeah<00:04:11.800> so

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.810 

that's<00:04:15.560> be<00:04:15.709> my<00:04:15.830> last<00:04:16.040> spring<00:04:16.340> trap

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.230 

and<00:04:19.060> we're<00:04:19.210> just<00:04:19.360> gonna<00:04:19.710> give<00:04:20.710> up<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.520> don't

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
and we're just gonna give up I I don't

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.790 
and we're just gonna give up I I don't
think<00:04:22.420> i<00:04:22.510> have<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.720> physics<00:04:23.170> yet<00:04:23.290> okay<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:23.740> do

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
think i have the physics yet okay I do

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.090 
think i have the physics yet okay I do
other<00:04:25.170> girls<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.350> push<00:04:26.590> trap<00:04:26.830> would<00:04:26.980> not

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
other girls that push trap would not

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.510 
other girls that push trap would not
push<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.730> odor

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
push the odor

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.850 
push the odor
and<00:04:30.000> now<00:04:30.150> just<00:04:30.539> looking<00:04:31.050> at<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:31.199> I<00:04:31.530> remember

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
and now just looking at that I remember

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.260 
and now just looking at that I remember
right<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.190> don't<00:04:32.340> think<00:04:32.610> these<00:04:32.699> spring<00:04:33.030> traps

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
right I don't think these spring traps

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.300 
right I don't think these spring traps
get<00:04:33.479> used<00:04:33.780> so<00:04:34.229> they<00:04:35.190> may<00:04:35.400> be<00:04:36.229> somewhat

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
get used so they may be somewhat

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.379 
get used so they may be somewhat
overkill<00:04:38.310> on<00:04:38.610> this<00:04:39.060> build<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:41.180> we'll<00:04:42.180> see<00:04:42.360> how

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
overkill on this build so we'll see how

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.820 
overkill on this build so we'll see how
the<00:04:42.479> rest<00:04:42.539> of<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.810> video<00:04:43.050> unfolds

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
the rest of the video unfolds

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.760 
the rest of the video unfolds
if<00:04:45.340> these<00:04:46.090> spring<00:04:46.750> traps<00:04:46.990> do<00:04:47.170> not<00:04:47.350> get<00:04:47.530> used

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
if these spring traps do not get used

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.400 
if these spring traps do not get used
then<00:04:48.600> then<00:04:49.600> yeah<00:04:49.780> we'll<00:04:49.930> probably<00:04:50.080> have<00:04:50.380> to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
then then yeah we'll probably have to

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.700 
then then yeah we'll probably have to
think<00:04:51.280> when<00:04:51.640> we<00:04:51.730> play<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.030> again<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.540> and

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
think when we play this again and and

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.370 
think when we play this again and and
change<00:04:53.710> up<00:04:53.920> our<00:04:54.070> strategy<00:04:55.140> how<00:04:56.140> you<00:04:56.200> could

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
change up our strategy how you could

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.630 
change up our strategy how you could
probably<00:04:56.560> go<00:04:56.740> for<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:56.980> archers<00:04:57.280> right<00:04:57.430> away

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
probably go for the archers right away

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.460 
probably go for the archers right away
if<00:04:58.510> we're<00:04:58.630> not<00:04:58.720> going<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.960> need<00:04:59.050> these<00:04:59.200> spring

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
if we're not going to need these spring

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.090 
if we're not going to need these spring
traps<00:04:59.880> because<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.000> mean<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.960> mises<00:05:02.620> they

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
traps because I mean that the mises they

of damage from the mace that way

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.500 
of damage from the mace that way
but<00:05:25.440> we're<00:05:25.590> on<00:05:25.680> our<00:05:25.710> last<00:05:25.950> round<00:05:26.250> f1<00:05:27.030> Archer<00:05:27.330> up

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
but we're on our last round f1 Archer up

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.190 
but we're on our last round f1 Archer up
I<00:05:28.490> never<00:05:29.490> got<00:05:29.700> I<00:05:30.030> don't<00:05:30.300> think<00:05:30.330> advocating<00:05:30.960> for

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
I never got I don't think advocating for

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.190 
I never got I don't think advocating for
squirters<00:05:31.680> up<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:32.570> think<00:05:33.570> that<00:05:33.750> might<00:05:33.960> be<00:05:34.020> a

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
squirters up so I think that might be a

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.470 
squirters up so I think that might be a
glaring<00:05:34.590> mistake<00:05:34.950> is<00:05:36.170> having<00:05:37.170> the<00:05:38.480> spring

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
glaring mistake is having the spring

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.390 
glaring mistake is having the spring
trap<00:05:40.190> and<00:05:41.190> going<00:05:41.550> for<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:42.950> not<00:05:43.950> going<00:05:44.220> for

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
trap and going for the not going for

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.170 
trap and going for the not going for
archers<00:05:44.730> first<00:05:44.970> like<00:05:46.400> I'm<00:05:47.400> wondering<00:05:47.940> if<00:05:48.030> I

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
archers first like I'm wondering if I

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.850 
archers first like I'm wondering if I
even<00:05:48.420> needed

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
even needed

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.399 
even needed
the

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.570 

maybe<00:05:53.009> I<00:05:53.099> should<00:05:53.159> have<00:05:53.339> had

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.499 

some<00:05:56.210> wall<00:05:56.509> axes<00:05:57.639> over<00:05:58.639> over<00:05:59.030> there<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.479> the

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
some wall axes over over there to the

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.879 
some wall axes over over there to the
push<00:05:59.810> traps<00:06:01.509> but<00:06:02.509> this<00:06:03.409> is<00:06:03.530> kind<00:06:03.710> of<00:06:03.740> why<00:06:03.860> I

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
push traps but this is kind of why I

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.339 
push traps but this is kind of why I
like<00:06:03.979> like<00:06:04.819> I<00:06:05.090> make<00:06:05.599> these<00:06:05.719> videos<00:06:05.840> and<00:06:06.319> I

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
like like I make these videos and I

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.929 
like like I make these videos and I
maybe<00:06:06.800> just<00:06:07.069> kind<00:06:07.280> of<00:06:09.580> scrub<00:06:10.580> through<00:06:10.759> and

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
maybe just kind of scrub through and

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.459 
maybe just kind of scrub through and
real<00:06:11.060> quick<00:06:11.270> just<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.509> make<00:06:11.689> sure<00:06:11.719> all<00:06:12.259> the
