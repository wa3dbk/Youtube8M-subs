Yoma<00:00:13.190> brother<00:00:13.429> Noah<00:00:13.669> what's<00:00:14.059> up<00:00:14.179> dog<00:00:16.180> yo<00:00:17.180> make

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
Yoma brother Noah what's up dog yo make

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.130 
Yoma brother Noah what's up dog yo make
the<00:00:17.900> great

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.420 

how<00:00:24.320> much<00:00:24.560> is<00:00:24.710> thinking<00:00:24.949> about<00:00:25.009> transcription

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
how much is thinking about transcription

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.380 
how much is thinking about transcription
brother<00:00:26.949> hey<00:00:27.949> what<00:00:28.279> what's<00:00:28.670> transcription

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
brother hey what what's transcription

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.979 
brother hey what what's transcription
you<00:00:29.779> know<00:00:29.929> about<00:00:30.050> transcription<00:00:37.629> let<00:00:38.629> me<00:00:38.750> give

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
you know about transcription let me give

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.069 
you know about transcription let me give
you<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.290> little<00:00:39.620> lesson<00:00:40.280> in<00:00:40.610> biology<00:00:40.930> we<00:00:41.930> can

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
you a little lesson in biology we can

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.049 
you a little lesson in biology we can
start<00:00:42.350> with<00:00:42.500> something<00:00:42.800> small<00:00:43.250> like<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.579> little

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
start with something small like a little

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.869 
start with something small like a little
terminology<00:00:44.809> transcription<00:00:45.739> it<00:00:46.010> starts<00:00:46.399> with

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
terminology transcription it starts with

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.680 
terminology transcription it starts with
RNA<00:00:47.510> polymerase<00:00:48.350> open<00:00:49.010> up<00:00:49.250> DNA<00:00:50.059> just<00:00:50.270> like<00:00:50.510> my

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
RNA polymerase open up DNA just like my

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.319 
RNA polymerase open up DNA just like my
good<00:00:50.930> friend<00:00:50.960> has<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.410> case<00:00:51.800> promoter<00:00:52.340> where<00:00:53.149> it

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
good friend has a case promoter where it

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.900 
good friend has a case promoter where it
all<00:00:53.510> begins<00:00:53.960> for<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.559> enzymes<00:00:55.280> are<00:00:55.460> reaching

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
all begins for the enzymes are reaching

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.560 
all begins for the enzymes are reaching
on<00:00:56.149> DNA<00:00:56.989> like<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.230> runway<00:00:57.469> I'm<00:00:58.329> telling<00:00:59.329> you

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
on DNA like a runway I'm telling you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.709 
on DNA like a runway I'm telling you
buddy<00:01:00.019> I<00:01:00.350> think<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:01.039> hard<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.430> get<00:01:01.699> when<00:01:02.570> I'm

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
buddy I think that hard to get when I'm

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.950 
buddy I think that hard to get when I'm
all<00:01:02.960> done<00:01:02.989> you<00:01:03.739> can<00:01:04.009> use<00:01:04.280> us<00:01:04.429> as<00:01:04.580> an<00:01:04.879> asset<00:01:05.600> now

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
all done you can use us as an asset now

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.919 
all done you can use us as an asset now
that<00:01:06.200> we've<00:01:06.380> connected<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:07.250> open<00:01:07.940> up<00:01:08.090> our<00:01:08.300> DNA

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
that we've connected and open up our DNA

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:12.400 
that we've connected and open up our DNA
it's<00:01:09.140> time<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:10.009> synthesize<00:01:10.670> some<00:01:10.910> M<00:01:11.149> our<00:01:11.869> name

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
it's time to synthesize some M our name

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.219 
it's time to synthesize some M our name
5<00:01:12.830> prime<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.340> 3<00:01:13.490> prime<00:01:13.940> that's<00:01:14.479> how<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.960> works

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
5 prime to 3 prime that's how it works

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.339 
5 prime to 3 prime that's how it works
always<00:01:16.190> same<00:01:16.670> direction<00:01:17.030> no<00:01:17.660> matter<00:01:17.959> what

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:18.349 
always same direction no matter what

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.559 
always same direction no matter what
works<00:01:19.959> the<00:01:20.959> two<00:01:21.319> strands<00:01:21.619> of<00:01:21.709> DNA<00:01:21.770> oh<00:01:22.539> well<00:01:23.539> uh

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
works the two strands of DNA oh well uh

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.900 
works the two strands of DNA oh well uh
the<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:25.810> little<00:01:26.810> less<00:01:27.020> forwards<00:01:27.470> that's<00:01:28.280> ok

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
the a little less forwards that's ok

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.050 
the a little less forwards that's ok
I'll<00:01:29.599> help<00:01:29.989> you<00:01:30.349> out<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.950> now<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.280> know<00:01:31.700> what
