00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
because teesri loses his attack and he

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.050

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
gets a boost an attack and spark um I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.650 
gets a boost an attack and spark um I
think<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:31.340> girl<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.730> gets<00:02:32.910> double<00:02:33.360> boozing
