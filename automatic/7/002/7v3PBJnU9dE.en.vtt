and we I was pretty sure that the yard
had<00:00:26.070> been<00:00:26.220> filled<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:26.910> at<00:00:27.029> least<00:00:27.180> something

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
had been done to it because we were only

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.919 
had been done to it because we were only
finding<00:00:29.519> some<00:00:29.760> modern<00:00:30.060> trash<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> couple

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
finding some modern trash a couple

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.440 
finding some modern trash a couple
modern<00:00:31.230> coins<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.949> range<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.210> had<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
modern coins in that range so I had a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.280 
modern coins in that range so I had a
gut<00:00:33.809> feeling<00:00:34.520> that<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.760> owner<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> ring

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
gut feeling that the owner of that ring

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170 
gut feeling that the owner of that ring
still<00:00:37.770> lived<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.280> house<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> went

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
still lived in that house so I went

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
still lived in that house so I went
ahead<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.480> presented<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:40.950> they

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
ahead and presented it to see if they

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
ahead and presented it to see if they
had<00:00:41.250> dropped<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.570> specific<00:00:43.020> homeowner

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
had dropped it this specific homeowner

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.619 
had dropped it this specific homeowner
also<00:00:44.010> had<00:00:44.250> requested<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.120> anything<00:00:45.420> cool

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
also had requested to see anything cool

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
also had requested to see anything cool
that<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.899> found<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.739> felt<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> was

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that we found so I felt that it was

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.110 
that we found so I felt that it was
definitely<00:00:48.180> appropriate<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.730> give<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.910> one

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
definitely appropriate to give this one

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.680 
definitely appropriate to give this one
back<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.780> sure<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:54.149> than<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.510> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
back for sure and but other than that we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
back for sure and but other than that we
didn't<00:00:54.870> find<00:00:55.079> much<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:56.219> were<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.399> hunting<00:00:56.579> for

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
didn't find much we were out hunting for

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
didn't find much we were out hunting for
like<00:00:56.940> two<00:00:57.180> hours<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.140> found<00:00:58.350> three

like two hours I you know I found three

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.580 
like two hours I you know I found three
quarters<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> penny<00:00:59.399> you<00:01:00.239> know<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:01.170> we

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
quarters in the penny you know but we

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
quarters in the penny you know but we
got<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> ring<00:01:02.550> return<00:01:02.910> today<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.480> was

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
yard we weren't finding too much in the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.920 
yard we weren't finding too much in the
yard<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:35.910> weren't<00:03:36.120> sure<00:03:36.239> if<00:03:36.329> there<00:03:36.480> was<00:03:36.600> fill

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
yard we weren't sure if there was fill

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.210 
yard we weren't sure if there was fill
dirt<00:03:37.110> here<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.350> one<00:03:37.470> time<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.680> something<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.160> we

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
dirt here at one time or something so we

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.860 
dirt here at one time or something so we
figured<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.610> wasn't<00:03:38.970> dropped<00:03:39.180> too<00:03:39.360> long<00:03:39.570> ago

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
figured this wasn't dropped too long ago

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.410 
figured this wasn't dropped too long ago
