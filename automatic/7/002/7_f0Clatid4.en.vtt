00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:25.050
 reinforcement at 5 o'clock in the morning and 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.700
 It supported the flavors of the day 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.240
 I was not coming here 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.690

 The damage we showed here 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.130
 our only difficulty here all 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.260
 respect the water because in winter it has 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.350
 to spare in the summer we have neither the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.980
 survival to us here 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.320

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.800

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 More than two hours 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.240
 all in all before and have to catch the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.770
 pavÃª was only for the day because each 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.610
 family is entitled to take that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.620
 clean 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.210
 there also the gift of the land thought 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.610
 much will be said if many without 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.810
 word clothes and other things there already 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.810
 I knew I had taken 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.500
 We keep water in the normal bottles. 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.590
 accumulated to save the mountain with bobo 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.829
 was addressed is the border the sensation of 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.509
 People are like this, they are no longer living my life. 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.600
 father cry because a car came kite 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.909
 I got here I took it from calling my 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.979
 design need the bird and will come back with 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:07.429
 attitude and in pim that put and the life 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.890
 whole is already now with slabs 40 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.799
 people have the quality and 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.799
 quality for every spindle and the sixth 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.810
 Much is said about the seminary, it has no soul. 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.430
 first we need to see that the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.170
 semi-arid region is one of the most 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.170
 rainy or more than robot 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.470
 now this water is not properly 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.380
 warehouse note 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.170
 and it is in this context that the wing created the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.980
 program a million cisterns and they 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.070
 are an instrument for the people of the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.520
 seminar I have and enter this project gives 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.670
 some 1,100 of Brazil Foundation is a 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.060
 be democratic is not 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.040
 concentrated thousands of liters 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.310
 water for one person to a group 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.310
 privileged is each family with 16 000 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.890
 the foundation opened a public notice of 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 convening organizations and wished to 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.530
 external project in this project in the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.200
 municipalities determined the foundation 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.680
 At the same time he made a covenant with 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.350
 so that the wing is to accompany if these 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.650
 organizations to form organizations 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.490
 from the managerial point of view this was the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.490
 wing action 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.799
 the water for all program he has 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.170
 change the face of the 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.200
 sown is not in all states 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.900
 make up the region and within this project 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.480
 is our role is to enable the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.720
 building the external because it is a 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.269
 mobilization and training work 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.060
 social interaction with the 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.070
 semi-arid when you arrive for only you 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.880
 was selected you will win a 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.560
 cistern 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.110
 if you saw happiness in the face 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.599
 them at the beginning when we spoke 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.090
 that even I did not attend the meeting 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:31.400
 in the community at the meeting and I 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.530
 spoke thus to be that this is not the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.020
 history gives if we already come sheep 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.080
 very Fipe the difficulty here right 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.599
 never see anything thinking that no more 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.190
 now that you want to make sure that 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.190
 comes and still guaranteed 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:55.039
 well this is the live and the mobilizer goes 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.840
 house to house there already doing register 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:01.610
 goiano if the family does not have water 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:09.110
 plumbing for babies removed from a cap 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:12.110
 and ready to cook from the local landmark 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.139
 GPS is the place to dig the 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.500
 hole where he builds the cistern 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.900
 there we have is the meeting and 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.750
 training how to use water 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.970
 the uptake was very important 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.169
 important because we did not know 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.110
 dealing with water is also did not know too 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.030
 so in a way to store for what 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.810
 she serves more than she is to drink and 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.810
 to cook right 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.930
 arrives on board October 9 economy 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.540
 local the bulk material is all of the region 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.700
 the labor force harnessed from the region 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.660
 often people are not pedro 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.460
 but do the course does this training 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.580
 new tour but when I got out of bed 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.830
 besides generating a lot of income is still a 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.870
 service that is difficult for anyone who is not in 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.580
 direct order you think that much 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.430
 satisfaction of the people, right? 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.820
 after service completion and this 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.500
 satisfaction it also generates the 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.440
 permanence of people in the city 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.560
 the generation of business in the city in a country 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.670
 where there is no wealth is centralized in 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.850
 Big centers 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.680
 this program goes against this 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.320
 to decentralize income generation and 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.070
 to merge the public resource of a 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.600
 more egalitarian form within the region 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.810
 sown and specifically but throughout the 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.810
 parents 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.870
 we are not just builders 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.970
 We are 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.420
 citizenship to increase in the 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:58.540
 program us and behind people always 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.130
 will explain to me and to the day is it today 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.220
 It's your philosophy of door people. 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.650
 next question is more external and how 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.590
 is that program is right up to 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.680
 to believe because coming from a 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.390
 serious program a partnership managed 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.850
 reach a much higher number of 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.920
 families in a short period of time and 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.140
 coming to universalize some 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.370
 thanks to the partnership with the 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.950
 natural foundation 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.350
 today it has inhabited no longer waste time 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.360
 many will produce more and more 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.750
 their quality of life because 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.700
 more food production than easy on 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.310
 china with let it play very well for 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.650
 please stand and plant lecturer with 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.930
 he to my son, talk to the beans, huh? 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.580
 and we see the quality of you saves 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.190
 because we do not even want to invest in 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.890
 new rains quick and we managed to fill 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.450
 the cistern and water that the whole summer 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.400
 voted worried 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.200
 I think that from now on, I do not know 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.420
 keep going the way it is going to be everything 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.860
 has changed 

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.260
 everyone was very happy because he knows 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.970
 We're going to slow down a lot now. 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.970
 very much this problem
