00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.029
 noodles for carbonara and as always 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.550
 we will explain the step by step from 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.480

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.470
 Ines how they have been good mommy explains 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:22.460
 well let's see first I bought from 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:27.380
 I bought this the noodles that are 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.589
 egg fresh that are 250 grams and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.239
 it's thread after I've served it with 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.879
 here you have them served so that you do not 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.789
 it was that not boiled with a with 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:44.090
 water with a little salt and with a little 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:46.190
 oil salt oil and when they are 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.500
 boiling the water the shots I've 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.870
 had four minutes was not removed and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.199
 drained and then the steps by the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 water so that they do not stick to us and that's 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.739
 how pasta is made 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.739
 is well explained, you know the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 egg pasta noodles 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.720
 then you put water on it, you put oil on it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.970
 you put salt when it goes boiling water 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.039
 he throws the 34 minutes out of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.830
 Drain and pass with fresh water 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.740
 so you can see so they do not come together 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.080
 they all hang loose before now and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.490
 then I put a little pot of cream 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.190
 little pot of cream a little pot of cream sauce 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.149
 This is free but the same also 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.720
 serves for bacon noodles 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:47.960
 strips of bacon bandages a box and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.960
 then grated emmental cheese grated 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.010
 OK 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.400
 now I put in the pan I put 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.790
 a little oil and then as you will see 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.610
 I have put the strips of bacon step to 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.710
 fry when it is well fried as already 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.880
 you will see that they are well fried 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 I put the cream 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.799
 I put the tin can to catch it 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.109
 who heard about the quarry in front 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.200
 whole and the cream that is soft for 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:24.969
 remove and I do not know how many I do not know how much 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.170
 have here does not have the 200 thousand 200 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.170
 exact milliliters 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.860
 everything is fine now I move everything 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.450
 a new well moved 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.230
 even sometimes the whole can already costs 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.230
 I put a few species 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.200
 a few species and then I put the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.200
 grated cheese 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.450
 like a handful like that you do not see 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.799
 and now I'm moving everything right 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.799
 movidito 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.280
 I have already put bacon stand well 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:52.780
 I have put the cream I have put 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.380
 in the grated cheese and the place the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.880
 species and now I leave it a little bit like that 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.950
 about him and once he's already a little 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.770
 all taken then we can already 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.230
 spaghetti and until serving point 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.860
 burst the noodles 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.260
 can connect with those who had 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.269
 noodles at home and money explodes 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.389
 It can also be done with spaghetti or 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.730
 with whatever they want or with macaroni or 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.550
 with whatever they want or with these 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.890
 of colors with what you want but 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.870
 usually they are always spaghetti or 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.170
 noodles that put carbonara 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.170
 begins to lose now and retirement 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:45.159
 the spaghetti that I already told you as 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.499
 the serveis and how are Tunisia and 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:51.930
 now I'm mixing everything well me 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:51.930
 he said a little 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.250
 today I do not make them for two people today 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.680
 I make them for three because today comes my 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.360
 son to eat at home and then for three 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:12.160
 that normally 250 grams of the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.160
 package or end for three people 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.089
 as well as other days something less seems 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.689
 for me here then for other people 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.689
 today 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.440
 now let about 5 minutes for 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.370
 get everything together 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.370
 and it is already 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.480
 they are done now then if you want 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:14.440
 we put them in a little dish to see how 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.380
 all this is left because there is nothing more than 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.050
 they are really good they do not have any 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.689
 ingredient more or nothing simply already 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.669
 serve them warm and that's it 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:30.120
 this is the dish that I have made today for 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.820
 eat and nothing else 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.190
 there is 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.190
 and here we have the final result of the 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.650
 Carbonara noodles you can see that 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:43.100
 you see the pasta you see the pieces of 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.220
 bacon looks what cream is looks 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.900
 also the species because all that then 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.910
 We hope you liked the recipe 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.010
