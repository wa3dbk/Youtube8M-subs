00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.160
 when we open in a space 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.110
 architectural make a focus 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.820
 about the sensations we receive 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.890
 usually blindly well 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.050
 different if they give us the opportunity 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.239
 become feeling parts of 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.910
 our body which leads to a 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.030
 self- examination and support 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.190
 aware of what we are from 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.420
 more concrete way just normal we 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.160
 invite to be attentive to our 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.710
 kinesthetic perceptions and 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.780
 proprioceptive ie our 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.269
 internal muscular perception 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.710
 articular and more generally to 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.330
 the set of perceptions that we 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.220
 information on the position and 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.290
 movements of the different parts of the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.690
 body 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.850
 for example when we borrow a 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.220
 staircase to gross we experience a 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.900
 impression of breathlessness we feel 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.460
 the other we wait more or less smooth and 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.220
 has the hints of our feet are approach 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.510
 we adapt our pace 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.360
 impressions that let your zik from their 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.940
 movement as well as impressions 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.320
 proprioceptive equilibrium is changing 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.150
 let's not forget the impressions of 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 brightness and darkness that are 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.780
 felt by our dear ones 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.880
 temperature differences the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.850
 air movements all of this helps 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.160
 a style and an atmosphere to take 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.230
 awareness of this feeling is a step 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.890
 indispensable in the critical analysis of 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.410
 space so noticed that we have 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.380
 crushed by the massive nature of a 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.420
 statue as in the Lincoln Memorial at 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.010
 Washington 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.320
 it's a first step in making 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.490
 awareness of the authoritarian vocation and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.549
 magistrates 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.170
 of this architectural layout 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.540
 regain a keen awareness of our 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.460
 body when he discovers a space has become 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.780
 developed a critical perception of 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.130
 our body in dialogue with this space 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.270
 the pure cowardly expert is all of us 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.099
 more in the development of this 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.500
 critical attention that the architectured 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.880
 of a fully lived art that makes 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.880
 the object of a total immersion 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.620
 the Swiss architect peter zumthor is 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.010
 particularly attentive to this 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.959
 sensitive dimension of the architectured 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.540
 as explained in his text 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.049
 architecture the design of a building 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.519
 requires leaving impressions 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.380
 architectural ie 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.049
 body impressions that the architectured 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.700
 likely to produce 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.459
 to do this they admit they do not have 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.390
 that only one means drawn from his 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.489
 childhood memories 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.560
 deeply rooted in his body 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.890
 is brought back to the consciousness of 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.569
 sensations of mood images 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.819
 it's a real Proustian exercise 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.290
 who empty each project the 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.350
 leading to the search for 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.820
 achitecture lost both points on 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.410
 nine are delighted to see on the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.780
 photographs taken in the house of 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.690
 Peter Zumthor with Peter Zumthor 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.310
 installed at his office and both well 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.959
 live with two photographs that will follow 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.850
 are photographs of one of the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.700
 achievements of peter zumthor ya terme 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.900
 valls in switzerland then i quote peter 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.030
 zumthor pretty good when I think of the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.460
 architecture really pictures in me 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.250
 many of these images are related 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.380
 with my training and my work 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.910
 of architect it concerns knowledge about 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.310
 the structure that I was able to accumulate at 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.100
 other time course evoke my 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.570
 childhood I remember the time when I 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.810
 did the experiment of the structure 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.330
 without thinking I think I still feel 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.610
 in my hand a door handle a 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.650
 rounded metal piece like the back 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.790
 of a spoon 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.760
 it's the one that mom caught 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.750
 concentrated in the garden of expectations 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.400
 still today this lady handle 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.380
 appears as a special sign in 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.200
 the entrance of a sort in a world made 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.240
 of different atmosphere and smell 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.650
 I remember the gravel not submitting the 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.120
 doubs a slap of the syria shell in 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.170
 the stairs 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.760
 I still hear the boiling of the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.130
 lock or english look of doors 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.780
 would be closed behind me I would 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.740
 revise lengthen the dark power and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.320
 enter the kitchen 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.930
 the umih truly bright piece of 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.210
 the house this room was the only one 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.800
 in my memory at least whose 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.410
 ceiling to fade not in a 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.050
 half-day the little ones because he alone 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.140
 hexagon or french to people tight 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.630
 imposed is not a ruthless purity 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.380
 and closet emitted a smell 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.630
 particular of skillful painting when 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.740
 I'm working on a project I'm at 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.430
 again immersed in memories 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.930
 old and have forgotten and I wonder 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.660
 how does this architecture stand 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.000
 what does it mean to me then 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.689
 and what could help me 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.219
 bring back this atmosphere 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.649
 it seems that to reject the obvious 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:03.239
 presence of things or everything instead 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:05.029
 and strong enough that it is appropriate to deliver here 

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:07.559
 a beautiful lesson in phenomenology 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:10.349
 zumthor invites us to make our bodies 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.610
 living the indispensable prism a 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.679
 renewed apprehension of the 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.389
 architecture 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:17.249
 according to him there is quality 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.939
 architectural than through the atmosphere 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:23.009
 that create a building the atmosphere 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.579
 means a sensitive report to our 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.189
 environment 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:28.679
 an emotional relationship and not 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:31.169
 intellectual space as well as to 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:35.099
 matter to heat as to light 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.349
 sounds and smells a report that 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.719
 engages an entire 13 and puts in 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.119
 unison our inner state and what 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.319
 surrounds us 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.179
 the architectural atmosphere which puts 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.039
 in tune our body awareness 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:48.209
 our being in the world 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.649
 upon entering a building we 

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:51.719
 feel if the conditions are met 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:54.269
 perception the atmosphere and a 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.739
 incredible speed there is something in 

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:58.169
 we who will tell us spontaneously a lot 

00:05:55.739 --> 00:06:01.559
 of united things moss an immediate emotion 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.289
 for an immediate rejection seize atmosphere 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.479
 quality the lived experience of a man goes through 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.209
 an activist an activation of our 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.009
 body awareness is not about 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:13.289
 a strictly meditative activity 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.329
 but attention to multiples 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.729
 sensations that runs through and ali our 

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:19.919
 body like what this book the young 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.129
 woman in the table of Edward hopper a 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.269
 favorite painters two authors the 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.969
 architecture is not a leader at 

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:28.710
 contemplate from afar by a 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:31.020
 naked voice that resonates well 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.020
 the sensory association that welcomes 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.689
 and stimulates living bodies to 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.650
 seize every corner to unfold 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.340
 the slightest decline 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.110
 you have to go through the test of the body 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.939
 in other words, live architecture is 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.939
 the privileged opportunity an experience 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:52.069
 self trainer with experience 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.069
 architectural carving of oneself
