00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
of your belts now the reason why they

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.799 
of your belts now the reason why they
call<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.579> our<00:00:32.640> harmonic<00:00:33.090> balancer<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.600> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
call it our harmonic balancer is this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.110 
call it our harmonic balancer is this
rubber<00:00:34.110> inside<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.920> dedenne's<00:00:35.550> the

rubber inside here dedenne's the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.990 
rubber inside here dedenne's the
vibrations<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.079> crankshaft<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:38.640> makes<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
vibrations on your crankshaft it makes a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.119 
vibrations on your crankshaft it makes a
harmonic<00:00:39.570> vibration<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.260> when<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> engine

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
harmonic vibration just when the engine

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.610 
harmonic vibration just when the engine
runs<00:00:41.370> similar<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.450> rubbing<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.230> finger

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
runs similar to rubbing your finger

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
runs similar to rubbing your finger
along<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> edge<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> wineglass<00:00:45.059> now

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
along the edge of the wineglass now

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.420 
along the edge of the wineglass now
without<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.260> balance<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:46.980> there<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
without this balance are on there it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.680 
without this balance are on there it
will<00:00:47.579> eventually<00:00:47.820> shatter

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
will eventually shatter

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.260 
will eventually shatter
the<00:00:49.050> hardened<00:00:49.500> steel<00:00:49.770> crankshaft<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:51.120> like

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the hardened steel crankshaft just like

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.950 
the hardened steel crankshaft just like
breaking<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.690> wineglass<00:00:53.270> how<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> install<00:00:54.660> one

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
breaking a wineglass how you install one

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.200 
breaking a wineglass how you install one
of<00:00:54.989> these<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.440> gonna<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> take

be an index inside here and there will
be<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> corresponding<00:01:05.250> index<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
be a corresponding index on the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160 
be a corresponding index on the
crankshaft<00:01:07.650> itself<00:01:08.330> there<00:01:09.330> either<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.869> or

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
crankshaft itself there either is or

there<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> there's<00:01:11.460> no<00:01:11.700> half<00:01:11.880> way<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.630> one

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
there is it there's no half way this one

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
there is it there's no half way this one
doesn't<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.340> slips

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
doesn't have one so this one just slips

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.190 
doesn't have one so this one just slips
on<00:01:14.820> any<00:01:15.210> way<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.509> want<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.900> gonna<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.170> on

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
on any way you want it's gonna go on

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.560 
on any way you want it's gonna go on
just<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.340> you're<00:01:18.030> gonna<00:01:18.090> want<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> pay

want to take and look at it as you can

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.660 
want to take and look at it as you can
see<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.450> tooth<00:01:27.750> marks

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
see here you can see the tooth marks

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.690 
see here you can see the tooth marks

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
teeth on our washer that's going to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
teeth on our washer that's going to
indicate<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> outside<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
indicate that this is the outside of the

indicate that this is the outside of the
pulley<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:38.460> we're<00:01:38.579> gonna<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.119> take<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
pulley what we're gonna do is take and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.370 
pulley what we're gonna do is take and
line<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:40.700> onto<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.180> crankshaft<00:01:45.200> just<00:01:46.200> like

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
line it up onto the crankshaft just like

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
line it up onto the crankshaft just like
so<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> started<00:01:48.509> by<00:01:48.659> tapping<00:01:49.020> on

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
so and just get it started by tapping on

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.609 
so and just get it started by tapping on
it<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> rubber<00:01:49.890> mallet<00:01:50.149> now<00:01:51.149> you're<00:01:51.390> not

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
it with a rubber mallet now you're not

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.109 
it with a rubber mallet now you're not
supposed<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.710> beat<00:01:52.950> these<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.700> hard<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
supposed to beat these very hard with a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
supposed to beat these very hard with a
steel<00:01:54.420> mallet<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.380> thing<00:01:55.560> you'll<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
steel mallet one thing you'll do is

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.830 
steel mallet one thing you'll do is
mushroom<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> end<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.119> make<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> difficult

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
mushroom the end and make it difficult

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
mushroom the end and make it difficult
for<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.290> bolt<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> go<00:01:58.799> through<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.850> other

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
for your bolt to go through the other

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.520 
for your bolt to go through the other
thing<00:02:00.240> you're<00:02:00.360> doing<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.320> gonna<00:02:01.409> be

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
thing you're doing is you're gonna be

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.819 
thing you're doing is you're gonna be
jamming<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> crankshaft<00:02:03.500> which<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.649> not<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
jamming the crankshaft which is not a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.350 
jamming the crankshaft which is not a
good<00:02:05.009> idea<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.610> very<00:02:05.880> tough<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
good idea it's very tough on the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.819 
good idea it's very tough on the
bearings<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.350> tough<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
bearings it can be tough on the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.260 
bearings it can be tough on the
transmission<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.700> well<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:09.119> you'll<00:02:09.239> be

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
transmission as well because you'll be

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.639 
transmission as well because you'll be
jamming<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> bearings<00:02:10.229> inside<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
jamming the bearings inside the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.260 
jamming the bearings inside the
transmission<00:02:10.950> who's<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> rubber

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
transmission who's gonna take a rubber

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.370 
transmission who's gonna take a rubber
mallet

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
mallet

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
mallet
and<00:02:14.010> give<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.340> couple<00:02:14.490> taps<00:02:14.820> just<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:15.540> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and give it a couple taps just to get it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.350 
and give it a couple taps just to get it
started<00:02:15.870> we're<00:02:16.470> gonna<00:02:16.560> actually<00:02:16.830> use<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
started we're gonna actually use the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.490 
started we're gonna actually use the
bolt<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:19.710> pull<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.160> down<00:02:20.400> tight<00:02:24.230> once<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.380> have

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
bolt to pull it down tight once you have

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800 
bolt to pull it down tight once you have
your<00:02:25.650> harmonic<00:02:26.160> balancer<00:02:26.580> tapped<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.300> just

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
your harmonic balancer tapped on just

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.660 
your harmonic balancer tapped on just
enough<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.290> get<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.470> couple<00:02:28.890> threads<00:02:29.190> started

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
enough to get a couple threads started

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430 
enough to get a couple threads started
what<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.150> mean<00:02:30.300> by<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> couple<00:02:30.660> threads<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.230> about

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
what I mean by a couple threads is about

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.740 
what I mean by a couple threads is about
that<00:02:31.770> much<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> bowl<00:02:32.430> we're<00:02:33.390> gonna<00:02:33.510> need

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
that much of the bowl we're gonna need

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.290 
that much of the bowl we're gonna need
enough<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.410> grip<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.830> strong<00:02:35.100> enough<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.970> pull

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
enough to grip it strong enough to pull

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300 
enough to grip it strong enough to pull
it<00:02:36.480> down<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.350> you're<00:02:37.530> not<00:02:37.560> gonna<00:02:37.890> want<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
it down but you're not gonna want to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.280 
it down but you're not gonna want to
beat<00:02:38.700> your<00:02:38.910> harmonic<00:02:39.390> balancer<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.110> one

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
beat your harmonic balancer on the one

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.510 
beat your harmonic balancer on the one
you<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.560> one<00:02:40.740> thing<00:02:40.950> you're<00:02:41.070> gonna<00:02:41.160> want<00:02:41.430> to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
you know one thing you're gonna want to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520 
you know one thing you're gonna want to
avoid<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.360> getting<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.810> balancer

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
avoid is getting that balancer

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.890 
avoid is getting that balancer
jammed<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.220> there<00:02:44.430> crooked<00:02:44.940> you'll<00:02:45.330> never<00:02:45.600> get

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
jammed on there crooked you'll never get

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.450 
jammed on there crooked you'll never get
it<00:02:45.990> off<00:02:46.140> or<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:46.800> on<00:02:46.920> right<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:47.370> that

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
it off or get it on right for that

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.170 
it off or get it on right for that
matter<00:02:47.700> what<00:02:48.210> you're<00:02:48.330> gonna<00:02:48.420> see<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:50.060> I've<00:02:51.060> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
matter what you're gonna see is I've it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.970 
matter what you're gonna see is I've it
on<00:02:51.270> there<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.600> got<00:02:52.290> about<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.470> quarter<00:02:52.770> inch<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
on there I got about a quarter inch of

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.110 
on there I got about a quarter inch of
threads<00:02:53.250> which<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.550> enough<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.910> give<00:02:54.030> me

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
threads which is enough to give me

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.420 
threads which is enough to give me
enough<00:02:54.330> grab<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:55.380> pull<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.920> harmonic

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
enough grab to pull that harmonic
