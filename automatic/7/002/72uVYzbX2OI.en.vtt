00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
little bit about the security because I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.190 
little bit about the security because I

imaging business with banks for over 15
years<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> back<00:00:52.590> office<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.940> over

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
years in the back office and now over

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
years in the back office and now over
the<00:00:54.239> last<00:00:54.390> two<00:00:54.690> years<00:00:54.719> we've<00:00:55.170> taken<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the last two years we've taken the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
the last two years we've taken the
technology<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.219> put<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.730> little

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
technology and put it on these little

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
technology and put it on these little
devices<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.719> what's<00:00:58.230> allowed<00:00:58.469> us<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
devices and what's allowed us to do that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790 
devices and what's allowed us to do that
is<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.760> sophisticated<00:01:00.059> cameras<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
is very sophisticated cameras and the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
is very sophisticated cameras and the
fast<00:01:02.039> data<00:01:02.399> networks<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.030> available<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
fast data networks that are available to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.660 
fast data networks that are available to
everybody<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.710> we've<00:01:04.890> also<00:01:05.070> been<00:01:05.309> able<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
everybody so we've also been able to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.190 
everybody so we've also been able to
incorporate<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> security<00:01:06.900> features

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
incorporate all the security features

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
incorporate all the security features
that<00:01:07.320> we've<00:01:07.470> built<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.890> over<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> years<00:01:08.640> we

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that we've built in over the years we

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
that we've built in over the years we
process<00:01:09.689> today<00:01:09.869> over<00:01:10.229> 10<00:01:10.530> billion<00:01:10.890> checks

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
process today over 10 billion checks

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
process today over 10 billion checks
through<00:01:12.210> banks<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.960> back<00:01:13.140> office<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
through banks in the back office and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460 
through banks in the back office and
only<00:01:14.580> recently<00:01:14.970> did<00:01:15.180> customers<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.900> PayPal

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
only recently did customers like PayPal

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.730 
only recently did customers like PayPal
or<00:01:16.500> even<00:01:16.979> usaa<00:01:17.759> launch<00:01:18.689> their<00:01:18.960> products<00:01:19.350> using

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
or even usaa launch their products using

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
or even usaa launch their products using
technology<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.790> tech<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.450> allow<00:01:21.659> check

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
technology for my tech to allow check

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.440 
technology for my tech to allow check
deposits<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.220> security<00:01:23.759> has<00:01:23.970> always<00:01:24.240> been<00:01:24.390> our

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
deposits so security has always been our

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.070 
deposits so security has always been our
number<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:25.170> concern<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.610> things<00:01:26.880> like

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
number one concern and we do things like

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.920 
number one concern and we do things like
multi-factor<00:01:28.080> authentication<00:01:29.630> data<00:01:30.630> bit

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
multi-factor authentication data bit

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350 
multi-factor authentication data bit
encryption<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.770> also<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> encrypt<00:01:33.180> using

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
encryption and also we encrypt using

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
encryption and also we encrypt using
secure<00:01:33.869> socket<00:01:34.350> layer<00:01:34.380> over<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> airwaves<00:01:35.130> on

secure socket layer over the airwaves on

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.330 
secure socket layer over the airwaves on
top<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.720> banks<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.320> several<00:01:38.040> layers<00:01:38.189> of

top of that banks have several layers of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
top of that banks have several layers of
security<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:39.060> deploy<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.200> partnership

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
security they deploy so in partnership

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.980 
security they deploy so in partnership
with<00:01:40.740> banks<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.240> secure<00:01:42.659> very

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
with banks we have a very secure very

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.499 
with banks we have a very secure very
scalable<00:01:43.470> system<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.119> many

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
scalable system now do you have many

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
scalable system now do you have many
companies<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.439> are<00:01:46.590> using<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.040> tech<00:01:47.280> soft

make a difference how many megapixels
your<00:02:34.170> camera<00:02:34.829> can<00:02:35.010> use<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.489> correct<00:02:35.790> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
your camera can use is that correct it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.910 
your camera can use is that correct it
does<00:02:36.480> make<00:02:36.629> a<00:02:36.690> difference<00:02:36.989> we<00:02:37.500> say<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
does make a difference we say the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.580 
does make a difference we say the
minimum<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.459> about<00:02:38.730> 2<00:02:38.970> megapixels<00:02:39.780> we

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
minimum is about 2 megapixels we

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.319 
minimum is about 2 megapixels we
fortunately<00:02:41.340> are<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.819> world<00:02:42.030> now<00:02:42.299> where
