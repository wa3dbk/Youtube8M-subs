00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.860
 theory of what to eat 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.579
 but so that the volume of the portion does not exceed the volume 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 us and so we have a glass actually 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.250
 need to eat 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:55.559
 food by volume that is it turns out 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:59.190
 us somewhere 200 gr that is no more than 40 per 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.859
 one meal is much smaller 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.979
 a number of experts offer 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.030
 rejected two or three times I read different 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.939
 opinion on this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 studied theories and realized that it was not mine 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.630
 as I said in the past I saw when 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.420
 it was about calories I am against the extreme 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.689
 I will add that in every way hard graphics 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.299
 some sort of food weighing modes all this 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.909
 my story I will never 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.189
 to do this for many reasons 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 First I do not have time for this during 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.250
 second i don't have this desire and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.229
 thirdly if I eat 200 grams of food I 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 I'm hungry much earlier than after 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.399
 two hours in the end i will be ready on i will 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 I will pass by all the time I will wait 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.680
 next meal and nothing good 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.170
 it won't end of course for the sake of 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 experiment you can go on any swipe 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.390
 but in my case a similar experiment 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.939
 can last a day or two and then everything 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.270
 will be finished and you can put an end to 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.270
 this story 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.560
 as many times as I will 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.670
 comfortable and listen to your 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.950
 body and so in the end I eat 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.069
 three times a day I have breakfast 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.099
 dinner is better and not enough 3 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.130
 full meal 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.630
 I also wanted to say something very important 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.380
 eat only when you 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.620
 really 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.900
 experiencing cold bangs do not bite 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.080
 own problems of stress some events 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.599
 life should be eaten only when 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.209
 really hungry now let's talk about 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.080
 portions a portion should be such that 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.599
 after you you did not feel hunger 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.760
 here all individually eat so much 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.970
 how much you need to saturate but 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.989
 do not overeat you should be feeling 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.329
 when you get 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.819
 become what else do you have place for 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.940
 something else that's the best 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.030
 the option is payment but you do not have 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.980
 feeling of heaviness in the stomach that way 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.200
 We also do with my daughter and I advise you 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.930
 do it that way 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.560
 fixate on portions on volume with 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 kinds of food believe it absolutely 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.160
 has nothing to do with losing weight 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.150
 By the way , somehow I'll take off 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.139
 special video on why I'm not 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.180
 I accept a diet and diet pills 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.769
 tell about your mistakes losing weight 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.260
 general about everything and you will understand why 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.230
 now I have such an opposit want more 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.630
 tell you something about when we are with. started 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.459
 to lose weight we replaced the big plates and on 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.069
 small before 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.639
 pupils from such big dining 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.180
 plates 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.780
 and now, too, more than a year my porsche 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.989
 such small hearts of plates though 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.900
 I doubt very much that this moment helped 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.750
 we do rather it is not psychological 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.989
 factor but nonetheless we have happening 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.389
 in such a way so that lose weight and 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.310
 eat comfortably so many times a day 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.489
 how much is required 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.250
 your body portions which 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:16.419
 must return to listen to 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.910
 yourself and lose weight on health for today 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.690

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.310
