00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.620
 of how much simone chiolerio you are more 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.200
 the teacher of writings of this course 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.469
 what insignia exactly to kids like 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.170
 the course is articulated but above all there 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.840
 we were found last week by 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.600
 ask guys what what we know 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 already do to see what I could 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.369
 actually teach them or team 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.799
 give him some advice then nothing 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.320
 when I saw that more or less the theory 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.390
 the jump was already in the holy 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.930
 It does not disconnect just ask 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.009
 at the table there would be the jump e 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.830
 nothing gave him advice on how 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.880
 improve them longed for 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.210
 terminologies 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.270
 the thrusts like stopping as a pd deal 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.100
 with the girls all the king us 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 I am a psychologist and I work for 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.009
 the hospital company within one 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.350
 structure called youth center 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.759
 teenagers where we take care of kids 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.549
 of the territory in the age group 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.310
 between the ages of 14 and 30 and we follow them 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.430
 if from an educational point of view 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.260
 psychological 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.210
 like this in collaboration with 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.710
 there is a pro wide association 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.530
 also other activities such as 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.090
 rowing that's why skate because 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.080
 you liked this thing about 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.100
 skateboard because there was proposed by 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.930
 a person with crazy energy and it 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.430
 self- skate 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 a series of values ​​that reflect 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.439
 very educational values ​​that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.179
 and worth it to transmit through the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.110
 sport the absence of a real one 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.300
 competition 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.680
 the absence of a real leader one 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.580
 collaborative spirit and much 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.200
 pronounced the master is indeed a master 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.030
 but he is perhaps simply a person who 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.040
 is passionate proven of different from 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.810
 we then exchange knowledge 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.610
 becomes a way to be together more 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.080
 what a way to go to class 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.910
 something in order to spend time 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.660
 with friends to share one with 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.190
 strong passion 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.110
 here you are at the horse-chestnut parking lot 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.299
 among other things it can be done in total 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.579
 security because cars do not pass 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.069
 in short the script many species yes 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.599
 roadside practice and uncertain 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.549
 so you can park here 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.079
 practice later in total 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.060
 tranquility right 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.269
 as you can see a space 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.060
 absolutely dedicated right now 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.220
 at skate and who participates in the course 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.700
 covered by insurance provided 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.410
 from the vas golf sport lario that's how it is 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.440
 sign up for this course 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.980
 if some guy wanted what 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.450
 must do 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.430
 being able to enroll in this course is 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.079
 enough to show up here, alico caldo 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:17.489
 that castrano di como every Thursday 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:20.700
 from 14 30 to 16 30 for many years 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.769
 you practice skateboard, however, the writing 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.130
 it has always been a sport in short that not 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.810
 has always been well-regarded shortcomings of 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.060
 spaces here at the horse chestnut tree can be 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.290
 practice in total tranquility 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.180
 exact, yes, more than not so well 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.880
 since I would say that it is really badly seen 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.180
 so many that we had made a structure 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.359
 Bari fanger weather that was almost 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.609
 ridiculous and the north removed 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.260
 then problems with the neighborhood 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.739
 here perhaps we say that this initiative 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.480
 it can also be a signal for those who must 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.450
 take certain decisions and 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.430
 decide whether to tell the spaces about this 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.790
 sport at como dene there is need 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.790
 hopefully staggering is nice hopefully
