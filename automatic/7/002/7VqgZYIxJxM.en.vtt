00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
any can do it by the way that's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
any can do it by the way that's
 with<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> pH<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.480> some<00:00:30.689> body<00:00:30.869> building

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
 with a pH it's some body building

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.870 
 with a pH it's some body building
lingo<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.710> don't<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.189> bull<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
lingo I don't get in that bull I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970 
lingo I don't get in that bull I
also<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.450> into<00:00:33.660> traditional<00:00:33.870> bulking<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
also get into traditional bulking and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
also get into traditional bulking and
cutting<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.030> think<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.450> completely

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
cutting because I think it's completely

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.799 
cutting because I think it's completely
retarded<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.250> two<00:00:38.820> steps<00:00:39.120> back<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
retarded to go two steps back which is

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
retarded to go two steps back which is
putting<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> bunch<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> body<00:00:40.710> fat<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.399> take

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
putting on a bunch of body fat to take

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.250 
putting on a bunch of body fat to take
one<00:00:41.790> step<00:00:41.969> forward<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> actually

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
one step forward and have to actually

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
one step forward and have to actually
burn<00:00:43.500> off<00:00:43.710> online<00:00:43.920> fat<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.730> look

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

versus calories out which is how many

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.470 
versus calories out which is how many
calories<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.309> burn<00:00:59.520> off<00:00:59.730> through<00:01:00.000> exercise

calories you burn off through exercise

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.170 
calories you burn off through exercise
or<00:01:00.899> through<00:01:01.620> fasting<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.910> if

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
or through fasting like I do or if

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
or through fasting like I do or if
you're<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.359> reducing<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.170> calories

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
you're just reducing your calories

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.010 
you're just reducing your calories
artificially<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.460> eating<00:01:05.790> less<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.270> say<00:01:06.869> it's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
artificially by eating less I say it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
artificially by eating less I say it's
all<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> bunch<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.159> I'm<00:01:08.460> gonna

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
all a bunch of and I'm gonna

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.330 
all a bunch of and I'm gonna
debunk<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.420> very<00:01:09.659> easily<00:01:10.040> first<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.220> all

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340

before<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.210> Paki<00:01:12.420> let<00:01:12.689> me<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.960> point<00:01:13.110> out

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
before I do Paki let me just point out

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.620 
before I do Paki let me just point out
that<00:01:13.650> anybody<00:01:14.400> who<00:01:14.580> thinks<00:01:14.729> says<00:01:15.000> calories<00:01:15.509> in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
that anybody who thinks says calories in

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.310 
that anybody who thinks says calories in
versus<00:01:15.960> calories<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.909> easy

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
versus calories out if it was that easy

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
versus calories out if it was that easy
to<00:01:19.320> lose<00:01:19.500> body<00:01:19.770> fat<00:01:19.890> which<00:01:20.280> by<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> way

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to lose body fat which by the way

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
to lose body fat which by the way
completely<00:01:20.939> takes<00:01:21.780> away<00:01:22.020> from<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
completely takes away from all the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
completely takes away from all the

are<00:01:24.659> complicated<00:01:25.229> machines<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.040> simple

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
are complicated machines it's not simple

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.030 
are complicated machines it's not simple
it's<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.479> eat<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.560> then

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's not like you just eat this and then

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
it's not like you just eat this and then
it<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.579> no<00:01:30.270> there's<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.780> kinds<00:01:31.110> of

ton of muscle so he had more room for
glycogen<00:03:53.350> if<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.160> go<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.490> I<00:03:54.580> eat<00:03:54.760> say<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> big

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
glycogen if I go and I eat say a big

the<00:04:35.410> first<00:04:35.470> 19<00:04:36.100> miles<00:04:36.310> of<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.970> 26-mile<00:04:37.570> marathon

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
the first 19 miles of a 26-mile marathon

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.420 
the first 19 miles of a 26-mile marathon
that's<00:04:38.740> smart

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
that's smart

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.190 
that's smart
I<00:04:39.460> understand<00:04:40.120> why<00:04:40.240> endurance<00:04:40.630> athletes<00:04:41.020> do

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
I understand why endurance athletes do

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.870 
I understand why endurance athletes do
that<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:41.920> you<00:04:41.980> see<00:04:42.190> right<00:04:42.220> there<00:04:42.400> that's<00:04:42.820> just

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
that so you see right there that's just

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.000 
that so you see right there that's just
