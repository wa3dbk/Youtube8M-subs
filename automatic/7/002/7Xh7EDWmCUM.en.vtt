completely<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.880> battery<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.420> mount

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
completely and the battery and mount

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
completely and the battery and mount
battery<00:02:07.229> inside<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> helmet

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
battery inside the helmet

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.229 
battery inside the helmet
and<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.159> know<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.340> necessary<00:02:11.879> go<00:02:12.120> out

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
and then if you know if necessary go out

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
and then if you know if necessary go out
and<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.450> another<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.049> just<00:02:13.200> wire<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and get another one and just wire in the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.679 
and get another one and just wire in the
series<00:02:14.099> if<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.819> need<00:02:14.970> more<00:02:15.150> than<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.329> speaker

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
series if I need more than one speaker

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.140 
series if I need more than one speaker
and<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.500> first<00:02:16.799> step<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.579> how

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and so first step is just to see how

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.220 
and so first step is just to see how
loud<00:02:18.329> it's<00:02:18.540> actually<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.930> be<00:02:18.989> inside

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
loud it's actually going to be inside

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.349 
loud it's actually going to be inside
the<00:02:19.349> helmet<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:26.700> right<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:26.939> it's<00:02:27.060> pretty<00:02:27.239> loud

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
the helmet all right so it's pretty loud

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.390 
the helmet all right so it's pretty loud
you<00:02:28.109> know<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.439> know<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.799> also<00:02:28.920> turn<00:02:29.129> down

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
you know you know you can also turn down

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.059 
you know you know you can also turn down
but<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.629> my<00:02:30.750> plan<00:02:30.959> was<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.409> something<00:02:31.769> in

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
but you know my plan was as something in

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.520 
but you know my plan was as something in
the<00:02:32.250> hair<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.659> helmet<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.349> would<00:02:34.439> be

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the hair in the helmet that would be

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
the hair in the helmet that would be
loud<00:02:35.069> if<00:02:35.459> if<00:02:36.269> needed<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.109> also<00:02:37.500> quiet<00:02:38.189> when

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
loud if if needed and also quiet when

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.089 
loud if if needed and also quiet when
needed<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.470> looks<00:02:40.829> like<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.040> gonna

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
needed so this looks like it's gonna

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.930 
needed so this looks like it's gonna
work<00:02:41.220> pretty<00:02:41.489> well

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
work pretty well

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.460 
work pretty well
alright<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.639> I've<00:02:44.639> taken<00:02:44.819> apart<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.540> speaker

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470

well<00:05:52.730> I<00:05:53.030> think<00:05:53.660> I<00:05:53.870> have<00:05:54.020> them<00:05:54.200> pretty<00:05:54.440> much<00:05:54.500> in

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
well I think I have them pretty much in

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.840 
well I think I have them pretty much in
place<00:05:56.860> change<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:57.980> configuration<00:05:58.670> up<00:05:58.760> a

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
place change the configuration up a

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.380 
place change the configuration up a
little<00:05:59.000> bit

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
little bit

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.750 
little bit
these<00:06:00.140> speakers<00:06:00.470> used<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:00.770> be<00:06:00.890> right<00:06:01.610> about

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
these speakers used to be right about

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.180 
these speakers used to be right about
here<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.930> board's<00:06:03.320> used<00:06:03.500> to<00:06:03.590> be<00:06:03.740> back

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
here and the board's used to be back

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.920 
here and the board's used to be back
here<00:06:04.580> there's<00:06:05.450> a<00:06:05.480> little<00:06:05.570> bit<00:06:05.690> too<00:06:05.780> much

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
here there's a little bit too much

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.500 
here there's a little bit too much
pressure<00:06:06.260> on<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.560> back<00:06:06.710> of<00:06:06.860> the<00:06:06.920> neck<00:06:07.130> and<00:06:07.510> too

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
pressure on the back of the neck and too

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.850 
pressure on the back of the neck and too
much<00:06:08.630> pressure<00:06:08.870> on<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.080> ear<00:06:09.290> so<00:06:09.530> what<00:06:09.650> I<00:06:09.680> did

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
much pressure on the ear so what I did

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.940 
much pressure on the ear so what I did
is<00:06:10.100> I<00:06:10.310> put<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.510> board's<00:06:11.780> right<00:06:11.930> here<00:06:12.170> where

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
is I put the board's right here where

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.090 
is I put the board's right here where
the<00:06:13.210> straps<00:06:14.210> come<00:06:14.420> across<00:06:14.690> for<00:06:15.620> some<00:06:15.890> extra

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
the straps come across for some extra

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.000 
the straps come across for some extra
padding<00:06:16.220> and<00:06:16.730> then<00:06:17.320> the<00:06:18.320> speaker's<00:06:18.740> sit

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
padding and then the speaker's sit

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.910 
padding and then the speaker's sit
really<00:06:19.930> far<00:06:20.930> back<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:22.640> reason<00:06:22.940> being<00:06:23.150> is

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
really far back the reason being is

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.320 
really far back the reason being is
that's<00:06:24.920> where<00:06:25.160> I<00:06:25.190> have<00:06:25.490> most<00:06:26.090> padding<00:06:26.600> and<00:06:28.330> did

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
that's where I have most padding and did

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.230 
that's where I have most padding and did
a<00:06:29.360> quick<00:06:29.660> test<00:06:30.110> run<00:06:30.410> put<00:06:30.980> these<00:06:31.130> in<00:06:31.310> and<00:06:31.580> this

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
a quick test run put these in and this

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.180 
a quick test run put these in and this
is<00:06:32.390> the<00:06:32.480> most<00:06:32.630> comfortable<00:06:32.870> setup<00:06:33.470> I<00:06:33.650> don't

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
is the most comfortable setup I don't

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.430 
is the most comfortable setup I don't
feel<00:06:34.370> any<00:06:34.580> extra<00:06:34.880> pressure<00:06:35.030> you<00:06:35.930> know<00:06:36.050> my<00:06:36.260> jaw

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
feel any extra pressure you know my jaw

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.890 
feel any extra pressure you know my jaw
line<00:06:36.680> went<00:06:37.250> back<00:06:37.460> go<00:06:37.580> ahead<00:06:37.820> like<00:06:38.480> I<00:06:38.600> did<00:06:38.750> with

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
line went back go ahead like I did with

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.020 
line went back go ahead like I did with
the<00:06:38.990> other<00:06:39.020> setup<00:06:39.500> so<00:06:39.830> this<00:06:40.100> is<00:06:40.700> what<00:06:40.790> it<00:06:40.880> looks

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
the other setup so this is what it looks

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.960 
the other setup so this is what it looks
like<00:06:41.120> without<00:06:41.690> the<00:06:41.900> cheek<00:06:42.170> heads<00:06:42.410> in<00:06:42.730> got<00:06:43.730> the

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
like without the cheek heads in got the

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.390 
like without the cheek heads in got the
speaker's<00:06:44.390> right<00:06:45.020> here<00:06:45.200> and<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:46.010> board's

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
speaker's right here and the board's

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.430 
speaker's right here and the board's

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.340 
back here all the hardware is right here
and<00:06:59.390> you<00:06:59.450> can<00:06:59.720> see<00:07:00.230> it<00:07:00.470> still<00:07:00.770> gives<00:07:02.260> plenty<00:07:03.260> of

cushion in speakers back here and then

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.780 
cushion in speakers back here and then
the<00:07:08.420> board<00:07:08.660> is<00:07:09.020> actually<00:07:09.260> right<00:07:09.560> here<00:07:09.640> so<00:07:10.640> it

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
the board is actually right here so it
