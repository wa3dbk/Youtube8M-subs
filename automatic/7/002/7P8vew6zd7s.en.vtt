00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
tyent 1-1 tie molar he was another for

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.680 
tyent 1-1 tie molar he was another for
one<00:01:00.600> season<00:01:00.960> after<00:01:01.710> being<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.300> Carolina

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
one season after being with the Carolina

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.090 
one season after being with the Carolina
Hurricanes<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.770> Carolina

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
Hurricanes so that the Carolina

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
Hurricanes so that the Carolina
Hurricanes<00:01:05.190> name<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.729> boilers<00:01:06.149> and<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.540> think

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
Hurricanes name is boilers and I think

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.120 
Hurricanes name is boilers and I think
he<00:01:06.810> went<00:01:06.930> back<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.410> Hurricanes<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> then

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
he went back to the Hurricanes and then

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.450 
he went back to the Hurricanes and then
now<00:01:08.250> he's<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> Canadians<00:01:10.340> usually<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
now he's with the Canadians usually I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.219 
now he's with the Canadians usually I
don't<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:11.910> ever<00:01:12.060> been<00:01:12.330> montreal<00:01:12.960> in
