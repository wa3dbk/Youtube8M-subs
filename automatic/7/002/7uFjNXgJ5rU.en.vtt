00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
think I like the Jada better but Jade

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.860 
think I like the Jada better but Jade
only<00:00:32.250> makes<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:33.890> that<00:00:35.059> 2010<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.809> I

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.689 
strobes and then about grill strobes as
well<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.620> then<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.949> put<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> was

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
well so then all that put in for you was

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.950 
well so then all that put in for you was
able<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.120> those<00:00:54.890> go<00:00:55.890> ahead<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.160> open<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
able to do those go ahead and open the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
able to do those go ahead and open the
hood<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.379> two<00:00:58.590> doors<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.760> buffer<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
hood the two doors I can get buffer you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.709 
hood the two doors I can get buffer you
know<00:01:00.239> under<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> hood<00:01:02.149> here<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.300> go

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
know under the hood here we go

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
know under the hood here we go
so<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> hood<00:01:04.619> does<00:01:04.799> open<00:01:05.129> door<00:01:05.339> opens

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so the hood does open door opens

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.359 
so the hood does open door opens
obviously<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> lift<00:01:06.330> gate<00:01:06.510> opens<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.960> well

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
obviously the lift gate opens as well

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.740 
obviously the lift gate opens as well

again<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.880> asked<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.119> grill<00:01:42.329> strobes<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.869> got

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
again you asked for grill strobes I got

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.319 
again you asked for grill strobes I got
the<00:01:43.229> grill<00:01:43.380> strobes<00:01:43.680> mounted<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:45.119> how<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the grill strobes mounted I think how I

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.830 
the grill strobes mounted I think how I
never<00:01:45.659> had<00:01:46.470> built<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.040> these<00:01:47.130> yet<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
never had built one of these yet so the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
never had built one of these yet so the
nofa<00:01:49.140> girl<00:01:49.350> strobes<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.770> possible<00:01:50.280> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
nofa girl strobes would be possible I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.130 
nofa girl strobes would be possible I
assume<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:50.670> probably<00:01:50.850> would<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
assume they probably would be and as you

of<00:04:30.050> them<00:04:30.200> being<00:04:31.070> looking<00:04:31.790> proofs<00:04:32.090> it's<00:04:32.300> kind

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
of them being looking proofs it's kind

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.350 
of them being looking proofs it's kind
of<00:04:32.570> out<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.080> way<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.230> little<00:04:33.380> bit<00:04:33.530> so<00:04:34.360> didn't

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
of out of the way a little bit so didn't

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.350 
of out of the way a little bit so didn't
want<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.540> look<00:04:35.720> silly<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.350> trim<00:04:36.680> them<00:04:36.830> back<00:04:36.860> and

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
want to look silly so trim them back and

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.570 
want to look silly so trim them back and
rounded<00:04:38.360> them<00:04:38.480> off<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:38.840> they're<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.140> same

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
rounded them off so they're the same

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.100 
rounded them off so they're the same
have<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.700> same<00:04:40.880> curvature<00:04:41.420> as<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.690> top<00:04:41.930> of

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
have the same curvature as the top of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.620 
have the same curvature as the top of
the<00:04:42.200> truck<00:04:42.610> so<00:04:43.610> obviously<00:04:44.150> they're<00:04:44.330> visible

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
the truck so obviously they're visible

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.660 
the truck so obviously they're visible

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
from the rear as you can see they're

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.210 
from the rear as you can see they're
trimmed<00:04:47.150> back<00:04:47.360> pretty<00:04:47.630> close<00:04:47.920> so<00:04:48.920> they<00:04:49.040> look

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
trimmed back pretty close so they look

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.470 
trimmed back pretty close so they look
really<00:04:49.400> nice<00:04:50.140> turn<00:04:51.140> this<00:04:51.260> back<00:04:51.470> on<00:04:51.590> again<00:04:52.480> turn

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
really nice turn this back on again turn

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.990 
really nice turn this back on again turn
the<00:04:53.600> switch<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:53.870> them<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:55.580> as<00:04:55.670> you<00:04:55.760> can<00:04:55.850> see

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
the switch on them so as you can see

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.260 
the switch on them so as you can see
these<00:04:56.120> have<00:04:56.330> patterns<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.870> them<00:04:56.960> as<00:04:57.020> well

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
these have patterns to them as well

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.740 
these have patterns to them as well
sitting<00:04:59.270> here<00:05:01.330> kind<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.450> a<00:05:02.540> back-and-forth

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.620 
simultaneous flash and then like I said
the<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.460> a<00:05:10.490> double<00:05:10.850> flash<00:05:11.030> wig<00:05:11.300> wag<00:05:11.450> my

of<00:05:33.650> those<00:05:33.770> so<00:05:34.150> neat<00:05:35.150> thing<00:05:35.330> about<00:05:35.360> these<00:05:35.720> the

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
of those so neat thing about these the

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.740 
of those so neat thing about these the
wheels<00:05:36.500> do<00:05:36.770> it's<00:05:37.640> not<00:05:37.730> curable<00:05:38.180> though<00:05:38.510> secure

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
wheels do it's not curable though secure

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.540 
wheels do it's not curable though secure
more<00:05:38.930> doesn't<00:05:39.200> actually<00:05:39.290> turn<00:05:39.620> them<00:05:39.740> but<00:05:40.430> the

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
more doesn't actually turn them but the

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.400 
more doesn't actually turn them but the
wheels<00:05:40.700> are<00:05:40.880> opposable<00:05:41.330> as<00:05:41.780> you<00:05:41.960> can<00:05:42.050> see<00:05:42.200> seen

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
wheels are opposable as you can see seen

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.260 
wheels are opposable as you can see seen
can<00:05:42.530> have<00:05:42.770> it<00:05:42.920> you<00:05:43.640> know<00:05:43.760> you<00:05:43.790> can<00:05:43.970> turn<00:05:44.120> the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
can have it you know you can turn the

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.420 
can have it you know you can turn the
wheels<00:05:44.480> front<00:05:45.350> wheels<00:05:45.530> a<00:05:45.590> little<00:05:45.650> bit<00:05:45.830> it

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
wheels front wheels a little bit it

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.560 
wheels front wheels a little bit it
seemed<00:05:46.700> like<00:05:46.790> there<00:05:46.910> was<00:05:46.970> something<00:05:47.300> else<00:05:47.450> I

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
seemed like there was something else I

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.790 
seemed like there was something else I
was<00:05:47.630> going<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.870> point<00:05:48.050> out<00:05:48.260> that<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.530> Jada

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
was going to point out that the Jada

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.520 
was going to point out that the Jada
doesn't<00:05:49.220> have<00:05:55.120> well<00:05:56.120> I<00:05:56.360> don't<00:05:56.720> know<00:05:56.810> don't
