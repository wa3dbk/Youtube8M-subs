gold what's going on well remember mark
I<00:00:28.199> didn't<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.560> start<00:00:28.769> buying<00:00:29.039> gold<00:00:29.340> last

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I didn't just start buying gold last

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
I didn't just start buying gold last
month<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.119> last<00:00:30.179> week<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:30.720> been<00:00:30.750> bided<00:00:31.260> for

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
month or last week I've been bided for

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.979 
month or last week I've been bided for
years<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.040> obviously<00:00:32.880> gold<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> off<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.750> highs

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
years so obviously gold is off as highs

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
years so obviously gold is off as highs
but<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> lot<00:00:34.710> higher<00:00:34.950> than<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.550> i

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
but it's a lot higher than it was when i

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
but it's a lot higher than it was when i
first<00:00:35.700> started<00:00:36.180> buying<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.630> Valley<00:00:36.960> thirty

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
first started buying it Valley thirty

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
first started buying it Valley thirty
percent<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.100> far<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.489> year<00:00:38.550> well<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.510> dow<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
percent so far this year well the dow is

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
percent so far this year well the dow is
down<00:00:39.930> more<00:00:40.260> than<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.590> right<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.489> know

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
down more than that right so you know

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.920 
down more than that right so you know
gold<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.940> still<00:00:42.059> outperforming<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> doubt

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gold is still outperforming the doubt

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
gold is still outperforming the doubt
but<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.290> often<00:00:43.710> when<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
but you know often when you know you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
but you know often when you know you
have<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> major<00:00:44.969> news<00:00:45.360> event<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.930> happens<00:00:46.289> in

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
have a major news event that happens in

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
have a major news event that happens in
a<00:00:46.530> day<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> market<00:00:47.969> makes<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.329> move<00:00:48.539> in

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
a day you see the market makes a move in

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.209 
a day you see the market makes a move in
one<00:00:48.870> direction<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.590> makes<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.980> bigger

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
one direction and then makes a bigger

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
one direction and then makes a bigger
move<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> other<00:00:50.789> direction<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.960> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
move in the other direction I think this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.420 
move in the other direction I think this
is<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.230> head-fake<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.920> we're<00:00:53.010> having<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
is a head-fake that we're having in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
is a head-fake that we're having in
golden<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.329> dollar<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.780> playing<00:00:55.110> out

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
golden and the dollar is playing out

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
golden and the dollar is playing out
over<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.680> longer<00:00:55.949> time<00:00:56.100> period<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> major

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
over a longer time period but the major

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.290 
over a longer time period but the major
move<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.199> coming<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.100> dollar<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.730> gold<00:01:00.059> is

not not that direction well you know I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.200 
not not that direction well you know I
agree<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.350> Peter<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> commodities

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
agree with Peter that the commodities

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.510 
agree with Peter that the commodities
are<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.840> volatile<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.619> may<00:01:13.830> still<00:01:14.189> be

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
are going to be volatile we may still be

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340 
are going to be volatile we may still be
calling<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> correction<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> bull<00:01:16.049> run

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
calling this a correction and a bull run

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
calling this a correction and a bull run
and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.130> agree<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.729> them<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.180> dollar

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and I do agree with them that the dollar

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
and I do agree with them that the dollar
strength<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.409> readjustment<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.610> weak

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
strength is a readjustment of weak

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.179 
strength is a readjustment of weak
European<00:01:21.509> issues<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> run

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
European issues and that's going to run

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
European issues and that's going to run
its<00:01:23.369> course<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.720> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
its course but I do think that that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.170 
its course but I do think that that
course<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.979> still<00:01:26.220> aggressive<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
course is still aggressive I think you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.300 
course is still aggressive I think you
can<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> euro<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.890> think

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
can see one to one in the euro I think

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859 
can see one to one in the euro I think
it's<00:01:29.520> more<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:30.000> because<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> weakness<00:01:30.810> in

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it's more not because a weakness in

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
it's more not because a weakness in
Europe<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> unwinding<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
Europe I just think it's unwinding of a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
Europe I just think it's unwinding of a
lot<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> traders<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.509> lot<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> leverage<00:01:34.049> out

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
lot of traders a lot of leverage out

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.929 
lot of traders a lot of leverage out
