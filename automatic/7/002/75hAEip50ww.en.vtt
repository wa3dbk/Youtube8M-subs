know to find out if my desk is obviously
you<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:47.180> plain<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.410> horizontal<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.680> see

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you know plain or horizontal I would see

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
you know plain or horizontal I would see
it<00:00:49.860> isn't<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.399> 5<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> floating<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.690> all

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it isn't as this 5 is floating on all

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
it isn't as this 5 is floating on all
that<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.640> a
