00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello very good youtube crazy 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.629
 welcome once again here to the channel 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.670
 the shadows consoles and what are you 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 seeing on the screen is therefore nothing 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.280
 comparative that we wanted to make 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 between the pc and console is worth and you will say and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.000
 good and what comes this good first is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 so you can see a little the great 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.010
 we have made a difference with the game 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.859
 tomb raider is worth the new tower from 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.560
 this year we have already played it, not us 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.199
 we have passed and so the question was that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.329
 you will live a little bit the difference of what 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.640
 that because this game I started this mac 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.930
 setting it to full right now what 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 will get the best at the time of recording 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 because it loses a bit of quality but I 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 I would like to set aside the subject 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.610
 put the issue with the new people 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.860
 generation was to know whether to say or 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.020
 You know how to think among all that they 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.699
 to you 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.440
 It will be the same as those PC 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.820
 we have now for example special to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 half cucumber than a graphic card 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.320
 good decent is worth letting me put the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 ultra games and you know if the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 next generation consoles are going to be 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.130
 same as the fish or they will overcome the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.040
 performance that has 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.860
 exactly the same as there is now and that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.010
 will not win the PCPC battle and the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.570
 it has equalized with console the only thing that 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.190
 it lacks the city ​​console spend more 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.130
 time to learn more 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.540
 performance I do not know there are several things that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.940
 they go through your head and I would like 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.920
 comment with all of you is worth where 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.960
 while for example this tom raider is 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.540
 an awful lot the difference there 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.690
 between the tomb raider of pc voucher and the tom 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.420
 console networks right now better not 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.750
 is noticing very well because the truth 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.090
 that loses quality when swimming a bit but 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.830
 true that is a true bestiality 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.080
 efe that there may be between towers 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.119
 example of pc fed up in roll of 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 playstation3 special voucher full and 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.890
 playstation 3 well as you know the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.369
 graphics that you have tried them the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.440
 two and the truth that leaves a lot 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.960
 wish I started for example we have the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.770
 new technology is called technology 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.840
 3g x for hair is worth the new 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.840
 graphic engine that each strand of hair is 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.849
 moves by itself alone is not like 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.129
 console 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.629
 the hair all in one and then that 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.540
 I would like to propose comments 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.240
 and what do you think of the current fish and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 they want the war won 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.640
 to consoles and consoles to be the best 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.890
 it hides more consoles liked pc not 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.140
 happens to be a videoblog voucher does not reach 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.210
 to be either a gameplay is a mix 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.530
 between gameplay and videoblog that knows that 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.050
 we like we have here here of the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.860
 consoles consoles and good me while you 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.930

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.160
 for comments opened completely 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.710
 As you know, it reads every two or more 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.380
