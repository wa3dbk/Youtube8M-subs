00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.440 
provided a platform for us to rely on
and<00:05:09.710> when<00:05:09.860> we<00:05:10.010> first<00:05:10.280> talked<00:05:10.520> about<00:05:10.820> Gennady

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
and when we first talked about Gennady

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.480 
and when we first talked about Gennady
fighting<00:05:11.810> heel<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.380> with<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.130> heavyweight

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
fighting heel and with the heavyweight

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.050 
fighting heel and with the heavyweight
co-feature<00:05:14.860> we<00:05:15.860> realized<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.460> was<00:05:16.610> too<00:05:16.820> big<00:05:17.030> to

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
co-feature we realized it was too big to

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.720 
co-feature we realized it was too big to
take<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.660> theater<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.290> the<00:05:19.190> Travis<00:05:19.550> fight

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
take to the theater and the Travis fight

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.820 
take to the theater and the Travis fight
was<00:05:19.880> going<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.060> happen<00:05:20.420> at<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.320> Forum<00:05:21.620> which

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
was going to happen at the Forum which

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.760 
was going to happen at the Forum which
is<00:05:22.010> owned<00:05:22.160> by<00:05:22.300> msg<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.510> renovated<00:05:23.990> by<00:05:24.080> msg<00:05:24.530> and

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
is owned by msg and renovated by msg and

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.430 
is owned by msg and renovated by msg and
so<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.790> decision<00:05:26.090> was<00:05:26.240> made<00:05:26.480> will<00:05:27.050> go<00:05:27.230> into

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
so the decision was made will go into

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.560 
so the decision was made will go into
the<00:05:27.590> big<00:05:27.770> arena<00:05:28.070> these<00:05:28.520> first<00:05:28.820> fight<00:05:29.030> here<00:05:29.270> we

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
the big arena these first fight here we

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.260 
the big arena these first fight here we
scaled<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.050> for<00:05:30.200> nine<00:05:30.380> thousand<00:05:31.210> burning<00:05:32.210> i

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
scaled it for nine thousand burning i

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.580 
scaled it for nine thousand burning i
think<00:05:32.450> the<00:05:32.540> official<00:05:32.900> count<00:05:33.050> was<00:05:33.230> what<00:05:33.380> eighty

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
think the official count was what eighty

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.030 
think the official count was what eighty
five<00:05:33.830> 72<00:05:34.310> were<00:05:34.460> different<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:35.840> that<00:05:35.990> out<00:05:36.200> so<00:05:36.470> we

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
five 72 were different so that out so we

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.710 
five 72 were different so that out so we
came<00:05:37.250> close<00:05:37.280> to<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:37.790> mark<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.180> we<00:05:38.300> scaled<00:05:38.600> it

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
came close to the mark that we scaled it

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.350 
came close to the mark that we scaled it
for<00:05:38.930> we<00:05:39.530> closed<00:05:39.800> off<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.220> upper<00:05:40.430> bowl<00:05:40.640> but<00:05:41.270> it

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
for we closed off the upper bowl but it

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.790 
for we closed off the upper bowl but it
was<00:05:41.450> still<00:05:41.660> an<00:05:41.780> indirect<00:05:42.050> electorate<00:05:42.680> was

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
was still an indirect electorate was

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.200 
was still an indirect electorate was
clearly<00:05:43.070> too<00:05:43.250> big<00:05:43.430> for<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.640> theater<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:44.090> it

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
clearly too big for the theater and it

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.690 
clearly too big for the theater and it
was<00:05:44.300> a<00:05:44.330> big<00:05:44.600> energy<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:45.080> arena<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:45.740> every<00:05:46.520> time

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
was a big energy in arena and every time

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.210 
was a big energy in arena and every time
he<00:05:46.760> fights<00:05:47.240> last<00:05:47.600> time<00:05:47.930> he<00:05:48.110> doubled<00:05:48.590> basically

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
he fights last time he doubled basically

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.460 
he fights last time he doubled basically
just<00:05:49.400> like<00:05:49.550> his<00:05:49.730> HBO<00:05:50.120> ratings<00:05:50.510> double-digit

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
just like his HBO ratings double-digit

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.750

increases<00:05:51.830> every<00:05:52.040> time<00:05:52.250> he<00:05:52.340> fights<00:05:52.580> he

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
increases every time he fights he

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.240 
increases every time he fights he
