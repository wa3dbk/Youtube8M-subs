00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello very good and welcome to this 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.970
 small review panama in 1.8 but good 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 more than what is this mode apart that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.480
 I got a bat at the beginning of the video 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 seriously a bat for the day this 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.439
 it's new and sincerely good 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.109
 then apart we are in charge of 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.869
 bring us new tools and with that to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.089
 turn with those tools we are going to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.159
 can also make super armours 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.289
 good because they are not qualities 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.289
 different make us start first 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 with lapis lazuli because the heavy 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.310
 well, lapis lazuli, it's going to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 sobrar the personaciÃ³n in 1.8 because 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.520
 they added a new functionality to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.150
 the charms, if you want more 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.040
 from lapis lazuli 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.170
 Well here you have tools that are 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.090
 pretty interesting it's worth so how 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.990
 this is bad date because it does 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.120
 next way is done with burning 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.940
 lapis lazuli in the oven and with this to your 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.910
 Once we remove the ingot from the fish tank 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 blue would be blue pencil and in ghost that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.860
 it would be the valero bullion of life 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.679
 and with this we can make backs spikes 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.440
 Ax blades and downs that are 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:08.420
 practically for nothing thrown 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.580
 that this is your ballet thing but 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.960
 good quote the creative are the same as 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.270
 a three gold iron sword 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.160
 diamonds as you see, you know, and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.530
 also the swimmer is practically 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.420
 same but has a different in 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.750
 functionality is worth the hurry is done well 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.210
 with pencil ingots we closed the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.700
 screens so we take out the pharmacies and by 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.310
 last the expenses that we spent doing 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.180
 Well, if I have four in the same 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.610
 let's say of the same class so 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.980
 saying it would give us a different quality 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.320
 in this case he added breathing 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.510
 infinite aquatic this is super 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.400
 important in case you want to kill the boss 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.170
 of the 1.8 that will add added 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.390
 aquatic mind then if you want to kill 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.070
 Well, if you over the pencil, this is 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.060
 your sincerely 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.680
 and we also have the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.290
 assemblers as enchanted and also 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.090
 are more interesting it so 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.979
 we continue for the second and the second is 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.510
 of the rest as sure that we will 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.580
 I have leftover leftovers to spare 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.979
 sure and maximum because I do not rest either 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.479
 I have a lot of knowledge so 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.510
 say it but well this is something 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.890
 your vale forgiveness how the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.690
 mature of rest 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.010
 it is achieved in the following way 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.560
 it's just like the other is practically worth 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.930
 it's called a straight one and we'll take out a 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.640
 ingot of the rest with that we do 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.209
 spades spikes shovels etc etc. 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.780
 ok ojito I think a sign of this 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.870
 lapis lazuli mode of the rest of quartz 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.910
 and from globe this and the best of all is 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.230
 that protects just like an iron vale 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.120
 that is not better than a diamond 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.520
 it's worth the best that diamond would be the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.709
 of emerald for the country like class 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.270
 we follow with him the review and if and if 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.370
 we have four of the rest as it is a 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.470
 see here the acquaintance is very simple like 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.060
 with the previous screens around here the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.709
 boticas around here and the caps by 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.950
 here if we have the rest would give us 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.150
 a fire-retardant body that this would be against 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.280
 the fire this is fine as well 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.810
 you want to go to the leader and kill more 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.510
 You play this is your ticket 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.910
 hehehe we make day and we continue with the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.400
 third we do with the quartz that the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.260
 of quartz would rush us to level 3 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.030
 that this to apply to you comes in handy 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.410
 it's worth how quartz is made nothing quotes 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.420
 for the fourth is to do regrets informs 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.209
 we have like quartz and we would take the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.140
 quartz ingot is worth and with that 50 then 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.390
 we make the swords the picks 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.790
 the hikes and finally the area that does not 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.470
 has no character or does not work for 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.140
 nothing 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.420
 as you know by forming equals 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.940
 the quartz and this around here this way 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.319
 it's very easy to creative you use a 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.030
 little buoy because it's pretty 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.860
 simple my opinion is worth we continue for the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.330
 fourth and the fourth I love it very 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.780
 Well, it's very interesting because our 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.030
 night vision level 2 or level 3 da 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.160
 the same because it is infinite vision or tuneup 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.739
 ok we do night and gives us vision 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.660
 night is very good and how it is 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.940
 He approached the lot with this very simple 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.350
 so we cooked it a black one this and it 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.780
 we wanted an ingot of gloss tony with 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.850
 this we make the peak the back the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.410
 tools and the armor is worth 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.450
 it's very good as it is to see here is 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.400
 very linking voucher and finally 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.620
 we start with the emerald the emerald 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.120
 on the other hand 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.730
 you do not have to burn a cell because the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.530
 emerald already comes to us we even have 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.560
 an 8 damage sword that's why he leaves the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.290
 last because it's 8 damage is a better 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.910
 that one of diamonds I think is a damage 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.480
 more than the diamond is very 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.180
 interesting 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.830
 we make the diamond peak we do the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.310
 word diamond we make a machete of 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.310
 Diamond 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.590
 7 damage just like a diamond sword 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.389
 mother our one shaved and finally 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.200
 the hoe the areas that we're not going to do 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:41.050
 nothing practically we do the bib 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.480
 as you know the pharmacies the screens 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.780
 and finally the cap and finally the 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.610
 Emerald would not release infinite strength 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.139
 This is very cool, so if 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.360
 you want to kill some enemy in particular 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.130
 that is difficult so to speak 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.370
 put a couple of services with my sword 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.750
 from a spiderweb we kill the spider of a 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.880
 touch me mother has charged me this is 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.740
 a serious girl who swims around here 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.940
 let's go to this one let's see what 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.190
 take of me is now being all the 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.780
 pull but good this is what brings the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.060
 mode of today than what I was doing 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.229
 I think one or two weeks without uploading a 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.150
 review because you have tomos 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.169
 interesting in my opinion and we 've 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.120
 seen this one and it seemed pretty 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.100
 interesting so it will let the 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.740
 Today's review I believe that the vis 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.720
 then it's basically because it's 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.639
 practically easy the mod and neither 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.660
 It has a lot of mystery, so it will leave me 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.370
 that the review of today only 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.080
 Proteus all this little mod and if it has 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.790
 liked the way then to grow and its line 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.130
 and one more comment so I 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.240
 dismissal here I say goodbye by killing the pig 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.310
 one touch 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.190
 this is an excited starting I think that 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.480
 has 10 life I think 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.500
 basile as a very particular until the 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.130
 following 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.130
 goodbye
