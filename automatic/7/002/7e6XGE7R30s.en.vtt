the<00:02:37.330> rules<00:02:37.600> are<00:02:37.750> what<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.080> scares<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.890> lot<00:02:38.920> of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
the rules are what like scares a lot of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.690 
the rules are what like scares a lot of
people<00:02:39.220> scared<00:02:40.120> me<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.560> again<00:02:42.190> all<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.520> need

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
people scared me so again all you need

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.760 
people scared me so again all you need
is<00:02:42.850> two<00:02:43.090> pairs<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.420> pliers<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.200> you're<00:02:44.590> going

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
is two pairs of pliers and you're going

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.240 
is two pairs of pliers and you're going
to<00:02:44.860> twist<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.910> not<00:02:46.660> pull<00:02:47.140> okay<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:48.010> jump

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
to twist and not pull okay the jump

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.220 
to twist and not pull okay the jump
rings<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.850> put<00:02:49.030> them<00:02:49.180> together<00:02:49.390> which<00:02:50.080> is

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
rings to put them together which is

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.360 
rings to put them together which is
interesting<00:02:50.349> because<00:02:50.650> I'd<00:02:50.890> never<00:02:51.099> heard<00:02:51.340> that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
interesting because I'd never heard that

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.970 
interesting because I'd never heard that
before<00:02:51.670> yeah<00:02:52.239> why<00:02:52.510> why<00:02:52.959> why<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.590> better

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
before yeah why why why is that better

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.870 
before yeah why why why is that better
it<00:02:54.390> attaches<00:02:55.390> easier<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.980> attaches<00:02:57.400> so

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
it attaches easier and it attaches so

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.539 
it attaches easier and it attaches so
that<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> jump<00:02:58.420> rings<00:02:58.660> aren't<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.400> you<00:03:00.400> want

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
that the jump rings aren't and you want

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.680 
that the jump rings aren't and you want
to<00:03:00.610> make<00:03:00.730> sure<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.150> jump<00:03:01.360> rings<00:03:01.540> are

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
to make sure that the jump rings are

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.630 
to make sure that the jump rings are
connected<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.380> your<00:03:02.530> pieces<00:03:02.769> are<00:03:03.040> not<00:03:03.190> falling

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
connected so your pieces are not falling

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.039 
connected so your pieces are not falling
off<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.209> just<00:03:04.330> kind<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.540> helps<00:03:04.720> them<00:03:04.810> line<00:03:05.019> up

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
off so just kind of helps them line up

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.930 
off so just kind of helps them line up
better<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.680> absolutely<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.549> I<00:03:06.700> know<00:03:06.760> that

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
better it absolutely because I know that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.090 
better it absolutely because I know that
seems<00:03:07.030> like<00:03:07.180> when<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.420> pull<00:03:07.780> them<00:03:08.110> when<00:03:08.620> i<00:03:08.650> try

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
seems like when I pull them when i try

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.620 
seems like when I pull them when i try
to<00:03:09.130> smoosh<00:03:09.580> them<00:03:09.790> back<00:03:09.970> together<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.480> always

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
to smoosh them back together it always

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.420 
to smoosh them back together it always
overlaps<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.739> just<00:03:11.890> doesn't<00:03:12.130> look<00:03:12.250> as

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
overlaps and it just doesn't look as

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.400 
overlaps and it just doesn't look as
clean<00:03:12.790> yeah<00:03:13.239> it's<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.600> little<00:03:13.900> bit<00:03:14.049> tougher

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
clean yeah it's a little bit tougher

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.470 
clean yeah it's a little bit tougher
when<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.769> do<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.190> way<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:15.910> this<00:03:16.299> is

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
when you do it that way so this this is

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.150 
when you do it that way so this this is
definitely<00:03:16.660> an<00:03:17.080> easier<00:03:17.440> method<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.950> can't

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
definitely an easier method I can't
