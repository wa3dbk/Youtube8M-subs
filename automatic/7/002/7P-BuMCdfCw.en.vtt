00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
from my position from last week's game I

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.109

think<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> big<00:00:29.220> thing<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.519> looking<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
think the big thing is looking at the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240 
think the big thing is looking at the
mistakes<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.750> made<00:00:30.779> personally<00:00:31.470> make

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
sure you don't make them again and then

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.750 
sure you don't make them again and then
you<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.840> making<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.309> cause<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you know making that you know cause and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.950

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
players on the offense even if it isn't

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790
