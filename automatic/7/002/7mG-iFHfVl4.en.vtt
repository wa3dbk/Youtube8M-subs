00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.830
 Covers somewhere in a week and so what 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.989

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.500
 Well, I told you what a jacuzzi will give you 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.810
 in the old days before 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.760
 I would probably stay fine here 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.620
 fresh so good and the ground under your feet 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.190

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.080
 you don't remember where he stopped 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.790
 in my opinion he said something about the palace 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.250
 bob gauze can look in there yes you can 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:25.640

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:36.650
 you can relax suddenly listen you don't 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:41.060

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:47.180

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.360

00:03:49.910 --> 00:04:01.459

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:19.400
 let zaydom that if he features hope here 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.040
 he is not here given he is clearly here recently 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.900
 was because 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.160
 because a lot of dynamite eliminated everything 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.310
 still burning yes and 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.419

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.419

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:41.770
 hell but late the market is already closed before 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:45.009

 well let's not make hasty 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.679
 conclusions can wait until he 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.309

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.550
