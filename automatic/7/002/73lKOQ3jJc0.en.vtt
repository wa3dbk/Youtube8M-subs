00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.509
 the karlsruher sc presents wildpark 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.509
 tv powered by baden tv 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.380
 the defeat is ticked off for us 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.029
 worked up yesterday, of course 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.180
 little time for it today again 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.289
 small suggestion in the training otherwise 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.829
 but noticed that earned lost 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.110
 to have 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.849
 that was a long time ago but that too is clear 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.470
 that's why it happens someday 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.689
 Do not throw us out of the saddle 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.660
 and it means looking forward 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.010
 set up with ingolstadt comes a very 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.190
 good team of mens team 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.660
 it also started well 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.640
 you notice that you have a lot of goals 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.790
 has shot a very good offensive 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.070
 has strengthened there very well and there 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.409
 applies to the old consequence back to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.869
 come because what we made leipzig 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.850
 have consistently been consistent as well 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:57.799
 that was already shown and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.689
 it can be much better now 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.460
 to defend oneself consistently on the 

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:03.140
 adversaries adjust to the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.269
 offensive qualities of ingolstadt 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.979
 set and then but also 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.850
 his own game more and better 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.159
 follow through 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.590
 That's not good for us in Leipzig 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.650
 succeeded to make better 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.170
 here at home , especially the audience 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.940
 also do everything in return to the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.940
 to come and get the threesome 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 not necessarily 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.200
 the rail so the old does not 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.090
 rail is then there of course 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.740
 available and is ready for use in the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.630
 moment in the training you notice it in 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.250
 The fight it was there once fallen 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.049
 and then it has problems to support itself 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.490
 does not come back very hard 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.200
 high and thus does not play at the moment 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.619
 because he is not competitive 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.179
 is for the second league if thats me 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.289
 that did not bother him and he did not feel 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.119
 can fall for it he can too 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.549
 get up as quickly as it does 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.679
 otherwise it does play a role if 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.990
 you can tell that the disabled or the 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.740
 injury then hampers him for so long 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.860
 does not matter 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.080
 So at the moment it is not possible because 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.910
 there are too many situations where 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.910
 he did not have not mastered 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.760
 yes, we are worried because we are 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.080
 within six days is the third 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.910
 of course that's the thing 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.740
 the freshness we will be back in today 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.209
 training to look closely 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.209
 make game form to look it would be 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.630
 fresh mode might be something 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.590
 something is not necessarily changing right now 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.660
 Immediately to do with the performance 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.450
 must have had a total significantly as 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.750
 team did not persuade 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.340
 but there are considerations 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.170
 as for this freshness and if he is 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.280
 maybe with two three 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.510
 maybe a change too 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.950
 can bring a little fresher 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.330
 but the field always, even if I 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.489
 I saw the games again yesterday 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.530
 was run times 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.090
 I can not say that today 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.690
 decide once again to look for it 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.300
 to get 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.300
 who is like who is like it 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.640
 Leipzig has seen plays football like 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.860
 few others play at a very fast pace 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.079
 with a lot of aggressiveness with a lot 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.140
 a lot of pressing in the game also very many 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.500
 easy fast balls forward 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.930
 ingolstadt he is different as well 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.200
 many other teams ingolstadt has 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.930
 strengthen forwards with with lex with 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.510
 Mathew Leckie also with Hinterseer Pascal 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.670
 only playing well is another 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.359
 football but still very much in their own way 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.900
 dangerously presented to the karlsruher sc 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.900
