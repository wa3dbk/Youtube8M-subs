absolutely brilliant now although this

absolutely brilliant now although this
door<00:00:40.379> may<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.620> fairly<00:00:40.920> comical<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.670> novelty

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
door may be fairly comical the novelty

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.459 
door may be fairly comical the novelty
of<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.239> might<00:00:42.450> wear<00:00:42.660> off<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.379> bit

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
of it might wear off just a little bit

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.779 
of it might wear off just a little bit
when<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.739> take<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> look<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.730> the

Redstone behind it so what I'm gonna do
is<00:00:46.440> remove<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.520> blocks<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> let's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
is remove all of these blocks and let's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.590 
is remove all of these blocks and let's
take<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> look<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> its<00:00:49.440> worry<00:00:49.739> bits

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
take a look at all of its worry bits

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
take a look at all of its worry bits
here<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.050> under<00:00:52.350> over<00:00:52.590> door<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
here is the under over door in all of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
here is the under over door in all of
his<00:00:53.460> glory<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.360> admit<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
his glory and I have to admit it is a

his glory and I have to admit it is a
little<00:00:55.649> bit<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> mess<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.550> tons<00:00:56.879> of

little bit of a mess there is tons of
stuff<00:00:57.090> occurring<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.899> fact<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.410> hit<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
stuff occurring in fact if we hit this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.080 
stuff occurring in fact if we hit this
button<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
button here you will see that there is

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.810 
button here you will see that there is
redstone<00:01:00.660> flashing<00:01:01.170> Pistons<00:01:01.920> extending<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
redstone flashing Pistons extending and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
redstone flashing Pistons extending and
retracting<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.019> happening<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.619> at

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
retracting and it's all happening all at

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.170 
retracting and it's all happening all at
once<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> run

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
once but one thing that I do want to run

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.910 
once but one thing that I do want to run
you<00:01:06.299> through<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> few<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> circuits

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you through is a few of the circuits

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.289 
you through is a few of the circuits
i've<00:01:08.130> used<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.580> build<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
i've used in this build that I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
i've used in this build that I
personally<00:01:09.990> think<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.740> interesting

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
personally think are really interesting

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
personally think are really interesting
so<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.360> we've<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so what we have here is we've got a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
so what we have here is we've got a
slime<00:01:13.080> block<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> extends<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
slime block and when it extends and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190 
slime block and when it extends and
retracts<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:15.119> actually<00:01:15.509> pulls<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.990> block

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
retracts it actually pulls this block

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
retracts it actually pulls this block
with<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.580> push<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
with it so what we do is we push that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
with it so what we do is we push that
block<00:01:18.240> back<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> its<00:01:18.780> original<00:01:18.900> position

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
block back to its original position

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
block back to its original position
using<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.490> piston<00:01:20.909> you'll<00:01:21.030> see<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.270> happen

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
using this piston you'll see it happen

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
using this piston you'll see it happen
it's<00:01:21.960> very<00:01:22.259> quick<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.799> might<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.310> able

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it's very quick so you might not be able

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.899 
it's very quick so you might not be able
to<00:01:23.580> catch<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.670> same

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
to catch it but there it was the same

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.399 
to catch it but there it was the same
thing<00:01:26.939> happens<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.659> side<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
thing happens on this side it just

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.749 
thing happens on this side it just
happens<00:01:28.740> vertically<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> hit<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
happens vertically so if you hit the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.340 
happens vertically so if you hit the
button<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.869> piston

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
button you will see that this piston

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
button you will see that this piston
over<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.770> gets<00:01:32.220> sucked<00:01:32.460> downward<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.210> there

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
over here gets sucked downward but there

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
over here gets sucked downward but there
is<00:01:33.479> also<00:01:33.750> pushed<00:01:34.020> back<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.380> by<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> piston

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
is also pushed back up by that piston

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.710 
is also pushed back up by that piston
down<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> bottom<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
down at the bottom so that it can

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
down at the bottom so that it can
recreate<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.350> trapdoor<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:38.250> another

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
recreate the trapdoor now another

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.249 
recreate the trapdoor now another
interesting<00:01:38.700> piece<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.479> circuitry<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.049> I'm

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
interesting piece of circuitry that I'm

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.780 
interesting piece of circuitry that I'm
sure<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.740> fairly<00:01:41.040> confused<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
sure you're all fairly confused about is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
sure you're all fairly confused about is
this<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.390> magic<00:01:42.990> button<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> button<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this little magic button the button is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
this little magic button the button is
floating<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:45.060> block<00:01:45.390> above<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> piston<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
floating one block above the piston and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
floating one block above the piston and
that<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.369> we've<00:01:47.579> got<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.970> redstone

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that is because we've got this redstone

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.030 
that is because we've got this redstone
clock<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.140> keeping<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> piston

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
clock here that is keeping that piston

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
clock here that is keeping that piston
up<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> date<00:01:50.579> checking<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.240> blocks<00:01:51.570> around<00:01:51.720> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
up to date checking for blocks around it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
up to date checking for blocks around it
other<00:01:52.079> powered<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.040> check<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.460> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
other powered and it will check for this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
other powered and it will check for this
block<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.110> button<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
block right here that when the button is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
block right here that when the button is
pressed<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.890> course<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.250> block<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.640> powered

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
pressed of course the block is powered

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.429 
pressed of course the block is powered
so<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> piston<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.110> extend

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so then the piston will extend

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.280 
so then the piston will extend
initiating<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> entire<00:01:59.880> circuit<00:02:00.420> really

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
initiating the entire circuit really

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.249 
initiating the entire circuit really
very<00:02:01.590> cool<00:02:01.890> stuff<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> start<00:02:03.930> things<00:02:04.079> off

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
very cool stuff so to start things off

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.069 
very cool stuff so to start things off
you<00:02:04.469> want<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.740> 5<00:02:05.040> by<00:02:05.310> 9<00:02:05.340> area<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.479> level<00:02:06.810> here

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
you want a 5 by 9 area this level here

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
you want a 5 by 9 area this level here

first thing that I would suggest doing

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.640 
first thing that I would suggest doing
is<00:02:13.020> Phi

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
is Phi

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.770

can be wooden it can be iron whichever
one<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.079> would<00:02:22.200> prefer<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.159> want

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
one you would prefer but then you want

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.949 
one you would prefer but then you want
to<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.519> couple<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:24.060> blocks<00:02:24.150> along<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.750> this

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
to go a couple of blocks along like this

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.289 
to go a couple of blocks along like this
and<00:02:25.019> two<00:02:25.709> blocks<00:02:25.950> up<00:02:26.129> like<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.489> placing<00:02:27.180> down

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
and two blocks up like that placing down

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.000 
and two blocks up like that placing down
your<00:02:27.510> button<00:02:27.840> then<00:02:28.140> take<00:02:28.379> down<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.769> block

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
your button then take down this block

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
your button then take down this block
and<00:02:29.250> place<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.939> sticky<00:02:30.299> piston<00:02:30.569> facing

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and place a sticky piston facing

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.410 
and place a sticky piston facing
downwards<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:31.890> cauldron<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:33.090> water

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
downwards with a cauldron and a water

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.360 
downwards with a cauldron and a water
bucket<00:02:33.689> on<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.109> inside<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.040> filled

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
bucket on the inside so it's a filled

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.399 
bucket on the inside so it's a filled
cauldron<00:02:35.939> that<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.540> very<00:02:36.810> important

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
cauldron that is very important

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.960 
cauldron that is very important
otherwise<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:38.010> comparator<00:02:38.519> won't<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.849> able

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
otherwise the comparator won't be able

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.610 
otherwise the comparator won't be able
to<00:02:39.090> take<00:02:39.269> an<00:02:39.390> output<00:02:39.689> so<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:40.319> what<00:02:40.439> we<00:02:40.500> have

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
to take an output so then what we have

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.289 
to take an output so then what we have
to<00:02:40.709> do<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.189> couple<00:02:41.519> more<00:02:41.819> blocks<00:02:41.939> down

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
to do is go a couple more blocks down

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.360 
to do is go a couple more blocks down
like<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.629> place<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.290> comparator<00:02:43.680> coming<00:02:44.250> out

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
like this place a comparator coming out

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.339 
like this place a comparator coming out
like<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> block<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:46.319> some

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
like that and then a block with some

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.970 
like that and then a block with some
redstone<00:02:46.980> dust<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.670> top<00:02:48.650> now<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.709> finish

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
redstone dust on the top now to finish

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.589 
redstone dust on the top now to finish
up<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.340> magic<00:02:50.609> button<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.970> want<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.180> place<00:02:51.420> a

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
up the magic button you want to place a

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.360 
up the magic button you want to place a
hopper<00:02:52.019> on<00:02:52.170> top<00:02:52.379> of<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.590> redstone<00:02:52.799> dust<00:02:53.159> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
hopper on top of that redstone dust a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.979

mana<00:04:22.229> stable<00:04:22.590> circuit<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.159> then<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.729> just

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
mana stable circuit and then you just

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.490 
mana stable circuit and then you just
want<00:04:24.029> to<00:04:24.120> place<00:04:24.240> another<00:04:24.599> repeater<00:04:24.990> sets<00:04:25.380> of

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
want to place another repeater sets of

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500 
want to place another repeater sets of
two<00:04:25.620> ticks<00:04:25.889> running<00:04:26.430> into<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.669> block<00:04:27.029> and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
two ticks running into a block and

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.000 
two ticks running into a block and
when<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.630> carry<00:04:27.870> out<00:04:27.960> these<00:04:28.200> blogs<00:04:28.500> all<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.920> way

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
when I carry out these blogs all the way

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.040 
when I carry out these blogs all the way
round<00:04:29.220> like<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.820> with<00:04:30.090> redstone<00:04:30.420> dust<00:04:30.720> just

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
round like this with redstone dust just

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
round like this with redstone dust just
there<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.440> then<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.070> repeater<00:04:32.400> set<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:33.030> three

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
there and then it repeater set to three

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.690 
there and then it repeater set to three
ticks<00:04:33.630> running<00:04:34.020> into<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.650> piston<00:04:35.190> right

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
ticks running into that piston right

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.340 
ticks running into that piston right
there<00:04:35.970> now<00:04:36.540> you<00:04:36.600> want<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.840> head<00:04:36.930> down<00:04:36.960> here

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
there now you want to head down here

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.200 
there now you want to head down here
place<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.890> couple<00:04:38.220> blocks<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.880> like<00:04:39.030> this

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
place a couple blocks just like this

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.510 
place a couple blocks just like this
with<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.660> repeater<00:04:40.080> no<00:04:40.620> ticks<00:04:40.890> on<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.160> one<00:04:41.340> and

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
with a repeater no ticks on that one and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.610 
with a repeater no ticks on that one and
redstone<00:04:42.270> dust<00:04:42.450> up<00:04:42.690> at<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.870> top<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.200> that

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
redstone dust up at the top and that

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.170 
redstone dust up at the top and that
will<00:04:43.740> create<00:04:43.890> your<00:04:44.190> little<00:04:44.370> slime<00:04:44.640> block<00:04:44.910> move

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
will create your little slime block move

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.490 
will create your little slime block move
in<00:04:45.330> action<00:04:45.660> so<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:45.930> hit<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.170> button<00:04:46.350> once

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
in action so if you hit the button once

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.200 
in action so if you hit the button once
again<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:47.100> will<00:04:47.190> see<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.640> is<00:04:47.820> how<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.090> all

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
again you will see this is how it all

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.800 
again you will see this is how it all
works<00:04:49.550> now<00:04:50.550> we're<00:04:50.820> going<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.120> start<00:04:51.360> work<00:04:51.600> on

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
works now we're going to start work on

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.300 
works now we're going to start work on
the<00:04:52.050> opposite<00:04:52.470> side<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:52.920> you<00:04:52.980> want<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.190> head

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the opposite side so you want to head

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.800 
the opposite side so you want to head
over<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.490> hoppers<00:04:53.910> right<00:04:54.240> next<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.540> this<00:04:54.630> half

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810

computer is a little bit on the laggy

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.660 
computer is a little bit on the laggy
side<00:06:49.080> then<00:06:49.620> you<00:06:49.740> might<00:06:49.920> want<00:06:50.100> to<00:06:50.160> change<00:06:50.370> this

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
side then you might want to change this

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.550 
side then you might want to change this
repeater<00:06:51.030> down<00:06:51.270> here<00:06:51.540> next<00:06:52.110> to<00:06:52.260> them<00:06:52.410> on<00:06:52.530> a

vertical slime block to two ticks that

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.680 
vertical slime block to two ticks that
will<00:06:56.490> mean<00:06:56.610> that<00:06:56.640> everything<00:06:57.180> runs<00:06:57.390> smoothly

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
will mean that everything runs smoothly

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.110 
will mean that everything runs smoothly
