00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.949
 so try to start the car at 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.949
 minus 4 pp 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.019
 to do this, just press 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.989
 killed by 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.599
 but the machine says it's not ready yet 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.810
 and what it takes some time to 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.040
 order to start running 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.410
 voice while we have some amount 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.410
 the time in which we are now just 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.620
 for the Sich or will be looking 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.450
 part how much she 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.510
 will start the whole thing we their 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.590
 naturally fix 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.200
 and documented 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.650
 panels again 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.239
 Of course, we have time 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.900
 temperature 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.280
 ambient air 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.350
 overboard 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.720
 in fact, the machine was all night 0 m 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.770
 and therefore 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.790
 I think that artek does not need some 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.690
 time to think 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.690
 check all functions both 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.730
 using the onboard computer and already 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.910
 whether she is able to run on the very 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.490
 Actually the battery is not discharged therefore 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.130
 will require some preparation 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 from my point of view 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.800
 once again explaining that we do everything strictly without 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
 instructions for one intuition 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.270
 car which 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.790
 must bring some benefit to them 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.780
 relaxation 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.350
 for its owner 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620
 continued 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.620
 obey not to master intuition 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.020
 must adapt to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.240
 him and should 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.400
 recall what 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.620
 an assistant 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.730
 here 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.600
 after some time I will try again 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.870
 start the engine
