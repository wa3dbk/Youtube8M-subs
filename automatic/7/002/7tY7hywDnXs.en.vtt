sit<00:02:58.079> on<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:58.319> exceed<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.859> now<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.669> in<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
sit on and exceed for now so in that

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.640 
sit on and exceed for now so in that
sense<00:03:00.389> it's<00:03:00.599> good<00:03:00.780> because<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.169> stops<00:03:01.379> them

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
sense it's good because it stops them

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.939 
sense it's good because it stops them
but<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.659> just<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.290> don't<00:03:04.650> think

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
but you know it's just I don't think

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.030 
but you know it's just I don't think
it's<00:03:05.250> as<00:03:05.430> good<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:06.060> said<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.389> was<00:03:06.510> very<00:03:07.019> good<00:03:07.290> but
