they stop sending videos in so I decided
to<00:01:54.219> convert<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.729> into<00:01:55.000> an<00:01:55.180> English<00:01:55.570> Channel

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
to convert that into an English Channel

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.389 
to convert that into an English Channel
and<00:01:56.170> that's<00:01:56.500> what<00:01:56.740> you're<00:01:56.950> looking<00:01:56.979> at<00:01:57.340> right

and that's what you're looking at right

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.600 
and that's what you're looking at right

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
now this used to be a Spanish

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.330 
now this used to be a Spanish
cooperation<00:02:01.539> channel<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:02.140> now<00:02:02.320> it's<00:02:02.649> English
