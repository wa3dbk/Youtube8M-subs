00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello everyone, we charge you today 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.469
 let's talk about the program cinema 4d studio 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.500
 namely how the character is textured from 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.580
 maynkavt on example Steve 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.539
 all download links you will find in 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.039
 description the first thing we need to do 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.570
 this open the workpiece 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:33.270
 we have a blank made of cubes 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.370
 which then serve to animate 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.700
 the pier of his character it will be with us as 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:45.989
 would be the design itself stella here it is with us 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.969
 we need to impose a texture like this 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.969
 do now we'll talk about it 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.260
 means 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.430
 first we need to create it select 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.360
 her from a client 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.420
 the most minecraft go to minecraft 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.060
 where you have it installed by default 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.830
 I think you know your user of data 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 roaming my maynkravt that is all as 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:21.360
 always open as usual with the archiver 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.780
 further here we go to the mob folder and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:32.190
 find the file 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:32.190
 tea is steve's texture unzip it 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.900
 it can be closed now open 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.680
 photoshop is more convenient for me and you 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.680
 I advise you to download 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.100
 open our file here it is 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:13.370
 as we see the image is small, why 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.900
 very much to increase we go in the image 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.270
 image size is visible here costs 64 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.340
 32 pixels 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.850
 We put here 384 and here Astana 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.580
 automatically put 192 is 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.420
 optimal size is required 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 we expose on the next pixels if we 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.390
 this will not do the whole image 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:53.330
 it will just be blurry here please 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:56.170
 Now we save in dzhee ji well 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.170
 let's call for example 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
 texture 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.120
 now you can close photoshop 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.629
 here we have the texture 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.210
 now we go again in blue we create a new one 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.000
 material 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:32.020
 go in it remove the gloss as he 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.430
 will look bad choose texture 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:42.540
 our click yes and here we choose without 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:48.280
 to make it all look clearer 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.959
 Now select all parts and transfer 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.630
 texture 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.060
 as we see the texture was transferred gently 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:01.260
 saying crooked to fix it 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:09.000
 we go and click here on this window and 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:10.120
 bp in edit so now choose 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.180
 polygonal 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:19.680
 selection and click here next 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.739
 next end 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.569
 shut down 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.690
 so have we see that texture 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.300
 changed but still well we need her 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.479
 adjust 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:44.870
 how do we do it we take pay 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:48.860
 head and direct this window 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.860
 where we need as we see this window 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.539
 does not match the size of the texture to 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.650
 right click to fix it 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:02.060
 free and scaling and already 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:08.360
 scale as we need well that is 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:11.659
 something like this and the rest is all for sure 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.550
 also we see that we have allocated a head 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.550
 and poke on the landfill 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:48.000
 and so with the rest also exactly left hand 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:48.000
 remove the polygon move 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:57.199
 It is the hand on hand or rather both hands 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:00.650
 they are the same ie this is the front 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:04.610
 part that is it 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.590
 and this and this texture 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.180
 inside 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:17.680
 more precisely inside and behind that is it will be 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:24.740
 here and it will be extremely inside well that is 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.780
 here we do the same 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.910
 with 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:32.960
 with everything else and what we have in the end 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:38.860
 It turns out now I will show you this we 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:42.280
 we close it turns out in the end 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.280
 something like this 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:56.510
 so he turned out ready steve in 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:07:00.200
 next lesson we'll talk about how 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.570
 same time to animate this character then 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.900
 there is how to make move and in general 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:11.230
 so he was plastic they were just 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:13.850
 somehow cardboard in general all 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:18.460
 subscribe comment and post 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.460
 likes were buried with you bye
