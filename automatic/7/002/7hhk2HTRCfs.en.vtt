 graphic charcot originally made to use drugs since 2001 a genius jury and 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.460
 unique is its concept of polarity 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.190
 different from other games of the genre 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.950
 here there are two types of projectiles the broker as it should white river with 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.080
 embroidery 1 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.870
 only ship consumers types of studies one of each color 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.950
 and can be spared 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.520
 sides at any time 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.160
 when I hear white is activated you are vulnerable to pure projects 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.730
 coast while those of the same color without regrets day to sound very 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.810
 Special 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.400
 their children also changed color according to the study exchange being the weapon 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.820
 more effective against white boys and vice versa as if 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.370
 the complexity of the formula 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 the player can still perform 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.119
 with goals eliminating three opponents in the same way in sequence 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.480
 The more rails and opponents you destroy the more chain points you 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.440
 stop 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.730
 taking into account timid frenzies held by the screen and the 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.970
 speed of action is almost impossible and only one of the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.970
 most criticized players will be able to perform 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 the mechanics are so solid that it does away with the traditional important items 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 left by enemies in common figures 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.420
 all elements of the game revolve around the concept of polarity 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.189
 enemies paychecks battles and even think in many parts the formula 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.439
 is so well explored that the player is constantly obliged to change the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.230
 strategic information study to survive little for sarney sines 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.900
 to survive is something by the round sunita 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.160
 only the difficulty is so frighteningly high I asked for two 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.260
 or you will become frustrated and give up function past the early stages 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.050
 even playing on the lower difficulty level with you will feel pressured to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.890
 continue to play repeatedly until you gain enough skill to reach 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.049
 at end 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.930
 although the game has only five phases that can be determined in 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.870
 about half an hour you need to play for a few hours 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.870
 despite acting with the concept of polarity 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.330
 it is the necessary skill 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
 to meet the challenges and leaders you will face 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.609
 it's curious to note 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.060
 Ricardo is required as much or more quick reflexes 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.029
 ability and concentration 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.259
 In a puzzle today race game 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:52.949
 although the game is basically identical to the original some new functions 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.609
 were implemented 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.919
 like scoring tables on enem 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:02.339
 or pressure to record and 3 may be available for download a mode 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.570
 cooperative for two players 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.980
 and even photos slides or even on location day 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.179
 do not appear to be as old as 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:13.390
 thanks to its polluted look 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.260
 a spectacle for the time of its flawless presentation launch 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.699
 everything was done very fondly 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.339
 in this visual effects the presentation screens of the phases until the 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.389
 modeling of wonders 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.359
 until the sound effects overflowing style 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.129
 with a robotic voice that announces the number of purchases for example 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.650
 the songs accompany perfectly fast action of the game with compositions 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:59.579
 exciting and appropriate for each scenario that it takes to become 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.400
 that which surrounds it is that type of game that conquers by the challenge 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:05.579
 provided 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.949
 I am mechanic is based on so solid and unique popularity 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.139
 which sets it apart from any other game of the genre requiring reflexes 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.979
 and controls skills 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.690
 it's not a game for everyone 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.900
 because the high difficulty may deter the most impatient players 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.289
 yet intense moments and striking battles with pension all the effort 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.660
 made by the player
