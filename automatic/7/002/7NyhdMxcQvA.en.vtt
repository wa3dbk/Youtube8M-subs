00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.740
 more to my channel and today 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.740
 This man named Diego Perez 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.490
 Perez GascÃ³n but on Youtube on a channel 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.750
 and it's called diego olate so all the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.010
 world is going to see it right now because 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.010
 well when I finish this day 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.349
 in their video we are going to talk 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.360
 about our experience with 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.610
 tattoos but the guys do not have a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.190
 real tattoo and let's talk about 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.949
 our experience with the ink box brand 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.870
 which is a brand that makes tattoos and 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.239
 I'll explain a little bit of what's going 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.620
 This brand is marking what it does 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.909
 make tattoos that is kind of 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 henna that are organic tattoos and last 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.260
 two weeks three 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460
 and well, we are going to tell you each one 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.949
 our experience because both the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.500
 we've used and well, well, that's what I'm going to 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.869
 give the advice to do what how much 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.020
 It takes everything that is going to serve you 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.880
 In case you want to do it, I chose 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.950
 two because I've collaborated with them and I 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.420
 have let two choose him however he 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.630
 bought one because he has bought it and has 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.270
 paid everything and well then I the first 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 case I chose this palm tree that surely 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 If you do not follow on instagram and ye 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.330
 seen and I have it in my arm here that does not 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.940
 that you will be watching but now I put 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.909
 a tuna and well it is here is a 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.590
 normal palm tree and then that and the second 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.640
 thing that I shrugged off was the skyline of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.810
 new york that now I tell you the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.210
 story that happened to this because 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.289
 Mother of the Lord, good thing is that to me 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.659
 directly I have erased the 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.390
 experience for this brand I have been 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.479
 very sad but basically they are the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.459
 signs of play pause not as it is called 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.740
 the square one and those to pass 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.959
 songs that good yes the typical thing that 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.700
 put people here and I'll tell you my 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.640
 experience is worth the application the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.620
 application then it comes to you 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.010
 little bottle that is what the ink would be 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.710
 that comes a glove with which I have 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.530
 had a serious problem and is that the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.170
 application then you have to catch this 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.700
 which is a sticker template and what 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.730
 you put on the area where you want it 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.010
 use then apply the ink over 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.010
 and you have to wait two hours 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.370
 the glove is supposed to be for something 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.680
 but when I had to use it, I did not 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.130
 use the juice half smoked that patch are 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.810
 very strongly that I recommend that if 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.840
 you do it please put on your glove 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.640
 because it has ended up badly damaged 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.260
 my problem because na less endurance and you 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.560
 when you are is the ink and you the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.510
 you remove at the beginning you do not see anything or the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.000
 ink alarms by pressing with the hours the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.370
 skin then what are they being 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.470
 I have whole hands full of 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.960
 ink that will not leave me until I give the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.430
 two months the whole gut I have full 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.100
 of ink because by making me the east of 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.900
 skyline, the ink ran off 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.630
 there and I clear I also naive of me 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.450
 I wiped it clean 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.640
 hours I started going out there a little bit 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.280
 everything and here, of course, to see the first 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.990
 advice I give is that the little boat is 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.700
 small but it has a lot of ink inside 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.280
 then I think that after I put the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.840
 sticker and I said goes of market says but 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.210
 I will talk about saving ink always 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.640
 because spending more time and the tattoo does not 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.050
 it lasts longer but it has not been like that because it's 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.120
 that already practically there will be reviewed two 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.430
 times and that is not even seen because delivery 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.660
 the chlorine or against chlorine is fatal 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.660
 in summer I do not recommend 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.340
 is that the man this one had read us in 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.660
 internet when you go to use or be 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.819
 if you want to swim in the pool or 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.340
 anything before you have to throw 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.100
 on the Vaseline surface because that 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.319
 it's going to be comfortable waterproof and you can 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.110
 I have bathed and bathed nothing has happened 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.810
 but this man was extruding me 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.850
 I 6 the garlic and instead of catching 18 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.430
 methodological plants here for all the 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.400
 life directly I buy this for 12 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.810
 dollars I think it cost mine and so already 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.050
 it's okay send more I think it's not very 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.050
 expensive 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.069
 and then that we recommend a lot 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.440
 we were both very foolish to jump 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.239
 some of the steps so on over 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.620
 the box that has all the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.970
 instructions which the others the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.860
 you have to read several times because 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.360
 we did not do it and that's how it came out 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.620
 bad and good girls up here the video 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.360

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.870
 see you this Sunday with a video 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.009
 special that will be very good and therefore 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.169

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.749
