00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
how's it going falls in this video we'll

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.430 
how's it going falls in this video we'll
be<00:00:02.669> taking<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.179> look<00:00:03.240> at<00:00:03.389> four<00:00:03.629> lengths<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.259> on

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
be taking a look at four lengths to on

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.369 
be taking a look at four lengths to on
the<00:00:04.560> gtx<00:00:05.009> 650ti<00:00:05.580> let's<00:00:06.210> go<00:00:06.420> straight<00:00:06.870> into<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
the gtx 650ti let's go straight into the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.700 
the gtx 650ti let's go straight into the
options<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.550> video<00:00:09.540> settings<00:00:09.990> unfortunately

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
options and video settings unfortunately

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350 
options and video settings unfortunately
for<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.040> reason<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.519> doesn't<00:00:11.969> say<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
for some reason it doesn't say the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.839 
for some reason it doesn't say the
resolution<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.049> here<00:00:13.469> oh<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.700> go<00:00:14.790> on

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
resolution on here oh you just go on

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.689 
resolution on here oh you just go on
here<00:00:15.059> okay<00:00:15.650> resolutions<00:00:16.650> out<00:00:16.770> there<00:00:16.949> 1920<00:00:17.580> x

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
here okay resolutions out there 1920 x

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.849 
here okay resolutions out there 1920 x
1080<00:00:17.880> for<00:00:18.869> some<00:00:18.990> reason<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.289> couldn't<00:00:19.350> find<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
1080 for some reason I couldn't find the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.620 
1080 for some reason I couldn't find the
resolution<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.789> guess<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
resolution but I guess you just have to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.290 
resolution but I guess you just have to
click<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.199> find<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.850> as<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.180> see

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
click that to find it as you can see

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.540 
click that to find it as you can see
this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> 650<00:00:25.199> Ti<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.650> can't<00:00:25.980> set<00:00:26.340> all

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
this is on the 650 Ti so I can't set all

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.359 
this is on the 650 Ti so I can't set all
the<00:00:26.849> things<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> highest<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:29.220> only

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the things to the highest the only

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.650 
the things to the highest the only
things<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.699> actually<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.240> been<00:00:30.269> lowered

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
things that actually have been lowered

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.060 
things that actually have been lowered
was<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> anti<00:00:31.199> stropping<00:00:31.529> filter<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
was the anti stropping filter and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.729 
was the anti stropping filter and
physics<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.790> low<00:00:33.030> um<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.320> hard<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
physics is on low um it's really hard to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.850 
physics is on low um it's really hard to
run<00:00:34.860> physics<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.730> uh<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:36.329> our<00:00:37.140> budget<00:00:37.469> card

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
run physics and uh on our budget card

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.830 
run physics and uh on our budget card
like<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> run<00:00:39.420> physics

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
like this so if you want to run physics

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.030 
like this so if you want to run physics
you're<00:00:40.170> better<00:00:40.410> off<00:00:40.469> getting<00:00:40.739> something

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
you're better off getting something

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360 
you're better off getting something
higher<00:00:41.309> end<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.850> yeah<00:00:42.800> let's<00:00:43.800> go<00:00:44.070> straight

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
higher end but yeah let's go straight

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
higher end but yeah let's go straight
into<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> gameplay<00:00:50.449> destroy<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.690> thing

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
into the gameplay destroy that thing

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.590 
into the gameplay destroy that thing
right<00:00:52.170> there

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.240 

right<00:00:56.600> now<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.840> frame<00:00:57.170> rates<00:00:57.410> dipping<00:00:58.100> to

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
right now the frame rates dipping to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.020 
right now the frame rates dipping to
about<00:00:58.520> 29<00:00:59.290> not<00:01:00.290> that<00:01:00.860> I<00:01:01.190> don't<00:01:01.400> like<00:01:01.580> get<00:01:01.850> that

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
about 29 not that I don't like get that

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.610 
about 29 not that I don't like get that
low<00:01:02.330> but<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:02.720> know<00:01:02.780> some<00:01:03.140> people<00:01:03.170> are<00:01:03.470> fun<00:01:05.620> 1080p

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
low but I know some people are fun 1080p

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.990 
low but I know some people are fun 1080p
is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.219 

16

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.139 

Oh

d

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:05.050 

back<00:01:52.320> down<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:52.820> probably<00:01:53.820> take<00:01:54.060> down

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.710 

down<00:02:05.659> again<00:02:06.079> not<00:02:06.590> going<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:07.040> hot

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
down again not going to hot

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.230 
down again not going to hot
I<00:02:08.810> can't<00:02:09.560> get<00:02:09.710> any<00:02:09.860> second

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.110 

Oh

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.980 

Oh<00:02:19.150> frame<00:02:20.140> rate<00:02:20.349> is<00:02:20.500> about<00:02:20.739> 30

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.250 

without<00:02:28.990> props<00:02:29.290> turn<00:02:29.650> active

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.810 

so<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> actual<00:02:36.530> frame<00:02:36.980> rate<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:37.520> while

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
so the actual frame rate you can while

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.970 
so the actual frame rate you can while
reporting<00:02:38.630> Khadijah<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.290> little<00:02:39.680> bit<00:02:39.800> higher

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
reporting Khadijah a little bit higher

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.500 
reporting Khadijah a little bit higher
about<00:02:40.360> nine

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.760
