00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
mass with this gun i recommend aiming

damage hitting to the body but you're

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.960 
damage hitting to the body but you're
also<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.430> increase<00:01:38.759> for

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
also going to have that increase for

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
also going to have that increase for

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
biggest calls for why this gun is just

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.280 
biggest calls for why this gun is just
not<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> mainstream<00:02:41.580> weapon<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.690> people<00:02:43.020> use

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
not a mainstream weapon that people use

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.980 
not a mainstream weapon that people use

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
of range but if you were just a little

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.290 
of range but if you were just a little
bit<00:03:46.620> closer<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.550> would<00:03:47.670> have<00:03:47.820> killed<00:03:48.030> him<00:03:48.180> at

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
least damaged him you have a little bit

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.060

more<00:03:51.270> leeway<00:03:51.510> with<00:03:51.990> this<00:03:52.200> gun<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.710> that's<00:03:52.860> why

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
more leeway with this gun and that's why

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.470 
more leeway with this gun and that's why
i<00:03:53.100> think<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.610> definitely<00:03:53.880> worth<00:03:54.210> you<00:03:54.450> know

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
i think it's definitely worth you know

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.820 
i think it's definitely worth you know
pulling<00:03:54.750> out<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.990> your<00:03:55.080> vault<00:03:55.290> leveling<00:03:55.710> up

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
and using because it is in my opinion

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.350 
and using because it is in my opinion
much<00:03:58.500> better<00:03:58.830> than<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.580> fel<00:03:59.760> winners<00:04:00.060> but

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
much better than the fel winners but

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.450 
much better than the fel winners but
again<00:04:01.020> it's<00:04:01.260> personal<00:04:01.680> preference<00:04:01.920> once<00:04:02.370> you
