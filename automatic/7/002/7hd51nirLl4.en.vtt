00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
inserts so the way of doing it pretty

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.200 
inserts so the way of doing it pretty
much<00:00:19.740> what's<00:00:20.039> holding<00:00:20.369> edge<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.910> switch

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
much what's holding edge is this switch

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.599 
much what's holding edge is this switch
right<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.769> ran<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:26.430> take

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
right here ran out on here and to take

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.230 
right here ran out on here and to take
it<00:00:26.760> off<00:00:26.880> pretty<00:00:27.240> much<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:29.099> lock<00:00:29.970> button

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it off pretty much as a lock button

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.069 
it off pretty much as a lock button
where<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.630> says<00:00:30.720> our<00:00:31.019> deadlock<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> it's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
where it says our deadlock so it's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.860 
where it says our deadlock so it's
locked<00:00:34.469> when<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.250> pushed<00:00:35.489> down<00:00:35.719> but<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
locked when it's pushed down but to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.130 
locked when it's pushed down but to
unlock<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.680> push<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:39.140> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
unlock it you push up and then the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.790 
unlock it you push up and then the
insert<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.660> wiper<00:00:42.660> blade<00:00:42.870> things<00:00:43.350> just

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I'm locking it into place the one in the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.240 
I'm locking it into place the one in the
back<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.850> back<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.130> up

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
back the one back here and the one up

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:33.550 
back the one back here and the one up
here<00:01:26.600> places<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:29.360> up<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:32.310> locks<00:01:32.549> in

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
here places and up here it locks in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.170 
here places and up here it locks in
another<00:01:34.560> way<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> find<00:01:35.310> out<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.820> aligned

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
another way to find out if it's aligned

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.140 
another way to find out if it's aligned
perfectly<00:01:37.009> it's<00:01:38.009> pretty<00:01:38.340> much<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.850> edge

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
perfectly it's pretty much this edge

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
perfectly it's pretty much this edge
right<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> where<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.680> catches

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
right here so this is where it catches

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.219 
right here so this is where it catches
on<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.670> locks<00:01:41.939> onto<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.479> right<00:01:43.079> here

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
on here it locks onto this right here

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.370 
on here it locks onto this right here
and<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:44.579> metal<00:01:44.820> pleat<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.390> metal<00:01:46.140> piece

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and this metal pleat the metal piece

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.520 
and this metal pleat the metal piece
we're<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> um<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.259> line<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.439> up

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
we're going to have to um I line it up

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
we're going to have to um I line it up
with<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.210> that's<00:01:51.450> let's

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
them but I found that you can do it a

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.219 
them but I found that you can do it a
cheaper<00:04:43.220> way<00:04:43.340> by<00:04:44.120> buying<00:04:44.389> these<00:04:44.630> inserts

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229
