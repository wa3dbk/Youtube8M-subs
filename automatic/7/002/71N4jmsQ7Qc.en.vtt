going<00:02:00.410> to<00:02:00.500> be<00:02:00.590> critical<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.490> future<00:02:01.700> not

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
going to be critical to the future not

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.090 
going to be critical to the future not
just<00:02:02.180> cancer<00:02:02.660> research<00:02:03.080> but<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.500> applying<00:02:03.860> it

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
just cancer research but to applying it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.980 
just cancer research but to applying it
to<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.340> care<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.910> particular<00:02:05.210> patient

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
to the care of that particular patient

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.830 
to the care of that particular patient
so<00:02:06.380> we<00:02:06.770> set<00:02:07.010> up<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.400> program<00:02:07.760> that<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:08.510> can<00:02:08.690> now

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so we set up a program that we can now

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.750 
so we set up a program that we can now
offer<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.470> every<00:02:09.649> patient<00:02:09.830> coming<00:02:10.250> into<00:02:10.670> the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
offer to every patient coming into the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.910 
offer to every patient coming into the
dana-farber<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.870> have<00:02:12.080> their<00:02:12.380> tumors

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920

and we can do it now that's the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.070 
and we can do it now that's the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
difference is we know what to do with

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.980 
difference is we know what to do with
just<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.410> matter<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.680> doing<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.990> our

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
just a matter of doing it our

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.230 
just a matter of doing it our
