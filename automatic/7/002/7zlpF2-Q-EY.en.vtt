00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.470

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.100
 neither me nor a star on the flag of 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.690
 Brazil 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 Yeda has something funny right? 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.600
 written on the flag is this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.850
 will anyone be able to explain the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 tragedy in the river to pre-know more about 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.990
 with you all great 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.550
 Do you know what the flags are for? 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.729
 the flags 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.040
 I do not know, so I know that 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.159
 state flag nÃ© has flag of the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.450
 the country's football team also in 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 same team 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.180
 in fact the flags are symbols 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.700
 these symbols represent many nations 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.100
 times states and even entities 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.259
 I do not know if you have already repaired but every 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.920
 flag has a characteristic 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.979
 different from the other 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.450
 even because they chose these things for 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.869
 the brazilian flag 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 good green represents the max marks already 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.310
 We have lots of green space in our country. 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.700
 yellow was chosen by our 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.910
 mineral riches such as or already 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.710
 blue represents sky and white brings 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.350

 the stars represent the states of 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.870
 Brazil and also the federal district 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.799
 currently we have 27 stars in our 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.320
 flag 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.470
 if one day we have a new state 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.209
 flag will win another star 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.459
