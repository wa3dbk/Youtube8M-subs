a latest models show that perhaps South

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
a latest models show that perhaps South

Korea may have a little bit of a part to
play<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.390> storm<00:00:54.690> lee<00:00:54.840> seems

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
play in this as well the storm lee seems

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
play in this as well the storm lee seems
to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.190> further<00:00:56.489> towards

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to be going a little bit further towards

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610

the Northeast with every passing model
run<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.699> there's<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> storm<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.570> now

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
run but there's a storm right now

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.549

as<00:01:06.150> well<00:01:06.299> they'll<00:01:06.810> probably<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.320> perverts

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
as well they'll probably want perverts

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.039 
as well they'll probably want perverts
probably<00:01:08.670> won't<00:01:08.760> cause<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.540> trouble

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
probably won't cause too much of trouble

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.010 
probably won't cause too much of trouble
over<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:11.030> very<00:01:12.030> warm<00:01:12.270> waters<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> course

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
over there very warm waters of course

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.359 
over there very warm waters of course
and<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> continue<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> way

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and that's going to continue all the way

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910 
and that's going to continue all the way
up<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> Japanese<00:01:15.299> islands<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.170> 30<00:01:16.530> degrees

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
up to the Japanese islands to 30 degrees

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.390 
up to the Japanese islands to 30 degrees
or<00:01:17.189> higher<00:01:17.960> 31<00:01:18.960> degrees<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:19.890> areas<00:01:19.920> as

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
or higher 31 degrees in some areas as

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.580 
or higher 31 degrees in some areas as
well<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> model<00:01:22.140> say<00:01:22.380> right

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
well this is what the model say right

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
well this is what the model say right
now<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> CMC<00:01:23.520> takes<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.360> west<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
now then the CMC takes it just west of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
now then the CMC takes it just west of
Okinawa<00:01:25.799> Island<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.790> another

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
Okinawa Island and we also have another

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
Okinawa Island and we also have another
typhoon<00:01:27.330> forming<00:01:27.780> after<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.380> near<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
typhoon forming after that near the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.700 
typhoon forming after that near the
northern<00:01:29.159> mariana<00:01:29.729> islands<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:31.020> CMC<00:01:31.439> takes

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
northern mariana islands the CMC takes

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
northern mariana islands the CMC takes
it<00:01:31.829> into<00:01:31.950> Japan<00:01:32.310> through<00:01:32.549> Kyushu<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.030> then

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it into Japan through Kyushu and then

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.260 
it into Japan through Kyushu and then
obviously<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> big<00:01:34.110> island<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.500> Honshu<00:01:35.270> still

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
obviously the big island of Honshu still

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.719 
obviously the big island of Honshu still
as<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> typhoon<00:01:36.930> I'd<00:01:37.110> imagine<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.950> GFS<00:01:38.430> takes

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
as a typhoon I'd imagine the GFS takes

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.039 
as a typhoon I'd imagine the GFS takes
it<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> little<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.270> further<00:01:39.450> towards<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> west

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it a little bit further towards the west

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.039 
it a little bit further towards the west
if<00:01:40.290> i'm<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.530> mistaken<00:01:41.360> through<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.570> Myakka

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
if i'm not mistaken through the Myakka

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.660 
if i'm not mistaken through the Myakka
and<00:01:43.170> yama<00:01:43.439> islands<00:01:43.860> further<00:01:44.100> towards<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and yama islands further towards the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
west in between Okinawa and Taiwan and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280 
west in between Okinawa and Taiwan and
then<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.820> bit<00:01:48.119> further<00:01:48.390> towards<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> north<00:01:49.079> not

then a bit further towards the north not

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.139 
then a bit further towards the north not
too<00:01:49.470> far<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> korean<00:01:50.250> island<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.729> Jeju
