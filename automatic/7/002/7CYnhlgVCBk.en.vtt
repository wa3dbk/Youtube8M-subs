00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.670
 on the starting grid on pole mattia 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.700
 cassani 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.329
 I will have 198 luca oppedisano pilot 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.180
 Genoese of the kawasaki 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.590
 here he is and then the mountains polita cordial 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 numbers 25 511 and 94 but has already shut down 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.120
 red light 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.820
 let's go see the start looked good 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.280
 however, the departure of tatasciore seems 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 we then had an uncertainty we see 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.010
 if he can go to close in front of 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.239
 all to San Donato 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.900
 I will have to go and cut in the margin a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.090
 big margin big date maneuver 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.460
 shola and those who pay because they earn 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.070
 immediately a few meters and then however the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:20.020
 second crazy but new mom kiss 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.420
 what happened to me Lorenzo had left 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.900
 great and can be cold tires 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.030
 dared to find, however, it is hard to say 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.310
 race used too much in the race as I say 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.710
 first are only 11 laps 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.659
 maybe not even a little and heroes right 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.790
 maybe you will also read galvanized and the 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:42.220
 I think it's more than good 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.850
 other the gas immediately immediately mounts commands 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.880
 operations but fails to stretch 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.100
 he can't take the edge of her 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.149
 cassani 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.909
 now that he is following him closely he is still 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.070
 benini but I can change everything from one 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.009
 at another moment we see now i 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.929
 passes on the finish line let's see 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.170
 also the chronometric references 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.119
 Lorenzo can surely be 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.580
 indicative in this case and it is cassani 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.700
 mattia cassani 298 went to 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.849
 spread out and crushed in a sandwich 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.010
 monti has never had a quick tour 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.750
 he's coming up too he looks at who 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.780
 detached that almost manages to 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.140
 maintaining the first position indeed ce 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.140
 He has reported immediately 1 59 0 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:49.260
 more attention a slip 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.260
 maybe loads your ass 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.050
 this and nicolas annoys that continues 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.420
 now the last round has passed 1 59 6 ma 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:33.240
 with more than four seconds of advantage 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:37.160
 kevin hearty inside this beautiful 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.709
 lorenza lasavelli get very hot 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.120
 hair on the stomach because we are in 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.780
 tv i know and abundance almost yes 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.110
 touch 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.000
 oppedisano obviously shakes a little yes 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.680
 shakes a little his kawasaki the rest is 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.020
 own limit must also stand said 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.810
 because he took a few meters warm 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.040
 behind and I think the number 19 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.489
 czech the number 53 of the Moroccan number 198 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.510
 cassani 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.960
 grand finale for the Cassani podium inside 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.600
 Cassani behind to take the look 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.660
 the position to return to tussle for 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.080
 the podium last meters of race now 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.870
 nicolas annoys great great trial 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.670
 for us it is preparing to seize this 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.830
 deserved success but we are 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.290
 concentrate on the sprint for the second 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.470
 place kevin warm here it is number here 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.780
 94 to the last point remember for 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.200
 launch on the final sprint to some 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.900
 margin then nicolas anger and on 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.490
 slot 600 really look at those who flew 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.350
 oppedisano and cassani 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.640
 oppedisano and cassano harpist nuns e 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:51.900
 fear how the flag takes you home 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.900
 corrent the wing almost to tear
