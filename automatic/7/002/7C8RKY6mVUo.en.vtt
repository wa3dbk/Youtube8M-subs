I'm<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.380> quite<00:00:31.800> sure<00:00:32.189> how<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.030> topic

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450

it's definitely different from the
others<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.670> guess<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> best<00:00:36.210> place<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
these reasons are valid and do make

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.830 
these reasons are valid and do make

like<00:03:04.970> before<00:03:05.359> I<00:03:05.540> do<00:03:05.629> think<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.049> some<00:03:06.409> of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
like before I do think that some of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.990 
like before I do think that some of
these<00:03:06.530> reasons<00:03:06.739> are<00:03:07.010> good<00:03:07.159> and<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.700> agree<00:03:07.940> at

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
these reasons are good and I agree at

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.490 
these reasons are good and I agree at
them<00:03:08.180> but<00:03:08.659> others<00:03:08.930> are<00:03:09.079> just<00:03:09.200> personal

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
them but others are just personal

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.729 
them but others are just personal
preference<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.140> there<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.319> definitive

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739
