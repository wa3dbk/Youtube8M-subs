00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.050
 the control and we are in the second video 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.730
 of draw every month and good is 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 basically this video with these videos 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.770
 consists of English every day 16 after 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.630
 that they pay me on day 15 what 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.630
 I do is draw a game and good 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 gta 5 that just came out I do not know for me 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.300
 it's a very good idea to draw it for 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.830
 people who do not have the possibility of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.190
 buy it seems a very good idea 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.049
 but that something does not work or something because 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.580
 do not try your luck buying the premium 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:02.309

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.430

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.390
 I wanted to inform you and that's the raffle
