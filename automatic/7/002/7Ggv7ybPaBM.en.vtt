00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.669
 geek inspector 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.560
 ok I remind you that this is one more of 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 the videos that I do talking about the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 current cartoons of which I gave my 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.189
 opinion in a previous video rabbit and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.080
 fowles is without a doubt the caricature with more 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.180
 class that I've seen in many years 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.730
 launched by any chain of 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.669
 television and without a doubt the best thing that I've 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.500
 seen from disney in a long time is a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.450
 caricature that makes me remember the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.450
 feeling of the 90's cartoons 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.610
 of disney but nothing feels old 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 but rather it feels like a 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.290
 Timeless caricature is a series that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.140
 I'm sure he will not grow old in 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.810
 many years and this is because without a doubt the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.960
 writing the plot the performance of 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.239
 dubbing the animation itself all 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.610
 absolutely everything it contains 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.770
 gravity falls is synonymous with maximum 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.140
 quality for those who do not know it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.000
 rabbit and fox is a caricature based on 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.950
 12-year-old brothers who are 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.530
 sent to spend the summer with his uncle 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.570
 grandfather to gravity fold a place where 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.329
 inhabit countless mysteries of the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.399
 which very few people have a notion but 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.840
 deeper one of these brothers is 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.520
 convinced in discover 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.799
 and all the mysteries that inhabit the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 and that's how the story goes 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.000
 from chapter to chapter a detail 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.520
 curious thing that happens in this caricature is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 the uncle is so the owner of a 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.750
 business of fake attractions and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.610
 creatures invented by himself without 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.709
 realize that it is actually 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.770
 surrounded by mysteries and creatures that yes 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:43.289
 exist which dipper is decided 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.539
 to reveal the gravity fall has everything 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.459
 that I like in a caricature has a 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.679
 structure in which each episode is 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.810
 can enjoy on its own but at 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.569
 all time they all carry a plot 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.030
 sequential in which you are interested 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.280
 this alone separates it from the rest of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.020
 the cartoons is very difficult that a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.479
 caricature I managed to combine these two 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.149
 mechanical being that commonly the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.640
 chapter is self contained or follows a 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.979
 General plot for me is very difficult 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.069
 talk about this series because seriously not 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.410
 there is one thing that does not do well to stop me 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.209
 to talk about doing well gravity falls 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.700
 unlike the other cartoons 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.830
 would be to describe you part by 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.200
 part of the complete series and what 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.380
 It 's better that you see it so that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.600
 you think the animation is superb and it shows 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.360
 the love placed in each scene 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.790
 magnificent scenarios the performance of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.530
 voices is great is another caricature that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.690
 he has only seen in English since I 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.420
 satisfies in every way the voices of 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.980
 the characters in their original language the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.950
 script of the episodes is 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.770
 tremendously well thought I have not seen 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.440
 no chapter absolutely no 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.750
 simple episode in the whole series that 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.720
 feel that they did not take their time to 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.610
 write and express calmly each one 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.490
 of the points they wanted to highlight in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.100
 your episodes honestly I do not know what else 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.350
 say or continue because my review of this 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.600
 series would simply be limited to being 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.060
 giving applause to each scene that appears 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.400
 on the screen so I'm going to point out the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.440
 details that I like and already in 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.720
 first place I love the balance that 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.970
 has each episode is a mixture of 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.430
 all a little and that not everyone what 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.400
 can do each chapter has its dose 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.160
 of ridiculez your dose of drama your dose 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.230
 laughing its dose of seriousness and purpose 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.660
 and they always end up with a valuable 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.420
 final choice that rounds to 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.190
 second full chapter 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.680
 may bowles is one of the characters 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.190
 most beautiful female I've seen in 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.650
 my life 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.050
 this character win your heart from 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.270
 the first episode and it 's such a girl 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.700
 restless and so great that every time 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.220
 you see on screen you can not help but smile 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.560
 and that it becomes your favorite character of 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.780
 the series in third place I like the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.880
 general madness of the series every time the 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.040
 series goes to strange places in 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.290
 you truly feel rewarded with a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.460
 great dose of creativity that you have to 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.650
 see to believe 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.510
 fourth I like the sentimental 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.060
 that you can get to put the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.860
 episodes seriously once you get 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.440
 you enter the characters of this series 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.440
 they come to mind and in each episode 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.900
 you are in the mental state that are the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.270
 characters if they are sad you 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.820
 you are sad if they are happy or 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.460
 doing stupid things you accompany them with 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.470
 that humor in a nutshell the script and 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.540
 the writing are so digestible that 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.430
 anyone enters the state 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.620
 mental that the series proposes 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.130
 in fifth place I think it's a series 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.130
 very smart especially in his humor 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.840
 nothing very urgent 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.020
 Clear 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.020
 for me 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.120
 and you already know how to criticize situations 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.700
 when you have the opportunity or 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.910
 the life of each person and it shows in 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.560
 each episode in sixth place the tone 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.960
 dark to which the series arrives in 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.150
 Sometimes I am surprised especially 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.639
 disney pepper really the 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.130
 I consider a very brave caricature in 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.010
 present countless episodes that 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.800
 commonly Disney would have censored the 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.590
 which in general surround attitudes 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.960
 of the uncle are but a round of applause 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.930
 that battle and emerge victorious to 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.660
 creators in seventh place is full of 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.510
 hidden details every episode that 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.880
 you see you only realize 70% of the 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.710
 things that happen in it usually 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.600
 has countless things very 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.190
 smart you have to 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.530
 pay attention or be well 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.200
 documented to understand but still 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.360
 there are countless riddles and things 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.389
 hidden on purpose so that you 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.340
 start making guesses in eighth 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.350
 place i like the subtlety 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.960
 and how natural the characters are 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.970
 they express this series is so full of 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.070
 small memorable or funny moments 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.500
 that I would not be surprised to see one day the 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.110
 complete series in youtube divided alone 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.030
 in funny scenes the 20 episodes 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.030
 who has this series feel with 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.550
 much more content than 50 episodes of 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.340
 other cartoons that tells you about 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.949
 effectiveness and lastly they gave me 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.080
 a very personal taste when inviting a 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.600
 of my favorite stars in the world 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.060
 of videogames to paul roberts are 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.310
 who the artist behind the game of 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.200
 scott pilgrim versus the world at the same 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.930
 time than the king of power animation 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.750
 one billion that is my favorite and 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.090
 that I previously put in some videos is 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.160
 a silly detail maybe but I eat 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.590
 fan of video games and this 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.410
 sir without a doubt I saw it as a 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.419
 tremendous good gift in general those 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.880
 are my reasons to recommend this 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:02.220
 series I do not say that because everything does 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.100
 You have to like it, but without doubt 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.620
 some quality is what is left over from this 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.639
 series and if you are looking for something well done before 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.249
 than nothing 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.900
 you have loses with gravity falls is a 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:15.090
 cartoon with too much class 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.330
 comparing it to the rest of the cartoons 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.400
 current is a caricature that undoubtedly 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.439
 any one deserves to be seen by any 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.020
 lover of caricatures at the same 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:28.169
 time that would deserve to have a big 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.960
 much bigger fan base in 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.879
 place that currently counts only 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.159
 with seeing so tremendous and memorable 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:37.939
 introduction you realize you're 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:40.939
 before a series of great and undoubted 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:40.939
 quality
