want your credits to be over is still
image<00:00:18.660> or<00:00:18.930> over<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:19.980> existing<00:00:20.609> clip<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.210> your

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
image or over an existing clip in your

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.540

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
project so you first want to estimate

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.550 
project so you first want to estimate
roughly<00:00:24.060> how<00:00:24.359> long<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.689> want<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.080> parts<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
roughly how long you want your parts to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.839 
roughly how long you want your parts to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
be so you can roughly estimate by the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.640 
be so you can roughly estimate by the
length<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.330> clip<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.810> section<00:00:31.590> right

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
length of this clip that section right

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.139 
length of this clip that section right
here<00:00:31.769> I'd<00:00:32.130> say<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:32.579> my<00:00:32.669> credits<00:00:33.030> be

here I'd say I want my credits be
credits<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.960> 10<00:00:34.170> seconds<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.250> tap

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
credits to be 10 seconds I can just tap

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930 
credits to be 10 seconds I can just tap
here<00:00:36.680> make<00:00:37.680> sure<00:00:37.860> I'm<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.340> tab<00:00:38.730> right

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
here make sure I'm on this tab right

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.250 
here make sure I'm on this tab right
here<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.620> then<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.680> tap<00:00:40.890> split<00:00:42.079> splits<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
here and then I tap split splits this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
here and then I tap split splits this
into<00:00:43.620> around<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.920> 10-second<00:00:44.489> clip<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.059> let's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
into around a 10-second clip and let's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
into around a 10-second clip and let's
say<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> want<00:00:46.350> two<00:00:46.860> titles<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.610> Mike<00:00:47.760> writes<00:00:47.969> I

can<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.260> roughly<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> middle

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
can do is and go roughly in the middle

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
can do is and go roughly in the middle
here<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:52.350> click<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.680> split<00:00:53.010> again<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.930> then

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
here and click on split again and then

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.049 
here and click on split again and then
puts<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.680> roughly<00:00:56.129> five<00:00:56.370> second<00:00:56.670> chunks

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
puts it into roughly five second chunks

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
puts it into roughly five second chunks
okay<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.800> order<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.340> bring<00:00:59.640> up

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
okay so in order to actually bring up

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.950 
okay so in order to actually bring up
