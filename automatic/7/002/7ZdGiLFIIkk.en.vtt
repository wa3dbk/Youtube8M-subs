tricky<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:16.259> people<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:17.280> defend<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
tricky because people will defend the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.410 
tricky because people will defend the
flags<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.290> sorts<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.770> stuff<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.240> you

bit difficult a little bit difficult
because<00:02:03.210> there's<00:02:03.540> only<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:04.110> air<00:02:04.350> drop<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
because there's only one air drop at a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.550 
because there's only one air drop at a
time<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.759> always<00:02:05.969> they<00:02:06.810> always<00:02:07.290> gets

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
time and it's always they always gets

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.930 
time and it's always they always gets
killed<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.450> lot<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> people<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:10.849> wants<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
killed a lot of people just wants to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.619 
killed a lot of people just wants to
destroy<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.540> soon<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.870> possible

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
destroy as soon as possible

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.820 
destroy as soon as possible
so<00:02:14.629> you<00:02:14.690> kind<00:02:14.989> of<00:02:15.049> have<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.230> wait<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> long<00:02:15.769> time

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
so you kind of have to wait a long time

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.570 
so you kind of have to wait a long time
sometimes<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.530> first<00:02:19.129> off<00:02:19.370> kill<00:02:20.060> one<00:02:20.810> enemy

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
sometimes so first off kill one enemy

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.180 
sometimes so first off kill one enemy
soldier<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.760> drops<00:02:23.209> from<00:02:23.629> that<00:02:23.780> airship<00:02:24.260> so

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
soldier that drops from that airship so

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.740 
soldier that drops from that airship so
anyone<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.849> drops<00:02:26.209> from<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.569> like<00:02:26.720> a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
anyone that drops from that like a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.670 
anyone that drops from that like a
parachute<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:27.950> destroy<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.760> get<00:02:29.000> it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
parachute if you destroy you get it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.970 
parachute if you destroy you get it
destroy<00:02:30.849> one<00:02:31.930> transport<00:02:32.930> vehicle<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.680> drops

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
destroy one transport vehicle that drops

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.940 
destroy one transport vehicle that drops
from<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.370> issue<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.480> if<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.110> drops<00:02:36.409> anything

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
from that issue so if it drops anything

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
from that issue so if it drops anything
like<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.879> a<00:02:38.030> Jeep<00:02:38.329> or<00:02:38.480> something<00:02:38.810> that

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
like that like a Jeep or something that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.649 
like that like a Jeep or something that
is<00:02:38.989> transport<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.760> takes<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:42.040> enemy<00:02:43.659> takes

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
is transport that takes and enemy takes

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.500 
is transport that takes and enemy takes
a<00:02:44.750> lot<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:44.959> enemies<00:02:45.379> to<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> different<00:02:46.129> place

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
a lot of enemies to a different place

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.630 
a lot of enemies to a different place
destroy<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.720> vehicle<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:49.459> done

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
destroy that vehicle and that be done

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.479 
destroy that vehicle and that be done
for<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> last<00:02:51.799> one<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.099> destroyed

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
for that so the last one is destroyed

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.729 
for that so the last one is destroyed
one<00:02:52.819> enemy<00:02:53.769> ifb<00:02:54.769> from<00:02:55.400> air-dropped<00:02:56.739> ifv

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
meaning basically the IFB that drops

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.569 
meaning basically the IFB that drops
form<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.390> airship<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:03.409> you<00:03:03.620> use<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:03.920> vehicle

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
form the airship if you use that vehicle

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.410 
form the airship if you use that vehicle
and<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:05.299> wait<00:03:05.510> for<00:03:05.750> their<00:03:06.190> ifp<00:03:07.190> drops<00:03:07.760> onto

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
and you wait for their ifp drops onto

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.690 
and you wait for their ifp drops onto
the<00:03:08.840> ground<00:03:09.109> you<00:03:09.409> can<00:03:09.590> destroy<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:10.129> with<00:03:10.340> your

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
the ground you can destroy it with your

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.170 
the ground you can destroy it with your
IFB<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.709> assignment<00:03:13.060> next<00:03:14.060> one

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
IFB you can do that assignment next one

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.690 
IFB you can do that assignment next one
is<00:03:14.209> broad<00:03:14.599> warrior<00:03:15.019> after<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.129> have<00:03:16.250> complete

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
is broad warrior after you have complete

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.900 
is broad warrior after you have complete
the<00:03:16.879> last<00:03:17.180> three<00:03:17.540> assignments<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:19.579> need<00:03:19.760> to

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
the last three assignments you need to

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.210 
the last three assignments you need to
destroy<00:03:20.299> 20<00:03:20.930> vehicles<00:03:21.200> which<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.859> kind<00:03:22.099> of

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
destroy 20 vehicles which is kind of

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.270 
destroy 20 vehicles which is kind of
easy<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:23.239> don't<00:03:23.540> say<00:03:23.959> which<00:03:24.349> vehicles<00:03:25.099> to

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
easy you don't say which vehicles to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.819 
easy you don't say which vehicles to
destroy<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.750> I'm<00:03:26.989> guessing<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.560> could<00:03:27.680> be

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
destroy but I'm guessing it could be

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.680 
destroy but I'm guessing it could be
anything<00:03:28.069> what<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> think<00:03:29.150> in<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.329> back<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.540> our

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
anything what I think in the back of our

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.670 
anything what I think in the back of our
mind<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.889> should<00:03:31.250> have<00:03:31.340> said<00:03:31.549> destroy<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.389> any

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
mind it should have said destroy to any

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.140 
mind it should have said destroy to any
