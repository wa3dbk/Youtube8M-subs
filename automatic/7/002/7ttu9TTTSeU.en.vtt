00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.640
 hello to all of you activists 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.749
 I hope you are well and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.669
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.829
 new video that will not be in play 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.480
 not in dofus anyway we'll talk 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.999
 a little thing that bothers me and 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.949
 who are you teasing for some we're going 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.800
 talk about introducing my videos 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.450
 so the little introductory video of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.969
 my videos and a lot of videos in 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.800
 so in fact what's enough that my 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.090
 introduction at present it is 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.559
 a little old now salty more than 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.910
 six months that I leave this is understandable 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.390
 you understand it I understand it 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.430
 perfectly 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.949
 I get a lot of messages saying 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.559
 yes she is not good she is too 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.390
 long and too short the music and not 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.370
 well there is not enough dynamic it is 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.230
 always the same thing must change it 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.609
 I really like it's the best 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.620
 introduction of times I even received 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.789
 messages like that finally short even I 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.079
 finds at the moment that this is true 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.120
 that she is a little old so this 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.620
 would be nice to put you know some pep 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.780
 what in the in the chain a little bit of a 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.780
 little of us young revival really 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.189
 you see there the banner for example eh 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.659
 Well, I think she's really 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.299
 beautiful and it really gave 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.060
 punch too much from the peps to the kouame chain 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.560
 but really what I would never thank 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.350
 strong enough is that he did for me 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.280
 a cheat subscribers really great what 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.600
 in any case I already had expenses ya 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.950
 people who make me fan art that's 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.909
 people who make me banners ago 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.530
 people who make me small pictures 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.890
 etc. all this I put on facebook and 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.890
 twitter 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.450
 it's safe and I really like 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.000
 a lot it is precisely if there is in 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 you an artist soul or someone who 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.299
 mastery very well software that wants 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.770
 to have fun and everything is good I 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.039
 gives you the free field to send me 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.719
 your introduction so that is possible 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.909
 the future introduction to my channel 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.469
 so it's very simple you do a 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.539
 video as you wish you can 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.219
 do what you want me that it does not me 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.409
 do not block the only thing I find 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.079
 that it would be nice if we knew that 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.020
 what does it mean about dofus battles that this 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.520
 that I'm on the server she monster 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.740
 and that we see did me 4 do not 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 by the way but 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.160
 officially it would be pretty much 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.840
 like that and you are really free 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.670
 because you're good bad it did not 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.580
 not important to me and I will put 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.410
 a maximum of play the shots and I think 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.959
 a little bit before and I 'll put the top 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.900
 2 introductions that I prefer and this 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.010
 will you who would choose 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.830
 the introduction so do not hesitate I 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.050
 leave a moment still worry 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.130
 not you long this for what 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.660
 I know that an introduction is done 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.830
 not in 5 minutes that's why 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.330
 Besides, I can not do it 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.830
 because I do not have the time you 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.860
 all know that I am very busy in this 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.810
 moment and especially with videos b 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.680
 finally all the others the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.019
 obligations that I have next to youtube 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.319
 finally will not stop me bothering a little bit of 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.810
 do what so really those who 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.910
 are interested in doing it but 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.440
 do it with great pleasure 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.480
 really a lot of interest in that 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.860
 would be super super cool that you do 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.549
 an introduction that gives a bit of 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.010
 punch in my chain obviously I you 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.290

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.260

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.459
 chip to the ear 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.200
 I did not pay much attention to 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.519
 because that's not really what 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.410
 it does not matter to me in my videos it's rather 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.970
 the direct content but then it's true that 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.410
