 also some have occurred over the years 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.930
 sports cars of very high level 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.459
 comparative has been the only event 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.459
 between April 2009 and 3 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.729
 the corner 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.729
 valdivia mossad m3 of the german firm bmw 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.189
 which boasts a body with capacity for four people 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.880
 inside your silhouette meet 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.539
 started with a four-cylinder propeller 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.329
 RaÃºl is animated 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.539
 20p 8 6 4 liters of displacement whose origins can be traced up to 23 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.240
 that equips the 5 m 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.760
 through six generations the chevrolet cut has been gaining in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.270
 technology and sophistication although it remains faithful to its principles 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.909
 up to two people 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.780
 although the basic design of the m3 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.559
 started as a coupe is from the current 3 series of the Bavarian brand 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.330
 there are only a few details that he shares with the most 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.660
 mundane 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.870
 the extensive use of aluminum and magnesium in addition to the ceiling made of fiber 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.660
 carbon 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.890
 help keep the weight to a minimum and as close to the ground as possible 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.390
 with well-defined leather upholstered armchairs and separated by a large tunnel 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.540
 central 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.090
 It has a board of multiple configurations, it is intelligible and clear 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.960
 and includes everything electrical that would be expected despite the search for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.870
 a reduced weight this does not affect the level of comfort that can be seen in the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.890
 m3 cab the electronic limited slip differential 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.410
 allows a great 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.720
 what is expressed by 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 finished 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.360
 the only objective to destroy 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.830
 I feel a huge wall 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.300
 but many centuries but that district displaces the first support 400 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.549
 horsepower 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.400
 and 400 pounds 5 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.140
 which are combined with a six-speed manual transmission 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.530
 and rear traction by difference 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.789
 toni sang 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.580
 in the case of m3 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.440
 under its control of composite material at the time of internal consumption but a lot 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.480
 that delivers an extra power of 420 horsepower 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.749
 and a torque of two belts 95 foot pounds from a displacement of four 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.749
 liters and with the help of 32 valves 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.629
 the attraction is later 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.359
 and will reach the wheels through a six-speed manual transmission 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.199
 to reach 100 kilometers per hour 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:55.229
 the chevrolet corvette c6 requires 4 points 4 seconds and is capable of reaching 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:03:00.819
 a maximum speed of 305 kilometers per hour both nations 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.649
 can reach 100 km 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.620
 four points 8 seconds 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.400
 moria casan 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.759
 a maximum speed 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 of 250 kilometers per hour 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.529
 when sitting in front of the steering wheel of the chevrolet corvette c6 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.269
 the relationship with the controls is very strong 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.190
 when entering too fast to indict half speed with sales the shaft 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.609
 frontal will tend to follow a wider line 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.959
 due to the slip differential already limited to the length of life 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.310
 finally the suspension 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.109
 to avoid scares 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.870
 it is so to stop completely from 80 kilometers per hour 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.579
 unicaja 14 points 2 30 meters 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.819
 poor psychic control 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.369
 The brakes of the m3 possess a huge detection capability Jason discs are 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.549
 the four 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.010
 the anti-lock system with electronic distribution of braking effort 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.089
 it is so you need to do only 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:07.319
 Mississippi 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.150
 Costa Rican 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
 It is 80 kilometers per hour 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.459
 the approximate price m 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.159
 90 x 110 pesos 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.849
 the environment 3 is approximately 89 thousand dollars
