00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.410 
hack my way into interesting prototypes
I<00:03:43.159> thing<00:03:43.609> as<00:03:43.730> programmers<00:03:44.060> are<00:03:44.209> really

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
I thing as programmers are really

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.990 
I thing as programmers are really
expensive<00:03:44.719> so<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:46.430> know<00:03:46.489> some<00:03:46.670> people<00:03:46.700> do

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
expensive so you know some people do

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.369 
expensive so you know some people do
this<00:03:47.180> bolt<00:03:47.389> thing<00:03:47.659> on<00:03:47.780> Kickstarter<00:03:48.230> where

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
this bolt thing on Kickstarter where

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.170 
this bolt thing on Kickstarter where
they<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.620> asked<00:03:49.040> for<00:03:49.220> less<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.430> they<00:03:49.790> really

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
they like asked for less and they really

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.520 
they like asked for less and they really
need<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.689> hope<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.230> kind<00:03:51.439> of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
need and the hope that it kind of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.770 
need and the hope that it kind of
explodes<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.370> like<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:52.549> love<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:52.939> stuff<00:03:53.120> but

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
explodes and like I love this stuff but

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.240 
explodes and like I love this stuff but
for<00:03:53.959> us<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.200> was<00:03:54.260> like<00:03:54.470> okay<00:03:54.769> well<00:03:54.950> no<00:03:55.099> we

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
for us it was like okay well no we

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.539 
for us it was like okay well no we
actually<00:03:55.400> have<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.909> ask<00:03:56.120> for<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.689> amount<00:03:56.959> and

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
actually have to ask for the amount and

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.759 
actually have to ask for the amount and
150,000<00:03:58.549> was<00:03:59.090> totally<00:03:59.659> like<00:04:00.109> what<00:04:00.409> do<00:04:00.500> we<00:04:00.620> need

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
150,000 was totally like what do we need

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.949 
150,000 was totally like what do we need
to<00:04:00.950> get<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.159> project<00:04:01.400> done<00:04:01.669> and<00:04:02.569> this<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:02.900> the

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
to get this project done and this is the

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.539 
to get this project done and this is the
honest<00:04:03.230> truth<00:04:03.379> like<00:04:03.739> we<00:04:03.919> are<00:04:04.040> not<00:04:04.250> going<00:04:04.459> to

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
honest truth like we are not going to

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.920 
honest truth like we are not going to
get<00:04:04.609> rich<00:04:04.790> off<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.120> idea<00:04:05.450> it's<00:04:05.629> a<00:04:05.720> passion

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
get rich off this idea it's a passion

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.589 
get rich off this idea it's a passion
project<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.889> it's<00:04:07.370> partly<00:04:07.669> a<00:04:08.090> passion

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
project and it's partly a passion

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.509 
project and it's partly a passion
project<00:04:08.689> of<00:04:09.079> local<00:04:09.889> multiplayer<00:04:10.310> is

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
project of local multiplayer is

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.460 
project of local multiplayer is
important<00:04:11.000> i<00:04:11.269> think<00:04:11.629> it's<00:04:12.019> been<00:04:12.200> overshadowed

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
important i think it's been overshadowed

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.890 
important i think it's been overshadowed
by<00:04:13.069> online<00:04:13.430> play<00:04:13.669> in<00:04:13.939> the<00:04:14.060> last<00:04:14.269> decade<00:04:14.659> i

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
by online play in the last decade i

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.629 
by online play in the last decade i
don't<00:04:15.200> know<00:04:15.260> like<00:04:15.290> i<00:04:15.560> grew<00:04:15.620> up<00:04:15.889> playing<00:04:16.070> stuff

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
don't know like i grew up playing stuff

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.729 
don't know like i grew up playing stuff
like<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.030> nintendo<00:04:17.150> 64<00:04:17.630> like<00:04:18.289> in<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.560> living

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
like the nintendo 64 like in a living

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.349 
like the nintendo 64 like in a living
room<00:04:18.889> in<00:04:19.159> that<00:04:19.280> kind<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.579> setting<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.090> think

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
room in that kind of setting I think

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.680 
room in that kind of setting I think
local<00:04:20.840> multiplayer<00:04:21.229> games<00:04:21.530> are<00:04:21.650> often

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
local multiplayer games are often

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.080 
local multiplayer games are often
Gainesville<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.530> so<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.730> think<00:04:24.760> are

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
Gainesville and so this is I think are

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.270 
Gainesville and so this is I think are
almost<00:04:25.630> like<00:04:25.780> rallying<00:04:26.260> cry<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.500> like<00:04:26.830> no<00:04:27.010> guys

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
almost like rallying cry of like no guys

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.700 
almost like rallying cry of like no guys
