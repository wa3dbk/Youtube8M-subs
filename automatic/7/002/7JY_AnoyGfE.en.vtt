00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
okay we're gonna have a quick look at my

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.309 
okay we're gonna have a quick look at my
right<00:02:10.670> hand<00:02:10.729> just<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.360> can<00:02:11.540> see<00:02:11.810> one<00:02:12.200> of

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
right hand just so you can see one of

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.780 
right hand just so you can see one of
the<00:02:12.410> techniques<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.950> I'm<00:02:13.160> using<00:02:13.459> in<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the techniques that I'm using in the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.020 
the techniques that I'm using in the
riff<00:02:13.970> called<00:02:14.360> hybrid<00:02:14.900> picking<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.730> is

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
riff called hybrid picking this is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.240 
riff called hybrid picking this is
basically<00:02:17.930> when<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.349> use<00:02:18.530> your<00:02:18.560> pick<00:02:19.010> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
basically when you use your pick and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.210 
basically when you use your pick and
fingers<00:02:19.819> together<00:02:22.269> now<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:23.660> use<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.379> in<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.890> two

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
fingers together now I use it in the two

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.210 
fingers together now I use it in the two
chords<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.900> tail<00:02:27.110> end<00:02:27.379> of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.680> riff<00:02:27.890> which

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
chords at the tail end of the riff which

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:37.150 
chords at the tail end of the riff which
are<00:02:28.430> here<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:35.620> I'll<00:02:36.620> play<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.980> riff

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
through so you can see how I use the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.099 
through so you can see how I use the
hybrid<00:02:39.079> picking<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.860> section
