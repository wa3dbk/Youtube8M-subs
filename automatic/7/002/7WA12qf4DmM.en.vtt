00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
um today was definitely a step in the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.559 
um today was definitely a step in the
right<00:02:06.149> direction<00:02:07.910> it's<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.269> something<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
right direction it's just something to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.600 
right direction it's just something to
take<00:02:09.750> week<00:02:10.019> after<00:02:10.410> week<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.800> far<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.310> just

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
take week after week as far as just

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.559 
take week after week as far as just
spend<00:02:11.849> more<00:02:12.030> time<00:02:12.269> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.569> boy<00:02:13.670> before<00:02:14.670> i<00:02:14.940> got

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
spend more time on the boy before i got

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.449 
spend more time on the boy before i got
the<00:02:15.720> call<00:02:15.870> off<00:02:16.080> from<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.470> i<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.830> working<00:02:17.280> full

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
the call off from and i was working full

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.490 
the call off from and i was working full
time<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.060> wasn't<00:02:18.330> really<00:02:18.480> riding<00:02:18.959> too<00:02:19.260> much

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
time so I wasn't really riding too much

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.680 
time so I wasn't really riding too much
so<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.069> pretty<00:02:20.700> much<00:02:20.910> catching<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.480> on

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
so it's just pretty much catching up on

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.360 
so it's just pretty much catching up on
a<00:02:21.720> lot<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.019> our<00:02:22.290> right<00:02:22.680> time<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.250> I've

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
a lot of our right time that I've

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.970 
a lot of our right time that I've
missing<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.090> pretty<00:02:24.569> much<00:02:24.629> time<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.769> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
missing and pretty much time on the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.740 
missing and pretty much time on the
saddle<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.519> racing<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:28.489> going<00:02:29.489> 79<00:02:29.970> today<00:02:30.510> was

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
saddle and racing so going 79 today was

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.470 
saddle and racing so going 79 today was
definitely<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.470> lot<00:02:32.430> better<00:02:32.489> than<00:02:32.940> Harvey<00:02:33.330> Bay

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
definitely a lot better than Harvey Bay

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.119 
definitely a lot better than Harvey Bay
and<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.810> think<00:02:34.080> from<00:02:34.650> now<00:02:34.709> we'll<00:02:35.099> just

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
and I think from now we'll just

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.069 
and I think from now we'll just
gradually<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.180> stronger<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.750> stronger

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
gradually get stronger and stronger

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.380 
gradually get stronger and stronger
