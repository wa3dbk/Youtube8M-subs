00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
not going to work this is the best

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.160 
not going to work this is the best
solution<00:02:35.950> now<00:02:36.950> inside<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.580> enclosure<00:02:38.170> this

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
solution now inside the enclosure this

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.740 
solution now inside the enclosure this
is<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.350> 4<00:02:39.709> by<00:02:39.860> 4<00:02:39.890> by<00:02:40.400> 7<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.180> plenty<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.570> room

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
is a 4 by 4 by 7 so it's plenty of room

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750 
is a 4 by 4 by 7 so it's plenty of room
for<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.110> move<00:02:42.140> around<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.860> then<00:02:43.580> you'll

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
for you to move around and then you'll

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.270
