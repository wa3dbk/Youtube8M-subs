00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
another necromancy build that's what I'd

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.950 
another necromancy build that's what I'd
be<00:00:27.900> running<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> while<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:30.240> it's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
be running with for a while now and it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
be running with for a while now and it's
fairly<00:00:31.289> interesting<00:00:31.940> it's<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.270> different

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
fairly interesting it's a bit different

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
fairly interesting it's a bit different
to<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.770> doing<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.520> too<00:00:35.760> different<00:00:37.160> so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
to what I was doing not too different so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
to what I was doing not too different so
we've<00:00:38.309> gone<00:00:38.460> 13<00:00:39.120> spike<00:00:39.480> 10<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> Death<00:00:40.530> Magic

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
we've gone 13 spike 10 in Death Magic

we've gone 13 spike 10 in Death Magic
and<00:00:41.129> 30<00:00:41.489> install<00:00:41.910> reaping<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.260> basic

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and 30 install reaping and the basic

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
and 30 install reaping and the basic
idea<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.460> too<00:00:44.879> well<00:00:45.300> firstly<00:00:45.750> you've

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
idea of this is too well firstly you've

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.709 
idea of this is too well firstly you've
got<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.379> staff<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.510> weapon

got your staff in one of your weapon

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
got your staff in one of your weapon
sets<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.649> staff<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.399> too<00:00:50.550> good

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
sets because the staff is just too good

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
sets because the staff is just too good
to<00:00:50.789> pass<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> other<00:00:52.530> weapon<00:00:52.860> set

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to pass up and in the other weapon set

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.910 
to pass up and in the other weapon set
it's<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.059> choice<00:00:54.270> between<00:00:54.329> dagger<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.860> your

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
focus I prefer focus and the main idea

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
focus I prefer focus and the main idea
of<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.489> build<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.390> stack

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
of this build is just stack

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.710 
of this build is just stack
vulnerability<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.040> enemy<00:01:08.299> stack<00:01:09.299> might

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
vulnerability on the enemy stack might

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.640 
vulnerability on the enemy stack might
on<00:01:09.930> yourself<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:12.020> just<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.260> straight<00:01:13.500> up

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on yourself and just do straight up

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.700 
on yourself and just do straight up
damage<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> go<00:01:16.290> through<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> traits<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:19.200> spite

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
damage so go through the traits in spite

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.700 
damage so go through the traits in spite
life<00:01:20.700> blast<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.330> play<00:01:21.780> blast<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.530> your

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
life blast and play blast which is your

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.090 
life blast and play blast which is your
death<00:01:23.189> shroud<00:01:23.490> stuff<00:01:23.880> give<00:01:24.750> might<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.710> 15

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
death shroud stuff give might for 15

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.179 
death shroud stuff give might for 15
seconds<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.110> it's<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.320> reaping<00:01:28.710> we've<00:01:28.979> got

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
seconds and it's all reaping we've got

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.510 
seconds and it's all reaping we've got
vital<00:01:29.640> force<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.030> nope<00:01:30.630> where<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.520> there

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
vital force here nope where is it there

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
vital force here nope where is it there
we<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.759> unyielding<00:01:33.119> blast<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.990> their<00:01:34.250> life

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
we go unyielding blast down their life

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
we go unyielding blast down their life
last<00:01:35.549> pieces<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.780> causes<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> building

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
last pieces and causes what the building

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.130 
last pieces and causes what the building
so<00:01:38.369> what<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> means<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
so what this means is that in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.060 
so what this means is that in
combination<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:41.270> vital<00:01:42.270> persistence<00:01:43.070> which

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
combination with vital persistence which

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
combination with vital persistence which
drains<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.700> life<00:01:44.880> force<00:01:45.149> slower<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:46.500> you're

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
drains your life force slower if you're

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.090 
drains your life force slower if you're
not<00:01:46.799> taking<00:01:47.130> damage<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.610> debt<00:01:47.820> route<00:01:49.100> then

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
not taking damage in debt route then

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.730 
not taking damage in debt route then
you're<00:01:51.090> able<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.899> sit<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.290> debt<00:01:52.470> shout

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you're able to just sit in debt shout

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.060 
you're able to just sit in debt shout
for<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> large<00:01:53.520> amount<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> time<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.070> Pierce

hopefully<00:05:53.140> be<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.890> next<00:05:54.130> build<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.550> I<00:05:54.670> do

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
hopefully be the next build that I do

hopefully be the next build that I do
ask<00:05:56.650> for<00:05:56.950> right<00:05:57.070> now<00:05:57.100> this<00:05:57.460> builds<00:05:58.180> pretty

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
ask for right now this builds pretty

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.450 
ask for right now this builds pretty
good<00:05:58.540> it's<00:05:58.990> not<00:05:59.140> bad<00:05:59.320> gives<00:05:59.800> you<00:05:59.890> a<00:06:00.070> lot<00:06:00.400> of
