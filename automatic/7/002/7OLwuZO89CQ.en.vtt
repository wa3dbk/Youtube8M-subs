 representing Italy all over the world 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.120
 that age group to cover 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 participants in a range ranging from 25 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.020
 also saw some guys 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.930
 prison 30 35 years then it depends 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.490
 however from the type we said of commitment 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.890
 who want to carry on 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.420
 who are the jurors and what are the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.690
 evaluation criteria 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.360
 jurors is the captain of 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.210
 national with his team indeed louis 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.560
 chose a group of people with the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.939
 which he intends to carry on 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.200
 of the national team 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.090
 and the criteria always go according to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.490
 international regulation therefore as 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.520
 I told you before regarding the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.240
 cold kitchen hot kitchen 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.479
 the artistic and there is no regulation 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.700
 very very particular very meticulous 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.850
 and therefore the tears they are preparing 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.530
 are all the cries I am 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.079
 regulated by this we say from 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.360
 this way of expressing oneself and therefore 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.369
 each of them that lights up in these 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.049
 preparations had to respect the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.780
 kitchen has now become an art form 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.630
 in fact we see crying here and there is one 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.549
 presentation and well chosen is well taken care of 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.049
 just as she said she is part of 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.479
 evaluation criteria also the 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.670
 presentation of the dish if very much 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.679
 we said just to say something 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.209
 as for the cold kitchen yes 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.930
 It takes into account the very premium 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.580
 nature ice creams the chromaticity and then for 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.730
 what about that 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.620
 hot portioning then there are some 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.870
 the technical rules forever too 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.150
 when they lead to the products they need 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.590
 there must not be well- weighed 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.140
 too many scraps products they must 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.690
 there are all traveling under vacuum 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.769
 all set of rules anyway 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.410
 they must be respected and we say 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.019
 here school we managed to host them 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.090
 because having a school with so many 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.430
 contemporary laboratories 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.769
 we had almost 10 12 chefs working 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.780
 1 simultaneously therefore truly 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.450
 this is a source of pride for the city 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.090
 of avellino because it is the only stage in 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.400
 italy in which thanks to the evil red doria 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.879
 we managed to host these cooks 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.140
 and to really make ourselves available 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.569
 state-of-the-art equipment with 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.000
 spaces we really had so many 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.400
 compliments from the top of the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.530
 federation as they found one 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.620
 school very welcoming and above all 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.769
 very equipped and I think those who already are 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.010
 knows what how like the institute and how 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.780
 let's try what we can give 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.849
 for our children for our students 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.599
 thanks also to the environments we have a 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.400
 layout 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.410
 precisely the role of the students in this 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.790
 competition participated in 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.239
 some way to carry out 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.220
 the event was attended because 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.389
 The captain did a bell'intervento 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 under the proper aspect 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.889
 of guidance explaining them a little 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.910
 professional ethics but above all 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:51.579
 also this desire to carry on 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.549
 this work that we consider almost 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.919
 a mission because now we have a little 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.630
 repeating we are saying a little a 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.989
 all that really for the future 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.000
 the only real medicine to feel good and 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.359
 know how to eat and therefore know how to prepare 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.169
 and offer people one anyway 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:13.720
 healthy cooking since now anyway 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.730
 we live in a rather particular period 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.349
 with all the problems that are there 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.019
 regarding the products 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.570
 especially in campania so I think that 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.760
 the contribution of the chef of the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.370
 professional becomes fundamental to 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.200
 transmit safety even at the table in 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.670
 say look, we're serving you 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.560
 a quality product 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.750
 even the TV now focuses a lot on 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.060
 kitchen is always the reality like 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.130
 masterchef or transmissions of 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.680
 kitchen that by the way go very well 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.110
 what do you really think no 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.160
 I don't really agree on these 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.830
 thematic show is pleasing 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.470
 but I like to give more messages 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.060
 concrete that then we do show 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.760
 with the kitchen but also good because of it 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.220
 we live the chef's professionalism 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.740
 they are sort of a different look below 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.170
 the look really really 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.150
 professional and what we see in 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.000
 many transmissions to be more one 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.120
 theatrical form where we try to attract 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.610
 the public, however, concrete messages 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.860
 as for the kitchen there are 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.140
 very few as there are so many 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.730
 instead in certain transmissions where one is 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.630
 really aims to give a message to 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.300
 viewers 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.850
 under the gastronomic aspect which 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.310
 paccione for example less than us 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.130
 the one I respect very much for that 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.750
 to fix or even the same in his 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.910
 small the test of the common cook there 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.129
 they are beautiful concrete messages as far as 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.479
 regards the real I see you fine 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:45.279
 fake a lot of scene sometimes seen 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.709
 of the kitchens that I sincerely think that 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.779
 if they really are restaurants that are 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:51.909
 open in those conditions is not that 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:55.209
 make you want to go there indeed 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.639
 make you want to escape from certain 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:59.469
 will certainly cook as a customer but 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.489
 also as a chef entering the kitchen 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.319
 such 

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:04.419
 I think it's not that we have to wait 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.919
 a chef who comes from outside who gives 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.330
 of the directives regarding 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.330
 the sanitary aspect
