00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.190 
into a corresponding tote for that
particular<00:02:12.580> order<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.660> have<00:02:13.690> vertical

particular order and we have vertical

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.590 
particular order and we have vertical
elevation<00:02:14.590> capability<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:16.060> allows<00:02:16.390> us<00:02:16.420> to
