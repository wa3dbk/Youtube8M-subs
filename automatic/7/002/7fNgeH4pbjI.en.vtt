00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:11.730
 good unhook with technical sergio del 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 blue cross and sergio good had 39 by 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.090
 hundred performance last season 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.379
 I got in last night to see low numbers 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.199
 when they told me that sergio good 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430
 I was so patiently waiting for the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 call of last crosses that is a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 big team pays well for 17 games 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.300
 Last season 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.330
 sergio good won 5 with the jaguars of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.579
 chiapas throw him jaguars for not me 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.710
 third line and hires blue cross 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.049
 but that hired it has turned out this 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.039
 story 

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:42.510
 robyn all have to be in the 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.159
 alvarez plant all have to be 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.799
 in practice for the people of cross 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.190
 blue and the decisions of your team 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.869
 cement hobby takes them now robin to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.179
 places thirty-something boy 

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.069
 years is the son of the vile and is a guy who 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.749
 he wanted to be a soccer player that could not be 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.779
 footballer or in his family's team 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.529
 so that we understand the whole context of 

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:03.529
 year and he 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.520
 and the vile and his father says son you're going to 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.300
 this position of the team is robyn Ã¡lvarez 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.120
 the one who will make the decisions 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.590
 mainly in blue cross now and as 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.210
 a technician who miss Jaguars 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
 Chiapas comes to a team that seeks to be 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.480
 league champion after 18 years 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.300
 it's ridiculous decent as good as it is 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.640
 embarrassing as his 15th teams and the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.720
 it's not technical for him to cross 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.390
 blue 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.540
 I'm beating that it's going to fail because it's 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.220
 the blue black profile we talked about hey 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.220
 if toluca leaves cardoso 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:48.740
 there is the blue cross is the only team 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.130
 technical of some equipment but not 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.320
 it has no title it is not we do not care in 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.490
 blue course now I do not know why they call it 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.610
 true 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.869
 is this is a juanpa arrangement they have 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.670
 kidnapped to the cross blue well 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.510
 stolen has hijacked the course is a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.120
 result 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.950
 he decides he does what he wants to me 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.780
 person who more than directed projected 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:17.340
 18 years everyone talks about 97 the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.750
 Cup date but league around the world 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.950
 speaks of 1997 the date in in 1980 cross 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.590
 blue had the opportunity to be 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.660
 three-time Mexican soccer lost the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.160
 final against cougars had been born in the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.570
 80 Enduring but has gotten him to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.660
 history they lost in general against 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.350
 pumas from 81 to date blue cross has 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.150
 a title of one a title is shameful 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.340
 what about the blues 30 and it's not a team 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.110
 big cross blue gentlemen are not a 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.350
 big team understand what the team 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.350
 big 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.260
 is what is the great team that had a 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.240
 golden age in the 70s when they went up to 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.420
 first division and since then the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.420
 team has a title on 1997
