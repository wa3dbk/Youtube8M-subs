00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:53.410 

-<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:43.800> gotta<00:02:43.980> be<00:02:44.100> kidding<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:48.530> have<00:02:52.310> been

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
- you gotta be kidding I have been

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.420 
- you gotta be kidding I have been
applying<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.660> color<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> my<00:02:58.430> last

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
applying the color and this is my last

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.200 
applying the color and this is my last
section<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.160> instructions<00:03:02.730> say<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:05.210> apply

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
section so the instructions say to apply

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.440 
section so the instructions say to apply
with<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.750> brush<00:03:07.070> but<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.310> find<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:09.090> it's

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
with the brush but I find that it's

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.120 
with the brush but I find that it's
easier<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.740> get<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.730> little<00:03:11.790> bit<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.210> my

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
easier to just get a little bit of my

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.900 
easier to just get a little bit of my
hand<00:03:14.130> here<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:16.530> apply<00:03:16.890> down<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.640> this

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
hand here and just apply down like this

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.120 
hand here and just apply down like this
because<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.900> brush<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.350> not<00:03:19.800> even<00:03:20.010> doing

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
because the brush is not even doing

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.600 
because the brush is not even doing
anything<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.680> here's<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.490> little

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
anything and here's the little

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.940 
anything and here's the little
applicator<00:03:24.060> brush<00:03:24.500> this<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.530> what<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:25.890> should

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
applicator brush this is what you should

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.000 
applicator brush this is what you should
do<00:03:26.280> but<00:03:26.550> I'm<00:03:26.820> not<00:03:26.880> doing<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.270> because

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
do but I'm not doing that because

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.810 
do but I'm not doing that because
typically<00:03:30.380> even<00:03:31.380> though<00:03:31.680> hair<00:03:32.250> colors<00:03:32.610> say

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
typically even though hair colors say

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.550 
typically even though hair colors say
they're<00:03:33.060> ammonia<00:03:33.420> free<00:03:33.690> they<00:03:33.870> still<00:03:34.320> have

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
they're ammonia free they still have
