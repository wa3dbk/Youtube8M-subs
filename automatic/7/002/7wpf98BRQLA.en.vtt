00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
this is going to be the grass areas

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.900 
this is going to be the grass areas
he'll<00:00:19.529> go<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> tags<00:00:20.390> levels<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.689> 30<00:00:22.650> bitmaps<00:00:23.640> and

he'll go to tags levels a 30 bitmaps and
detail<00:00:24.869> grass<00:00:25.140> bitmap<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:27.560> now<00:00:28.560> we're<00:00:28.740> done

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
detail grass bitmap and now we're done

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.999 
detail grass bitmap and now we're done
editing<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.820> shader<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> save

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
editing this shader we do want to save

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.040 
editing this shader we do want to save
it<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.730> we'll<00:00:32.910> save<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.300> under<00:00:33.480> our<00:00:33.780> tags

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it and we'll save it under our tags

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.130 
it and we'll save it under our tags
directory<00:00:34.500> under<00:00:34.680> levels<00:00:35.480> splinter<00:00:36.480> will

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
directory under levels splinter will

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
directory under levels splinter will
create<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.770> new<00:00:38.100> folder<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.730> we'll<00:00:38.879> call<00:00:39.090> this

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
create a new folder and we'll call this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500 
create a new folder and we'll call this
folder<00:00:39.629> shaders<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.760> we'll<00:00:41.760> go<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
folder shaders and we'll go in there and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.069 
folder shaders and we'll go in there and
we'll<00:00:43.230> name<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.590> shader<00:00:45.079> splinter

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
we'll name the shader splinter

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.810 
we'll name the shader splinter
underscore<00:00:46.950> ground<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:49.250> select<00:00:50.250> save

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
underscore ground and select save

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.510 
underscore ground and select save
now<00:00:52.690> we<00:00:52.750> want<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.290> export<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:54.160> level<00:00:54.400> itself

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
now we want to export the level itself

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.610 
now we want to export the level itself
so<00:00:55.480> we'll<00:00:55.600> type<00:00:55.810> tool<00:00:57.180> structure<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.620> it's

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
so we'll type tool structure and it's

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.570 
so we'll type tool structure and it's
going<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.830> assume<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.129> we're<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.400> data

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
going to assume that we're in the data

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.530 
going to assume that we're in the data
directory<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.270> we'll<00:01:01.420> go<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.600> levels<00:01:06.540> splinter

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
directory so we'll go to levels splinter

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.100 
directory so we'll go to levels splinter
and<00:01:08.160> then<00:01:09.160> space<00:01:09.580> splinter<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.840> first

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
and then space splinter the first

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.600 
and then space splinter the first
splinter<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.710> directory<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:12.190> we<00:01:12.430> want

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
splinter is the directory that we want

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.730 
splinter is the directory that we want
it<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.700> go<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.930> second<00:01:14.290> splinter<00:01:14.680> is

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
it to go to and the second splinter is

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.620 
it to go to and the second splinter is
the<00:01:14.920> actual<00:01:15.190> file<00:01:15.460> name<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.910> JMS<00:01:16.330> files

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
the actual file name of the JMS files

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.620 
the actual file name of the JMS files
and<00:01:17.020> we'll<00:01:17.470> hit<00:01:17.619> enter<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.360> will<00:01:22.450> go

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
and we'll hit enter and it will go

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.719 
and we'll hit enter and it will go
through<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.229> build<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.650> tag<00:01:23.860> for<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.250> now

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
through and build the tag for that now

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.550 
through and build the tag for that now
we<00:01:24.789> want<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.090> open<00:01:25.149> this<00:01:25.450> tag<00:01:25.720> in<00:01:25.899> gorilla<00:01:26.170> will

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
we want to open this tag in gorilla will

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.749 
we want to open this tag in gorilla will
go<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.740> file<00:01:27.280> open<00:01:27.930> we'll<00:01:28.930> go<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.110> levels

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
go to file open we'll go to levels

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.550 
go to file open we'll go to levels
splinter<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:30.910> then<00:01:31.539> select<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.020> Splinter

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560
