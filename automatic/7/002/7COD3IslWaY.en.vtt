joe flacco how do you think that's gonna

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.520 
joe flacco how do you think that's gonna
affect<00:01:35.829> how<00:01:36.130> he<00:01:36.189> plays<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:37.079> would<00:01:38.079> imagine<00:01:38.259> he

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
affect how he plays I would imagine he

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.139 
affect how he plays I would imagine he
hasn't<00:01:38.770> seen<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.920> pass<00:01:39.159> rush<00:01:39.399> like<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:40.030> mean

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
hasn't seen a pass rush like this I mean

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.490 
hasn't seen a pass rush like this I mean
I<00:01:40.240> know<00:01:40.270> he's<00:01:40.479> been<00:01:40.570> playing<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.049> NFL<00:01:41.259> and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
I know he's been playing in the NFL and

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.590 
I know he's been playing in the NFL and
every<00:01:42.159> team<00:01:42.369> can<00:01:42.579> get<00:01:42.729> after<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.060> from<00:01:43.270> time<00:01:43.450> to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
every team can get after it from time to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810 
every team can get after it from time to
time<00:01:43.630> but<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:43.990> don't<00:01:44.200> think<00:01:44.290> he's<00:01:44.469> seen<00:01:44.820> pass

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.819 
time but I don't think he's seen pass
rush<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.210> when<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:46.600> team<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.259> on<00:01:47.409> can

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
rush that when this team is on can

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.289 
rush that when this team is on can
really<00:01:48.100> get<00:01:48.250> after<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.729> know<00:01:48.789> he<00:01:49.030> didn't

don't have much of a history against the
ravens<00:02:16.520> but<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.570> two<00:02:17.750> most<00:02:17.900> recent<00:02:18.020> games

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
ravens but to the two most recent games

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.260 
ravens but to the two most recent games
is<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.950> blowout<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.430> no<00:02:19.520> four<00:02:19.820> then<00:02:20.120> there's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
is the blowout and no four then there's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.940 
is the blowout and no four then there's
a<00:02:20.330> Super<00:02:20.690> Bowl<00:02:20.720> loss<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.380> know<00:02:21.440> went<00:02:21.680> super

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
a Super Bowl loss you know went super

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.670 
a Super Bowl loss you know went super
bowl<00:02:22.070> 35<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.210> guess<00:02:23.540> how<00:02:23.900> much<00:02:24.080> he<00:02:24.320> said<00:02:24.590> they

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
bowl 35 so I guess how much he said they

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.710 
bowl 35 so I guess how much he said they
want<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.920> atone<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.310> those<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.480> know<00:02:26.570> those

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
want to atone for those you know those

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.970 
want to atone for those you know those
games<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.230> think<00:02:27.410> that's<00:02:27.530> kind<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.770> something

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.410 
games you think that's kind of something
that's<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.310> their<00:02:28.430> heads<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.730> week<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.210> maybe

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
