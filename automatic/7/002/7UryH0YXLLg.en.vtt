00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.430
 penny which had been fun first 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.340
 yes that was 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.210
 we nice to start the preparation 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.030
 especially with new club and I am me 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 I'm happy that I can play here so 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 eh 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.420
 long in the pipeline that you are here 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.570
 will shine from i heard i get there 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.310
 well that interest was the c word though 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.670
 that while people are watching 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.759
 were the box and code 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.110
 yes I knew that because I had that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.300
 or indicate which my agent 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.559
 I just wanted to focus on VVV 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.420
 everywhere lies in the playoffs 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 and yes view from at a given moment 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739
 the week really becomes concrete too 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.800
 in the sense of with conversations 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.539
 we really shall I caught was was 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.219
 premier league then no option because if you 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.879
 people ask the streets and for 5 players 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.010
 from the jupiler league 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.329
 then I also think that there is a lot at the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.949
 name in it welt comb 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.340
 well that 's right 'some interest was also expressed 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:07.350
 the Eredivisie and yes that it is not me 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.570
 may be yes i i that yes i have 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.680
 had a conversation with Willem 2 also one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.220
 but the trainer who was 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.130
 charmed from me even in yes to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.460
 the day of Thursday say 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.140
 actually heard nothing my 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.189
 it is that I am on the steel by marco 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.500
 it was a good conversation with the training 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.500
 and we actually right by 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 caught so how do you see how do you see this 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 step into your career now how does it look 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.500
 step 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.679
 I think it's a very beautiful beautiful 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.640
 nice step is certain for me 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.610
 go deals yes the club says it all 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.709
 football radiates from the supporters 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.299
 yes a very nice team i think 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.720
 that a very close group can go 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.920
 be this season and I think yes yes 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.869
 That is the intention that we are so fast 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 possible of times in the premier division and 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.770
 that is my intention i want in the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.450
 premier league shine yes right now 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.670
 would that be the best thing about my code 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.990
 eagles so for my pass at that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.799
 club at we do a little bit one 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.340

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.239
 yes has the passion for for for 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.680
 for code eagles in deventer I think so 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.769
 nice i like a little interaction 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.019
 with the audience and I watch it 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.000
 out to damage the sls after welding or in the 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.980
 eagle's chest 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.200
 my father meter what little I know 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.420
 tap now 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.090
 I feel like I'm talking a list 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.400
 but I am still a bit quiet that was 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.689
 I could think how important it is 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.459
 bart friends 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.230

 teijsse because you are and a bit 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.819
 content the card club you look like it 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.340
 but i think he is sure 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.810
 has been important and kenny that too 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.569
 the choice fell on go I think 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.250
 that did the deciding when I yes then 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.989

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.669
