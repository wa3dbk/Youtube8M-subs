00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.240 
serious I do some yoga I meditate I go
for<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> walk<00:02:38.110> my<00:02:38.590> blood<00:02:38.800> pressure<00:02:38.980> goes<00:02:39.220> down

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
for a walk my blood pressure goes down

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.060 
for a walk my blood pressure goes down
so<00:02:40.000> I'm<00:02:40.300> learning<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.140> different

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
so I'm learning that different

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.490 
so I'm learning that different
activities<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.760> daily<00:02:42.790> living<00:02:43.030> really<00:02:44.020> really

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
activities of daily living really really

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.830 
activities of daily living really really
affect<00:02:44.920> my<00:02:45.100> blood<00:02:45.310> pressure<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:45.820> think<00:02:46.510> where

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.690 
affect my blood pressure I think where
the<00:02:46.959> future<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.470> headed<00:02:47.830> when<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.430> start

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
the future is headed when you start

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.160 
the future is headed when you start
sharing<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.270> information<00:02:49.480> with<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.900> cloud

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
sharing that information with a cloud

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.140 
sharing that information with a cloud
even<00:02:50.530> anonymously<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.880> start

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
even anonymously and you start

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.940 
even anonymously and you start
overlaying<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.990> with<00:02:53.140> other<00:02:53.380> data<00:02:53.680> we're

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
overlaying that with other data we're

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.970 
overlaying that with other data we're
going<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.190> learn<00:02:54.840> new<00:02:55.840> things<00:02:56.260> from<00:02:56.739> blood

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
going to learn new things from blood

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.870 
going to learn new things from blood
pressure<00:02:57.190> we're<00:02:57.340> going<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.519> be<00:02:57.580> able<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.760> use

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
pressure we're going to be able to use

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.550 
pressure we're going to be able to use
blood<00:02:58.120> pressure<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.540> monitor<00:02:58.870> other<00:02:59.200> things

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
blood pressure to monitor other things

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.350 
blood pressure to monitor other things
that<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.580> great<00:03:00.700> they<00:03:00.880> give<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> time<00:03:01.300> I
