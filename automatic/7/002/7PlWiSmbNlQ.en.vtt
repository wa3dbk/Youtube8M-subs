00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.310
 and going out to the mountain with our dog is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 an unparalleled experience we can 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.080
 do it alone or have a guide 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.010
 of mountain today in scalibor direct routes 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.010
 guided with your pet 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.449
 and a group of mountain guides has 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.230
 decided to organize this type of routes of 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 where the idea arose 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.600
 and we have many friends who had their 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.120
 pet and they used to go to places like 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.240
 timely option to the pedriza sites 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.880
 where there was much massification much 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.190
 transit of people and looking for a place 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.730
 a little calmer to be able 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.430
 be with your pets 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.890
 We started this project with people who 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.170
 I wanted to enjoy the mountain but in a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.960
 environment more we feel that we have to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.640
 carry in the backpack for our dog 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.350
 Well first of all carry 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 tied to your dog to go with you 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.869
 to enjoy the field you 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.550
 carry everything we have to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 take to the mountain but also our 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.710
 partner with us so then 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.710
 bring your water a little food a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 small kit or if our best friend is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.250
 it hurts and above all, a lot of desire 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.369
 because it's a great way to enjoy 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.869
 from the monte very good company when 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.490
 we went to the mountain with our dog 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.130
 we have to bear in mind that the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.720
 processionary can be deadly one of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.520
 the dangers that dogs have is the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.680
 processionary that occurs in pine area 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.350
 here aspen castaÃ±ar not 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.640
 we have that problem we also have to 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 bring our dogs protected 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.080
 in front of external parasites like fleas 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.600
 ticks and phlebotomine transmitters of 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.100
 good leishmaniasis on the route that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.810
 we are doing and for example we have 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.360
 water lines 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.040
 that runs along the creek and there's 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.870
 standing water and you have to be careful 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.470
 with parasites the mosquitoes shoes 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.750
 we have all these areas and that with a 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.350
 good antiparasitic necklace we can 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.030

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.170

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.120
 difficulty obviously we have different 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.750
 levels of excursions depending on 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.170
 the durability the technical difficulty of
