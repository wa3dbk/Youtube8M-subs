00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.500
 pierre-alain there is a glass ok that 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.240
 what's more a parrot compared 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.950
 to other birds it's more 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.720
 smart that's a gray parrot 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.740
 Gabon has an intelligence 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.200
 special 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.029
 scientists say they have to 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.189
 pretty much an intellectual capacity 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.930
 a child of 5 years we imagine finally 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.329
 me it's the clichÃ© that I have that the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.770
 parrot is a bird that all speak 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.480
 do not speak but the gabon is 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.470
 certainly the best speaker that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.079
 we can know 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.000
 and when we say speak they repeat 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.980
 sounds he hears or understands a little 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.550
 little the liquids completely the words to 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.559
 advisedly 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.289
 there really the ability to create a real 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.640
 link via the word with his accomplice he 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.379
 can talk about just about every 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.690
 languages this ability he take it in 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.309
 France the cci there he has the ability to 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.929
 produce complex sounds and words 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.570
 and then even after it's 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.100
 Japanese or French he would adapt 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.390
 completely so it works like a 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.070
 child so that means he needs him 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.870
 to learn it is necessary to teach him 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.819
 the trained one has to spend time with 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.770
 him and quite how much of 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.729
 words there is an average that's pretty much 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.350
 of 200 mo on a gray parrot that is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.420
 a little trained already 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 you have to spend about how many hours 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.290
 minimum per day 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 with him there is not necessarily time 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.770
 specified that it should be 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 time already let him go free go 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.520
 talk to him fondling him out in the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.590
 house is really very important 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.630
 allows what they thrive and who 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 change a little bit of air he has a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.659
 quite exclusive behavior with the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.920
 person with whom they spend the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.810
 more time they need to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.789
 see that it is a full part of 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.770
 the family positioned to cage in a 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.770
 where the family lives 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.840
 I heard that some 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.190
 gray owners of the gabon in all 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.740
 four parrots in their absence 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 was putting radio or TV 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.430
 it's recommended or thinks it's necessary 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.740
 favor contact with his 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.620
 parrot and the enrichment of his 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.590
 middle after I have heard too 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.170
 so it is possible that it brings them 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 a little company that's crazy 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.369
 it's a game that exists for kids 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 and had created gabon that are 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.770
 able to do it with 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.630
 training quite yeah we're going 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.580
 on enriching the environment 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.870
 stimulation is rather understands his 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.520
 parrot we will spend a little while 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.530
 with him as we would do with a 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.300
 child there is an all in one relational 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.370
 who is also around the candy 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.840
 when he does well but we reward him 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.360
 Ouch that's important 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.270
 quite is it better in 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.500
 to have 2 or only one gray of the gabon in 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.360
 nature is a bird that is 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.400
 gregarious do not forget about them 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.260
 keep 2 in a cage that avoids 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.280
 boredom that prevents them from finding the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.590
 days too long when you're 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.600
 absent but with all we can 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.640
 bring in their environment in their cage 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.620
 the stimulations the puzzles the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.470
 games we can very well maintain a single 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.370
 bird there is no problem against that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.880
 requires a little bit of 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.880
 time with him 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120
 and
