00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 actually the book is called fucking 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.849
 cancer is a book that counts in a 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.660
 autobiographical book let's say a novel 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 autobiographical where he is written in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.789
 dyes of humor the idea is power 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.230
 recover those things that still in the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.529
 Middle of the tragedy are fun 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 in the basic premise I say the intention 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.129
 it's not making people laugh but it 's my way of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.550
 If so I write so well did this come 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.770
 as work the experience is humor I was 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.410
 in the most painful process came after 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.809
 over time it does not always pass 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.089
 always with me I laugh when I 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.610
 trophy and from which he laughs when he falls 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.769
 to the floor and I'm one of those who quickly 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.110
 I can laugh at some things like 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.430
 I also cry very easily and I think 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.469
 that the book has a bit of both 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 things all the way it occurred to me 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.550
 no title just that was the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.329
 situation was in a dilemma I did not 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 I knew how to name it and I just wrote 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 I did not know either is my first novel 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.800
 so I did not know whether to put together chapters 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.930
 but put together how to do it and in this the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.789
 well, thank the editorial that had 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.740
 the occurrence and I thought it was great 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.030
 I truly thought that the name 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.220
 that the book had to have 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.040
 and this book really liked me first 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.790
 I said no because I thought that being treated 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.130
 of the topic cancer was a self-help issue 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.380
 and I do not like self-help 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.869
 Everyone sets their way but not me 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.880
 like self-help the most in the hand of 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.610
 psychoanalysis short but when I read it 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 I found it a very interesting book 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 Then I tried it on 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.200
 it's a book to read it 's a book but 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.020
 What the madman has is that she 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.230
 plant undoing death why and 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.330
 about her about herself not so but 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.900
 make humor about one's own cancer 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.800
 thing and a risk and a value 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.800
 and I loved it
