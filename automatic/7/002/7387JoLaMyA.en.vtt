00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
my favorite and it's also one of the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:27.950 
my favorite and it's also one of the
most<00:00:16.379> basic<00:00:16.650> steps<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.599> was<00:00:27.779> saying

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
most basic steps so like I was saying

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
most basic steps so like I was saying
before<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.529> move<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> done<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> faster

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
before this move is done to you faster

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.600 
before this move is done to you faster
beats<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.199> example<00:00:31.679> electronics<00:00:32.460> or

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
beats so for example electronics or

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.319 
beats so for example electronics or
house<00:00:33.149> music<00:00:33.660> anywhere<00:00:34.350> from<00:00:34.559> 120<00:00:35.430> beats<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
house music anywhere from 120 beats and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.680 
house music anywhere from 120 beats and
up<00:00:36.780> alright<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.430> move<00:00:38.790> itself<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.480> broken

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
up alright so this move itself is broken

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.479 
up alright so this move itself is broken
down<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.649> couple<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.190> different

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
down into a couple of different

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.420 
down into a couple of different
movements<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.540> others<00:00:43.260> yes<00:00:43.680> first<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
movements just like others yes first of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.700 
movements just like others yes first of
all<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.700> stuff<00:00:44.940> touch<00:00:45.180> motion<00:00:45.450> no<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.200> one

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
all this stuff touch motion no this one

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
all this stuff touch motion no this one
is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:47.489> different<00:00:47.910> unlike<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
is a little bit different unlike the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.930 
is a little bit different unlike the
other<00:00:48.840> stuff<00:00:49.320> touchy<00:00:49.559> variations<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.730> one

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
other stuff touchy variations this one

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.389 
other stuff touchy variations this one
is<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> little<00:00:51.539> bit<00:00:51.690> quicker<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.949> footwork

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is a little bit quicker so the footwork

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.819 
is a little bit quicker so the footwork
is<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.910> actually<00:00:54.690> we'll<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.410> tempo

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
is so actually we'll go on this tempo

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.970 
is so actually we'll go on this tempo
five<00:00:56.460> six<00:00:57.059> seven<00:00:57.840> eight<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.440> two<00:00:58.789> one<00:00:59.789> two

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
five six seven eight and one two one two

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
five six seven eight and one two one two
one<00:01:01.980> two<00:01:02.359> notice<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.110> quicker<00:01:04.350> than

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
one two notice it's a lot quicker than

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
one two notice it's a lot quicker than
he<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.519> before<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:06.060> goes<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.360> this

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
he was from before which goes like this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.000 
he was from before which goes like this
one<00:01:07.020> two<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:10.140> two

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
one two one two one two one two

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.620 
one two one two one two one two
so<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> quick<00:01:16.340> alright<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> second

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so it's quick alright so the second

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.560 
so it's quick alright so the second
motion<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.220> swing<00:01:20.729> motion<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.390> this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
motion here is the swing motion and this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
motion here is the swing motion and this
one<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.020> also<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.710> bit<00:01:23.009> different

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
one is also a little bit different

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.149 
one is also a little bit different
because<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.689> step<00:01:25.049> itself<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.740> quicker

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
because the step itself is quicker

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.670 
because the step itself is quicker
what's<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.210> happen<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.619> to

what's going to happen is I'm going to
show<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.280> trick<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> thinking

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:24.050 
alright pretty simple right it's a
little<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.600> quicker<00:02:15.780> 5<00:02:16.260> 6<00:02:16.860> 7<00:02:17.700> 8<00:02:18.000> &amp;<00:02:18.270> 1<00:02:18.300> 2<00:02:18.980> 1<00:02:19.980> 1<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
little bit quicker 5 6 7 8 &amp; 1 2 1 1 the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.480 
little bit quicker 5 6 7 8 &amp; 1 2 1 1 the
second<00:02:24.480> part<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.950> tricky<00:02:26.459> part

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
second part here this is the tricky part

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.000 
second part here this is the tricky part
so<00:02:27.209> what<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.050> want<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.320> do<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.800> want<00:02:28.950> to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
so what you want to do is you want to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.390 
so what you want to do is you want to
have<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.430> nice<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.150> flowy<00:02:30.600> smooth<00:02:31.560> motion<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
have a nice and flowy smooth motion and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300 
have a nice and flowy smooth motion and
the<00:02:32.940> trick<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:34.110> think<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.890> your<00:02:35.070> head

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the trick to that is think of your head

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.360 
the trick to that is think of your head
being<00:02:35.670> stuck<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.990> center<00:02:37.470> here<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.160> for

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
being stuck to the center here so for

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.970 
being stuck to the center here so for
example<00:02:38.850> my<00:02:39.209> head<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.600> being<00:02:39.870> locked<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.709> box

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
example my head is being locked in a box

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.340 
example my head is being locked in a box
that<00:02:41.610> cannot<00:02:42.240> move<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.110> head<00:02:43.320> is

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
that cannot move so my head is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.320 
that cannot move so my head is
stationary<00:02:44.070> while<00:02:44.459> my<00:02:44.580> body<00:02:44.760> can't<00:02:45.090> go<00:02:45.239> around

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
stationary while my body can't go around

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.530 
stationary while my body can't go around
like<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:48.260> my<00:02:49.260> head<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.920> stuck<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.790> space

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
like this my head is stuck in this space

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.920 
like this my head is stuck in this space
of<00:02:51.810> area<00:02:52.290> looks<00:02:52.860> really<00:02:53.190> silly<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.610> know<00:02:53.730> but

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
of area looks really silly I know but

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.570 
of area looks really silly I know but
give<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.170> try<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.709> what's<00:02:55.890> gonna<00:02:56.010> happen<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
give it a try so what's gonna happen is

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.120 
give it a try so what's gonna happen is
imagine<00:02:57.090> yourself<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:58.080> your<00:02:58.230> head<00:02:58.470> stuck<00:02:58.890> in

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
imagine yourself with your head stuck in

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.310 
imagine yourself with your head stuck in
this<00:02:59.400> area<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.820> in<00:02:59.970> space<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.170> walk

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
this area is in space and you can walk

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.720 
this area is in space and you can walk
around<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.950> your<00:03:02.430> head<00:03:02.750> stuck<00:03:04.220> at<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.430> spot

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
around with your head stuck at that spot

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.860 
around with your head stuck at that spot
so<00:03:06.380> once<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:07.860> type<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.750> concept<00:03:09.750> in

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
so once you have that type of concept in

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.750 
so once you have that type of concept in
your<00:03:10.019> head<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.950> technique<00:03:11.370> for<00:03:11.610> you

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
your head this is the technique for you

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.090 
your head this is the technique for you
to<00:03:11.970> move<00:03:12.269> really<00:03:12.630> smoothly<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.530> take<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.860> look

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
to move really smoothly so take a look

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.220 
to move really smoothly so take a look
I'm<00:03:14.370> gonna<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.970> regular<00:03:15.360> step<00:03:15.630> touch<00:03:18.230> but

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
I'm gonna do the regular step touch but

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.260 
I'm gonna do the regular step touch but
I'm<00:03:19.380> gonna<00:03:19.560> apply<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.190> technique<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.880> it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
I'm gonna apply that technique to it

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.690 
I'm gonna apply that technique to it
my<00:03:21.390> head<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.960> stuck<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:23.010> space<00:03:23.310> right

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
my head is stuck in this space right

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.490 
my head is stuck in this space right
here<00:03:24.120> alright<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.020> gonna<00:03:25.140> look<00:03:25.230> like

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
here alright so it's gonna look like

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.230 
here alright so it's gonna look like
this<00:03:30.770> notice<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.950> difference<00:03:32.340> once<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.060> get

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
this notice the difference once you get

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.100 
this notice the difference once you get
used<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.600> that

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
used to that

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.530 
used to that
everything<00:03:34.920> changes<00:03:35.400> your<00:03:35.670> body<00:03:35.850> start

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
everything changes your body start

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.320 
everything changes your body start
moving<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.560> different<00:03:38.010> type<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.180> more

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
moving in a different type so one more

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.690 
moving in a different type so one more
time<00:03:39.360> my<00:03:39.780> head<00:03:39.990> is<00:03:40.200> stuck<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.710> this<00:03:40.920> space<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
time my head is stuck in this space and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.150 
time my head is stuck in this space and
I'm<00:03:41.850> gonna<00:03:42.030> do<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.330> step<00:03:42.510> touch<00:03:42.720> slowly<00:03:43.620> and

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
I'm gonna do this step touch slowly and

00:03:44.160 --> 00:04:04.670 
I'm gonna do this step touch slowly and
they're<00:03:44.280> not<00:03:44.370> gonna<00:03:44.550> speed<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:44.910> up<00:03:45.090> so<00:04:03.680> alright

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
they're not gonna speed it up so alright

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.380 
they're not gonna speed it up so alright
so<00:04:04.920> putting<00:04:05.340> those<00:04:05.610> two<00:04:05.940> things<00:04:05.970> together

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
so putting those two things together

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.140 
so putting those two things together
you'll<00:04:07.140> get<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.530> variation<00:04:08.130> for<00:04:08.580> this<00:04:08.880> step

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
you'll get the variation for this step

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.660 
you'll get the variation for this step
touch<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.660> faster<00:04:10.260> music<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.920> hope<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.400> found
