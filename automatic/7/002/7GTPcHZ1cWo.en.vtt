Caesar has been acquitted does it left

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.160 
Caesar has been acquitted does it left
back<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:05.730> why's<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:05.970> he's<00:03:06.300> very<00:03:06.360> tight<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.900> JT

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170

in<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> app<00:03:07.710> see<00:03:08.010> me<00:03:08.100> because<00:03:08.280> obviously<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
in the app see me because obviously the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.750 
in the app see me because obviously the
lack<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.910> pace<00:03:09.350> but<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:11.550> that's<00:03:11.670> one

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
lack of pace but and I think that's one

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.800 
lack of pace but and I think that's one
of<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.910> reasons<00:03:12.090> why<00:03:12.180> Felipe<00:03:12.330> we<00:03:12.660> still

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
of the reasons why Felipe we still

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.150 
of the reasons why Felipe we still
getting<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.050> team<00:03:13.230> by<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.410> way<00:03:13.560> quick<00:03:13.950> site

getting the team by the way quick site
dog<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.520> i<00:03:14.670> think<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:14.970> because<00:03:15.060> he<00:03:15.210> doesn't

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
dog is i think is because he doesn't

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.160 
dog is i think is because he doesn't
give<00:03:15.570> as<00:03:15.660> much<00:03:15.780> cover<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.260> JT<00:03:16.730> um<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:19.140> know

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
give as much cover to JT um but you know

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.500

when stuff was going wrong i think going

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.130

Nemanja<00:04:51.900> i<00:04:52.490> think<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.580> problem<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:53.910> is<00:04:54.120> that

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
Nemanja i think the problem is is that

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.210
