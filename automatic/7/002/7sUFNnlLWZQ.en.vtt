00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello to everything so today like 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.259
 promised the famous video to show 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.250
 how do I do my ripples with his 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.330
 little bug that in this case it's me 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 ghd hair straightener is a small bomb 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.470
 I really tested a lot and a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.400
 other brand that I like a lot but 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 so this one I think it's 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.730
 really top of the top in terms of speed 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 of heating of results on the hair 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 see today I have high schools 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.469
 so this morning after shampoo so 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.180
 let it dry is normally and I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.190
 will take the opportunity to show you the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.579
 results 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.140
 if you will see well so the rendering very 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.710
 very smooth very bright also 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 horses so here without needing to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.280
 to spend the pint is said a thousand times 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.960
 only passage really enough yes 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.750
 it's really great so here I'm going 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.879
 show how I do my loops so 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.060
 to proceed with the ripple so already 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.330
 the first thing is to separate the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.369
 hair in two pieces 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.850
 here on each side the idea to the press 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.400
 and also to redo a separation like 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 so in this sense there you tie the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 upper part is missing above 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.450
 start with wavy on each side the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.420
 lower parties that was so there was 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.329
 I'm just going to show you the gesture 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.869
 so will not be very academic as I 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.640
 usually do 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 and if at least you reported 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.619
 of the way I proceed so we go 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.740
 take a wick so not too much son 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.740
 but not too much and not either and after 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 to go a little too much to think that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.189
 the months I do not have a mirror it's not 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.780
 easy we will come to take the wick and 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:08.840
 for you my tour we do it all in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.840
 continuing to go down 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.560
 second example appears so we resume 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.879
 a wick I did not hear the step soon 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.110
 the root actually I find that more 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.330
 pretty when it's only about 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.470
 lengths after it's up to you to see this 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:39.950
 that you want to see so always this 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:39.950
 land ulation effect started i turn 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.690
 it's pouring rain is awesome 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.560
 I say to myself here 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.870
 so I do not know if you're going 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.829
 already count of the result so what I 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.440
 I will continue 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.709
 on this part and I take you back 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.910
 just after to meet later 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.010
 so here I finished the loops of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.319
 this side so like that you can see 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.190
 a little bit the results already then 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.379
 on the other hand today I have hair 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.680
 but gas electric was unbearable 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.799
 as soon as I admit that the holidays are 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.709
 so I put a little bit of reporting 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.069
 a pure product I can not do it anymore I have 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.220
 used a spray actually shine 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.290
 the little Marseillais here I had 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.609
 had a little bob I think just 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.150
 here to moisten a little bit 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.359
 hair to avoid this side completely 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:41.970
 here he explains I'll show you 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:43.919
 a few squatting locks here it is 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.489
 I attach a little bit but hot from 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.489
 above that I 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.060
 I think you will understand a little 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.900
 the gesture I think but I think there is 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.519
 different technics 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.290
 after that it's mine I did everything 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.380
 like that so seems to have seen in 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.720
 other videos than sick I 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.380
 did not really read the same return is 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.460
 not necessarily meije in the same direction 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.270
 good after I want to say it's you 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.930
 who see according to your hair from 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.930
 help too 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.410
 v also curly hair the wick 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.449
 leaving older steam bar if you 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.289
 really want more volume made 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:57.840
 I like it when his people are here 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.129
 japan that sweet I do not want to do everything 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.099
 head like that because if not to go 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:07.610
 until that even if it's fast I'm going 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.610
 not sure that it is hyper interesting 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.039
 So I'll make this stuff the spine 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.330
 days hop 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.759
 let's go a little bit after 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:27.030
 I continue off camera and I you 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:32.240
 shows the final result and so here 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:39.990
 I finished the loops on each side 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:42.210
 I miss the opportunity to give a pretty 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.909
 there is no need to do too much 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.960
 more 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:50.810
 so now two solutions be you 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.700
 use a 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:58.240
 a serum a city for really good 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:01.120
 very well define the loops or so 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.440
 your technique that I like 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.970
 there you have sight and fright she is going 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.020
 all brushed and everything is going away and well 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:12.700
 no so I take the brush does I 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.700
 come big half an hour 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.750
 you see on the one hand that the loops 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:27.380
 rest and then so that it really comes 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.970
 give a very very glamorous side actually 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.170
 hair is defined but more 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.600
 I do not know how to say you see the 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.540
 difference so between this side where young 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.670
 and brushed who is very pretty too and 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.820
 the one where we have something really 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.860
 moreover I do not find the word but I 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.220
 think you'll understand me the most 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.860
 glamorous more than natural too 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:57.800
 that's what I like so I'll tell you 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.260
 join on the other side and I 'm going 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.010
 do the same thing 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.010
 you have a menu 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:17.960
 I can see and so that's it 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.830
 shows one last time the result 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.830
 final back 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.810
 here is gingham so listen I hope I 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.880
 you would have given some leads from 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.890
 blow to get to you waved them 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.450
 hair with your doing if you have 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.340
 questions do not hesitate acted 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.030
 will answer with ceiling showcases and 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.030
 then forget very quickly
