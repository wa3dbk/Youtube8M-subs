we've got a G chord now together to play
cleanly<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:00.840> said<00:02:01.020> before<00:02:01.170> you'll<00:02:01.500> need<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
cleanly as I said before you'll need to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.440 
cleanly as I said before you'll need to
make<00:02:01.980> sure<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:02.430> arch<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.790> hand<00:02:03.180> otherwise

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
make sure you arch your hand otherwise

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.890 
make sure you arch your hand otherwise
you<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.410> sort<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.830> damp<00:02:05.130> notes<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:05.900> and

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
you get sort of damp notes like that and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.550 
you get sort of damp notes like that and
simply<00:02:07.380> let<00:02:07.560> all<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.950> notes<00:02:08.190> ring<00:02:08.460> out<00:02:09.560> so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
simply let all the notes ring out so

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.910 
simply let all the notes ring out so
that's<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:11.070> that's<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.730> play<00:02:12.060> AG<00:02:12.450> chord<00:02:13.050> on
