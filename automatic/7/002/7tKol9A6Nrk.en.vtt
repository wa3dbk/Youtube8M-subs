00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
around not sure what this is it's like a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.020 
around not sure what this is it's like a
soft<00:03:48.010> rubber<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.370> think<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:51.280> then<00:03:51.430> as<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.880> get

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
soft rubber I think but then as you get

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.470 
soft rubber I think but then as you get
from<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.990> part<00:03:53.320> of<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.500> shoe<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.060> toe

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
from this part of the shoe to the toe

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.650 
from this part of the shoe to the toe
box<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:56.020> becomes<00:03:56.830> leather<00:03:57.220> goes<00:03:58.180> from<00:03:58.360> suede

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
box it becomes leather goes from suede

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.410 
box it becomes leather goes from suede
to<00:03:58.870> leather<00:03:59.080> so<00:03:59.260> that's<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.470> nice<00:03:59.620> transition

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
to leather so that's a nice transition

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.850 
to leather so that's a nice transition
you<00:04:01.420> have<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.660> Jordan<00:04:02.110> emblem<00:04:02.440> on<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.590> tongue

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
you have the Jordan emblem on the tongue

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.100 
you have the Jordan emblem on the tongue
the<00:04:03.250> tongue<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.580> leather<00:04:03.760> top<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.780> Tungus

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
the tongue is leather top of the Tungus

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.840 
the tongue is leather top of the Tungus
leather<00:04:05.290> then<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.220> goes<00:04:06.370> down<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.700> being
