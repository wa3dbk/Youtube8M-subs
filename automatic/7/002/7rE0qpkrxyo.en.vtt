00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
compromise going forward on a whole

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910 
compromise going forward on a whole
range<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:39.030> issues<00:00:39.559> let<00:00:40.559> me<00:00:40.649> give<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> an

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
range of issues let me give you an

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.580 
range of issues let me give you an
example<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:42.690> issue<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.989> energy<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> i<00:00:43.469> just

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
example the issue of energy that i just

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.850 
example the issue of energy that i just
mentioned<00:00:44.300> i<00:00:45.469> think<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> lot<00:00:46.829> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
mentioned i think there are a lot of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
mentioned i think there are a lot of
republicans<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> ran<00:00:47.820> against<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.840> energy

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
republicans that ran against the energy

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.330 
republicans that ran against the energy
bill<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.860> passed<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.879> house<00:00:51.149> last<00:00:51.870> year

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
bill that passed in the house last year

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.220 
bill that passed in the house last year
and<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.789> doubtful<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.930> could<00:00:55.110> get

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and so it's doubtful that you could get

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
and so it's doubtful that you could get
the<00:00:55.350> votes<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.860> pass<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.000> through<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> house

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the votes to pass that through the house

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.170 
the votes to pass that through the house
this<00:00:57.780> year<00:00:58.100> or<00:00:59.100> next<00:00:59.160> year<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.510> year<00:01:00.539> after

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
this year or next year or the year after

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
this year or next year or the year after
but<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.510> doesn't<00:01:03.840> mean<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.379> an

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but that doesn't mean there is an

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
but that doesn't mean there is an
agreement<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:06.240> should<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> better

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
agreement that we should have a better

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
agreement that we should have a better
energy<00:01:06.930> policy<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> let's<00:01:10.350> find<00:01:10.740> those

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
energy policy and so let's find those

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.679 
energy policy and so let's find those
areas<00:01:11.640> where<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.450> agree<00:01:13.580> we've<00:01:14.580> got<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
areas where we can agree we've got I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.580 
areas where we can agree we've got I
think<00:01:16.290> broad<00:01:16.560> agreement<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:18.380> we've<00:01:19.380> got

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
think broad agreement that we've got

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.039 
think broad agreement that we've got
terrific<00:01:20.520> natural<00:01:21.000> gas<00:01:21.210> resources<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
terrific natural gas resources in this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.990 
terrific natural gas resources in this
country<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:23.340> doing<00:01:23.549> everything<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:23.970> can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
to develop those there's a lot of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
to develop those there's a lot of
agreement<00:01:26.759> around<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> make<00:01:27.900> sure

efficiency standards on cars and trucks
we<00:02:06.540> didn't<00:02:06.750> even<00:02:06.810> need<00:02:06.990> legislation<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.829> just

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
we didn't even need legislation we just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.589 
we didn't even need legislation we just
needed<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> cooperation<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.970> automakers<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
needed the cooperation of automakers and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.760 
needed the cooperation of automakers and
auto<00:02:10.229> workers<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
auto workers and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.410 
auto workers and
investors<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:12.920> other<00:02:12.980> shareholders<00:02:13.700> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
investors and other shareholders and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.940 
investors and other shareholders and
that's<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.850> move<00:02:16.850> us<00:02:16.970> forward<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:18.800> a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
that's going to move us forward in a

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.820 
that's going to move us forward in a
serious<00:02:19.310> way<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:21.290> know<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.380> think<00:02:21.620> when<00:02:21.740> it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
serious way so you know I think when it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.250 
serious way so you know I think when it
comes<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.280> something<00:02:22.790> like<00:02:22.970> energy<00:02:23.570> what

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
comes to something like energy what

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
comes to something like energy what
we're<00:02:24.410> probably<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.860> have<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.040> do<00:02:25.160> is

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
we're probably going to have to do is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.220 
we're probably going to have to do is
say<00:02:25.460> here<00:02:25.970> are<00:02:26.000> some<00:02:26.180> areas<00:02:26.450> where<00:02:26.810> there's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
say here are some areas where there's

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.510 
say here are some areas where there's
just<00:02:27.410> too<00:02:27.530> much<00:02:27.680> disagreement<00:02:28.220> between

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
just too much disagreement between

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.250 
just too much disagreement between
Democrats<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.240> Republicans<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.840> can't<00:02:30.080> get

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
Democrats and Republicans we can't get

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.210 
Democrats and Republicans we can't get
this<00:02:30.410> done<00:02:30.710> right<00:02:30.950> now<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:32.450> let's<00:02:32.720> not<00:02:32.810> wait

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
this done right now but let's not wait

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.200 
this done right now but let's not wait
let's<00:02:34.220> go<00:02:34.340> ahead<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.550> start<00:02:34.790> making<00:02:34.940> some

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
let's go ahead and start making some

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.730 
let's go ahead and start making some
progress<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.930> things<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.290> we<00:02:36.380> do<00:02:36.500> agree

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
progress on the things that we do agree

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.270 
progress on the things that we do agree
on<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.850> we<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.900> continue<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.800> strong

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
on and we can continue to have a strong

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.770 
on and we can continue to have a strong
and<00:02:40.520> healthy<00:02:40.760> debate<00:02:40.910> about<00:02:41.180> those<00:02:41.480> areas

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
and healthy debate about those areas

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.260 
and healthy debate about those areas
where<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:42.050> don't
