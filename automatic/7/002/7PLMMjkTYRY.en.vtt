00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 very good chocolates that is because 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.220
 I'm great perfectly welcome to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.080
 some videos my channel I bring them a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.769
 partidita playing in call of duty and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.540
 mountebanks with the atlas with the model 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.219
 of this elite that touched me that already 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.550
 I taught it from one of the before the video 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.710
 take and double low with the atlas of 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 propellers as the snej was called but 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 something like that with the golden camouflage that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.880
 it remained the truth is that it is very 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 cool to wing blast and good said to throw 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.820
 a little game because when you finish the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.440
 road to diamond mors I asked in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.989
 last episode would like you to do 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.390
 a road to diamond atlas and then 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 Many people told me that if I did 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.800
 that they would be me I know how much so I 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.450
 had put to play because it does not take 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.820
 quite without playing the mayor to this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.410
 call of duty because this week I already 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.420
 I said in the videos because it was the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.820
 soldier has entered with exams and everything 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 the roll so I could not be so 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.059
 fully focused on playing and threw me 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.660
 a little game for the sake of saying come 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.190
 connected in fact I turn it on life 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.200
 of the one team 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.150
 knowing that it was not mediated on TV and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.400
 in the middle plan that passes that low 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.350
 cable the console that shit this and it was 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.000
 I had connected to the 360 because 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.640
 I was playing before playing open 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.130
 everything when I had been on the 360 ​​and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.329
 well the game came out a lot more 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.090
 a pair of unlocking camouflages 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.470
 before I realized the progress that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.960
 I was wearing from the camouflage then 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.399
 when the game was over I teach it and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.409
 made maria throw away for 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.939
 warm up a little to practice and 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.460
 as I unlock it looks for a flash is 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.549
 I say good so let's see as if this 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.670
 video was an episode 0 so 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.490
 let's say the road to diamond 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.130
 you talk that I only have left me 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.680
 there are the shots to the head 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.509
 I take the same progress from the shots to 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.780
 the head in the far shots and I 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.250
 the bloodthirsty ones are also missing I do not know 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.340
 what's wrong with me with this sniper 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.039
 that for example I put the horse and with 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.870
 the more can be more or less manage 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.720
 and yes that I take both to the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.750
 bloodthirsty since I took it out playing and 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 normal but with him with the monkey I do not know 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.870
 because it costs me much more now less 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.340
 bloodthirsty I do not know if it's because of the look 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.830
 because the look I like less than the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.980
 mors or I think what I said through 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:36.850
 which I said earlier 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.890
 with the atlas it costs me more 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.030
 do not really ask me why maybe 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.400
 because I'm used to using 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.170
 always a thermal pyramid in the morse that 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.540
 a look that we go seems to me the best 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.730
 look at the sniper and many 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.680
 you ask why I had a couple of 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.300
 mentions wondering what what 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.280
 accessory were good to get 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.730
 get the bloodthirsty with the sniper 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.410
 I can say that it takes away from me the mos 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.450
 I take off the thermal sight and I can not play 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.550
 with the sniper because they do not know me 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.590
 I like really like me not much output 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.210
 like the normal look that the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.400
 sniper because it happened very weird and 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.100
 maybe that's why I do not like the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.830
 laplace crosspiece 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.350
 and with the zoom lens variable if it is 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.150
 it's true that it's a little better 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.590
 but it takes longer to aim and you saw the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.580
 video that I made of the comparatives of 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.400
 all the sights of the sniper afternoon are going to 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.410
 point and you always have to do as 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.390
 zoom in on the look you know that 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.350
 has three increases the normal one that 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.350
 put a little more closely 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.240
 for my taste an increase to be able 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.810
 half handle that in conviction then 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.990
 then I do not like it and the case that this 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.990
 departure is cool if I'm going to do the road 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.820
 to the jam on mars or road no 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.380
 delay them from rock even better and what 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.950
 we have made me a mess 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.280
 incredible mental and I will not do road 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.830
 to 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.209
 royalty or a hyper kingship 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.610
 I have also seen some comments 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:10.050
 wondering I do not intend to do that because 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.330
 bone the 45 is a fucking trash and the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.830
 links I have not used the link what 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.750
 I tried at a friend's house when I had 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.280
 a game before it came out I tried it 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.470
 we paste the amount of haymarket singles 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.669
 amazing and designed this sniper what 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.380
 they used and I thought it was a whore 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.830
 shit and in fact I think we have 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.320
 little low on my account with the links 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.120
 in fact to some low it will be because I have 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.419
 picked up from the ground because I think no no 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.710
 I have never put the links on 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.250
 no class then 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.720
 I think I have answered everything 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.400
 wanted to 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.900
 this land of the goddess was jumping 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.360
 I'm trying , I've done it for 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.390
 get me the challenge of the heads but 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.280
 I can not get it, I did not get it and now 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.710
 you will see at the end of the game or that 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.970
 teach the progress that we take with the 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.040
 sniper atlas we carry more or 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.350
 less half still try to do what 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.580
 same as I did with the walrus not to do 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.470
 all episodes of far shots 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.450
 because that's a real pain in the ass 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.150
 far shots then let's say that 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.190
 I will accelerate on my own 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.140
 we have the collateral facts already done because 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.440
 with him with the laser much more 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.420
 simple that with the walrus with love 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.500
 had to be collateral with the atlas 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.480
 you have seen at the beginning of the gameplay 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.920
 how do I get two very fast casualties and that 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.720
 tell me as if it were the double low 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.250
 that with the morse for the cadence that 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.780
 has can not click with the morse and 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.450
 that has to be collateral with the atlas 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.280
 it can not be doping very fast here what 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.200
 there's how the camouflage gives me and 7 and 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.249
 camouflage of neptune the blue one says that 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.089
 good 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:43.609
 it's cool and here we see the process of 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:45.589
 progress that I take from national and percy 

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:47.599
 that will start with the road to diamond 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:49.729
 high I do not know when you will have the first 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.949
 let's say we are a pre episode of 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.709
 the series so we 'll see you soon with 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.309
 the beginning of this series us and 

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.999
 until next time 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:57.999
 bye
