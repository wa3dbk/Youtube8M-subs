00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
metal and the Rings do really really

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.070 
metal and the Rings do really really
good

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
good

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.620 
good
it<00:01:53.500> has<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.740> USM<00:01:54.430> focusing<00:01:55.090> motor<00:01:55.330> which<00:01:55.600> is

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
it has a USM focusing motor which is

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.650 
it has a USM focusing motor which is
really<00:01:56.200> fast<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.710> really<00:01:57.040> quiet<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.660> another

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
really fast and really quiet and another

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.180 
really fast and really quiet and another
cool<00:01:58.900> thing<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.500> barrel<00:01:59.830> doesn't

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
cool thing is that the barrel doesn't

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.109 
cool thing is that the barrel doesn't
extend<00:02:00.610> or<00:02:01.020> turn<00:02:02.020> around<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.890> zoom<00:02:03.670> so

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
extend or turn around when you zoom so

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.810 
extend or turn around when you zoom so
you<00:02:04.240> can<00:02:04.570> fit<00:02:04.900> like<00:02:05.530> filters<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.400> protection

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
you can fit like filters and protection

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.940 
you can fit like filters and protection
glasses<00:02:07.150> are<00:02:07.210> really<00:02:07.300> easy<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.900> won't<00:02:08.830> get

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
glasses are really easy and won't get

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.160 
glasses are really easy and won't get
hassled<00:02:09.160> with<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.420> only<00:02:10.660> downside<00:02:11.140> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
hassled with that the only downside I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.630 
hassled with that the only downside I
think<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.860> don't<00:02:12.070> get<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> lens<00:02:12.550> hood

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
think is that you don't get a lens hood

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.160 
think is that you don't get a lens hood
and<00:02:12.910> especially<00:02:13.209> when<00:02:13.510> you'd<00:02:13.690> want<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.990> do

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
and especially when you'd want to do

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.830 
and especially when you'd want to do
landscape<00:02:15.130> photography<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.820> do<00:02:16.060> recommend<00:02:16.570> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
landscape photography I do recommend a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.630 
landscape photography I do recommend a
lens<00:02:17.050> hood<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> Sun<00:02:17.920> will<00:02:18.190> come<00:02:18.459> in

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
lens hood because the Sun will come in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.850 
lens hood because the Sun will come in
your<00:02:18.820> lens<00:02:19.060> because<00:02:19.840> it's<00:02:20.020> such<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> wide<00:02:20.620> angle

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
your lens because it's such a wide angle

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.640 
your lens because it's such a wide angle
I've<00:02:21.550> gotten<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.150> from<00:02:22.570> Canon<00:02:22.959> it's<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
I've gotten this one from Canon it's the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.229 
I've gotten this one from Canon it's the
e<00:02:23.680> w8<00:02:24.220> III<00:02:24.760> II<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:25.870> connects<00:02:26.709> really<00:02:26.890> easy

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
e w8 III II it just connects really easy

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.820 
e w8 III II it just connects really easy
and<00:02:28.239> then<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.810> have<00:02:28.989> yourself<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.470> real<00:02:29.620> cool

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
and then you have yourself a real cool
