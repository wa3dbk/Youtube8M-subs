00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490 
know it's going to be awesome especially
since<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.310> downloadable<00:01:21.000> gun<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.930> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
since it's a downloadable gun it's you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.359 
since it's a downloadable gun it's you
know<00:01:22.590> they're<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> give<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
know they're not going to give you a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
know they're not going to give you a
crappy<00:01:23.670> gun<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.060> least<00:01:24.210> I'd<00:01:24.330> hope<00:01:24.509> they

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
crappy gun or at least I'd hope they

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.170 
crappy gun or at least I'd hope they
wouldn't<00:01:25.229> give<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> crap<00:01:25.680> again<00:01:26.180> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
wouldn't give you a crap again the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.520 
wouldn't give you a crap again the
Peacekeeper<00:01:27.689> does<00:01:27.840> shoot<00:01:28.020> slower<00:01:28.259> than<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
Peacekeeper does shoot slower than the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
Peacekeeper does shoot slower than the
other<00:01:28.740> submachine<00:01:29.310> guns<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.060> probably

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
other submachine guns but that probably

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
other submachine guns but that probably
means<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.200> stronger<00:01:31.470> also<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
means that it's a lot stronger also it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.460 
means that it's a lot stronger also it
has<00:01:32.520> less<00:01:32.759> recoil<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.990> taken<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
has less recoil again it's taken that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
has less recoil again it's taken that
aspect<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> an<00:01:35.369> assault<00:01:35.670> rifle<00:01:35.729> less<00:01:36.540> recoil

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
aspect of an assault rifle less recoil

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
aspect of an assault rifle less recoil
easier<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> aim<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:37.890> sight<00:01:38.189> has<00:01:38.460> good

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
easier to aim down sight has good

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.460 
easier to aim down sight has good
distance<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.020> all<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.259> other

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
to bounce all over the place now I'm not

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.649 
to bounce all over the place now I'm not
sure<00:01:43.829> exactly<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.369> he's<00:01:44.460> using<00:01:44.909> wellness

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
sure exactly what he's using wellness

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.600 
sure exactly what he's using wellness
just<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.140> customized<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.890> might<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> grip<00:01:47.460> or

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just as customized it might be a grip or

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.679 
just as customized it might be a grip or
something<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.329> why<00:01:48.479> there's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
something that and that's why there's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
something that and that's why there's
not<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.840> much<00:01:49.200> recoil<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.250> here<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> some

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

to<00:02:24.710> kill<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.400> gun<00:02:25.550> does<00:02:25.820> seem<00:02:26.030> pretty<00:02:26.060> strong

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980

like<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.010> said<00:02:28.130> he<00:02:28.610> might<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.880> using<00:02:29.060> grip<00:02:29.420> but

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
like I said he might be using grip but

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.380 
like I said he might be using grip but
he<00:02:29.750> doesn't<00:02:30.080> have<00:02:30.110> much<00:02:30.500> much<00:02:31.100> recoil<00:02:31.490> on<00:02:31.910> this

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
he doesn't have much much recoil on this

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.910 
he doesn't have much much recoil on this
and<00:02:32.660> as<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.960> can<00:02:33.050> see<00:02:33.110> there's<00:02:33.380> some<00:02:33.410> bikes<00:02:33.710> I
