00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.360
 welcome to the most dangerous circuit 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.490
 of the formula 1 the tension here is at 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.990
 stars so far has been a fight between two 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.609
 only men 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 it's the last act of a long season 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.370
 incredibly dramatic the duel anymore 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.350
 bloody of the decade 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.140
 the rivalry between james hunt and niki lauda 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.410
 it is one of the most beautiful stories of it all 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.330
 sport and it is so extraordinary that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 people are definitely struggling to defend 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.910
 let it be true niki lauda and james hunt 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.430
 flank has wept a battle 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.520
 incredible between these two great pilots 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.489
 the film tells of 1976 when theirs 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 rivalry had a dramatic implication in the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.739
 wind that you hear is me blowing you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.769
 on the neck 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690
 next time they take you into the world 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.820
 of the formula 1 when speaking of the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 70s is said who were the years in 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.680
 where having sex was safe and driving was 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 dangerous every time I get in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340
 machine I accept 20 percent of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
 chance to die 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.540
 the denis approach which is the most 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.970
 professional rationale possible while 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 james hunt loved to have fun with women 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.830
 they say you are a bad child lived 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.390
 a wild life but he had a talent 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.540
 that allowed him to get into the car 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.310
 and go fast talk me not 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.900
 treat me like strangers and give you you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 with men to find normality 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.130
 they want to kill themselves by running in the car 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.469
 one of the most fascinating aspects of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 this story showed the courage 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.719
 those people constantly risking 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.159
 love is faster than you all go 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:45.720
 well then let's run 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.240
 both were dominated by desire 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 to win and the pinnacle of it all was the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:57.270
 of 1976 were ready to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.000
 risk your life to stay on top of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.369
 everything and will pay a price 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 this is sure they paid the price 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.810
 even if they managed to make their mark 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.720
 I feel responsible for what is you 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.870
 happened to win you while I struggled 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 with death if the manager also 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.390
 of my return in that car he speaks 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.820
 fears of friendship and fear 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.100
 overcome is two rivals that push themselves 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.690
 they are each other beyond all limits 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.410
 world champion and I'm about to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.000
 I can still reconfirm myself as a champion 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.000
 beat trust me 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.950
 with this film you enter a world of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.190
 which I wanted to appropriate and share 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.320
 with the spectators not only for the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.030
 drama of a story between life and 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 morgan but also for nature 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.600
 genuinely attractive of these two 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.150
 people 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 both fascinating witty series 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.240
 fearsome and I thought that 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.850
 combination of these two men the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.250
 their rivalry their relationship out 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.160
 from the runway their way of entering 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.770
 that world to become great pits 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.430
 something exciting and strong without 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.130
 doubt fascinating the closer you are to 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.650
 death the more you feel alive is a way 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.800
 fantastic to say and it's the only way to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.800
 to drive
