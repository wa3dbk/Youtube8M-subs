00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:10.130
 Thank you. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.130
 I will 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.220
 Hello, I go to the piano lecture teacher 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 We 're going to learn more about digital piano this time. 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.710
 A digital piano is an instrument that has a lot of advantages 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.020
 Pia and do not put itguyo shape 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.000
 Rat n mode contains the voices of 128 different instruments. 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 Not only Piano Woods 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.399
 120 Eight different sounds A great advantage of listening to other instruments 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.429
 I have. 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.980
 Um, no color separation and radeunga 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:52.350
 Sonic 3 or later, or the keyboard, these various functions or something accompaniment pattern 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.850
 Using features to shit 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 You can have a good musical activity. There are speakers out there 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.400
 So I played again through headphones 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 Also itguyo can also be stunted in conjunction with the contact and can also play again 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.500
 I have a lot of different benefits 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.579
 But now that this is an electronic store, you guys are now buying 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.670
 There are some people who are a little hard on you, basically digital piano 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:27.509
 When it is done, it is only 88 pieces 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.390
 If you say the keyboard 60 days 56 rooms Bar 61 Bent van 76 volumes Short sleeve 8 Only 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.719
 It's a lot like this. 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.390
 The digital piano has 88 keys. 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:42.270
 Well, there is now a product specification when you buy a back coat. 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:48.119
 It's exactly what we buy electronics. 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 If you look at the specifications, what kind of touch do you have? 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:02:00.570
 The tone is a few rhythm accompaniment rhythm patch and a few other sounds 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:04.140
 Another thing that night Tolls stop this new pungnap some other features there's no 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.600
 I am sure that various things are now written 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.730
 As a rule of thumb, I would like to compare price 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:20.430
 It 's good to have a number on it . 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:24.420
 Well , DeMarrie is basically a 128- tone thing . 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.430
 If it contains anything else, it's a better spec. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.930
 And the lead pitch , you can have these things . 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:39.510
 I have a few rhythms, including some rhythm. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.830
 Geureongeot 10 dogs come in Sharjah has reached that number is much more better in China 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.490
 I can see it. 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.910
 Yin Yan longer balancer so Thira 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:54.000
 That's a word out so you gotta show the number 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:03:00.360
 The ballast stage is represented by the number 64 128 something like this 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.550
 Balancing is what I want to control the keyboard 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.910
 I can do it. 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:13.620
 Slowly , when I hit it, I heard the loud noise from the following three guests 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:17.460
 When you take out the new accounting I hear that step to the sound 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.060
 64 steps, 128 per dog, now it is expressed in this way 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.960
 I will. 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:29.670
 That's why the digital piano now holds the electronics and the word digital 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:34.380
 Because they were there are also displayed as a number, so concertina Galloway 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.400
 It is a function , but it is said that because there are higher numbers, the higher the better 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.240
 I care. 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:45.180
 There may be a variety of other things besides that. 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:49.050
 So, when you look at these functions , 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:54.000
 Is it the same or 20 or 30? 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:57.330
 So if you look at the various items that are represented by numbers, 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.830
 If the number is higher still going a lot of good things are written 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.480
 It's basically a fortified MetaHelper Keyboard. It's a Hammer Key. 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:10.140
 When 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.190
 I played the usual acoustic piano and went to the hammers I wanted to 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.140
 here 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.359
 I feel like playing the hammer now just under the machine's 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.380
 Pickup and other 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.240
 It's a device, so if you can not afford it, 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.169
 BuiIding the space 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:35.940
 Because there is a common use of the mouse in all of it by convention 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:42.300
 In general, all of the eightteen voices are taken, 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:47.540
 So the more you use the functions, the better you judge the other things. 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:52.830
 When I made a comparison at the same price , 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.300
 A little more of the things represented in numbers are good models that have more jugglers 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.250
 You have to think. 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:03.300
 And these functions set the price range so 5 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.510
 When the price is 500,000 won, the price is 700,000 won. 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.969
 Sometimes these features are different. 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.009
 or 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:19.189
 Despite the absence of a few notes, the piano itself 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:24.499
 Uh, only a certain level again if I'm picked to be the price of the ellipse formed it 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:27.829
 Especially in the nerves or in such parts, there is now a line 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:29.179
 Also when opening tha grind 1,000,000 won 2,000,000 won 3,000,000 won as the 1st line 

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:35.479
 It is shaped 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:37.639
 Typically, when you use a lot of miles, most hand down to you based 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.149
 The app is making a purchase. 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:44.899
 Now, if that were to feature 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:49.189
 There is no missing feature here. 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:52.669
 There is no function. In this case , who has the same function, 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:55.999
 The price depends on how much you have 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:06:01.429
 And you do not know a good model. 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:04.269
 Well Well, I saw you far out on the digital piano in the following river again 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:04.269
 I'll see you.
