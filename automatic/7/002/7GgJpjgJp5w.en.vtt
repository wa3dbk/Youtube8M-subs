00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.460
 Hi guys, welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.730
 again today I 'm going to 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.419
 to do a very fast video and 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.519
 simple to make true this let's 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.820
 do we are going to be preparing a shampoo 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.070
 for true hair growth in 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.400
 this case we are I am using a 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.990
 brand shampoo soft truth this what 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.890
 What I do recommend is that they grab a 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.050
 shampoo that is transparent ok to that 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.419
 you see your hand that is 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.610
 transparent truth in the shampoo is very 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.790
 advisable since it is said that they bring 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.250
 less chemical or that is true then 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.110
 We are going to need a transparent shampoo 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.180
 no matter the brand 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.350
 we're going to need this a quarter of 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.540
 preferably white onion is said 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.809
 that can be used also be in love 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.950
 but it is more advisable to wash 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:02.150
 and a paper bag before continuing with 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.730

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.100

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.390

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.680
