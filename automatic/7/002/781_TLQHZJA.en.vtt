attack him for damage see my house does
not<00:05:51.620> go<00:05:51.919> down<00:05:52.099> it<00:05:52.370> does<00:05:52.610> not<00:05:52.970> ever<00:05:53.300> go<00:05:53.599> down

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
not go down it does not ever go down

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.719 
not go down it does not ever go down
that's<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.949> good<00:05:55.130> part<00:05:56.260> so<00:05:57.260> I<00:05:57.320> can<00:05:57.620> be<00:05:58.190> bosses

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
that's the good part so I can be bosses

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.189 
that's the good part so I can be bosses
with<00:05:58.940> value<00:05:59.210> losing<00:05:59.630> health<00:05:59.780> so<00:05:59.960> I<00:06:00.020> don't

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
with value losing health so I don't

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.750 
with value losing health so I don't
really<00:06:00.320> have<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.710> shield<00:06:01.340> myself<00:06:01.490> from

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
really have to shield myself from

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.560 
really have to shield myself from
anything<00:06:02.770> or<00:06:03.770> I<00:06:03.830> can<00:06:04.220> just<00:06:04.400> do<00:06:04.550> shield<00:06:04.880> much

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
anything or I can just do shield much

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.589 
anything or I can just do shield much
easier<00:06:06.020> but<00:06:06.770> doesn't<00:06:07.370> really<00:06:07.490> matter<00:06:07.729> so

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
easier but doesn't really matter so

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.330 
easier but doesn't really matter so
that's<00:06:08.840> how<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.110> can<00:06:09.530> use<00:06:09.590> an<00:06:09.889> action<00:06:10.159> replay

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
that's how you can use an action replay

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.779 
that's how you can use an action replay
it<00:06:10.849> works<00:06:11.150> for<00:06:11.360> mostly<00:06:11.659> any<00:06:11.900> game<00:06:12.789> sometimes

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.210 
it works for mostly any game sometimes
it<00:06:14.030> doesn't<00:06:14.180> work<00:06:14.389> for<00:06:14.659> all<00:06:14.720> the<00:06:15.080> games<00:06:15.289> but

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
it doesn't work for all the games but

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.390 
it doesn't work for all the games but
it's<00:06:16.729> really<00:06:17.030> fun<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.919> it<00:06:18.919> doesn't<00:06:19.159> affect

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400
