00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
this is the first one I got and I think

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.759 
this is the first one I got and I think
this<00:00:20.910> was<00:00:21.060> 40<00:00:21.480> something<00:00:21.720> dollars<00:00:22.050> which<00:00:22.529> was

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
this was 40 something dollars which was

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.340 
this was 40 something dollars which was
really<00:00:23.160> good<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.789> went<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> H&amp;M<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> i

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
really good because I went to H&amp;M and i

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.500 
really good because I went to H&amp;M and i
actually<00:00:25.560> spotted<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.490> pair<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.300> which

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
actually spotted a pair like this which

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.080 
actually spotted a pair like this which
I<00:00:27.599> really<00:00:27.810> liked<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.410> $60<00:00:29.250> before<00:00:29.820> tax

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
I really liked but it was $60 before tax

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
I really liked but it was $60 before tax
so<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.050> thought<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.590> flows<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.070> steal

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so I thought that this flows to steal

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.860 
so I thought that this flows to steal
and<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.000> actually<00:00:33.149> looked<00:00:33.450> better<00:00:33.570> than<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and it actually looked better than the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990 
and it actually looked better than the
one<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.020> H&amp;M<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.520> love<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.969> has

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
one at H&amp;M and I really love that it has

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
one at H&amp;M and I really love that it has
the<00:00:36.329> zipper<00:00:36.390> opening<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> back<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.070> one

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the zipper opening at the back it's one

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
the zipper opening at the back it's one
of<00:00:38.340> my<00:00:38.430> favorite<00:00:38.940> things<00:00:39.149> about<00:00:39.329> shoes<00:00:39.899> it's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of my favorite things about shoes it's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.860 
of my favorite things about shoes it's
just<00:00:40.559> sticking<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.399> feet<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.540> hate

just sticking my feet in because I hate

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.900 
just sticking my feet in because I hate

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

them and everything and I got these in a
size<00:00:46.920> 35<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> size<00:00:48.329> five<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.899> half

and<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.829> fit<00:00:50.190> me<00:00:50.219> quite<00:00:50.640> snug<00:00:51.030> but

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and these actually fit me quite snug but

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.510 
and these actually fit me quite snug but
I'm<00:00:51.809> pretty<00:00:52.020> sure<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.680> had<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> size<00:00:53.129> 6

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I'm pretty sure that if I had a size 6

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.750 
I'm pretty sure that if I had a size 6
which<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.030> size<00:00:54.329> size<00:00:55.079> 6<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.469> size<00:00:55.680> 36<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
which is a size size 6 a size 36 it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
which is a size size 6 a size 36 it
would<00:00:56.910> fit<00:00:57.120> me<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.660> well<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.289> just

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
would fit me just as well this was just

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200 
would fit me just as well this was just
a<00:00:58.680> little<00:00:58.829> snug<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> straps<00:00:59.969> over

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
a little snug so because the straps over

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
a little snug so because the straps over
here<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.449> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.899> thin<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.559> figured<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
here are kind of thin I figured that I

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.470 
here are kind of thin I figured that I
wouldn't<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.460> able<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.699> walk<00:01:02.879> too<00:01:03.120> long<00:01:03.300> in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
wouldn't be able to walk too long in

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690 
wouldn't be able to walk too long in
them<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.589> wrong<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.400> actually

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
them but I was wrong these are actually

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
them but I was wrong these are actually
pretty<00:01:05.880> comfortable<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.290> able<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pretty comfortable and I was able to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.920 
pretty comfortable and I was able to
walk<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> whole<00:01:08.130> day<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> them<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.720> didn't

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
walk a whole day in them and I didn't

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.420 
walk a whole day in them and I didn't
get<00:01:10.049> any<00:01:10.200> blisters<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.770> anything<00:01:10.920> over<00:01:11.250> here

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
get any blisters or anything over here

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
get any blisters or anything over here
