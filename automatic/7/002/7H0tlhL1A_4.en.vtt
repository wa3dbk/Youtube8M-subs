and join together these two edges and
we're<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> I'm

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
we're going to do that as we go so I'm

we're going to do that as we go so I'm
going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> attach<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.530> cream<00:01:17.100> color<00:01:17.460> yarn<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

going to attach my cream color yarn and
start<00:01:18.750> working<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.500> along<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.490> edge<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
start working my way along this edge and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
start working my way along this edge and
then<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.390> shall<00:01:21.720> come<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.560> show<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.830> how

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
then I shall come back and show you how

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.380 
then I shall come back and show you how
to<00:01:23.670> attach<00:01:24.180> these<00:01:25.049> two<00:01:25.380> together<00:01:26.150> alright<00:01:27.150> now

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to attach these two together alright now

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.140 
to attach these two together alright now
so<00:01:27.630> I've<00:01:27.869> started<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.740> edge<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:30.030> I'm

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
so I've started this edge and what I'm

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.469 
so I've started this edge and what I'm
going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:32.280> my<00:01:32.640> corner<00:01:33.240> or

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
going to do is just do my corner or

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.950 
going to do is just do my corner or
start<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.930> corner<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.640> normal<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.570> would<00:01:36.750> do

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
start my corner as normal so I would do

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
start my corner as normal so I would do
my<00:01:37.170> cluster<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.890> three<00:01:38.250> trebles<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
my cluster of three trebles in this

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.850 
my cluster of three trebles in this
corner<00:01:39.750> remember<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.780> UK<00:01:42.780> term<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.500> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
corner remember that's a UK term so this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.520 
corner remember that's a UK term so this
is<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.340> called<00:01:44.460> double<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> u.s.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
is actually called double in the u.s.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.830 
is actually called double in the u.s.
now<00:01:46.530> usually<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.399> would<00:01:47.520> chain<00:01:47.850> three<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
now usually we would chain three and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.050 
now usually we would chain three and
then<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.259> another<00:01:49.290> cluster<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.159> three<00:01:50.610> triples

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
then do another cluster of three triples

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.569 
then do another cluster of three triples
in<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:51.810> same<00:01:52.049> corner<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.430> we're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
in this very same corner but what we're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.940 
in this very same corner but what we're
going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.270> we're<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.899> chain<00:01:55.560> one

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
going to do is we're going to chain one

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.450 
going to do is we're going to chain one
and<00:01:56.659> instead<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.719> chaining<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.290> another<00:01:58.530> this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and instead of chaining in another this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.950 
and instead of chaining in another this
is<00:01:59.610> where<00:01:59.759> we're<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.149> start<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> join

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
is where we're going to start to join

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.679 
is where we're going to start to join
these<00:02:01.560> two<00:02:01.860> squares<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.180> I'm<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> pick

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
these two squares so I'm going to pick

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.670 
these two squares so I'm going to pick
up<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.020> square<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:05.070> at<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.060> corner<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.719> I'm

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
up this square I'm at the corner and I'm

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.699 
up this square I'm at the corner and I'm
going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> insert<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.610> hook<00:02:09.239> into<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.289> corner

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
going to insert my hook into that corner

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.910 
going to insert my hook into that corner
so<00:02:10.920> instead<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.459> chaining<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:12.569> going

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
so instead of chaining one now I'm going

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.160 
so instead of chaining one now I'm going
to<00:02:12.980> insert<00:02:13.370> my<00:02:13.550> hook<00:02:13.580> into<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.450> corner<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
to insert my hook into that corner and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.490 
to insert my hook into that corner and
I'm<00:02:15.920> going<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.370> grab<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.910> yarn<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.390> pull

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
I'm going to grab the yarn and pull

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.860 
I'm going to grab the yarn and pull
through<00:02:18.500> both<00:02:19.099> loops<00:02:19.550> on<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.150> hook<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.720> is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
through both loops on the hook that is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.530 
through both loops on the hook that is
going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.260> clasp<00:02:21.530> as<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.890> chain<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.180> has

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
going to clasp as a chain and that has

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.460 
going to clasp as a chain and that has
now<00:02:23.750> connected<00:02:24.440> those<00:02:24.709> two<00:02:25.120> squares<00:02:26.120> together

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
now connected those two squares together

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.110 
now connected those two squares together
then<00:02:27.470> going<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.770> yarn<00:02:28.160> over<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.700> pull<00:02:28.819> through

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
then going to yarn over and pull through

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.010 
then going to yarn over and pull through
to<00:02:29.720> make<00:02:29.959> our<00:02:30.200> third<00:02:30.800> chain<00:02:31.569> which<00:02:32.569> is<00:02:32.600> our

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
to make our third chain which is our

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.800 
to make our third chain which is our
corner<00:02:33.319> I'm<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.239> do<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
corner I'm then just going to do the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.590 
corner I'm then just going to do the
three<00:02:36.110> troubles<00:02:36.590> into<00:02:37.069> this<00:02:37.910> corner<00:02:38.390> as

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
three troubles into this corner as

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:48.250 
three troubles into this corner as
normal<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.709> one<00:02:42.190> two<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:45.850> three<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.260> now

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
normal so one two and three and now

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.990 
normal so one two and three and now
where<00:02:48.530> we<00:02:48.680> would<00:02:48.800> normally<00:02:48.980> chain<00:02:49.489> one<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
where we would normally chain one to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.300 
where we would normally chain one to
move<00:02:50.239> over<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> next<00:02:51.019> section<00:02:51.709> I'm

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
move over to the next section I'm

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.220 
move over to the next section I'm
actually<00:02:52.549> going<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.000> grab<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:55.130> Square<00:02:55.640> again

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
actually going to grab this Square again

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.610 
actually going to grab this Square again
insert<00:02:57.230> my<00:02:57.440> hook<00:02:57.940> grab<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:58.970> yarn<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.720> pull<00:02:59.780> it

through as a slip stitch to make our
next<00:03:04.459> chain<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:07.190> would<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:08.620> do<00:03:09.620> our

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
next chain and we would just do our

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.710 
next chain and we would just do our
three<00:03:10.130> trebles<00:03:10.610> as<00:03:10.880> normal<00:03:13.390> into<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.510> space

and again instead of chaining one we

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.440 
and again instead of chaining one we
grab<00:03:20.269> our<00:03:20.540> or<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.200> square<00:03:22.060> insert<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.239> hook

and draw through the yarn as a slip
stitch<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.900> as<00:03:51.109> you<00:03:51.230> get<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.620> end<00:03:51.799> it's

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
stitch now as you get to the end it's

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.870 
stitch now as you get to the end it's
going<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.910> feel<00:03:53.180> like<00:03:53.480> you've<00:03:53.930> not<00:03:54.880> you've

going to feel like you've not you've

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.140 
going to feel like you've not you've
done<00:03:56.090> something<00:03:56.359> wrong<00:03:56.750> because<00:03:57.489> this<00:03:58.489> side

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
done something wrong because this side

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.910 
done something wrong because this side
obviously<00:03:59.359> feels<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.989> lot<00:04:00.170> smaller<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.769> this

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
obviously feels a lot smaller to this

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.610 
obviously feels a lot smaller to this
side<00:04:01.250> but<00:04:01.970> as<00:04:02.120> we<00:04:02.299> work<00:04:02.480> you'll<00:04:02.690> see<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:03.260> will

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
side but as we work you'll see it will

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.759 
side but as we work you'll see it will
work<00:04:04.040> out<00:04:04.220> absolutely<00:04:04.790> fine<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.989> now<00:04:06.230> we<00:04:06.290> go

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
work out absolutely fine so now we go

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.640 
work out absolutely fine so now we go
into<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.069> corresponding<00:04:07.609> corner<00:04:08.470> grab<00:04:09.470> the

yarn and pull it through and then do a

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.300 
yarn and pull it through and then do a
cluster<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.120> three<00:04:14.180> troubles<00:04:14.930> into<00:04:15.310> that

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
cluster of three troubles into that

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.140 
cluster of three troubles into that
corner<00:04:16.789> exactly<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.870> same<00:04:18.109> as<00:04:18.440> normal<00:04:22.150> we're

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
corner exactly the same as normal we're

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.410 
corner exactly the same as normal we're
then<00:04:23.330> going<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.659> chain<00:04:24.440> one<00:04:24.970> first<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.150> all

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
then going to chain one first of all

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.580 
then going to chain one first of all
for<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.720> corner<00:04:27.080> because<00:04:27.170> we<00:04:27.350> would<00:04:27.470> normally

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
for the corner because we would normally

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.030 
for the corner because we would normally
do<00:04:27.920> three<00:04:28.310> here<00:04:28.840> insert<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:30.020> hook<00:04:30.320> into<00:04:30.680> that

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
do three here insert a hook into that

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.120 
do three here insert a hook into that
corner<00:04:31.730> space<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.510> yarn<00:04:33.410> over<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.040> pull

corner space and yarn over and pull

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.290 
corner space and yarn over and pull
through<00:04:36.040> we<00:04:37.040> can<00:04:37.220> then<00:04:37.370> start<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.850> turn<00:04:38.060> our

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
through we can then start to turn our

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.160 
through we can then start to turn our
work<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:39.940> then<00:04:40.940> chain<00:04:41.240> one<00:04:41.510> again<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.990> make

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
work and then chain one again to make

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.430 
work and then chain one again to make
our<00:04:42.350> third<00:04:42.740> chain<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.610> then<00:04:44.600> do<00:04:44.870> our<00:04:45.020> cluster

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
our third chain and then do our cluster

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.620 
our third chain and then do our cluster
of<00:04:45.590> three<00:04:45.950> troubles<00:04:46.430> into<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.810> corner<00:04:52.630> to

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
of three troubles into this corner to

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.750 
of three troubles into this corner to
attach<00:04:53.930> those<00:04:54.170> two<00:04:54.560> squares<00:04:54.920> together<00:04:55.130> and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
attach those two squares together and

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.540 
attach those two squares together and
then<00:04:56.720> just<00:04:56.900> continue<00:04:57.470> as<00:04:57.620> normal<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.100> chain

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
then just continue as normal so chain

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.220 
then just continue as normal so chain
one<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.410> three<00:05:00.410> trebles<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:02.080> that<00:05:03.080> has

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
one and three trebles and that has

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.880 
one and three trebles and that has
connected<00:05:03.770> those<00:05:04.010> two<00:05:04.400> squares<00:05:04.760> together<00:05:05.890> so

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
connected those two squares together so

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.100 
connected those two squares together so
it's<00:05:07.040> really<00:05:07.460> simple<00:05:08.180> once<00:05:08.690> you<00:05:08.810> get<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.080> hang

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
it's really simple once you get the hang

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.070 
it's really simple once you get the hang
of<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.710> can<00:05:09.950> be<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.160> bit<00:05:10.370> fiddly

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
of it it can be a bit fiddly

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.740 
of it it can be a bit fiddly
at<00:05:12.080> first<00:05:12.550> but<00:05:13.550> it's<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.880> really<00:05:14.240> nice<00:05:14.390> quick

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
at first but it's a really nice quick

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.420 
at first but it's a really nice quick
and<00:05:14.960> easy<00:05:15.050> way<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.350> join<00:05:15.800> your<00:05:16.040> squares

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
and easy way to join your squares

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.270 
and easy way to join your squares
together<00:05:16.670> as<00:05:17.180> you<00:05:17.390> are<00:05:17.570> working<00:05:17.780> your<00:05:18.770> blanket

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
together as you are working your blanket

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.310 
together as you are working your blanket
so<00:05:19.880> once<00:05:20.090> you've<00:05:20.270> joined<00:05:20.390> your<00:05:20.660> first<00:05:20.990> row<00:05:21.290> you

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
so once you've joined your first row you

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.320 
so once you've joined your first row you
will<00:05:21.800> get<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.220> point<00:05:22.280> where<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:22.880> will<00:05:23.090> have

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
will get to a point where you will have

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.100 
will get to a point where you will have
to<00:05:23.390> attach<00:05:24.080> two<00:05:24.440> corners<00:05:24.980> to<00:05:25.400> a<00:05:25.870> blanket<00:05:26.870> and

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
to attach two corners to a blanket and

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.470 
to attach two corners to a blanket and
you<00:05:27.470> would<00:05:27.590> just<00:05:27.800> do<00:05:28.040> this<00:05:28.280> in<00:05:28.520> exactly<00:05:29.180> the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
you would just do this in exactly the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.410 
you would just do this in exactly the
same<00:05:29.510> way<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:30.650> I've<00:05:30.800> just<00:05:30.830> added<00:05:31.220> my<00:05:31.610> first<00:05:32.000> M

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
same way so I've just added my first M

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.980 
same way so I've just added my first M
edge<00:05:33.670> and<00:05:34.670> what<00:05:34.850> you<00:05:34.970> would<00:05:35.090> want<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.360> do<00:05:35.600> is

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
edge and what you would want to do is

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.830 
edge and what you would want to do is
take<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:37.040> corresponding<00:05:37.760> corner<00:05:38.300> now

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
take the corresponding corner now

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.450 
take the corresponding corner now
because<00:05:39.230> there's<00:05:39.470> already<00:05:39.590> two<00:05:39.950> squares

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
because there's already two squares

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.850 
because there's already two squares
joined<00:05:40.790> together<00:05:41.000> there<00:05:41.540> what<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.170> like<00:05:42.560> to<00:05:42.710> do

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
joined together there what I like to do

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.530 
joined together there what I like to do
is<00:05:43.010> instead<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.430> just<00:05:43.550> going<00:05:44.000> into<00:05:44.150> this

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
is instead of just going into this

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.830 
is instead of just going into this
corner<00:05:45.470> here<00:05:45.830> I'll<00:05:46.430> go<00:05:46.850> to<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.300> opposite

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
corner here I'll go to the opposite

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.160 
corner here I'll go to the opposite
corner<00:05:48.080> so<00:05:48.560> I'll<00:05:48.770> put<00:05:49.010> that<00:05:49.190> in<00:05:49.250> there<00:05:49.670> and

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
corner so I'll put that in there and

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.950 
corner so I'll put that in there and
then<00:05:51.170> pull<00:05:51.740> through<00:05:52.010> and<00:05:52.550> it<00:05:52.880> just<00:05:53.150> it<00:05:53.480> makes

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
then pull through and it just it makes

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.140 
then pull through and it just it makes
it<00:05:54.140> a<00:05:54.200> little<00:05:54.350> bit<00:05:54.500> more<00:05:54.680> secure<00:05:55.160> and<00:05:55.460> then

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
it a little bit more secure and then

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.810 
it a little bit more secure and then
yarn<00:05:56.450> over<00:05:56.780> and<00:05:56.810> pull<00:05:56.960> through<00:05:57.170> to<00:05:57.800> make<00:05:58.040> third

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
yarn over and pull through to make third

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.410 
yarn over and pull through to make third
stick<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.840> third<00:06:00.110> chain<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.860> then<00:06:01.760> work<00:06:02.000> into

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
stick the third chain and then work into

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.600 
stick the third chain and then work into
your<00:06:02.540> corner<00:06:02.990> as<00:06:03.170> normal<00:06:03.680> so<00:06:04.070> do<00:06:04.220> your<00:06:04.430> three

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
your corner as normal so do your three

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:13.810 
your corner as normal so do your three
troubles<00:06:10.900> and<00:06:11.980> then<00:06:12.980> instead<00:06:13.310> of<00:06:13.370> chaining

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
troubles and then instead of chaining

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.510 
troubles and then instead of chaining
one<00:06:14.060> you<00:06:14.360> would<00:06:14.480> go<00:06:14.630> into<00:06:15.100> the<00:06:16.100> corresponding

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
one you would go into the corresponding

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.790 
one you would go into the corresponding
space<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:18.290> just<00:06:19.600> work<00:06:20.600> your<00:06:20.630> way<00:06:20.960> along<00:06:21.590> as

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
space and just work your way along as

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.610 
space and just work your way along as
normal<00:06:22.510> okay<00:06:23.510> and<00:06:23.810> as<00:06:23.900> you<00:06:24.050> get<00:06:24.200> closer<00:06:24.470> to

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
normal okay and as you get closer to

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.080 
normal okay and as you get closer to
this<00:06:24.860> edge<00:06:25.100> you're<00:06:25.340> going<00:06:25.550> to<00:06:25.670> feel<00:06:25.880> like

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
this edge you're going to feel like

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.520 
this edge you're going to feel like
you've<00:06:26.300> done<00:06:26.510> something<00:06:26.780> wrong<00:06:27.200> but<00:06:27.410> you

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
you've done something wrong but you

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.620 
you've done something wrong but you
haven't<00:06:27.950> don't<00:06:28.100> worry<00:06:28.400> I've<00:06:29.030> just<00:06:29.240> done<00:06:29.420> two

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
haven't don't worry I've just done two

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.990 
haven't don't worry I've just done two
troubles<00:06:30.080> in<00:06:30.260> here<00:06:30.590> and<00:06:30.800> I'm<00:06:31.610> just<00:06:31.820> going<00:06:31.970> to

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
troubles in here and I'm just going to

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.240 
troubles in here and I'm just going to
do<00:06:32.150> my<00:06:32.180> third<00:06:32.660> treble<00:06:33.020> now<00:06:33.770> this<00:06:33.980> is<00:06:34.130> the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
do my third treble now this is the

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.570 
do my third treble now this is the
corner<00:06:34.640> so<00:06:34.820> I<00:06:34.850> chain<00:06:35.270> one<00:06:35.660> and<00:06:35.960> then<00:06:36.430> once<00:06:37.430> I

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
corner so I chain one and then once I

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.800 
corner so I chain one and then once I
get<00:06:37.730> to<00:06:37.760> this<00:06:37.970> corner<00:06:38.360> I'm<00:06:38.450> going<00:06:38.570> to<00:06:38.660> have

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
get to this corner I'm going to have

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.610 
get to this corner I'm going to have
three<00:06:39.260> school

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
three school

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.860 
three school
that<00:06:39.889> are<00:06:40.010> already<00:06:40.250> joined<00:06:40.790> so<00:06:41.570> what<00:06:41.750> I'm

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
that are already joined so what I'm

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.379 
that are already joined so what I'm
going<00:06:42.050> to<00:06:42.139> do<00:06:42.440> is<00:06:42.710> go<00:06:43.010> into<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:43.520> opposite

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
going to do is go into the opposite

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.460 
going to do is go into the opposite
corner<00:06:44.949> insert<00:06:45.949> my<00:06:46.160> hook<00:06:46.190> and<00:06:46.990> pull<00:06:47.990> the<00:06:48.199> yarn
