00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 if you like cooking that preserves 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.349
 the taste and aromas of the fish I you 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.719
 propose to try the thigh in foil 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.670
 in addition it remains a very simple cooking 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.839
 and especially health go we go it's 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.520
 gone you will see it's not rocket science 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.779
 for cooking in foil I like 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.609
 well near cure and vegetables because if 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.460
 you put your vegetables and your fish 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.170
 at the same time often the vegetables are 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 not cooked enough and the fish is too 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.380
 cooked so you'll see that she's 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.109
 method you go near cure and vegetables 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 keep a small pan a little trickle 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.120
 of oil from the small vegetables cut at its 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 okay we'll start seeing some 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 not put the vegetables that are the most 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.160
 long to cook there for example is the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.160
 peppers and onions 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 so you first advocate your 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 vegetables and further to cook during a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 to two minutes and then you're done 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.620
 by the fastest vegetables 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.000
 welcome the small jemaye 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680
 zucchini and small dots 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.710
 asparagus 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 I'm starting to season a little bit 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.049
 little fleur de sel and cooking 2 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.909
 minutes we will check the cooking at the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.630
 tip of a knife it is necessary that vegetables 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.439
 are still very crunchy 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.210
 [Music] 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.770
 here are my vegetables are pre cooked then 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.060
 I like there a really ready price that 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 the vegetables pass like that you go 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.290
 have a very homogeneous cooking you 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.920
 go put in the center of your 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.299
 papillote 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 so here I have a special paper 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.110
 curly sent with transparent 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 for a visual effect but you can 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.869
 no problem using paper 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.939
 greaseproof to make your curl 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.369
 the important thing that sits well hermetic 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.460
 for the steam to cook the fish 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.470
 I have small Pavilion Pavilion pavers 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.180
 France I followed the seasonings 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.390
 slightly on both sides it's very 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.520
 important that is well seasoned there 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.549
 I will add a little trick of pepper 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.549
 mill 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.600
 I will have my little medallions 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.789
 of monkfish on vegetables in the center of 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.270
 papillote that will add a small 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.270
 fillet of olive oil 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:18.060
 some fresh herbs you go 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:25.700
 dispose of it like that i will close my 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:28.920
 curled up and with a little son 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.290
 I checked the papillote is well 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.940
 hermetic 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:40.650
 so little son to remove it and that's it and 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 for small monkfish medallions 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.150
 like that I'm going to cook 7 to 8 minutes 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.470
 in a 180 Â° oven 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.300
 if you have a big cobblestone you go 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.980
 cook up to 12 minutes in fact 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.240
 what is important is to adapt the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.980
 cooking time compared to 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.140
 the thickness of your fish not cities 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.070
 in France immediately for the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.209
 papillote and cooked 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.060
 then you will open it without delay and 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.880
 especially especially you have to open it in front of 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.010
 your friends in your family and the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.840
 look at that you have all the flavors 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.430
 of the papillote that goes up the wrapper 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.560
 with him eight minutes because my 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.670
 fishmonger my size and tiny 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.290
 monkfish medallions there that are really 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.760
 spotless though if you have a 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.650
 thicker pad but you will push 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.630
 cooking about 12 minutes from the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.790
 end of cooking of the papillotes and there we have 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.090
 vegetables that are perfectly cooked 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.989
 the monkfish that adjusts cooking and I can 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.090
 to tell you that you are really going to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.400
 to feast I told you that cooking 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.290
 in foil fish preserved 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.850
 really all the aroma and you've seen 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.100
 there it is successful 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:54.300
 so now it's up to you 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:54.300
