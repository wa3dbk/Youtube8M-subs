I<00:00:43.940> believe<00:00:44.270> nine<00:00:44.600> wooden<00:00:45.350> crates<00:00:47.199> so<00:00:48.199> there's

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
I believe nine wooden crates so there's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.369 
I believe nine wooden crates so there's
just<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.860> lot<00:00:49.129> of<00:00:49.390> pulling<00:00:50.390> these<00:00:50.510> heavy<00:00:50.930> things

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
just a lot of pulling these heavy things

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.700 
just a lot of pulling these heavy things
out<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.160> rolling<00:00:52.670> them<00:00:52.789> around<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.710> removing

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
out and rolling them around and removing

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.479

the<00:00:54.829> frisk<00:00:55.510> can<00:00:56.510> take<00:00:56.960> literally<00:00:57.829> hours<00:00:58.309> if

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
the frisk can take literally hours if

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.819 
the frisk can take literally hours if
you<00:00:58.609> do<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:58.850> by<00:00:59.030> yourself

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
you do it by yourself

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.400 
you do it by yourself
the<00:01:00.829> way<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.219> one<00:01:01.489> was<00:01:01.640> planned<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.329> we<00:01:03.170> had

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
the way this one was planned is we had

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.260 
the way this one was planned is we had

Corbin and Sean come in and lay down the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.389 
Corbin and Sean come in and lay down the
foundation<00:01:09.140> of<00:01:09.229> getting<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.710> speakers<00:01:10.160> out

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
foundation of getting the speakers out

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.679 
foundation of getting the speakers out
of<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.670> crates<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.420> basically<00:01:12.229> erected<00:01:13.100> and

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
of the crates and basically erected and

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.330 
of the crates and basically erected and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
positioned in the general position and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.969 
positioned in the general position and
and<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.090> when<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.780> came<00:01:17.960> time<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.320> actually

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
and so when it came time to actually

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.690 
and so when it came time to actually
tune<00:01:19.820> their<00:01:20.299> position<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> room<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:22.130> lot<00:01:22.580> of

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
tune their position to the room a lot of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.270 
tune their position to the room a lot of
the<00:01:22.790> heavy<00:01:22.939> work<00:01:23.210> was<00:01:23.450> done<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.680> job<00:01:25.009> was

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the heavy work was done the job was

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.520 
the heavy work was done the job was
really<00:01:25.490> spread<00:01:26.060> out<00:01:26.090> over<00:01:26.299> probably<00:01:26.900> five<00:01:27.500> or

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
really spread out over probably five or

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.890 
really spread out over probably five or
six<00:01:27.770> people<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:30.049> it<00:01:30.170> nevertheless<00:01:30.560> took

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
six people and it nevertheless took

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.450 
six people and it nevertheless took

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
cumulative probably a day to set it up I

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.300 
cumulative probably a day to set it up I
considered<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:37.640> because<00:01:38.000> not<00:01:38.560> mostly<00:01:39.560> its
