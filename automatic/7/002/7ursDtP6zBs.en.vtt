vaccine<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.590> Badgers<00:01:37.890> might<00:01:38.610> reduce<00:01:39.150> the

vaccine in Badgers might reduce the

effect<00:01:39.720> by<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.049> eight<00:01:40.290> percent<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.009> it's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
effect by about eight percent but it's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.210 
effect by about eight percent but it's
still<00:01:41.369> worth<00:01:41.640> pursuing

still worth pursuing
