00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.840
 today we go to lunch 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.040
 so the good news is that you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.889
 you can consume vegetables 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 then at will you also think of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.890
 consume coral lenses that are 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.140
 very rich in antioxidants 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
 so for the recipe sense to sand 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.609
 the hour if I show you an example of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.680
 what I consume at noon then there I 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.080
 go a tablespoon of oil 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:38.070
 olive 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:40.020
 then I put the onions here I 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.899
 mix right after I put my 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.820
 poor we are here the goal is to have 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.579
 really a fried crunchy veggie 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.800
 in order to keep all 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.920
 vitamins and minerals so these 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920
 vegetables 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.800
 then I continue with the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.800
 zucchini 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.190
 so what I like about this diet 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 is that vegetables are really 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.979
 will we can eat as much as we 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.040
 then wants then 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.510
 I season with pepper so especially 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.890
 no salt 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.340
 I never put salt in my 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 preparations except when I do so a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.610
 extra or two a week 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 when I make small differences so that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 happens to me once or twice 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.570
 week there I allow myself a little bit of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.140
 salt but still limited so here I 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.890
 mix then I put so my 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.890
 spinach leaves 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 then I'll put some seeds 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.720
 of linen so that's stuffed with 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.730
 calcium magnesium protein 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.120
 there are plenty of minerals in it 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.830
 really super good there I mix we're going 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.070
 try to pop them up so with 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.070
 the vegetables 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.160
 then I put it so that the tomatoes the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.870
 mixes as needed 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.910
 tomatoes contain lycopene 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.489
 then lycopene is an antioxidant 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.660
 very very powerful 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:23.190
 now I'm putting some peas 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 so frozen then usually when 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.180
 I make small dishes like that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.459
 I 'm trying to double proportions for 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.620
 also have some for the evening so as to 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.700
 save a little time it's true that 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.340
 when we have a day she would 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.830
 loaded is really not bad to have some 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.739
 little shortcuts like that in my skin 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.630
 tan I'll put so an apple 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.400
 so here I already started so go 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.650
 more at play the cup in small 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.670
 neighborhoods and that's not bad because 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.670
 it's so satisfying 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.480
 there I mix then at the level of spices 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.180
 you are really book we can put 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.069
 curcuma curry human reducer that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.239
 it's really you who see there 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.849
 today me I focused on 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.519
 herbs and age and basil so 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.739
 frozen basil game but also a 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:21.840
 little bit it brings a lot of 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:23.819
 flavor so I mix sacomi times and 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.110
 then in the fridge I always have 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.209
 the sweet potato leaking 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.510
 so I often use them for 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.459
 breakfasts then the fact of 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.600
 having cooked it here allows you if 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.370
 you never have a daylong 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.019
 is not to take a piece of 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.730
 sweet potatoes and satiate you 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.400
 it will always be better than taking 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.299
 a chocolate bar so here I cut 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.549
 my sweet potato so that white 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.840
 I mix then I prefer the 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.430
 white sweet potato because at the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.620
 texture that is much firmer than 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.299
 the orange sweet potato and it's true that 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.569
 sweet potato so orange and more 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.150
 rich in beta carotene aulas I do not 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.700
 mix not as I should when 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.500
 even then use turmeric so the 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.380
 turmeric is a spice and that protects 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.400
 the better your health and especially if it 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.920
 is associated with pepper 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.100
 its antioxidant power and multiply 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.010
 per 1000 ha so here I mix where he 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.380
 must then if we see that the preparation 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.900
 needs some liquid we're going 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.180
 add a little water here is not 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.430
 too much and then we will continue so the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.169
 cooking about five minutes once 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.419
 that my vegetables so his loan I'll go there 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.419
 put a splash of lemon juice 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.789
 so that 's a lot of acidity and 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.090
 for me that's a large area so 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.530
 my little dish there I mix and 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.669
 now we will go to the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.950
 protein preparation so it's up to 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.360
 preparing my chicken meat 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.850
 be able to accompany ogm and vegetables 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.669
 so I'm just a6 on the nose 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.120
 with this Mexican mix then there is 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.610
 what in 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.240
 we have red pepper onions 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.860
 dehydrated pepper from cumin 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.580
 sesame seeds of coriander 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.860
 parsley of their eyes 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.409
 I think it's going to be delicious so 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.310
 never a little bit baja suffer so with 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.729
 my fingers 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.960
 then I return my poultry and I 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.580
 do the same thing on the other side then 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.560
 now I'm going to put my pole to 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.129
 heat and as soon as it is hot 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.120
 and I will go to leather masts wilander 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:36.280
 I put fewer scallops in the pan 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.960
 then a nonstick pan is very 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.039
 important to avoid any material 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.440
 fat 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.020
 so I'll cook about 3 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.680
 minutes from each side 1 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.389
 so as soon as we see that this chart 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.550
 shale on the sides that means we 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.979
 will be able to return when our 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:57.310
 other meat and again it 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:58.990
 insensitive in the face of dressage 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.150
 my plate 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.800
 there I put so Mont Blanc Chicken 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.509
 then I will put my vegetables then 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.990
 there at the vegetable level 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:15.219
 I have for noon and doors tonight I 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:18.699
 I am well organized so I put the 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:27.159
 portion that is enough for me that is to say the 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:29.139
 half of the pole so here we have a 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.490
 very very beautiful plate very greedy 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.909
 so now I'm going to spend everything from 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.849
 following the tasting 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:38.770
 yum yum so here I take a piece 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.360
 of pomegranate meat and I a little 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.360
 cooking meat is juicy 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.030
 then the spices for the lemon the side 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.610
 Sweet sweet potato and palm 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.210
 largely replaces salt it's really 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.210
 super good
