00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the same how different could they be

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.419 
the same how different could they be
right<00:00:06.899> oh<00:00:07.200> pretty<00:00:07.859> different

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
right oh pretty different

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.330 
right oh pretty different
we<00:00:08.970> took<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.269> chevy<00:00:09.599> 4500<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> v8<00:00:10.980> engine

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
we took the chevy 4500 with a v8 engine

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.780 
we took the chevy 4500 with a v8 engine
and<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.880> Ford<00:00:12.150> e450<00:00:12.960> v10<00:00:13.620> heads<00:00:14.190> ahead

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and the Ford e450 v10 heads ahead

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
mano-a-mano and powertrain to power trip

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.400 
mano-a-mano and powertrain to power trip
we<00:00:17.789> then<00:00:17.940> equip<00:00:18.210> them<00:00:18.390> with<00:00:18.420> identical<00:00:18.900> cargo

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we then equip them with identical cargo

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.439 
we then equip them with identical cargo
bodies<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.010> added<00:00:20.580> enough<00:00:20.820> ways<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.270> bring

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

them up to exactly seven tons gross
vehicle<00:00:23.730> weight<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:24.840> put<00:00:25.019> them<00:00:25.140> through

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
vehicle weight we then put them through

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.630 
vehicle weight we then put them through
a<00:00:25.350> variety<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.859> tests<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> measure<00:00:26.369> their

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
a variety of tests to measure their

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
a variety of tests to measure their
performance<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.269> fuel<00:00:27.599> economy<00:00:27.779> turns<00:00:28.769> out

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

different let's watch and see with these
vans<00:00:33.710> acceleration<00:00:34.710> isn't<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.070> nice-to-have

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
vans acceleration isn't a nice-to-have

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
vans acceleration isn't a nice-to-have
it's<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.690> necessity<00:00:37.040> because<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.190> you're

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
it's a necessity because when you're

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.920 
it's a necessity because when you're
getting<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> highway<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> 7-ton<00:00:39.629> van

situation<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:48.090> stabilize<00:00:48.600> both<00:00:48.809> vehicles<00:00:49.110> at

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
situation we stabilize both vehicles at

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.299 
situation we stabilize both vehicles at
20<00:00:49.649> miles<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.920> hour

gear selectors in their highest forward
position<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.070> accelerated<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.730> full

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
position and then we accelerated at full

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.170 
position and then we accelerated at full

so<00:00:57.180> who<00:00:57.300> ain't<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:57.570> giddy<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.140> Chevy<00:00:58.680> 4500

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so who ain't more giddy on a Chevy 4500

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.750 
so who ain't more giddy on a Chevy 4500
was<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> close<00:01:00.329> no<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.410> Chevy<00:01:01.980> beat<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> Ford<00:01:02.609> by

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
was it close no a Chevy beat the Ford by

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.479 
was it close no a Chevy beat the Ford by
more<00:01:03.059> than<00:01:03.300> 250<00:01:04.080> feet<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:05.010> exactly<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
more than 250 feet so not exactly a

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
hi in my way we'd be right now escalator

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.260 
hi in my way we'd be right now escalator
right<00:01:36.260> now<00:01:36.460> well<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.760> truth<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.090> there's

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
right now well the truth is there's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.390 
right now well the truth is there's
hills<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.660> steep<00:01:38.930> all<00:01:39.530> over<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.890> place<00:01:40.100> and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
hills this steep all over the place and

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.800 
hills this steep all over the place and
your<00:01:40.700> business<00:01:40.970> vehicles<00:01:41.300> are<00:01:41.390> gonna<00:01:41.540> go<00:01:41.630> up

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
your business vehicles are gonna go up

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.550 
your business vehicles are gonna go up
and<00:01:42.110> over<00:01:42.410> them<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.550> we<00:01:43.670> did<00:01:43.820> some<00:01:43.970> Hill<00:01:44.120> tests

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
and over them so we did some Hill tests

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.410 
and over them so we did some Hill tests
hill<00:01:45.560> climbing<00:01:45.890> really<00:01:46.550> tests<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.060> vehicle's

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
hill climbing really tests a vehicle's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.390 
hill climbing really tests a vehicle's
power<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.840> acceleration<00:01:48.050> in<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:49.100> first

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400
