next step of our printing process

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.939 
next step of our printing process
alright<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.049> we're<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.319> to<00:00:43.409> be<00:00:43.499> doing<00:00:43.799> is

alright well we're going to be doing is

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.939 
alright well we're going to be doing is
using<00:00:44.339> our<00:00:44.690> homemade<00:00:45.690> light<00:00:45.929> table<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
using our homemade light table here you

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.829 
using our homemade light table here you
can<00:00:47.399> build<00:00:47.549> one<00:00:47.729> just<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.359> it's<00:00:48.569> just

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
can build one just like it it's just

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.079 
can build one just like it it's just
basically<00:00:49.229> the<00:00:49.379> frame<00:00:49.799> and<00:00:50.129> we've<00:00:50.760> got<00:00:50.940> some

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.879 
basically the frame and we've got some
fluorescent<00:00:51.329> bulbs<00:00:51.869> inside<00:00:52.260> all<00:00:52.559> covered

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:52.889 
fluorescent bulbs inside all covered

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:55.189 
fluorescent bulbs inside all covered
with<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.069> piece<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.399> glass<00:00:54.019> what<00:00:55.019> we're<00:00:55.109> gonna

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
with a piece of glass what we're gonna

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.910 
with a piece of glass what we're gonna
do<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> tape<00:00:56.429> our<00:00:56.699> film<00:00:57.239> onto<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
do is going to tape our film onto the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.899 
do is going to tape our film onto the
glass<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.489> keep<00:00:59.639> it<00:00:59.789> still<00:01:04.549> now<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
glass to keep it still now what this is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789 
glass to keep it still now what this is
going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.780> light<00:01:07.170> from<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> light

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
going to do the light from the light

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.690 
going to do the light from the light
table<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.380> harden<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> emulsion<00:01:11.280> on

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
table is going to harden the emulsion on

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.899 
table is going to harden the emulsion on
the<00:01:11.850> screen<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:13.020> wherever<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.460> ink<00:01:14.670> from

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the screen but wherever the the ink from

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
the screen but wherever the the ink from
the<00:01:15.049> film<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> block<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the film is that is going to block that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.080 
the film is that is going to block that
light<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.289> that<00:01:19.829> that<00:01:20.090> emulsion

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
light and so that that emulsion

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
light and so that that emulsion
underneath<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.810> ink<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.530> soft

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
underneath the ink is going to be soft

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.929 
underneath the ink is going to be soft
so<00:01:22.920> we're<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> blow<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.729> later

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so we're going to blow that out later

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
so we're going to blow that out later
and<00:01:24.270> that's<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.929> to<00:01:24.990> create<00:01:25.289> the<00:01:25.409> image<00:01:25.679> on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and that's going to create the image on

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.469 
and that's going to create the image on
the<00:01:26.039> screen<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.850> when<00:01:26.969> you're<00:01:27.090> taping<00:01:27.240> your

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the screen now when you're taping your

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.919

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
image around it with a sharpie so you'll

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.810 
image around it with a sharpie so you'll

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
Sharpie now this is our screen after we

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.140 
Sharpie now this is our screen after we
have<00:03:25.560> burned<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.890> image<00:03:26.130> onto<00:03:26.460> it<00:03:26.610> as<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.000> can

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
have burned the image onto it as you can

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.140 
have burned the image onto it as you can
see<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.570> looks<00:03:27.750> exactly<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.290> same<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.940> cannot

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
see it looks exactly the same you cannot

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.120 
see it looks exactly the same you cannot
see<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.660> some<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.380> emulsion<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.890> still

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
see that some of the emulsion is still

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.010 
see that some of the emulsion is still
soft<00:03:32.430> we're<00:03:33.180> going<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.360> take<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.630> down<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.990> the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
soft we're going to take it down to the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.410 
soft we're going to take it down to the
washout<00:03:34.500> area<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.130> wash<00:03:35.730> out<00:03:35.970> all<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.210> soft

way<00:03:39.920> alright<00:03:40.920> we've<00:03:41.130> got<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.430> image<00:03:41.700> burned

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
way alright we've got the image burned

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.450 
way alright we've got the image burned
onto<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.390> screen<00:03:42.660> now<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:43.410> are<00:03:43.500> ready<00:03:43.740> to<00:03:43.920> blow

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
onto the screen now we are ready to blow

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.770 
onto the screen now we are ready to blow
out<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.760> image<00:03:45.120> we're<00:03:45.360> just<00:03:45.510> going<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.660> be

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
out the image we're just going to be

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.420 
out the image we're just going to be
using<00:03:45.960> a<00:03:46.170> standard<00:03:46.590> water<00:03:46.800> hose<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
the intensity of the light and how long

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.760 
the intensity of the light and how long
you<00:03:53.820> burned<00:03:54.270> your<00:03:54.390> image<00:03:54.690> for<00:03:54.990> we'll

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
you burned your image for we'll

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.530 
you burned your image for we'll
determine<00:03:56.010> how<00:03:56.430> long<00:03:56.640> it'll<00:03:56.880> take<00:03:56.940> but<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
determine how long it'll take but it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.820 
determine how long it'll take but it
usually<00:03:57.660> doesn't<00:03:58.020> take<00:03:58.110> very<00:03:58.230> long<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.800> just

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
usually doesn't take very long you just

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.910 
usually doesn't take very long you just
spray<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.310> out<00:03:59.400> normally<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:01.410> image<00:04:01.770> will

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
spray it out normally and the image will

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:14.360 
spray it out normally and the image will
start<00:04:02.160> appearing

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.710 

after<00:04:15.370> you're<00:04:15.519> done<00:04:15.549> spraying<00:04:16.030> out<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.389> image

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
after you're done spraying out the image

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.879 
after you're done spraying out the image
you're<00:04:16.870> going<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.079> want<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.289> hold<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.620> up<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.859> a
