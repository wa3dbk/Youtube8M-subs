00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 very good guys in this new video os 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.640
 to know a new ct previously in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.109
 the channel we already raised another age that was 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 the first phone that had unlock 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.509
 for eyes but here the video is a 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.580
 pretty novel phone 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.680
 here we have videos to know the zte 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 blade 6 is a new smartphone that has 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:31.800
 presented part in its range top that 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 is going to get here Spain and one of the zte 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 blade s 6 and it 's a pretty good phone 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.420
 at hand is aluminum and this body 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.260
 unibody its dimensions would be 143 9 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.570
 millimeters high a width of 70 61 and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 a thickness of 7 points 9 mm the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590
 Phone screen is a screen of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.660
 5 inches has a resolution hd but 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 good in spite of being only hd you see 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.350
 quite well the processor would be a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 Corbal chooses rodent is the first phone 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.129
 with octa core that will present the zte 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.719
 and it would be accompanied by two gigabytes of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.460
 ram will also have internal memory of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.120
 16gb and this would be expandable through 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.370
 microsd cards up to one hundred 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.900
 one of the things that quite a few 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.640
 manufacturers implement is that it has 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.860
 dual sim is worth this way we can 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.560
 use the numbers at the same time your battery 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.210
 would be 2400 milliamps we have tried a 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.070
 intensive use we do not know we will not know what 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.540
 results will come in day to day and 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.830
 would be a fully equipped terminal in 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.250
 how much connectivity will not have wifi 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.360
 bluetooth nfc and would also have 4g 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.560
 I have also been called by the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.630
 attention some functions that 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.640
 implements this new terminal by 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.800
 example, you are going to see, we are going to have the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.120
 locked phone let's shake it two 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.640
 times 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.520
 and as you can see there, the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.850
 lantern is valid if we go back to other 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.860
 twice I would be paying for the flashlight 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.810
 another function like this a quick access but 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.210
 if we have the phone in this position 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.630
 we keep the volume up button and 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.080
 we raise so we would open directly 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.790
 of the camera in portrait mode 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.350
 you're going to block it again and if by the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.890
 otherwise we do the same but in this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.970
 position 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.360
 and we raise like this 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.100
 As you can see, we would open the photograph for 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.119
 take a self and good as we have 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.310
 talked about the cameras we're going to 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.050
 take the opportunity to know a little more 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.790
 each of them in this case we have 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.680
 here the back camera that case 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.150
 would be 13 megapixels and if we go to 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.640
 the front camera because we have a 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.810
 5 megapixel camera and good guys 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.340
 up to here the first impressions of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.440
 this new zte the truth that is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.000
 liking enough to luck of the hand is 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.950
 aluminum and feel pretty good is 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.390
 very comfortable and good I hope more 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.040
 forward to be able to prove it in a way 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.750
 more intensive on the channel and I like it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.400
 low comments you put what has 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.070
 like this smartphone and for those who 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.290
 you ask the phone is hovering the 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.090
 phone is the market around April 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.650
 March and the price would be somewhat 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.940
 below 300 euros so a 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.800
 relationship value for money 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.120
 pretty good so nothing this would be 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.150
 everything is remember that we are going to leave here 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.770
 the other zte video that we leave you is worth 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.630
 the eye unlocking that is 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.800
 also quite interesting and nothing that 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.820
 it would be all remember that by following us to 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.440
 our social network twitter and facebook 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.440
