00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.430
 one of the most errors committed by 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.189
 brides when they are organizing the wedding 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.160
 is to mix 7 protocol styles 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.200
 hello I am Maria Jose and today on the blog 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.599
 of marajÃ³ I present a topic that you 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.820
 will help plan a harmonic wedding and 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.949
 without falling into contradiction I mean 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.930
 the importance of establishing the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.760
 priorities of the wedding priorities 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.070
 of the wedding serve to have a direction and 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.809
 to create a wedding with form you have to 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.660
 do it from the moment you define the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.180
 team is very easy with three singles 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.860
 steps that relate to each other and 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.870
 you can be sure that if you do not 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.629
 from the beginning everything will go 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.059
 flowing reality 1 you want a wedding 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.739
 night or a wedding watch choose the time of 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.780
 the wedding will help you define the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.969
 concepts the place where it will take 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.010
 out the wedding reception as well as the 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.079
 label is to say if it will be formal 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.780
 elegant or rigorous label 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.580
 priority or how will the wedding think if 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.470
 you want to get married in an open place in 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.210
 a closed place in a wedding destination 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.789
 if you want the wedding guests 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.130
 They look very elegant or if you prefer 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.550
 Children will not define this priority will 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 help to 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.110
 not to mix the edge of the plane example 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.510
 If you're getting married in a garden with weather 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.340
 hot and you can not ask your 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.320
 invited to go long and to the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.390
 costume guests here is where it comes in 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.760
 the priority is really to establish that 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.590
 most important to you if the place of the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.480
 wedding or that the guests are looking for 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.280
 elegant if you feel lost you 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.830
 I recommend that you go from the general to the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.900
 particular priority 3 has to do with 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.640
 the budget and with the service of your 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.950
 providers to achieve this priority 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.720
 It is recommended that you make a list with 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.940
 the three things that can not be missing in 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.800
 the wedding and with the three things that they give you 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.260
 a little bit the same for example for us 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.020
 music is more important the food or 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.120
 the decoration that the car 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.580
 Invitations or memories seen 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.170
 true that it was easy remember to take in 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.180
 tell your boyfriend also at your wedding 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.070
 sit down to talk about the priorities of 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.020
 the wedding I 'm not going to if you liked the video not 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.850
