00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.369
 pc of few resources and that is the in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.740

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.900
 can withstand the high resource 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.130
 install it if they do not install as well as I 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.110

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.660

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.670
 ultra light pc and all the files that 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.800
 come inside we copy them as we see 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.140
 our gta without getting into any 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.180
 folder or to the root of the gta san 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.430
