00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.170
 I'm here with Adriana Olmedo and Laura 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.289
 Olmedo one of the most successful couples 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.589
 in the company of the prestige adrián group 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.950
 a question for you first what 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.930
 special talent who was there to be able 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.350
 have the success you 've had what is your 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 force what is your most special talent 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 I'm going to define myself in two parts 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.690
 a faith that you can conquer what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.370
 longed for the second trust in people 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 because big things are not done 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.210
 alone they are made in company as a team and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.210
 I trust people 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.800
 Laura 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.020
 they say that women are smarter 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.780
 that men say that women have 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.440
 taken control of the world that thinks 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.440
 do you study or 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.270
 I do not think so I think the state 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.070
 perfect of the human being is to be married 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.510
 and I believe in the strength of the couple 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.850
 we really believe in the strength of the couple 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.280
 so 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.460
 are two very large intelligences that 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.570
 unite are complemented and in royal 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.930
 prestigious works so 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 extraordinary 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.350
 Mr. Olmedo, I want to ask you how 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.950
 important is to overcome fear in 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.320
 this business 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 first let's define that fear is a 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.990
 story 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.720
 it's something that one creates oneself creates one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.600
 establishes and even seems to be cultivated 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.480
 when in reality fear is only 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.020
 a feeling that you decide to make 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.780
 extensive equivocally I can understand 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.390
 fear as an instant but as no 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.270
 something not something established then there's 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.060
 to shake off the mna of fear and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.540
 devote to action time not the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.650
 fear does not have no does not have no time 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.720
 in action 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.480
 If someone is in action , time is not 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.470
 there is fear you do not exist that 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.920
 They are so powerful that you think your partner 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.260
 lady in what form in the way more 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.230
 powerful that you can support your 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.660
 husband what is the most powerful way that 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.720
 a woman can support her husband to 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.670
 that he achieves the success that he dreams good 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.170
 one of the ways that I believe in that 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.630
 I will have supported Adrian 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.640
 allowing them in the no 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.950
 if you have a project if you have a dream 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.840
 If you have an illusion of doing something, 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.510
 I want to be that obstacle stone in 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.230
 which in the future will say if you 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.239
 would you have supported 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.970
 it could be that you do not agree many 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.360
 times in what they decide what they want 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.629
 but there I will be and if it comes out 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.159
 well that good and if it goes wrong we will be 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.670
 together to be with him for 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.440
 support it 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.750
 Adrián 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.910
 there have been people in your life you think 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.940
 than to get to the point where you 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.730
 Mentors are required 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.470
 people whom you admire you have 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.170

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.230
 guided to be able to have this success that 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.320
 have you had definitely needed 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.020
 godparents to success those godparents are 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.760
 the mentors in the course of my life 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.550
 there have always been mentors from the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.470

 you have to pay attention to the mentors are 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.040
 needed a mentor is one who 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.140
 tell the truth and the one who demands that you 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.120
 is the best of you brave for the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.820
 mentors fortunately have many 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.130

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.150

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.040
 of 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.690
 of a struggle to do honest acts not 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.870
 for having honest acts to work 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.300

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.250

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.979

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.539
 Mr. Olmedo has what advice 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.430

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.680

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.270
 spread your wings that you think you can 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.100
 conquer heights that you let yourself be by 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:42.150
 that inner being that calls you to take off 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.180
 in reality that is the human being by 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.510
 nature is intrepid is of conquest 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.360
 is exploration is a challenge when the 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.860
 fear stands between those things then
