real you and real age and the website

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.689 
real you and real age and the website
you<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:16.080> actually<00:00:16.260> calculate<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.220> aging<00:00:17.640> of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
you can actually calculate the aging of

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.340 
you can actually calculate the aging of
they<00:00:17.850> did<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.449> can<00:00:18.630> calculate<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
they did that you can calculate the

aging effect of all these different

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.650 
aging effect of all these different
health<00:00:21.119> behaviors

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
health behaviors

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.150 
health behaviors
well<00:00:21.869> they<00:00:21.990> determine<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> laughter<00:00:22.980> can

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
well they determine the laughter can

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.740 
well they determine the laughter can
help<00:00:23.340> us<00:00:23.460> feel<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.939> eight<00:00:24.150> years<00:00:24.420> younger

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
help us feel up to eight years younger

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
help us feel up to eight years younger
and<00:00:25.050> consequently<00:00:25.980> live<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> eight<00:00:26.699> years

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and consequently live up to eight years

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.480 
and consequently live up to eight years
longer<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.890> think<00:00:29.130> those<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.310> some

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
longer and I think those are some

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
longer and I think those are some
impressive<00:00:30.269> numbers<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.140> some<00:00:31.260> other

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
impressive numbers and some other
