may have been her first game but I'm not
entirely<00:00:38.520> sure<00:00:38.670> about<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.540> basically

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
entirely sure about that and basically

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.049 
entirely sure about that and basically
what<00:00:40.260> she<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.040> she<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.430> provide<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
provide you with food I'm guessing the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
provide you with food I'm guessing the
fruit<00:00:47.489> were<00:00:47.700> most<00:00:48.030> likely<00:00:48.539> would<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.379> sure

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
fruit were most likely would you sure

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.160 
fruit were most likely would you sure
you<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.430> damage<00:00:50.850> counter<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.870> what

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you know your damage counter that's what

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
you know your damage counter that's what
that's<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.649> fruit<00:00:52.980> has<00:00:53.160> done<00:00:53.370> every<00:00:53.640> single

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that's what fruit has done every single

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
that's what fruit has done every single
game<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:55.020> don't<00:00:55.170> exactly<00:00:55.770> show<00:00:56.100> her

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
game so they don't exactly show her

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
game so they don't exactly show her
giving<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.760> fruit<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.079> she
