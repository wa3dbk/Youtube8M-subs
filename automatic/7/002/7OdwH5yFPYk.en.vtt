00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.580
 we are receiving the allowance for many 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.670
 that's the secret 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.500
 to get 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.380
 I hesitate in public tenders 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.559
 the vestibular 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.869
 but there is one point that can greatly influence your learning 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.669
 a half hour 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.800
 what we reap can help or impair memory to the same extent 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.109
 wise 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.789
 for neurons to cateme the messages of the neurotransmitters of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.949
 satisfactory way the membranes of your nose should be based on a large 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.619
 amount of lipids 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.170
 you did not understand anything the acarajÃ© nutritionist explain this complex process 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.829
 the neuron is constituted dollar 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.750
 myelin sheath that the myopia dependent substance 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 then the quality if lippi will favor directly 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.280
 beyond the transmission of information is the brain 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.850
 So if you have the company supplying my goal 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.540
 in place prevents it from poor quality this is the first transmission that 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.460
 transmission from the other neuron will be very difficult. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.420
 passage 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.550
 so I need to cancel the session in the presence 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.680
 billi pig and good quality of my diet so that this result comes in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.350
 better understanding and capture of knowledge and 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.660
 information after the explanation, it is easy to see that a 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.390
 proper diet 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.370
 after the confrontation 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.860
 and in the learning of young children and adults for whom it is going to provide vestibular 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.570
 have run for a vacancy in public tender food can give a 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.100
 Hand in hand the reaction despite the draw Amara knows what I'm talking about 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.229
 the student went through the experience of adequate food 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.399
 and the results appeared I had a greater concern about food 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.940
 already been premier grew list 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.040
 why after being a bike at this time my income was much bigger I have 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.510
 greater ease 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.520
 to study 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.000
 the chamber will provide college entrance examination for medicine at the end of the year the student 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.290
 devotes much of his time to books but he relaxes on food and he guesses 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.980
 with the law already establishes between a difficulty to concentrate 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.289
 is the cabense gets heavy with any country I'm already tired 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.900
 then it is there that it becomes very difficult the fatigue mentioned by samara 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.140
 is the first symptom to signal when food is low in nutrients 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.699
 with the fatigue well the lack of concentration from then on the 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:26.909
 content seen by the student goes by water down comes positions that do not 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.490
 are very comfortable with such positions 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.350
 positions so in the cgs not modulated in brain activity the body 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.779
 as a whole will not respond adequately 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.180
 the opposition estimates a class quadrant who has information 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.730
 where esther and abilities as attention written reasoning then not only the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.059
 psychological 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.440
 a more deadly earthquake also important 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.860
 then the motor activity datena that deal - and activity was logic depends 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.160
 of the supply of these different substances 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.439
 instrument 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.680
 for maintaining brain health 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.219
 some elements are indicated mainly those rich in omega 3 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.259
 vitamin c and vitamin c postures and the b complex 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.399
 Seafood 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:15.869
 Thank you later. 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.239
 half way 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.149
 stores and nuts 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.149
 besides organic food means this 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.289
 the student interested in obtaining success in selective processes interest in 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.249
 science in mental activities 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.439
 should avoid some delights 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:43.459
 sweet fried drinks industrialized and saturated fat easily found 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.949
 in foods such as red meat milk and dairy products 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.709
 but it's no use adopting the club created with the test knocking on the door 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.619
 it takes time to detoxify the body without using brain function 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.769
 moment we go to work 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.980
 making detoxification a better absorption of nutrients 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.090
 it is also worth noting that there is the arche are intestinal absorption intestinal 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.730
 should be focused and not simply go tomorrow every day 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.150
 is not we the penne to zero this blessing are turned to what really 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.299
 It is necessary that I be acquitted so I started migrants and not the 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.759
 provision 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.850
 directing the best version all the mineral nutrients vitamins that will 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.589
 favoring the reactions that are these complex and that needs with the factors 

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:34.219
 mainly vitamins minerals from a diet 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:39.219
 what we do can help us to be smarter. 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.249
 balanced with emotions and behaviors 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.889
 to adopt a diet specific to their needs 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.930
 the idea is to count on guidance of a good nutrition list doctor Karla 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.530
 jeane is part of the neon nutrition team and to schedule an appointment just call 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.930
 to the phone 32 32 nero 8 21
