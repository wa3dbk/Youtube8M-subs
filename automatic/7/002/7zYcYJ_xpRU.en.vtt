00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
and we didn't defend them all as well as

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.080 
and we didn't defend them all as well as
we'd<00:00:14.590> like<00:00:14.710> to<00:00:14.769> and<00:00:15.550> it<00:00:15.639> wasn't<00:00:15.790> the<00:00:15.940> perfect

we'd like to and it wasn't the perfect
performance<00:00:16.599> but<00:00:16.750> we<00:00:16.900> got<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.619> when<00:00:17.800> we

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
performance but we got the when we

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.679 
performance but we got the when we
stopped<00:00:18.189> man<00:00:18.310> from<00:00:18.460> got<00:00:18.580> my<00:00:18.730> bonus<00:00:18.849> point<00:00:19.180> you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
two in the league and i think the

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.290

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
performance leads us in nicely the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.120 
performance leads us in nicely the

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
game us being particularly pleased we

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.479 
game us being particularly pleased we
took<00:00:28.810> your<00:00:28.960> chances<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.470> way<00:00:29.590> you<00:00:30.160> took<00:00:30.309> your

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
took your chances the way you took your

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.670 
took your chances the way you took your
try<00:00:30.669> em<00:00:31.300> yeah<00:00:31.660> it<00:00:31.809> was<00:00:31.930> good<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.169> be<00:00:32.200> twenty

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
try em yeah it was good to be twenty

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.319 
try em yeah it was good to be twenty
Nell<00:00:32.829> up<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.130> think<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.670> wind<00:00:33.820> actually<00:00:34.000> died<00:00:34.300> a

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
Nell up I think the wind actually died a

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.729 
Nell up I think the wind actually died a
wee<00:00:34.540> bit<00:00:34.660> in<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.840> second<00:00:35.110> half<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:35.530> we<00:00:35.620> did

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
wee bit in the second half so we did

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.779 
wee bit in the second half so we did
well<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:36.010> get<00:00:36.130> that<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.429> first<00:00:36.609> half

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
well to get that the first half

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.490 
well to get that the first half
disappointing<00:00:37.719> to<00:00:37.780> let<00:00:37.899> them<00:00:38.050> in<00:00:38.170> from<00:00:38.379> the

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
disappointing to let them in from the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.099 
disappointing to let them in from the
try<00:00:38.710> just<00:00:39.370> for<00:00:39.399> halftime<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:40.149> that<00:00:40.899> all

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
try just for halftime and that all

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.689 
try just for halftime and that all
season<00:00:41.379> I<00:00:41.559> think<00:00:41.739> whatever<00:00:41.890> combination<00:00:42.280> of

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
season I think whatever combination of

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.790 
season I think whatever combination of
backs<00:00:43.329> marks<00:00:43.750> had<00:00:43.899> in<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.079> field<00:00:44.289> I<00:00:44.500> think

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
backs marks had in the field I think

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.139 
backs marks had in the field I think
they've<00:00:44.920> caused<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.219> lot<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.399> teams<00:00:45.670> a<00:00:45.850> lot<00:00:46.059> of

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
they've caused a lot of teams a lot of

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.739 
they've caused a lot of teams a lot of
problems<00:00:46.449> and<00:00:46.690> from<00:00:47.589> personal<00:00:47.829> point<00:00:47.980> of<00:00:48.160> view

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
problems and from personal point of view

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.880 
problems and from personal point of view
program<00:00:49.749> girls<00:00:49.960> many<00:00:50.109> tries<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.499> wanted<00:00:50.800> this

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
program girls many tries is wanted this

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.380 
program girls many tries is wanted this
year<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.280> back<00:00:51.429> three<00:00:51.670> don't<00:00:51.999> always<00:00:52.210> share

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
year the back three don't always share

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.720 
year the back three don't always share
perhaps<00:00:53.230> but<00:00:53.589> it<00:00:54.100> was<00:00:54.219> nice<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.489> get<00:00:54.579> one

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.720 
perhaps but it was nice to get one
