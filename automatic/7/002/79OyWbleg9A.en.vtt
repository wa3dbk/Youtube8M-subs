automatically<00:00:55.379> at<00:00:55.620> 60<00:00:55.980> degrees<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.120> side<00:00:57.930> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
automatically at 60 degrees the side is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.939 
automatically at 60 degrees the side is
actually<00:00:58.649> cork<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.550> has<00:00:59.789> been<00:01:00.559> wine<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
actually cork that has been wine that we

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.179 
actually cork that has been wine that we
have<00:01:02.070> soared<00:01:02.370> over<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.760> years<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.799> it's<00:01:04.799> cork

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
have soared over the years and it's cork

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
have soared over the years and it's cork
on<00:01:05.400> corks<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> way<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.900> way<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> explain

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
on corks so the way this way to explain

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.719 
on corks so the way this way to explain
it<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.909> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.360> 1<00:01:10.200> by<00:01:10.409> 1<00:01:10.439> foot<00:01:10.950> square<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
it is this is a 1 by 1 foot square of

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
it is this is a 1 by 1 foot square of
thin<00:01:12.240> cork<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:14.280> glue<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.900> place

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
thin cork and you glue and you place

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
thin cork and you glue and you place
these<00:01:16.680> quarks<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.310> top<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
these quarks on top of it and this is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.940 
these quarks on top of it and this is
what<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:21.900> 17<00:01:22.560> years<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
what you get and it's about 17 years of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
what you get and it's about 17 years of
wine<00:01:23.520> drinking<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.150> friends<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.659> family

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that you see right there so that's the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.980 
that you see right there so that's the
first<00:01:27.420> layer<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:29.299> what's<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.689> into

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
first layer and what's going to go into

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.950 
first layer and what's going to go into
that<00:01:31.229> wine<00:01:31.710> cellar<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.670> wine<00:01:32.970> rack<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960

that wine cellar is this wine rack that
holds<00:01:34.189> 296<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.369> basically<00:01:35.790> 300

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
holds 296 so basically 300

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.440 
holds 296 so basically 300
the<00:01:36.840> wine<00:01:37.080> will<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.860> display<00:01:38.280> areas<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:39.030> here

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the wine will be display areas up here

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.380 
the wine will be display areas up here
and<00:01:39.830> this<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:40.890> double<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.850> put<00:01:42.000> 2<00:01:42.180> vols

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and this is double so you can put 2 vols

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.890 
and this is double so you can put 2 vols
you<00:01:42.600> need<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.870> be<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.400> less<00:01:44.900> this

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900

actually it's showing right now the big
deal<00:02:24.570> here<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.500> entire<00:02:25.920> wall<00:02:26.160> hack<00:02:26.430> that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
deal here was this entire wall hack that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.270 
deal here was this entire wall hack that
you<00:02:26.700> removed<00:02:27.440> first<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.040> fit

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you removed first of all they just fit

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.550 
you removed first of all they just fit
the<00:02:29.430> AC<00:02:29.550> unit<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.270> but<00:02:30.900> then<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.260> create<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the AC unit in but then to create a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.980 
the AC unit in but then to create a
comments<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.190> tube<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.850> drops<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:33.780> here

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
comments a tube that drops in here

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.320 
comments a tube that drops in here
because<00:02:34.320> obviously<00:02:34.500> trying<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.550> keep<00:02:35.910> fifty

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
because obviously trying to keep fifty

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.670 
because obviously trying to keep fifty
to<00:02:36.420> seventy<00:02:36.690> percent<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:37.470> will<00:02:37.650> be

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
to seventy percent there will be

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.950 
to seventy percent there will be
condensation<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.940> what<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> did<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.450> built<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
condensation so what I did is built a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.560 
condensation so what I did is built a
nice<00:02:40.140> little<00:02:40.320> frame<00:02:40.680> using<00:02:41.400> an<00:02:41.700> old<00:02:41.880> case<00:02:42.209> of

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
nice little frame using an old case of

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.830 
nice little frame using an old case of
wine<00:02:43.020> from<00:02:43.320> chile<00:02:43.410> called<00:02:43.980> those<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
wine from chile called those and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.300 
wine from chile called those and
basically<00:02:45.840> what<00:02:46.050> will<00:02:46.230> happen<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.709> over<00:02:47.100> time

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
basically what will happen is over time

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.310 
basically what will happen is over time
you<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.180> pull<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.480> out<00:02:48.660> there's<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.080> little

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
you just pull it out there's this little

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.780 
you just pull it out there's this little
little<00:02:50.600> tube<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.959> drops<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.459> water

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
little tube that drops in and that water

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.400 
little tube that drops in and that water
will<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.180> dropped<00:02:54.420> into<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.780> toilet<00:02:54.870> and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
will be dropped into the toilet and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.520 
will be dropped into the toilet and
that's<00:02:56.370> worth<00:02:56.610> drops<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.540> then<00:02:57.930> all<00:02:58.080> i<00:02:58.110> had

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that's worth drops so and then all i had

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.140 
that's worth drops so and then all i had
to<00:02:58.770> drive<00:02:59.610> all<00:02:59.640> this<00:03:00.000> thing<00:03:00.270> in

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
to drive all this thing in

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.479 
to drive all this thing in
so<00:03:01.840> that's<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.650> backside<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.370> white

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
so that's the the backside of the white

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.750 
so that's the the backside of the white

it all started with a little drawing

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.509 
it all started with a little drawing
here<00:03:09.459> but<00:03:09.939> that<00:03:10.599> was<00:03:10.689> drawn<00:03:10.989> in<00:03:11.200> about<00:03:11.519> August

two things it controlled temperature as

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.930 
two things it controlled temperature as
well<00:03:39.519> as<00:03:39.670> humidity<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:41.019> thing<00:03:41.290> will<00:03:41.560> be

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940

targeting 60 degrees you can see up

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.250 
targeting 60 degrees you can see up
there<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:46.150> humidity<00:03:46.480> will<00:03:46.870> be<00:03:46.989> between

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
there and the humidity will be between

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.490 
there and the humidity will be between
fifty<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:47.799> seventy<00:03:48.129> percent<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.480> very<00:03:50.170> nice
