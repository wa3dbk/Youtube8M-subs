out with a knockout it was said before
by<00:03:28.540> many<00:03:28.780> experts<00:03:29.020> it's<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.950> only<00:03:30.070> way<00:03:30.340> he

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
by many experts it's the only way he

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.920 
by many experts it's the only way he
could<00:03:30.730> come<00:03:30.910> out<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.180> Argentina<00:03:31.390> with<00:03:31.870> a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
could come out of Argentina with a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.470 
could come out of Argentina with a
victory<00:03:32.200> anyway<00:03:32.620> but<00:03:33.280> few<00:03:33.610> thought<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:34.360> he

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
victory anyway but few thought that he

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.540 
victory anyway but few thought that he
would<00:03:34.630> go<00:03:34.780> into<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.200> 15th<00:03:35.590> round<00:03:35.770> trailing<00:03:36.430> as

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
would go into the 15th round trailing as

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.700 
would go into the 15th round trailing as
badly<00:03:36.820> as<00:03:37.030> he<00:03:37.120> does<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:38.080> think<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.500> it's

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
badly as he does and I think that it's

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.380 
badly as he does and I think that it's
safe<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.070> say<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.280> at<00:03:39.580> this<00:03:39.730> point<00:03:39.970> it's

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
safe to say that at this point it's

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.840 
safe to say that at this point it's
about<00:03:40.690> 12<00:03:41.050> rounds<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:41.620> zone<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.160> two<00:03:42.610> for

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
about 12 rounds one zone and two for

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
about 12 rounds one zone and two for
