00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello, I'll be back with you and we will 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.810
 today so a little bit about that 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.010
 the first time you make a makeover talk to me 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.240
 and if so a bit ours 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.070
 Tell story and go afterwards 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.139
 still on your questions to us 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.380
 have and wish you a lot of savings 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.380
 run 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.730
 then tell me how was yours 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.930
 first nesting experience 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.660
 So I think I 'm relative 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.790
 late really made up or in the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.559
 I am only 16 at school 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.390
 make-up and that is always how I am 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.460
 bought a bit of make up and also 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.320
 tested but never really used 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.330
 because with me it is such a thing 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.910
 I used to fear that very early 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.449
 I find myself ugly without make-up 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.010
 would 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.809
 That's why I did not want to make up 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.670
 use because I really me too 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.379
 I did not want to find it nice 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.750
 India is always the more of such women 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.070
 belongs to his wife without make up 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.410
 I can not leave the house and 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.640
 I wanted could be me without 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.500
 accept make-up 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.239
 that's why I'm only 16 at the time 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.740
 really started making makeup 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.619
 also go to school and wear 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.200
 I think so with me it was like that 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.430
 I think I have about 12:30 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.350
 what started actually whole corner 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.759
 early and probably a bit 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.140
 maybe my audience is still one 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.300
 little concerned so I think I've 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.110
 at twelve I have a Roman 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.399
 get a present 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.280
 I only have my eyelashes there 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.200
 showered and applied concealer 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.179
 and then I started at the age of 14 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.560
 have a bit of kajal too 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.990
 I swing then a bit 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.740
 with brown bavaria upper eyelashes and 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:41.340
 the lower lash line thus 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.020
 foundation and that's how I believe it 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.940
 16 17 as it has been since then 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.349
 actually supposed to do videos and shoot 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.119
 I I have on twitter asked if we 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.110
 do not have a few questions both of us have and 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.880
 I just wanted a few 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.619
 spectators ask you to answer 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.509
 that you are not pretty cool and here 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.800
 Almost for example the leoni was it was 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.130
 the first make-up product you have 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.959
 Had it with lip gloss and looked from 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.810
 all the whole I used to be three he used to be 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.360
 tackles lipgloss and design at the end was 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.130
 never one in a wise one 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.660
 So it really works a little bit more 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.270
 i know my first product more like that 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.430
 I have deliberately smoked now 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.069
 actually make-up pretty buy who 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.020
 on regular weapons with me because it 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.610
 yes said oscar was the me 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.380
 History has taken a brown 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.550
 Waterproof mascara means they were 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.290
 not that not really fooled 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.700
 because only 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.459
 I have just the blonde eyelashes 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.579
 So nothing special 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.659
 quite simple is actually because has 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.640
 Pictures are not asked 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.700
 some drastic beginner mistake 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 So he committed 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.670
 Accessoire not at the beginning but so 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.959
 in the course of my schmid train is but 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.760
 The thing where I then with the car years 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.900
 I started there then 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.390
 sometime a bit exaggerated 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.250
 then my waterline brown or 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.859
 black maybe even on the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.659
 Waterline abandoned so completely and 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.299
 it was just completely black 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.680
 to say I absolutely do not think so 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.450
 nice, that's why a friend 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.859
 from me at the beginning always made and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.510
 that is so blatant from sometime she has 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.459
 that then also pictured 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.379
 and if everyone does that I think so 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.879
 always needed a relatively long time at the beginning 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.500
 has until the right foundation 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.090
 So I 've found I have 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.120
 for a while always dark 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.919
 foundation worn so difficult 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.209
 to find the right one so completely on 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.790
 At the beginning where I make such a make-up 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.739
 wanted to test a bit and that was 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.389
 also not so cool because I can give you the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.040
 Tip that you are a lighter 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.889
 nuance definitely a lighter one 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.909
 used instead the darker ones as well 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.560
 like the foundation a few times 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.329
 wear for hours and then decide 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.470
 which color would like to use and then 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:40.079
 still asks baby's big baby nature how to 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.639
 Not surprised so I think so 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.220
 is always very important because it is me 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.930
 earlier also happened that one 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.599
 in the morning always make-up can still be 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.889
 so dark and such a lamp and wear 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.949
 I'll open it all up and leave 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.540
 this from the house 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.040
 that's why it's really good again 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.720
 bathroom extra maybe to go 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.299
 or that's why I sometimes get up 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.519
 the bed so really where you light a lot 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.349
 has a faction of your name in the morning 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.459
 and generally you can just have that 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.229
 We also show where I am in your video 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.720
 then you can drop by that 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.919
 you just did not use a bus 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.180
 So kidman animal is that is 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.959
 In principle, it is actually but 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.639
 is bad if it is not so 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.560
 it is complicated but in that case it is 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.699
 really good if it's just very discreet 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.889
 new and just a little fresh 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.139
 there of, first, really right 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.659
 many who are not so casting band now 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.729
 just then ask the cellphone underlined 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.880
 ex with what merkel you have on 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.139
 at the beginning I only make-up 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.870
 believe me when I started to 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.800
 Make-up there was not necessarily so 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.410
 but I think so, too, I was very 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.880
 a lot in the dining area on the way so 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.620
 actually I can not just it 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.780
 I still do not wear patrice 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.920
 possible because it definitely 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.320
 pretty much of p 2 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.000
 The whole thing has already been in the em 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.320
 I used a lot of products from me 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.950
 I always do it now 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.390
 still far 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.700
 We also have really cheap things 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.680
 yes really great are denise 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.780
 littmann asks a lot more when did you have 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.880
 it first applied foundation and 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.390
 I personally said I believe 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.560
 I really started with 16 17 of 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.270
 which one to wear which I find that it 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.740
 previously not so necessary was necessary 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.030
 I just carried people 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.770
 because I find that my skin is simple 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.540
 got worse and somehow 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.480
 I think that foundation then so im 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.490
 all the way round even if you 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.900
 starts to make up more 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.310
 he also makes sense foundation 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.320
 use because the net really 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.660
 complete is one knows then it too 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.360
 I'm really 16 years old 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.430
 also killed more so from eating so 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.670
 Day creams and something like that 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.350
 that was fix with 16 still asks 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.780
 Partie could already have each other there 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.910
 great tip no definitely not 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.410
 i think i can find that 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.930
 I'm really trying because I like 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.280
 This ring sexy and I wear real 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.320
 maybe actually only since then 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.860
 maybe this year this year 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.210
 year 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.040
 but I think as I said also has the 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.900
 but not so early on 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.850
 You can really belong there too 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.650
 So rather in our video we ask 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.750
 There are already quite some of Essens 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.510
 You can easily make bright eyeliner 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.460
 Wear on bottom and try otherwise 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.380
 he can take such natural nuances as 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.330
 you brew the throne dress you 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.980
 Just your eyelashes a bit 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.630
 more compacted with an eyeliner 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.600
 instead of making you such a fat one 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.450
 Just pull the eyeliner line because that 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.700
 you do not even need it 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.620
 because now ask, underlined what 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.540
 Would you recommend it because you want that 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.510
 I should taste it first 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.380
 personally find an age of 13 14 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.419
 quite well 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.440
 So I started at twelve 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.770
 I think that's almost a bit too 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.210
 think so early yes so takes 13 years 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.040
 I actually like the area 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.540
 said just always for I also 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.660
 important that you do not stop that way 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.950
 a great make up she will make up if 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.090
 you want to try it a bit 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.370
 or because they an overnight stay 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.650
 scaglione girlfriend but for the school 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.169
 There it is really achieved when you are 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.150
 just a little what makes 13 14 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.710
 in oaks great age and the first 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.410
 It's easy to test 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.150
 exactly what I also think there'd stick
