00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:19.757
 We are not going to make it! 

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:24.301
 Come on, a little further! 

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.521
 NOeee 

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:36.179
 Aah ... We have to get to the cheese! 

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:39.328
 &lt;i&gt; (splash) &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.276
 What!? 

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.649
 Noeee 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.641
 No no no no WAIT! 

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:05.451
 Why are you laughing? 

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:07.313
 You play a bad guy. 

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:12.690
 Ugh 

00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:14.761
 Then! ... Chrisi! 

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.367
 Jason? Where have you been all the time? 

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.211
 We haven't seen you in a long time. 

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.690
 Yes, we have already replaced you 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.940
 This is Jeff. 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.292
 Hey Jeff! 

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.655
 Hey hey Jeff. 

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:30.069
 Wow, he's so polite! 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.983
 One of you has to play my bad guy. 

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:33.993
 I will do it! 

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.579
 Woohoo! Come on! Let's go! 

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:41.064
 Do you come? 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.153
 Really ... There, on that toy boat. 

00:01:44.153 --> 00:01:47.439
 Yes ... No, you go. Live it out ... 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.464
 Okay, you need to know yourself! 

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:52.836
 Pff. I don't need them. 

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:55.820
 I can have fun with ... 

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:56.915
 Jeff 

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:14.187
 &lt;i&gt; (gun sounds) (heavy music) &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.615
 Ugh. Come on! It's like you're not even trying. 

00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:21.519
 &lt;i&gt; (bonk) &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.165
 Ugh ... This sucks! 

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:28.434
 Hey, that seems like leu ... no ... no ... 

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:29.668
 I don't want to go there! 

00:02:29.747 --> 00:02:30.733
 Why not? 

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.629
 Ah! Did you just talk to me? 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:37.315
 Yes indeed. And actually you are pretty bad at this game. 

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:39.103
 Oh my God, are you Morgan Freeman? 

00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:39.983
 No, but... 

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:41.353
 Say you are Morgan Freeman! 

00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:43.076
 You are Morgan Freeman. 

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:44.091
 I'm Morgan Freeman? 

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.005
 No... 

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.130
 Oh... 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.633
 You'd better go there 

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:49.649
 and spend some time with your friends. 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.561
 But I do not want to. It's all fake. Sounds so boring. 

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:58.607
 I need something more visually stimulating, like this Xcube ONE with KINOCT. 

00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:02.272
 You know that the NSA spies on you with those things. 

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:03.267
 No, we don't do that. 

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:04.434
 Xcube out. 

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:09.006
 The fact is that using your imagination is not a bad thing. 

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:12.221
 You already use it now. 

00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:13.273
 Oh yeah? 

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:16.258
 &lt;i&gt; (orchestra music plays) &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.201
 GOODBYE! 

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:19.226
 &lt;i&gt; (orchestra music plays) &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.365
 Ugh 

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:29.563
 Uh. Hey, would you mind if I joined in? 

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:34.684
 I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE IT? 

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:38.152
 I don't think there is much that you can do to surprise me. 

00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:40.110
 Okay then ... 

00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:47.136
 &lt;i&gt; (Music changes -&gt; dramatically) &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:49.270
 Wah! Where are we? 

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:53.086
 You are in my head now! 

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:59.772
 &lt;i&gt; (Dubstep music plays) &lt;/i&gt; 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.816
 Wah, what's happening? 

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:09.712
 THE BASS IS DROPPING 

00:04:11.674 --> 00:04:16.074
