00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.389 
got this beautiful natural wave pattern
and<00:00:30.510> then<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:30.869> gonna<00:00:30.990> bump<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.650> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and then I'm just gonna bump that up so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.000 
and then I'm just gonna bump that up so
what<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.790> gonna<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.930> where<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> curves<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
what I'm gonna do is where it curves in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.610 
what I'm gonna do is where it curves in
that's<00:00:35.370> where<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> pop<00:00:35.969> my<00:00:36.210> iron

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
that's where I'm going to pop my iron

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.619 
that's where I'm going to pop my iron
lightly<00:00:37.620> wrap<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.550> around<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.450> leave

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
lightly wrap it around and just leave

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.690 
lightly wrap it around and just leave
the<00:00:39.780> ends<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.980> too<00:00:41.340> done

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the ends out so that's not too done

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910 
the ends out so that's not too done
looking<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.469> drop<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
looking and then you can just drop that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.090 
looking and then you can just drop that
out<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.539> pull<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.530> stretch<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
out and I pull it just stretch it a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.279 
out and I pull it just stretch it a
little<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:47.940> too<00:00:48.300> done<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.110> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
little bit so it's not too done and you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
little bit so it's not too done and you
can<00:00:49.440> either<00:00:49.530> start<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.700> side<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> go

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
can either start from one side and go

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.299 
can either start from one side and go
this<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.780> or<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.230> started<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> center

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this way or I started in the center

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.340 
this way or I started in the center
doesn't<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:53.969> matter<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.989> thing<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
doesn't really matter the thing that I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
doesn't really matter the thing that I
love<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.620> clamp<00:00:56.160> list<00:00:56.430> iron<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.090> just

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
love about clamp list iron so I just

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.479 
love about clamp list iron so I just
find<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:58.109> easy<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.859> people<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.340> use

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
find them really easy for people to use

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.420 
find them really easy for people to use
themselves<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.829> repeating

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
themselves so now I'm just repeating

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.289 
themselves so now I'm just repeating
that<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> way<00:01:03.629> around<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:05.030> now<00:01:06.030> when<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that all the way around and now when you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
that all the way around and now when you
move<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> side<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
move to the side what I like to do is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.510 
move to the side what I like to do is
actually<00:01:08.520> create<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.030> big<00:01:09.570> zigzag<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually create a big zigzag so what I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
actually create a big zigzag so what I
do<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.090> walk<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.840> chopstick<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
do is I just walk my chopstick on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
do is I just walk my chopstick on the
scalp<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> split<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
scalp and then when I split it it has a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.310 
scalp and then when I split it it has a
zigzag<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> reason<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.200> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
zigzag now the reason I do that it's so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620 
zigzag now the reason I do that it's so
that<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.590> don't<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:20.070> lines<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> front<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that you don't see lines in the front of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
that you don't see lines in the front of
your<00:01:21.750> hair<00:01:22.020> otherwise<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.799> end<00:01:22.950> up

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
your hair otherwise you would end up

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.160 
your hair otherwise you would end up
with<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.310> railroad<00:01:23.670> tracks<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
with like railroad tracks what I like to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.590 
with like railroad tracks what I like to
do<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.770> wrap<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.580> away<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> face

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600
