00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.549
 yes my friends what's up from their 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 Pan-European therefore with the new one 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.490
 tutorial video that veolia I have 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.490
 ever uploaded but off 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.620
 Inexplicable reasons have the end 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 was missing where was shown what I 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.440
 at all it takes tutorial doing so 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.550
 just agree that here again 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.380
 new it is about the following as I drive 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 at pokemon omega ruby ​​and easier 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.240
 four permanently in the circle without the ds 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 to lead 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.820
 The trick was already in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.380
 pokémon xy at the prism tower where you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.570
 something small, such as one 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 coin or in the note under his 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 so that the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 protagonist permanently to the right or 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 drives left and through this ski 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.270
 programming the merck the whole 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.700
 Time in a circle drives because the notes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.100
 with yes the trick is synonymous here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 and yes I'll just show you how 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 it works like I'm just 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 in the pokémon center of the fight hairstyle and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.000
 Do not move me because I do it all 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.120
 not commented on commented 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.120
 that nothing happens here and that's why 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.700
 The horny when I am slow 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.760
 moving thank you yes, as I said 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.409
 stand here in the fight resort where you can 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.450
 after the pokémon league it comes 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.610
 that's why for those who ask first 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.350
 nice the league on 4 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.040
 defeat and then you can too 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.110
 to reach 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.200
 Anyway, we have to go to the beach here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.479
 The beach bar became too dense 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.850
 tuned to this move tutor here 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.650
 go and best you take with you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.710
 the steering wheel because then the then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.060
 gefixed better tuned sat 1 with the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.460
 sliding pad one the sliding pad lightly 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.040
 Deviations had never been so accurate 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.290
 if I get on the bike and ride 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.210
 to the right until then where it is no longer 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.220
 continues and then with the sliding pad 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.619
 up there because then you stuck the coin 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.180
 or other purely because every time 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.130
 you now encounter a barrier 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.590
 The protagonist returns to the top 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.630
 that has me spinning and though 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.200
 the sliding pad then points upwards 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.210
 fatih always in the direction and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.409
 only up when the player is one 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.489
 almost ram pops like for example here 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.910
 The sliding pad is still up 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:17.130
 trapped here under the bridge 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.450
 because you learn about it even though briefly 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.190
 this sand will cause a bit 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.460
 it's slow but that does not matter 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.870
 is also possible as an alternative 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.560
 but I'm not the fan of it 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.300
 I have to say honestly in the desert 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.330
 put where you can only high up the all-wheel 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.680
 there you can also face it and 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.390
 also put something under the sliding pad 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.100
 that the protagonist quasi this place 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.280
 but it's always up 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.950
 is thrown down because he only one 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.140
 wheel comes up that also steps 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.320
 I tried yesterday and mine 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.040
 pool in the pension has a level to 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.660
 but i personally like it though 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.370
 the whole time in a circle that drives 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.740
 looks cooler and then you can 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.470
 faster his pokemon eggs breed because 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.340
 You are right in the pension here 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.890
 the fighting zone 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.870
 You can also go if you are a pokémon 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.970
 who have ev already trained and you 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.530
 they would now like leveling and corrosive 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.880
 There's tears all the time 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.300
 and defeat or league 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.310
 go 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.430
 then she just grabbed two here 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.050
 the pensions are at a good 117 left 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.209
 of tires for city ​​two pieces the 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.070
 pension flies back now in the fight 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.790
 resort and the ds just once over 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.680
 night run 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.760
 I also did that for my edition 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.510
 at my ex and david in pokémon what 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.610
 you're done ev on level 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.880
 30 or something like that depends on it 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.130
 what has caught and run overnight 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.989
 let it level up and that was on 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.459
 Next morning, the level was at 75 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.310
 78 so therefore there is already a lot 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.830
 level then rum around so the video 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.690
 driven through and helped if yes let 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.489
 tends not subscribed me yet 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.610

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.390
 Now for the next part of the legend of 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.799
 zelda link's pokemon alpha saphir one 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.370
