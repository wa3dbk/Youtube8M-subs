00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
found a gap where you can sneak in but

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:50.430 
found a gap where you can sneak in but
you'll<00:01:43.580> have<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.759> go<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.090> long<00:01:44.240> way<00:01:44.270> around

since this is a power-down area you need

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.609 
since this is a power-down area you need
to<00:01:53.240> be<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> little<00:01:53.450> bit<00:01:53.840> conservative<00:01:54.200> about

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
to be a little bit conservative about

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.940 
to be a little bit conservative about
your<00:01:55.490> use<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.729> your<00:01:56.119> special<00:01:56.569> powers<00:01:56.950> however

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
if you do run out just know that you can

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.370 
if you do run out just know that you can
light<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.330> electrical<00:02:02.330> fence<00:02:02.600> or<00:02:02.899> any<00:02:03.110> kind

of metal object that usually will give

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.260 
of metal object that usually will give
you<00:02:05.360> some<00:02:05.659> some<00:02:06.289> power<00:02:06.500> back<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.429> just<00:02:07.640> keep

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
you some some power back and just keep

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.820 
you some some power back and just keep
hitting<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.050> absorb<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
hitting it and then absorb the
