make batteries for the Malibu mainly

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.530 
make batteries for the Malibu mainly
because<00:00:17.310> they<00:00:17.910> don't<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> right<00:00:18.329> size

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540

dimensions<00:00:19.169> the<00:00:19.410> stock<00:00:20.099> battery<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.790> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
dimensions the stock battery in the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.690 
dimensions the stock battery in the
Malibu<00:00:21.450> is<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.110> 9<00:00:22.590> inch<00:00:22.890> long<00:00:23.160> whereas<00:00:23.520> the

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
Malibu is a 9 inch long whereas the

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.609 
Malibu is a 9 inch long whereas the
Optima<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.660> think<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.989> 10<00:00:25.230> inch<00:00:25.410> long

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
Optima like I think it's a 10 inch long

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.589 
Optima like I think it's a 10 inch long
battery<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.149> a<00:00:27.180> little<00:00:27.360> redneck

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
right there into the alternator that's a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.969 
right there into the alternator that's a
really<00:02:00.540> important<00:02:00.900> one<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.259> we're<00:02:01.860> gonna

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
really important one to go we're gonna

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.109 
really important one to go we're gonna
do<00:02:02.100> though<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.490> we're<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> take<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
do though is we're going to take that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.580 
do though is we're going to take that
stock<00:02:03.390> battery<00:02:03.780> right<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> try

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
stock battery right now I'm going to try

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
stock battery right now I'm going to try
a<00:02:04.619> dremel<00:02:05.040> out<00:02:05.189> those<00:02:05.430> wedges<00:02:06.150> or<00:02:06.180> maybe<00:02:06.420> I'll

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
a dremel out those wedges or maybe I'll

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.089 
a dremel out those wedges or maybe I'll
show<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> wedges<00:02:07.350> right<00:02:07.619> afterward

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
show you the wedges right afterward

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.289 
show you the wedges right afterward
right<00:02:08.310> after<00:02:08.519> I<00:02:08.549> pull<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> battery<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
right after I pull the battery out and

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.659 
right after I pull the battery out and
now<00:02:09.509> we'll<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:09.840> from<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.549> alright<00:02:11.549> so

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:11.669 
now we'll go from there alright so

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.970 
now we'll go from there alright so
here's<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> case<00:02:12.689> without<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.230> battery<00:02:13.829> in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
here's the case without the battery in

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.449 
here's the case without the battery in
it

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
it

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.640 
it
the<00:02:14.819> problematic<00:02:15.269> parts<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.049> are<00:02:16.230> gonna<00:02:16.379> be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
the problematic parts of it are gonna be

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.619 
the problematic parts of it are gonna be
right<00:02:17.519> these<00:02:17.819> two<00:02:17.849> things<00:02:18.299> aren't<00:02:18.540> here

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
right these two things aren't here

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.819 
right these two things aren't here
enough<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:18.989> see<00:02:19.140> them<00:02:19.230> these<00:02:19.349> two<00:02:19.560> little

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
enough you can see them these two little

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.369 
enough you can see them these two little
thin<00:02:20.549> looking<00:02:20.849> things<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.019> one<00:02:22.200> this

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
thin looking things right this one this

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.160 
thin looking things right this one this
one<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.890> Optima<00:02:23.489> has<00:02:23.640> those<00:02:23.879> I'll<00:02:24.510> call<00:02:25.019> them

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
one the Optima has those I'll call them

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.229 
one the Optima has those I'll call them
goopy<00:02:25.890> shape<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.579> one<00:02:26.730> actually<00:02:26.849> doesn't

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
goopy shape so this one actually doesn't

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.089 
goopy shape so this one actually doesn't
need<00:02:27.359> to<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.540> filed<00:02:27.810> down<00:02:28.049> but<00:02:28.709> what<00:02:28.829> I<00:02:28.859> need<00:02:28.980> to

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
need to be filed down but what I need to

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.740 
need to be filed down but what I need to
do<00:02:29.189> is<00:02:29.310> basically<00:02:29.459> take<00:02:29.879> this<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.510> cut

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
do is basically take this one and cut

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.629 
do is basically take this one and cut
this<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.049> completely<00:02:31.650> down<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.340> order<00:02:32.579> to

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
this one completely down in order to

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.000 
this one completely down in order to
make<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:32.969> work<00:02:33.439> hopefully<00:02:34.439> that<00:02:34.709> won't<00:02:34.799> take

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
make it work hopefully that won't take

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.009 
make it work hopefully that won't take
too<00:02:35.189> long<00:02:35.219> I<00:02:35.459> say<00:02:35.609> just<00:02:35.760> put<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.420> dremel<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
too long I say just put the dremel and a

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.589 
too long I say just put the dremel and a
about<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.680> bing<00:02:37.859> bada<00:02:38.040> boom<00:02:38.129> good<00:02:38.609> to<00:02:38.700> go<00:02:41.599> all

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
about a bing bada boom good to go all

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.879 
about a bing bada boom good to go all
right<00:02:42.689> here's<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.049> here's<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> battery

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
right here's the here's the battery

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.800 
right here's the here's the battery

while it's sitting in there dry fit wise

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.780 
while it's sitting in there dry fit wise
see<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.650> not<00:02:46.980> exactly<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.489> there<00:02:47.639> all<00:02:47.760> the

way<00:02:47.939> it<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.720> all<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.019> way<00:02:49.109> against<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.470> back

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
way it is all the way against the back

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
but I shot my flashlight on it that

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.990 
but I shot my flashlight on it that
little<00:02:55.169> tab<00:02:56.010> looking<00:02:56.400> thing<00:02:56.609> right<00:02:56.790> there

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
little tab looking thing right there

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.670 
little tab looking thing right there
that's<00:02:57.269> what's<00:02:57.450> getting<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> way<00:02:57.989> the

that's what's getting in the way the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
that's what's getting in the way the
center<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.099> works<00:02:59.340> just<00:02:59.459> fine<00:02:59.760> because<00:02:59.909> it's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
center one works just fine because it's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
center one works just fine because it's
fitting<00:03:00.419> that<00:03:00.450> groove<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.560> there's<00:03:01.799> another

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
fitting that groove but there's another

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.259 
fitting that groove but there's another
one<00:03:02.129> right<00:03:02.189> there<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.849> those<00:03:03.060> two<00:03:03.239> things
