00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
hi in the session I'm going to cover how

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.409 
hi in the session I'm going to cover how
to<00:00:01.380> create<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> fade<00:00:02.370> effect<00:00:02.520> now<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.270> not

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
to create a fade effect now this is not

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.999 
to create a fade effect now this is not
the<00:00:03.540> same<00:00:03.750> type<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.080> fade<00:00:04.410> effect<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.890> you

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
the same type of fade effect that you

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.099 
the same type of fade effect that you
would<00:00:05.130> see<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.490> an<00:00:05.580> animation<00:00:06.060> if<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.750> select

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
would see in an animation if I select

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.310 
would see in an animation if I select
this<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.529> go<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:09.540> fade<00:00:09.840> effect<00:00:09.990> this

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
this and I go to this fade effect this

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.220 
this and I go to this fade effect this
exit<00:00:10.650> fit<00:00:10.800> at<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.670> animation<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.840> more<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.170> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
exit fit at for animation it's more of a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.959 
exit fit at for animation it's more of a
fade<00:00:13.440> effect<00:00:13.830> where<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.309> would<00:00:14.429> blend<00:00:14.759> an

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
fade effect where we would blend an

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.910 
fade effect where we would blend an
image<00:00:15.299> into<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.809> background<00:00:16.529> color<00:00:16.770> or

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
image into the background color or

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.670 
image into the background color or
another<00:00:17.520> color<00:00:17.789> close<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.750> example<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.439> have

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
another color close for example we have

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.550 
another color close for example we have
some<00:00:20.640> text<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.900> an<00:00:22.080> image<00:00:22.170> here

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
some text here and we have an image here

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.790 
some text here and we have an image here
and<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.830> want<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.300> blend<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.510> where<00:00:24.750> part<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and we want to blend it where part of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.830 
and we want to blend it where part of
the<00:00:25.980> image<00:00:26.609> kind<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.939> blends<00:00:27.210> into<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> white

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the image kind of blends into the white

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.109 
the image kind of blends into the white
background<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.740> another<00:00:29.519> example<00:00:30.000> would<00:00:30.060> be

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
background here another example would be

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.389 
background here another example would be
where<00:00:30.599> we'd<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:31.050> two<00:00:31.410> images<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.219> want

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
where we'd have two images and we want

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
where we'd have two images and we want
to<00:00:32.489> kind<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> blend<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.329> image<00:00:33.660> within<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
to kind of blend one image within the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
to kind of blend one image within the
other<00:00:34.380> image<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.160> we'd<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.790> kind<00:00:36.059> of

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
other image so we'd have this kind of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.910 
other image so we'd have this kind of
effect<00:00:36.239> where<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.170> looks<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> little<00:00:37.770> bit

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
effect where it looks like a little bit

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.220 
effect where it looks like a little bit
of<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> mirage<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.600> kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> there's<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of a mirage or kind of kind of there's a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.500 
of a mirage or kind of kind of there's a
dreamy<00:00:40.649> effect<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.030> let<00:00:42.210> me<00:00:42.270> show<00:00:42.420> you

click<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.539> go<00:01:47.470> into<00:01:47.680> format<00:01:47.950> shape<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.640> get

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
click that go into format shape and get

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.230 
click that go into format shape and get
rid<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:50.190> get<00:01:51.190> rid<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.640> line<00:01:51.970> color

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
rid of the get rid of the line color

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.760 
rid of the get rid of the line color
first<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.720> don't<00:01:52.780> want<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.080> line<00:01:53.259> clicks<00:01:53.649> well

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
first I don't want to line clicks well

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.770 
first I don't want to line clicks well
that's<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.039> line<00:01:54.340> color<00:01:54.670> around<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.149> square

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
that's that line color around the square

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.460 
that's that line color around the square
bucks<00:01:56.050> make<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.100> no<00:01:57.429> and<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.509> fill<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.140> want

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
bucks make that no and the fill I want

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.169 
bucks make that no and the fill I want
to<00:01:59.560> have<00:01:59.770> a<00:02:00.009> gradient<00:02:00.399> fill<00:02:00.880> because

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
to have a gradient fill because

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.029 
to have a gradient fill because
basically<00:02:01.780> it's<00:02:01.960> going<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:02.710> going<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.950> be

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
basically it's going to it's going to be

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.760 
basically it's going to it's going to be
a<00:02:03.190> gradient<00:02:03.520> from<00:02:03.880> white<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.420> white<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
a gradient from white to white and so

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.020 
a gradient from white to white and so
once<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.039> have<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.190> gradient<00:02:06.640> field<00:02:06.820> it's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
once I have that gradient field it's

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.520 
once I have that gradient field it's
going<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.210> have<00:02:07.390> these<00:02:07.570> gradient<00:02:08.050> stops<00:02:08.289> you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
going to have these gradient stops you

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.100 
going to have these gradient stops you
really<00:02:08.799> only<00:02:08.950> need<00:02:09.040> two<00:02:09.399> gradient<00:02:09.910> steps<00:02:10.179> one

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
really only need two gradient steps one

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.210 
really only need two gradient steps one
the<00:02:11.500> first<00:02:11.769> one<00:02:12.040> at<00:02:12.250> 0%<00:02:12.989> transparency<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the first one at 0% transparency and the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.199 
the first one at 0% transparency and the
second<00:02:15.640> one<00:02:15.820> at<00:02:15.970> 100%<00:02:16.860> transparency<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.730> so

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
second one at 100% transparency and so

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.390 
second one at 100% transparency and so
what<00:02:19.329> we<00:02:19.390> want<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.600> do<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:20.110> now<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.680> kind<00:02:21.340> of

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
what we want to do here now is kind of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.819 
what we want to do here now is kind of
adjust<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.910> but<00:02:22.090> first<00:02:22.480> before<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.079> you

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
adjust it but first before I do that you

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.930 
adjust it but first before I do that you
can<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.130> how<00:02:24.340> since<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.060> added<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.700> box

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
can see how since I added in the box

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.690 
can see how since I added in the box
the<00:02:28.690> last<00:02:28.930> thing<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.400> last<00:02:30.549> thing

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
all I want to do is bring the text box

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.100 
all I want to do is bring the text box
or<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.420> lettering<00:02:37.720> box<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:39.329> front<00:02:40.329> so<00:02:40.930> what<00:02:41.079> I

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
or the lettering box up front so what I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.319 
or the lettering box up front so what I
want<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.709> click<00:02:42.070> on<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.430> text<00:02:42.760> box<00:02:42.790> and

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
want to do is click on the text box and

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.840 
want to do is click on the text box and
make<00:02:44.049> sure<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.260> click<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.709> again<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.670> line

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
make sure I click it again on the line

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.789 
make sure I click it again on the line
square<00:02:46.180> we<00:02:46.360> see<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> solid<00:02:46.840> line<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.350> then

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
square we see a solid line and then

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.310 
square we see a solid line and then
right-click<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.610> send<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.450> bring<00:02:50.110> to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
right-click it and send and bring to

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.800 
right-click it and send and bring to
front<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.459> brings<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.000> front<00:02:52.239> so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
front so that brings it to the front so

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.539 
front so that brings it to the front so
let's<00:02:52.959> go<00:02:53.079> back<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.410> try<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.620> click<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
let's go back and try to click the

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.259 
let's go back and try to click the
square<00:02:55.269> box<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> brought<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.200> earlier<00:02:56.680> and

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
square box that I brought in earlier and

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.580 
square box that I brought in earlier and
this<00:02:58.269> is<00:02:58.480> where<00:02:58.660> we<00:02:58.780> now<00:02:58.900> we<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.200> get<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.440> do

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
this is where we now we can get to do

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.920 
this is where we now we can get to do
some<00:02:59.799> adjustments<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:01.450> I'm<00:03:01.570> going<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.780> go

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
some adjustments so I'm going to go

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.020 
some adjustments so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.320> kind<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.560> slide<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.100> down<00:03:03.280> here<00:03:04.000> a

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
ahead and kind of slide it down here a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.589 
ahead and kind of slide it down here a
little<00:03:04.239> bit

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.050 

see<00:03:09.319> maybe<00:03:09.620> bring<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.189> down<00:03:10.489> I'm<00:03:10.909> gonna

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
see maybe bring this down I'm gonna

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.089 
see maybe bring this down I'm gonna
close<00:03:11.269> this<00:03:11.390> box<00:03:11.629> here<00:03:11.900> we're<00:03:12.769> going<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.920> bring

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
close this box here we're going to bring

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.660 
close this box here we're going to bring
this<00:03:13.280> box<00:03:13.579> down<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:13.909> little<00:03:14.120> bit<00:03:15.549> maybe<00:03:16.549> a

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
this box down a little bit maybe a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.449 
this box down a little bit maybe a
little<00:03:16.849> bit<00:03:17.030> more<00:03:17.590> see<00:03:18.590> now<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.769> don't<00:03:19.069> see

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
little bit more see now you don't see

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.970 
little bit more see now you don't see
that<00:03:19.610> line<00:03:19.819> as<00:03:20.000> much<00:03:20.470> maybe<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.650> little<00:03:21.890> bit

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
that line as much maybe a little bit

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.649 
that line as much maybe a little bit
more<00:03:22.959> let's<00:03:23.959> see<00:03:24.110> how<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.260> looks

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
more let's see how that looks

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.270 
more let's see how that looks
see<00:03:26.659> how<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:26.930> covering<00:03:27.290> here<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.159> can

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
see how it's covering here so you can

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.800 
see how it's covering here so you can
see<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.730> takes<00:03:28.909> maybe<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.480> little<00:03:29.629> bit

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
see that it takes maybe a little bit

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.199 
see that it takes maybe a little bit
more<00:03:30.019> adjustment<00:03:30.560> after<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:31.010> get<00:03:31.909> it<00:03:32.060> in

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
more adjustment after you get it in

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.540 
more adjustment after you get it in
there<00:03:32.590> let<00:03:33.590> me<00:03:34.120> click<00:03:35.120> outside

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
there let me click outside

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.750 
there let me click outside
and<00:03:37.670> maybe<00:03:38.630> just<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:39.440> little<00:03:39.470> bit<00:03:39.980> more<00:03:40.430> here

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
and maybe just a little bit more here

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.910 
and maybe just a little bit more here
maybe<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.060> can<00:03:41.210> just<00:03:41.390> move<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:42.230> whole<00:03:42.260> box<00:03:42.620> down

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
maybe I can just move the whole box down

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.160 
maybe I can just move the whole box down
I'm<00:03:43.130> gonna<00:03:43.250> click<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:43.970> box<00:03:44.270> now<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:44.540> have<00:03:45.050> it

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
I'm gonna click the box now we have it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.840 
I'm gonna click the box now we have it
select<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:45.770> use<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.040> bottom<00:03:46.430> arrow<00:03:46.640> to

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
select it just use the bottom arrow to

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.200 
select it just use the bottom arrow to
bring<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.150> down<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.390> little<00:03:47.660> bit

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
bring it down a little bit

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.640 
bring it down a little bit
there<00:03:50.210> we<00:03:50.360> go

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.750 

and<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:53.480> think<00:03:54.480> we've<00:03:55.260> kind<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.950> blended<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.610> in

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
and I think we've kind of blended it in

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.759 
and I think we've kind of blended it in
nicely<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.659> you<00:03:57.720> don't<00:03:58.019> see<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.409> line

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
nicely so you don't see that line

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.059 
nicely so you don't see that line
anymore<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.390> one<00:04:00.659> way<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.290> creating<00:04:01.950> a

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
anymore so that's one way of creating a

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.270 
anymore so that's one way of creating a
faded<00:04:02.760> effect<00:04:03.390> on<00:04:03.629> an<00:04:03.780> image<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.739> other<00:04:05.010> way

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
faded effect on an image the other way

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.420 
faded effect on an image the other way
let<00:04:05.790> me<00:04:05.879> go<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.299> other<00:04:06.420> way<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.409> we<00:04:08.189> wanted

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
let me go the other way is if we wanted

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.039 
let me go the other way is if we wanted
to<00:04:08.549> put<00:04:08.760> an<00:04:08.879> image<00:04:09.030> within<00:04:09.329> an<00:04:09.540> image<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:09.870> kind

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049

close<00:05:43.819> that<00:05:44.089> and<00:05:44.839> kind<00:05:45.110> of<00:05:45.139> adjust<00:05:45.589> it<00:05:45.740> here<00:05:46.039> so

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
close that and kind of adjust it here so

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.359 
close that and kind of adjust it here so
but<00:05:46.669> once<00:05:46.939> you<00:05:47.059> see<00:05:47.389> that<00:05:47.659> that<00:05:48.559> after<00:05:49.249> you

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:49.369 
but once you see that that after you

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:51.939 
but once you see that that after you
select<00:05:49.699> the<00:05:49.759> transparency<00:05:50.719> for<00:05:50.900> 50%<00:05:51.349> you

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
select the transparency for 50% you

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.159 
select the transparency for 50% you
still<00:05:52.159> have<00:05:52.309> these<00:05:52.460> lines<00:05:52.819> here<00:05:53.389> so<00:05:53.930> I'm<00:05:54.020> going

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
still have these lines here so I'm going

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.719 
still have these lines here so I'm going
to<00:05:54.199> get<00:05:54.349> rid<00:05:54.589> of<00:05:54.619> that<00:05:54.860> line<00:05:54.979> to<00:05:55.189> make<00:05:55.279> it<00:05:55.430> seem

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
to get rid of that line to make it seem

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.969 
to get rid of that line to make it seem
like<00:05:55.849> it<00:05:55.969> blends<00:05:56.270> into<00:05:56.599> this<00:05:56.930> picture<00:05:57.199> so

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
like it blends into this picture so

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.109 
like it blends into this picture so
there's<00:05:58.159> some<00:05:58.279> additional<00:05:58.460> features<00:05:59.089> that

00:05:59.109 --> 00:05:59.119 
there's some additional features that

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:03.999 
there's some additional features that
you<00:05:59.509> can<00:05:59.809> use<00:06:00.289> in<00:06:00.819> PowerPoint<00:06:01.869> to<00:06:02.869> do<00:06:03.139> that<00:06:03.379> so

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
you can use in PowerPoint to do that so

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.619 
you can use in PowerPoint to do that so
once<00:06:04.189> I<00:06:04.309> selected<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:04.969> picture<00:06:05.300> you<00:06:05.419> see<00:06:05.599> the

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
once I selected the picture you see the

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.139 
once I selected the picture you see the
outline<00:06:06.050> here<00:06:06.229> I'm<00:06:06.889> going<00:06:07.189> to<00:06:07.369> format<00:06:07.939> the

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:08.149 
outline here I'm going to format the

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:10.480 
outline here I'm going to format the
picture<00:06:08.419> tools<00:06:08.629> format<00:06:08.779> and<00:06:09.409> go<00:06:10.129> under<00:06:10.369> the

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
picture tools format and go under the

picture tools format and go under the
pictures<00:06:10.849> effects<00:06:11.210> here<00:06:11.449> and<00:06:11.659> what<00:06:11.839> I'm<00:06:11.930> going

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
pictures effects here and what I'm going

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.129 
pictures effects here and what I'm going
to<00:06:12.139> do<00:06:12.289> is<00:06:12.589> I<00:06:13.129> want<00:06:13.639> to<00:06:13.669> use<00:06:13.729> the<00:06:14.389> soft<00:06:14.779> edges

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
to do is I want to use the soft edges

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.989 
to do is I want to use the soft edges
feature<00:06:15.559> and<00:06:15.949> probably<00:06:16.939> go<00:06:18.789> 25%<00:06:19.789> let's<00:06:19.909> see

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:19.999 
feature and probably go 25% let's see

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:21.850 
feature and probably go 25% let's see
fifty<00:06:20.389> percent<00:06:20.719> fifty<00:06:21.259> point<00:06:21.529> is<00:06:21.680> probably

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
fifty percent fifty point is probably

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.040 
fifty percent fifty point is probably
good<00:06:22.219> so<00:06:22.879> once<00:06:23.059> I<00:06:23.149> click<00:06:23.180> on<00:06:23.509> that<00:06:23.629> you<00:06:23.779> can<00:06:23.809> see
