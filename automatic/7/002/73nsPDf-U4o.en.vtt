00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
other and nice to believe this ok this

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.500 
other and nice to believe this ok this
is<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.840> DVD<00:04:04.230> version<00:04:05.060> which<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.180> think<00:04:06.390> this

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
is the DVD version which I think this

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.289 
is the DVD version which I think this
was<00:04:06.690> sooo<00:04:07.170> well<00:04:07.350> as<00:04:07.560> being<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.860> DVD<00:04:08.160> version

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
was sooo well as being the DVD version

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.430 
was sooo well as being the DVD version
and<00:04:09.299> then<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.840> blu-ray<00:04:10.230> version

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
and then this is the blu-ray version

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.620 
and then this is the blu-ray version
which<00:04:10.739> looks<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.070> lot<00:04:11.190> cooler<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:12.420> I'm<00:04:12.480> glad

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
which looks a lot cooler so I'm glad

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.030 
which looks a lot cooler so I'm glad
they're<00:04:12.870> getting<00:04:12.930> better<00:04:13.230> with<00:04:13.410> their<00:04:13.590> cover

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
they're getting better with their cover

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.860 
they're getting better with their cover
displacement<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.120> obviously<00:04:15.480> these<00:04:15.630> things

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
displacement and obviously these things

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.069 
displacement and obviously these things
are<00:04:15.989> double-sided<00:04:17.510> pretty<00:04:18.510> much<00:04:18.690> standard

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
are double-sided pretty much standard

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.199 
are double-sided pretty much standard
discs<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:20.400> can<00:04:20.549> see<00:04:20.669> there's<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.910> reverse

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
discs you can see there's a reverse

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.589
