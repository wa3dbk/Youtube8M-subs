 en twente kicks off in the inserted practice match against attacks by ossel 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.950
 pants 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.099
 and Pechtold Thijs Bouma is out of business this afternoon 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.559
 Monday this summer it was about 20 years old cfo van oslo pants 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.769
 and is therefore unfortunately not of the party 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.569
 beware I in this initial phase little in possession helps with the substance early alone 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.569
 the number still has the possibility this is now persie 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.840
 of them still have to come into action holes along at speed 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.010
 good pass 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.500
 that ball is just full with the signs along the first chance in the match 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 for FC Twente look in order 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 land saver 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 and so it is frequently searched for in the first 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.420
 The percussion hit that is for a shot was off it once in the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 matter 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.590
 good combination 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
 how many people on the side on the fabrics fail like a clock 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.560
 for the purpose stateless costa 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.550
 that is already quite free there the ball does not come because this is a nice opportunity 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.710
 says 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.420
 kennedy shopping 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.690
 good for a stubble be taken quickly but pay attention to every the issue 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.460
 most chances 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.300
 you pay the user 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.720
 with the signs Friday 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.790
 what you own for the promotion 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.790
 the tire is on 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 enne oirschot that ball goes but just touched the ball 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 good attack from FC Twente 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 good header and that ball just passes 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.380
 the winter weather 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.460
 and this is more cars he brings to it half an hour of play 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.590
 the lead one to 0 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.199
 the frou disturbed 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.199
 a well finished tim breakers and against 0 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.339
 nicky cooper 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.339
 in other words land land 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.829
 be sharpened 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.430
 interim switch oirschot what a fantastic time said 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.939
 beautiful coming 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.040
 they are for big lead for FC Twente 2 against normally what one 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.539
 that was a great hit 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.089
 and what happens then also expected 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:48.379
 maybe now 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.739
 so use just before rest 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.179
 look sick 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.049
 construction bv brothers 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.449
 the nice she can again for mÃ¼cke plates 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.909
 he did not get the ball completely drowsy then he still has to go 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.909
 watch out in the counter according to a source 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 that's a nice attack 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.549
 disturbed good shot year after battle 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.049
 Birds call the Twente goalkeeper gets the chance but in the 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:16.899
 switching 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:17.879
 is the 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.879
 including knee 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.119
 who had been present today also broke his metatarsal and he 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.409
 he indicated that he is probably not dry 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.589
 before Christmas 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.779
 so the sentences will not last for the first half of the competition 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.779
 in action 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.359
 the matter 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.939
 yesterday 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.929
 little soft play ball 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:45.829
 Immediate danger at the start of the second half for when we're busy 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.149
 but pay attention wisgerhof beautiful sliding was also important 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.849
 and clapping again with the game resumption 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.770
 this is why this saying is also a good rider of verandas 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.770
 because the chance was what the free davids were not like that 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.319
 but a good save from being the best remains two against one 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.349
 practically flawless pants in a dangerous place 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.500
 what against the wind 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.809
 she played a role 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:17.789
 yes and still in the rebound guts and that is also with a brilliant response 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.219
 in the second instance 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.629
 initially sits next 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.149
 what second and third instance good performance of fernandes man of many 

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.219
 opportunities for us a bridge 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.550
 the others come for the ox trousers 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.919
 club of course again 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.319
 rotating ball 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.319
 Circumstances also play a role 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.130
 and if that all remains many people penalty area so see here and again 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.569
 fantastic rescue is just fernandez 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.659
 on a shot of simons if necessary 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.939
 shortly thereafter a competition, because the vases are currently in a difficult phase 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.099
 match 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.099
 if the sale does not exist the chances that role 6 the room looks on are 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.270
 watch 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.270
 so I don't want to always come to mind 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.499
 it's dangerous 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.219
 and then put the contest pulled fc twente finds this contest against fall of if 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.190
 trousers with sweden against rhine 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.850
 Twente was very even the one rightly in the lead 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.760
 just before half-time it became 2 against, after half-time it was broken 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.749
 best odds but goalkeeper form of ds 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.639
 that fc twente on the leg twente has not succumbed
