basically what I learned from playing

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.920 
basically what I learned from playing
this<00:00:20.340> game<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.760> whole<00:00:20.970> lot<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> past<00:00:21.720> two

this game a whole lot in the past two

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.730 
this game a whole lot in the past two
days<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.880> from<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> learned<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.410> rarity

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
days so from what I learned the rarity

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
days so from what I learned the rarity
of<00:00:25.769> equipment<00:00:26.310> goes<00:00:26.490> from<00:00:26.730> uncommon<00:00:27.390> rare

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
of equipment goes from uncommon rare

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.230 
of equipment goes from uncommon rare
legendary<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> exotic<00:00:29.130> pretty<00:00:29.849> basic

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
legendary and exotic pretty basic

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
legendary and exotic pretty basic
information<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> really<00:00:31.619> didn't<00:00:31.859> notice

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
information but I really didn't notice

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.630 
information but I really didn't notice
I<00:00:32.340> thought<00:00:32.850> exotic<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.570> below<00:00:33.989> legendary<00:00:34.649> but

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
I thought exotic was below legendary but

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
I thought exotic was below legendary but

weapons from the store because most of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.270 
weapons from the store because most of

the time you'll find what you want from
drops<00:00:44.640> or<00:00:44.820> engrams<00:00:45.450> while<00:00:45.719> playing<00:00:46.079> PvE<00:00:46.520> also

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
drops or engrams while playing PvE also

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.029 
drops or engrams while playing PvE also
the<00:00:48.420> higher<00:00:48.629> level<00:00:48.960> your<00:00:49.079> cryptarch<00:00:49.500> level<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the higher level your cryptarch level is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
the higher level your cryptarch level is
the<00:00:50.430> better<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:50.969> engrams<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.570> come<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the better your engrams will come out to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
the better your engrams will come out to
be<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> rare<00:00:53.370> Engram<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.239> might

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
be so if you get a rare Engram you might

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.500 
be so if you get a rare Engram you might
even<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> legendary<00:00:55.860> weapon<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.760> but

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
even get a legendary weapon from it but

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.349 
even get a legendary weapon from it but
I'll<00:00:57.809> start<00:00:58.079> off<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.440> uncommon<00:00:58.980> uncommon<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
I'll start off with uncommon uncommon is

rare engrams on the field and if you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
rare engrams on the field and if you
have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> hot<00:01:45.509> cryptarch<00:01:45.899> level<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.500> said

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
have a hot cryptarch level like I said

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.039 
have a hot cryptarch level like I said
you<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> higher<00:01:47.790> chance<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.240> receiving

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you have a higher chance of receiving

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
you have a higher chance of receiving
rare<00:01:49.500> equipment<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> Engram<00:01:50.659> number

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
rare equipment from that Engram number

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.020 
rare equipment from that Engram number
two<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.990> play<00:01:52.350> crucible<00:01:52.799> yeah<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.759> don't<00:01:53.909> have

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
there's two known ways right now

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.559 
there's two known ways right now
no<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:14.189> can<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.579> legendary<00:02:14.969> and<00:02:15.209> ground<00:02:15.420> by

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
no you can get a legendary and ground by

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.899 
no you can get a legendary and ground by
playing<00:02:15.780> crucible<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.439> if<00:02:17.159> you're<00:02:17.310> lucky<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
have a high cryptic level you can decode

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.259 
have a high cryptic level you can decode
it<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.530> let<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.829> legendary<00:02:23.430> piece<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.819> equipment

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269

because I still think that legendary

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.250 
because I still think that legendary
piece<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.560> random<00:02:29.189> class<00:02:29.549> so<00:02:30.359> you<00:02:30.420> might<00:02:30.959> need
