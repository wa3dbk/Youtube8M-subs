video response to the previous video I
put<00:00:06.060> out<00:00:06.180> on<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.420> minecraft<00:00:06.899> Launcher<00:00:07.049> that

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
put out on the minecraft Launcher that

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.620 
put out on the minecraft Launcher that
caused<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.309> lot<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.550> confusion<00:00:08.730> as<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.420> how<00:00:09.570> to

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
caused a lot of confusion as to how to

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.259 
caused a lot of confusion as to how to
install<00:00:10.110> mods<00:00:10.440> now<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.490> video<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.030> made

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
install mods now the video that I made

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.700 
install mods now the video that I made
showed<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.780> all<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> different<00:00:13.170> features<00:00:13.679> in

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
showed you all the different features in

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.620 
showed you all the different features in
the<00:00:14.009> launcher<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.700> register<00:00:15.089> mods

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the launcher and how to register mods

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.599 
the launcher and how to register mods
with<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> launcher<00:00:16.740> itself<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.400> could

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
with the launcher itself so you could

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
with the launcher itself so you could
use<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.940> run<00:00:18.240> them<00:00:18.539> now<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> school's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
use it to run them now the school's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.960 
use it to run them now the school's
confusion<00:00:20.100> because<00:00:20.250> people<00:00:20.670> thought<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> was

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
confusion because people thought I was

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
confusion because people thought I was
showing<00:00:21.300> them<00:00:21.420> how<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> install<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
showing them how to install it and the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.650 
showing them how to install it and the
instructions<00:00:23.789> weren't<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> clearest<00:00:24.539> they

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
instructions weren't the clearest they

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.910 
instructions weren't the clearest they
could<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:24.960> been<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> thought<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
could have been so I thought that I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.009 
could have been so I thought that I
would<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> video<00:00:27.060> again<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.449> address

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
would do this video again and address

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.470 
would do this video again and address
how<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.230> both<00:00:28.560> install<00:00:29.130> mods<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.609> register

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
how to both install mods and register

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.959 
how to both install mods and register
them<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> new<00:00:31.260> launcher<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:31.830> well<00:00:32.070> so

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
them with the new launcher as well so

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
them with the new launcher as well so
what's<00:00:33.210> important<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.079> new<00:00:34.230> launcher

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
what's important about this new launcher

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.870 
what's important about this new launcher
is<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:35.550> register

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
is that you can actually register

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.150 
is that you can actually register
different<00:00:36.540> jar<00:00:36.719> files<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.649> previously

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
different jar files to it so previously

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
different jar files to it so previously
you<00:00:38.489> only<00:00:39.120> had<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.480> jar<00:00:39.780> file<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> would

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you only had one jar file and you would

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
you only had one jar file and you would
update<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.790> latest<00:00:41.879> one<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.809> would

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
update it to the latest one or you would

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.319 
update it to the latest one or you would
modify<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.770> play<00:00:43.980> mods<00:00:44.309> whereas<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
modify it to play mods whereas what you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
modify it to play mods whereas what you
can<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.289> register<00:00:46.829> different

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
can do in this one is register different

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
can do in this one is register different
jar<00:00:47.610> files<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
jar files so you can see here that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.900 
jar files so you can see here that
there's<00:00:49.710> lots<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.980> different<00:00:50.250> jar<00:00:50.430> files<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
there's lots of different jar files that

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.180 
there's lots of different jar files that
I<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.329> my<00:00:51.480> computer<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.590> linked<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I have on my computer that are linked to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
I have on my computer that are linked to
this<00:00:53.370> program<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.539> edit<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.170> default

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this program so I can edit the default

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.849 
this program so I can edit the default
profile<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.579> select<00:00:57.210> them<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> then

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
profile I can select them here and then

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.860 
profile I can select them here and then
that<00:00:59.070> means<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.579> when<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> go<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.390> click<00:01:00.600> play

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that means that when I go and click play

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.330 
that means that when I go and click play
it's<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> use<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.859> I've<00:01:02.070> selected

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it's going to use the one I've selected

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.479 
it's going to use the one I've selected
there<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.750> by<00:01:03.930> registering<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.710> new<00:01:04.739> jar<00:01:05.220> file

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
there so by registering a new jar file

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.960 
there so by registering a new jar file
to<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> program<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.780> means<00:01:07.020> when<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
to the program it means when you want to

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.160 
to the program it means when you want to
play<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.270> mods<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.020> either

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
play a different mods you can either

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
play a different mods you can either
select<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> different<00:01:10.830> profile<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.729> can

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
select a different profile or you can

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.149 
select a different profile or you can
simply<00:01:12.119> edit<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.659> default<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> select

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
simply edit the default one and select

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
simply edit the default one and select
the<00:01:14.430> different<00:01:14.580> mod<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> play

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the different mod that you want to play

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.969

which<00:01:44.970> should<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.360> dot<00:01:45.990> minecraft<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.829> then

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
which should be dot minecraft and then

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.800

when we go in here we want to go down to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
when we go in here we want to go down to
versions<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.799> when<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.130> open<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.790> folder

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
versions so when we open up this folder

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.090 
versions so when we open up this folder
you'll<00:01:51.899> see<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.530> lots<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.860> different

you'll see that I have lots of different

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
you'll see that I have lots of different
jar<00:01:53.280> files<00:01:53.579> each<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> these<00:01:54.180> represents<00:01:54.509> a

different<00:01:55.409> jar<00:01:55.740> file<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:57.360> mod<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
different jar file and the mod that I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.980 
different jar file and the mod that I
have<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.229> 1.5.2<00:01:59.420> now<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.479> might<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.930> have

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
have is for 1.5.2 now you might not have

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.819 
have is for 1.5.2 now you might not have
this<00:02:01.140> folder<00:02:01.530> because<00:02:01.619> you've<00:02:01.799> just

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
this folder because you've just

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.130 
this folder because you've just
installed<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> launcher<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.689> which<00:02:03.869> case

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
installed the launcher in which case

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.539 
installed the launcher in which case
you'll<00:02:04.290> probably<00:02:04.469> only<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.070> point<00:02:05.189> six

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
you'll probably only have one point six

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
you'll probably only have one point six
or<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:05.880> point<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.590> don't<00:02:07.649> actually

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
or one point one and I don't actually

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.559 
or one point one and I don't actually
know<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.429> way<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.970> hold<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> one

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
know of a way to get hold of the one

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.869 
know of a way to get hold of the one
point<00:02:09.720> five<00:02:10.020> point<00:02:10.229> two<00:02:10.520> unless<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.849> a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
point five point two unless you have a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.030 
point five point two unless you have a
backup<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.590> go

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
backup of it so if you go

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.789 
backup of it so if you go
into<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> 1.5.2<00:02:15.329> folder<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:16.560> want<00:02:16.709> to

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
into the 1.5.2 folder what you want to

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.160 
into the 1.5.2 folder what you want to
do<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.069> copy<00:02:17.310> both<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.819> these<00:02:17.939> files<00:02:18.209> here<00:02:18.540> so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
do is copy both of these files here so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.990 
do is copy both of these files here so
the<00:02:19.260> first<00:02:19.469> one<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.069> doc<00:02:20.250> jar<00:02:20.519> file<00:02:20.790> this

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the first one is the doc jar file this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.509 
the first one is the doc jar file this
is<00:02:21.180> basically<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.870> game<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.950> second<00:02:23.370> one

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
is basically the game and the second one

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.670 
is basically the game and the second one
is<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.299> dot<00:02:24.450> JSON<00:02:24.719> file<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.530> what

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
is the dot JSON file this is what

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.130 
is the dot JSON file this is what
registers<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.209> launcher<00:02:27.659> so<00:02:27.930> what

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
registers it to the launcher so what

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.809 
registers it to the launcher so what
we're<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.439> do<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.739> make<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> copy<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.609> both

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
we're going to do is make a copy of both

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.849 
we're going to do is make a copy of both
of<00:02:30.030> these<00:02:30.090> files<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.750> we're<00:02:31.409> going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> put<00:02:31.739> it

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
of these files and we're going to put it

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.649 
of these files and we're going to put it
in<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.220> new<00:02:32.400> folder<00:02:32.819> in<00:02:32.939> the<00:02:33.060> versions<00:02:33.450> folder

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
in a new folder in the versions folder

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.509 
in a new folder in the versions folder
so<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.409> go<00:02:34.530> down<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:35.010> bottom<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.280> you

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
so if we go down to the bottom here you

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.830 
so if we go down to the bottom here you
can<00:02:35.670> see<00:02:35.849> I've<00:02:35.939> already<00:02:36.120> created<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.629> called

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
can see I've already created one called

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440 
can see I've already created one called
Optifine<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.709> if<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.459> open<00:02:38.609> that<00:02:38.939> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.239> see

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
Optifine and if we open that you can see

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.089 
Optifine and if we open that you can see
that<00:02:39.599> I've<00:02:39.689> already<00:02:39.810> downloaded<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> mod<00:02:40.859> as

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that I've already downloaded the mod as

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.979 
that I've already downloaded the mod as
well<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.120> here<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.540> where<00:02:42.720> we're<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:42.930> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
well so in here is where we're going to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.379 
well so in here is where we're going to
paste<00:02:43.260> those<00:02:43.560> two<00:02:43.799> files<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:45.150> first

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
paste those two files and the first

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.410 
paste those two files and the first
thing<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:45.719> we<00:02:45.810> need<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.079> do<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.470> rename<00:02:46.739> them

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
thing that we need to do is rename them

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.179 
thing that we need to do is rename them
so<00:02:48.420> once<00:02:48.689> you've<00:02:48.870> renamed<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.439> file<00:02:49.739> what<00:02:50.099> you

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
so once you've renamed the file what you

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.280 
so once you've renamed the file what you
need<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.459> do<00:02:50.639> is<00:02:50.849> open<00:02:50.879> this<00:02:51.389> one<00:02:51.599> first<00:02:51.659> of<00:02:52.139> all

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
need to do is open this one first of all

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.830 
need to do is open this one first of all
in<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.980> notepad<00:02:53.189> so<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.939> one<00:02:54.150> already<00:02:54.329> open

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
in a notepad so I have one already open

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.300 
in a notepad so I have one already open
that<00:02:54.989> means<00:02:55.169> I<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.439> drag<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.680> drop<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.040> file

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
that means I can drag and drop the file

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.670 
that means I can drag and drop the file
if<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.939> can't<00:02:57.299> do<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:57.840> go<00:02:57.989> file<00:02:58.349> open

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
if you can't do that you go file open

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.369 
if you can't do that you go file open
and<00:02:59.189> navigate<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.359> same<00:03:00.569> folder<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.169> open

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
and navigate to the same folder and open

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.170 
and navigate to the same folder and open
it<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.620> way<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.609> can<00:03:02.669> see<00:03:02.909> there's<00:03:03.120> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
it that way and you can see there's a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.670 
it that way and you can see there's a
load<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.359> text<00:03:03.780> there<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.139> only<00:03:04.290> thing<00:03:04.560> that

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
load of text there the only thing that

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.530 
load of text there the only thing that
you<00:03:04.769> actually<00:03:04.889> need<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.340> change<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.299> bit

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
you actually need to change is this bit

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.159 
you actually need to change is this bit
right<00:03:06.780> here<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.829> where<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.069> says<00:03:08.299> 1.5.2<00:03:09.299> that

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
right here so where it says 1.5.2 that

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.020 
right here so where it says 1.5.2 that
would<00:03:10.290> be<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:10.560> name<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:11.010> where<00:03:11.189> we<00:03:11.340> got<00:03:11.579> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
would be the name of where we got the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.640 
would be the name of where we got the
jar<00:03:12.299> file<00:03:12.540> from<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.049> if<00:03:13.109> you<00:03:13.200> got<00:03:13.319> it<00:03:13.409> from<00:03:13.530> a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
jar file from so if you got it from a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.140 
jar file from so if you got it from a
different<00:03:13.919> folder<00:03:14.099> like<00:03:14.400> one<00:03:14.639> point<00:03:14.849> six

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
different folder like one point six

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.699 
different folder like one point six
that's<00:03:15.359> what<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.659> will<00:03:15.780> say<00:03:15.989> here<00:03:16.260> but

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
that's what it will say here but

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.949 
that's what it will say here but
basically<00:03:16.859> it's<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.459> second<00:03:17.849> thing<00:03:18.060> after<00:03:18.239> ID

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
basically it's the second thing after ID

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.020 
basically it's the second thing after ID
so<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.799> go<00:03:19.949> here<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:20.430> change<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:20.970> to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
so we go here and we change this to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.909 
so we go here and we change this to
Optifine<00:03:21.629> this<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.470> what<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:22.739> going<00:03:22.859> to

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
Optifine this is what it's going to

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.550 
Optifine this is what it's going to
appear<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.150> launcher<00:03:24.599> so<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.409> do

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
appear like in the launcher so we do

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.069 
appear like in the launcher so we do
that<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.919> press<00:03:26.220> ctrl<00:03:26.760> s<00:03:27.000> or<00:03:27.599> we<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.900> go<00:03:28.019> to

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
that we press ctrl s or we can go to

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.110 
that we press ctrl s or we can go to
file<00:03:28.470> save<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.129> then<00:03:29.250> we've<00:03:29.400> saved<00:03:29.669> that<00:03:29.909> so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
file save and then we've saved that so

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.689 
file save and then we've saved that so
we've<00:03:30.239> now<00:03:30.419> modified<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.620> file<00:03:32.040> now<00:03:32.669> the

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
we've now modified that file now the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.129 
we've now modified that file now the
second<00:03:33.150> thing<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.329> we<00:03:33.510> need<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.690> do<00:03:33.959> is

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
second thing that we need to do is

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.460 
second thing that we need to do is
install<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.680> mod<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.879> Optifine<00:03:36.359> jar<00:03:36.840> so

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
install the mod to the Optifine jar so

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.050 
install the mod to the Optifine jar so
you<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.829> do<00:03:37.949> this<00:03:38.129> with<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.340> program<00:03:38.790> called

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
you can do this with a program called

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.149 
you can do this with a program called
WinRAR<00:03:39.599> or<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.049> do<00:03:40.229> it<00:03:40.319> with<00:03:40.409> 7-zip<00:03:40.829> and

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
WinRAR or you can do it with 7-zip and

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.770 
WinRAR or you can do it with 7-zip and
if<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.849> haven't<00:03:42.090> done<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.329> before<00:03:42.389> these

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
if you haven't done this before these

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.589 
if you haven't done this before these
are<00:03:42.840> basically<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.669> zip<00:03:44.669> top<00:03:44.849> file<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.479> it's

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
are basically a zip top file so it's

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.000 
are basically a zip top file so it's
compressed<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.319> there's<00:03:46.440> other<00:03:46.680> files

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
compressed and there's other files

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.059 
compressed and there's other files
inside<00:03:47.609> this<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.169> 7-zip<00:03:49.709> insert

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
inside this one so I have 7-zip insert

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.460 
inside this one so I have 7-zip insert
installed<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.299> what<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.629> need<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.930> do<00:03:52.079> is<00:03:52.260> go<00:03:52.440> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
installed and what I need to do is go to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.039 
installed and what I need to do is go to
open<00:03:53.459> archive<00:03:53.909> so<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.419> can<00:03:54.540> see<00:03:54.720> over<00:03:55.019> here

and<00:04:27.780> now<00:04:28.200> what<00:04:28.350> we<00:04:28.470> do<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:28.650> delete<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.400> folder

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
and now what we do is delete this folder

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.340 
and now what we do is delete this folder
here<00:04:29.880> called<00:04:29.940> meta<00:04:30.330> info<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:31.050> pressing

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
here called meta info and pressing

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.140 
here called meta info and pressing
delete<00:04:31.530> on<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.860> keyboard<00:04:31.950> we're<00:04:32.940> going<00:04:33.090> to

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
delete on the keyboard we're going to

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.510 
delete on the keyboard we're going to
confirm<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.960> now<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.710> Joff<00:04:35.070> has<00:04:35.340> been

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
confirm that and now this Joff has been

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.570 
confirm that and now this Joff has been
modded<00:04:36.200> so<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.260> recap<00:04:37.740> what<00:04:37.920> we've<00:04:38.100> done<00:04:38.310> there

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
modded so to recap what we've done there

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.810 
modded so to recap what we've done there
we've<00:04:39.090> made<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> copy<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.070> 1.5.2<00:04:41.070> jar<00:04:41.550> file

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
we've made a copy of a 1.5.2 jar file

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.930 
we've made a copy of a 1.5.2 jar file
and<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:42.780> we've<00:04:43.020> copied<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.860> new<00:04:44.130> folder

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
and then we've copied it to a new folder

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.910 
and then we've copied it to a new folder
we've<00:04:45.270> renamed<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.320> same<00:04:46.530> name<00:04:46.740> as<00:04:46.890> the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
we've renamed it to the same name as the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.980 
we've renamed it to the same name as the
folder<00:04:47.250> we've<00:04:47.520> also<00:04:47.820> copied<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.300> JSON<00:04:48.720> file

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
folder we've also copied the JSON file

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.050 
folder we've also copied the JSON file
and<00:04:49.230> we've<00:04:49.740> edited<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.310> that<00:04:50.670> one<00:04:50.850> is

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
and we've edited it and that one is

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.330 
and we've edited it and that one is
going<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.300> register<00:04:51.480> this<00:04:51.930> jar<00:04:52.230> file<00:04:52.530> with<00:04:53.190> the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
going to register this jar file with the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.100 
going to register this jar file with the
launcher<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.000> then<00:04:54.120> we've<00:04:54.240> modified<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.900> jar

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
launcher and then we've modified the jar

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.260 
launcher and then we've modified the jar
file<00:04:55.380> as<00:04:55.590> well<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:56.340> now<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:56.700> one<00:04:57.060> point

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
file as well so now this is one point

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.760 
file as well so now this is one point
five<00:04:57.480> point<00:04:57.540> two<00:04:57.990> with<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.290> Optifine

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
five point two with the Optifine

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.800 
five point two with the Optifine
installed<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.490> when<00:05:00.180> we<00:05:00.300> reload<00:05:00.630> our

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
installed and when we reload our

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.970 
installed and when we reload our
launcher<00:05:01.170> we're<00:05:01.290> going<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.470> be<00:05:01.530> able<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.770> see

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
launcher we're going to be able to see

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.270 
launcher we're going to be able to see
that<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.370> load<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.090> game<00:05:03.270> with<00:05:03.450> Optifine<00:05:04.280> so

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
that and load the game with Optifine so

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.800 
that and load the game with Optifine so
now<00:05:05.430> I've<00:05:05.580> loaded<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.030> launcher<00:05:06.450> back<00:05:06.600> up

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
now I've loaded the launcher back up

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.300 
now I've loaded the launcher back up
again<00:05:07.140> what<00:05:07.410> we're<00:05:07.530> going<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.680> do<00:05:07.830> is<00:05:07.980> click<00:05:08.220> on

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310

edit profile over here on the side and

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.320 
edit profile over here on the side and
then<00:05:11.220> we're<00:05:11.400> going<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.580> select<00:05:11.820> release

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
then we're going to select release

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.900 
then we're going to select release
Optifine<00:05:13.170> we're<00:05:13.770> going<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:13.950> save<00:05:14.190> our<00:05:14.370> profile

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
Optifine we're going to save our profile

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.330 
Optifine we're going to save our profile
and<00:05:15.150> now<00:05:15.750> when<00:05:15.930> we<00:05:15.960> click<00:05:16.110> play<00:05:16.350> we're<00:05:17.220> going

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
and now when we click play we're going

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.800 
and now when we click play we're going
to<00:05:17.400> be<00:05:17.490> launching<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:18.030> game<00:05:18.180> with<00:05:18.360> Optifine

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
to be launching the game with Optifine

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.900 
to be launching the game with Optifine
mod<00:05:18.840> installed<00:05:19.200> so<00:05:20.190> what<00:05:20.370> we've<00:05:20.490> done<00:05:20.670> there

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
mod installed so what we've done there

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.960 
mod installed so what we've done there
again<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.540> we've<00:05:21.720> registered<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:23.130> mods<00:05:23.580> to

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
again is we've registered the mods to

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.880 
again is we've registered the mods to
our<00:05:24.240> list<00:05:24.540> of<00:05:24.780> different<00:05:25.080> jar<00:05:25.290> files<00:05:25.590> here<00:05:25.860> and

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
our list of different jar files here and

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.740 
our list of different jar files here and
this<00:05:26.310> is<00:05:26.400> good<00:05:26.580> because<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:27.000> means<00:05:27.150> we<00:05:27.720> can

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
this is good because it means we can

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.360 
this is good because it means we can
keep<00:05:27.990> our<00:05:28.170> different<00:05:28.470> mods<00:05:28.650> separate<00:05:29.160> from

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
keep our different mods separate from

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.130 
keep our different mods separate from
one<00:05:29.520> another<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:30.060> then<00:05:30.540> we<00:05:30.660> don't<00:05:30.780> have<00:05:31.020> to

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
one another and then we don't have to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.810 
one another and then we don't have to
swap<00:05:31.410> jar<00:05:31.680> files<00:05:31.950> it<00:05:32.160> can<00:05:32.190> all<00:05:32.370> be<00:05:32.460> done<00:05:32.580> by<00:05:32.640> the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
swap jar files it can all be done by the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.640 
swap jar files it can all be done by the
program<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.540> of<00:05:33.930> course<00:05:34.140> you<00:05:34.290> can<00:05:34.440> also

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
program and of course you can also

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.190 
program and of course you can also
create<00:05:35.070> profiles<00:05:35.730> like<00:05:36.510> for<00:05:36.690> example<00:05:37.110> we

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
create profiles like for example we

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.800 
create profiles like for example we
could<00:05:37.410> create<00:05:37.590> up<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:38.010> fly<00:05:38.220> in<00:05:38.280> here<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:38.880> we

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
could create up to fly in here and we

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.200 
could create up to fly in here and we
could<00:05:39.930> tell<00:05:40.110> it<00:05:40.230> to<00:05:40.350> use<00:05:40.560> Optifine<00:05:41.340> there<00:05:41.730> and

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
could tell it to use Optifine there and

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.790 
could tell it to use Optifine there and
we<00:05:42.330> could<00:05:42.480> save<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.870> profile<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:43.650> means

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
we could save that profile and it means

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.500 
we could save that profile and it means
that<00:05:43.950> when<00:05:44.160> we<00:05:44.280> select<00:05:44.430> Optifine<00:05:45.060> over<00:05:45.330> here

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
that when we select Optifine over here

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.420 
that when we select Optifine over here
then<00:05:46.260> it's<00:05:46.440> automatically<00:05:47.010> going<00:05:47.250> to<00:05:47.310> be

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
then it's automatically going to be

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.159 
then it's automatically going to be
using<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.910> mod<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.090> we've<00:05:48.390> registered<00:05:48.570> and

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
using the mod that we've registered and

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.980 
using the mod that we've registered and
it's<00:05:49.320> still<00:05:49.610> so<00:05:50.610> my<00:05:50.850> recording<00:05:51.300> software<00:05:51.510> cut

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
it's still so my recording software cut

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.900 
it's still so my recording software cut
me<00:05:52.140> out<00:05:52.169> there<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:52.800> literally<00:05:53.400> finished<00:05:53.610> my

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
me out there I literally finished my

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.370 
me out there I literally finished my
sentence<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.419> was<00:05:54.510> just<00:05:54.690> going<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:54.930> say<00:05:55.110> that

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
sentence I was just going to say that

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.170 
sentence I was just going to say that
we're<00:05:55.919> selecting<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.520> mod<00:05:56.669> that<00:05:56.850> we've<00:05:56.970> just

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
we're selecting the mod that we've just

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.370 
we're selecting the mod that we've just
registered<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.840> installed<00:05:58.230> with<00:05:58.350> the
