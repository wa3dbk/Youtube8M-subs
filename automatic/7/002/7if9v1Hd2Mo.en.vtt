making artisan pipes you often find

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.990 
making artisan pipes you often find
personality<00:04:37.270> clashes<00:04:37.479> and<00:04:37.780> everything<00:04:38.169> um<00:04:39.000> so

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
personality clashes and everything um so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.210 
personality clashes and everything um so
what<00:04:40.210> we<00:04:40.330> do<00:04:40.539> is<00:04:43.530> one<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.650> us<00:04:44.770> will<00:04:44.919> start<00:04:45.160> a

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
what we do is one of us will start a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.830 
what we do is one of us will start a
pipe<00:04:47.520> say<00:04:48.520> for<00:04:48.700> instance<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:49.150> start<00:04:49.630> on<00:04:49.750> the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
pipe say for instance I start on the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.070 
pipe say for instance I start on the
shaping<00:04:50.080> wheel<00:04:51.240> I'll<00:04:52.240> get<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:52.600> rough<00:04:52.780> shaped

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
shaping wheel I'll get it rough shaped

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.469 
shaping wheel I'll get it rough shaped
I'll<00:04:53.320> show<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.919> John<00:04:54.160> John<00:04:54.789> will<00:04:55.000> say<00:04:55.180> I

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
I'll show it to John John will say I

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.790 
I'll show it to John John will say I
really<00:04:56.260> like<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:57.870> really<00:04:58.870> like<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.260> or<00:04:59.410> I

don't like that I wish it was more like
this<00:05:01.990> I'll<00:05:02.680> make<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.220> appropriate<00:05:03.490> changes

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
this I'll make the appropriate changes

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.370 
this I'll make the appropriate changes
we<00:05:04.660> can<00:05:04.840> move<00:05:04.960> forward<00:05:04.990> will<00:05:05.500> drill<00:05:05.740> it<00:05:07.380> John

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
we can move forward will drill it John

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.080 
we can move forward will drill it John
will<00:05:08.560> comment<00:05:08.800> again<00:05:09.070> on<00:05:09.460> what<00:05:09.729> kind<00:05:10.000> of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
will comment again on what kind of

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.909 
will comment again on what kind of
accents<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.840> use<00:05:11.050> or<00:05:11.260> what<00:05:11.380> kind<00:05:11.530> of<00:05:11.590> stem

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
accents to use or what kind of stem

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.760 
accents to use or what kind of stem
length<00:05:12.600> or<00:05:13.600> I'll<00:05:13.750> say<00:05:13.990> here<00:05:14.229> I'll<00:05:14.380> take<00:05:14.560> this

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
length or I'll say here I'll take this

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.529 
length or I'll say here I'll take this
and<00:05:15.070> I'm<00:05:15.160> thinking<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.700> using<00:05:15.850> this<00:05:16.090> or<00:05:16.360> I'll

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
and I'm thinking of using this or I'll

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.270 
and I'm thinking of using this or I'll
hand<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:16.960> over<00:05:17.970> I'm<00:05:18.970> very<00:05:19.030> liquid<00:05:19.630> very

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
hand it over I'm very liquid very

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.060 
hand it over I'm very liquid very
flexible<00:05:21.280> we<00:05:21.520> kind<00:05:21.850> of<00:05:22.470> toss<00:05:23.470> things<00:05:23.680> back<00:05:23.950> and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
flexible we kind of toss things back and

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.590 
flexible we kind of toss things back and
forth<00:05:24.190> but<00:05:24.460> we<00:05:24.580> collaborate<00:05:25.060> on<00:05:25.210> pretty<00:05:25.479> much

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
forth but we collaborate on pretty much

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.659 
forth but we collaborate on pretty much
every<00:05:26.020> process<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.740> pipe<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.130> we<00:05:27.310> inspect

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
every process of a pipe and we inspect

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.730 
every process of a pipe and we inspect
every<00:05:27.910> pipe<00:05:28.120> each<00:05:28.600> part<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.080> pipe<00:05:29.320> has<00:05:29.710> a

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
every pipe each part of the pipe has a

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.900 
every pipe each part of the pipe has a
discussion<00:05:30.280> formed<00:05:31.120> around<00:05:31.210> it

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
discussion formed around it

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.330 
discussion formed around it
so<00:05:32.390> from<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.930> shaping<00:05:33.170> to<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.620> accent<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.220> the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
so from the shaping to the accent to the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.860 
so from the shaping to the accent to the
stem<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.820> button<00:05:38.150> work<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.750> the

engineering<00:05:39.320> every<00:05:39.740> part<00:05:39.980> of<00:05:40.040> it<00:05:40.160> has<00:05:40.220> a

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
engineering every part of it has a

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.360 
engineering every part of it has a
critical<00:05:40.910> discussion<00:05:41.660> I<00:05:42.650> don't<00:05:42.980> like<00:05:43.040> this

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
critical discussion I don't like this

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.940 
critical discussion I don't like this
this<00:05:43.760> should<00:05:43.940> be<00:05:44.060> better<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.510> so<00:05:45.080> there's<00:05:45.860> a

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
this should be better and so there's a

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.180 
this should be better and so there's a
veto<00:05:46.370> if<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.690> don't<00:05:47.930> like<00:05:48.080> something<00:05:48.380> John<00:05:48.890> has

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
veto if I don't like something John has

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.860 
veto if I don't like something John has
to<00:05:49.400> change<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:49.760> or<00:05:49.970> it<00:05:50.090> can't<00:05:50.300> be<00:05:50.450> sold<00:05:50.660> and

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
to change it or it can't be sold and

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.520 
to change it or it can't be sold and
vice<00:05:51.380> versa<00:05:51.890> know<00:05:52.640> if<00:05:53.510> it's<00:05:53.840> something<00:05:54.020> I'm

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
vice versa know if it's something I'm

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.280 
vice versa know if it's something I'm
doing<00:05:54.770> he<00:05:55.520> has<00:05:55.700> he<00:05:56.090> has<00:05:56.120> veto<00:05:56.570> power<00:05:56.600> to<00:05:57.110> say

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
doing he has he has veto power to say

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.750 
doing he has he has veto power to say
you<00:05:57.590> need<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.830> change<00:05:57.980> that<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:58.400> if<00:05:58.580> he's

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
you need to change that and if he's

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.480 
you need to change that and if he's
doing<00:05:58.940> something<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.600> a<00:05:59.630> veto<00:06:00.080> power<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.590> the

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
doing something I a veto power and the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.160 
doing something I a veto power and the
whole<00:06:01.670> point<00:06:01.880> is<00:06:02.120> that<00:06:02.150> there's<00:06:02.630> a<00:06:02.690> reason

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
whole point is that there's a reason

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.290 
whole point is that there's a reason
that<00:06:03.320> there<00:06:03.560> are<00:06:03.620> 2<00:06:03.770> j's<00:06:04.040> on<00:06:04.370> every<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:05.180> our

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
that there are 2 j's on every of our

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.120 
that there are 2 j's on every of our
pipes<00:06:05.950> so<00:06:06.950> it<00:06:07.250> is<00:06:07.460> a<00:06:07.790> J<00:06:08.240> and<00:06:08.510> J<00:06:08.900> pipe<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.710> if<00:06:10.010> you

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
pipes so it is a J and J pipe and if you

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.610 
pipes so it is a J and J pipe and if you
have<00:06:10.280> any<00:06:10.610> questions<00:06:11.480> about<00:06:11.720> any<00:06:12.440> particular

questions comments like I said no I

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.240 
questions comments like I said no I
think<00:06:24.170> that<00:06:24.290> pretty<00:06:24.440> much<00:06:24.560> concludes<00:06:24.830> if<00:06:25.160> we

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
think that pretty much concludes if we

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.900 
think that pretty much concludes if we
don't<00:06:25.370> want<00:06:25.490> to<00:06:25.550> bore<00:06:25.670> you<00:06:25.700> guys<00:06:25.790> forever<00:06:26.150> so

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
don't want to bore you guys forever so

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.220 
don't want to bore you guys forever so
