Martin<00:00:05.250> Racing<00:00:05.490> performance<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.870> most

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
Martin Racing performance the most

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:28.160 
Martin Racing performance the most
advanced<00:00:07.590> parts<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.760> planet<00:00:09.180> oh<00:00:09.590> yeah

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.290 

you

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.940 

we're<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> install<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
we're about to install this see the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.460 
we're about to install this see the
angle<00:00:38.460> connection<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> different<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
angle connection is different this is

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.810 
angle connection is different this is
going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.220> TJ<00:00:41.930> 250<00:00:42.930> Powersports<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
going to be on a TJ 250 Powersports and

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.730 
going to be on a TJ 250 Powersports and
the<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.030> actually<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.900> bracket<00:00:46.290> is<00:00:46.440> already

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
the is actually the bracket is already

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.850 
the is actually the bracket is already
installed<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.490> the<00:00:47.520> exhaust<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.140> proceed

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
installed in the exhaust so we proceed

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.360 
installed in the exhaust so we proceed
to<00:00:50.100> install<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.610> performance<00:00:51.210> pipe<00:00:52.370> samples

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
to install the performance pipe samples

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:23.850 
to install the performance pipe samples
us<00:00:54.000> this<00:01:01.760> few<00:01:02.760> nuts<00:01:03.090> goes<00:01:03.630> on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> bracket

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:58.230 

we<00:01:24.670> want<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.090> style<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.540> other<00:01:25.570> two

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.420 

and<00:01:58.570> that's<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.380> got<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.860> performance

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
and that's it I got the performance

00:02:00.430 --> 00:03:06.920 
and that's it I got the performance
racing<00:02:00.790> exhaust<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.440> TJ<00:02:03.000> 250

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.690 

Martin<00:03:07.930> Racing<00:03:08.170> performance<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.550> most

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
Martin Racing performance the most

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.300 
Martin Racing performance the most
advanced<00:03:10.270> parts<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.440> planet<00:03:11.830> oh<00:03:12.300> yeah
