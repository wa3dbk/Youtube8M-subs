Sparky<00:02:34.450> fix<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.870> antenna<00:02:35.190> well<00:02:36.190> does<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.400> good

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
Sparky fix the antenna well does a good

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.789 
Sparky fix the antenna well does a good
reason<00:02:36.880> for<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.060> it's<00:02:37.840> because<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.380> antenna

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
reason for that it's because the antenna

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.300 
reason for that it's because the antenna
is<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.370> freaking<00:02:39.910> vacuum<00:02:41.160> Sparky's<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
is in the freaking vacuum Sparky's the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.759 
is in the freaking vacuum Sparky's the
only<00:02:42.489> one<00:02:42.669> that<00:02:42.819> has<00:02:42.970> little<00:02:43.329> jisu<00:02:43.900> if<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.560> went

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
only one that has little jisu if I went

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.830 
only one that has little jisu if I went
out<00:02:44.859> there<00:02:44.889> I<00:02:45.099> blow<00:02:45.370> up<00:02:45.579> well<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.239> guess<00:02:46.630> that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
out there I blow up well I guess that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.659 
out there I blow up well I guess that
makes<00:02:47.019> sense<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:47.680> why<00:02:47.919> won't<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.280> help<00:02:48.310> him

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
makes sense but why won't you help him

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.500 
makes sense but why won't you help him
