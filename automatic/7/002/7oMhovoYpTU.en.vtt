00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.180
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to give 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.050
 use to an old shoe you have to 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:22.220
 to recycle the shoes is not to vote them 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:25.660
 this shoe is mine was purple 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.470
 let's say 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.180
 some call 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.950
 good was cloth 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.650
 the shoe was already in the garbage 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.860
 practically I do not want to get rid of 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.650
 that shoe because it's easy to put on 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.990
 quickly put and you can find it 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.470
 you can not forgive me because you can 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.750
 put you can take off is not easy to 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.550
 I do not vote what I did, it's not 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 recycled to create a second 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.200
 with this material 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.520
 This is a corrosive world material 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.930
 the use of the body uses this glue 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.750
 super blue 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.750
 and this rubber that is liquid silicone 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.980
 also visited 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.990
 this cutter and a scissor 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.720
 The first thing I did is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.260
 I have grasped silicone I have put enough 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.450
 silicone everywhere down here 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.680
 once you have put enough silicone 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.670
 there 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.310
 I have grabbed this 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.320
 this material corresponds those 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.840
 meetings in any bookstore is very 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.110
 easy to get and the good thing is that it is 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.800
 economic 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.690
 I go for you strong bet you until 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.400
 you are going to leave a line for 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:58.260
 the silhouette of the shoe was all detached 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.260
 in everything here and outside of my nails 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.610
 I also put it silicone for this 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.610
 place 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.260
 and I put it 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.630
 strong once you have finished 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.930
 put silicone all here and paste the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.219
 shoe will fit me like this 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.219
 which is not true 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.260
 grabbed a coarse scissor is stuck to the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.210
 Subway warranty for the medium up 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.340
 get here 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.160
 and you already have to realize that 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 this is already stuck once it ends 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.410
 to do that I put glue on this guy 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.240
 of glue is stronger inside 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.230
 how am I going to stick it I put the glue 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.220
 here 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.739
 and he turned it to cospedal you press and 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.920
 scholtÃ¨s and rapids something paste equal to 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.510
 glue pressure carlos well 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.549
 speed of all because this is rap and it 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.440
 dry but you have to be very careful 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.880
 with 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.750
 our eyes that you have also triumphed 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.430
 because stronger and sometimes you're 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.000
 watering once finished sticking 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.189
 here you will be left with an opening what 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.370
 fourth you have to cut the surplus 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.940
 the spare parts 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.690
 and stick to this like this 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.290
 and this here is going to be like a virtue 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.900
 finished that little procedure to 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.960
 little you grab a strip in the form of 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 rectangular and you can top it with this 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.520
 glue equally what as is already 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.160
 plastic and stick it here halo in addition 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.870
 After that I was not aware 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.080
 cut the premises but I was going back to 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080
 paste 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.190
 in this place as we are going to pull hard 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.380
 strong will always be a small 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.260
 like in your tip shoes will not be 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.180
 is going to be one on another what is going 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.530
 to do is join this point with this 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.790
 lace is going to stay 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.540
 you hold the same 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.540
 and it is a part 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.680
 calculating faults 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.590
 it deforms him so that it covers him 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.419
 and that's what I did with your shoes 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 simple shoes did not have a I'm
