00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.999
 I greet you dear viewers with you 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.130
 bridge in plus today i would like 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.499
 tell you about two dvrs 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.239
 from the black girl company 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.989
 I was given guys and sex help 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.329
 dot ru 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.249
 Well, let's start with the older 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.210
 model which is called blessing in the form of 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:36.850
 r500 live and hd or just black view 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.530
 with this console because there is not 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.660
 simply because the whole point is that this 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.760
 the device is equipped with built-in wifi 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.740
 the module ships the same device in 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.870
 very small black boxes inside 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.600
 which besides the registrar you 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.060
 find instructions in Russian 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.250
 car cigarette lighter mains cable 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.970
 small card reader 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.900
 micro sd this micro sd card itself 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.659
 already 16 gigabytes of fasteners for 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.989
 power wires and spare velcro on 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.989
 glass 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.030
 either the device is powered by battery 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.039
 either from the cigarette lighter in the car like you 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.680
 see the picture more than decent 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.990
 Perhaps it is worth noting that many 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.880
 may confuse the lack of a screen due to 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.829
 what for example turning the camera wrong 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.929
 you can see something like that however 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.090
 lack of a screen after all though 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.429
 is a kind of minus its advantages 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.429
 this also has an effect on 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.229
 whole and it's only 114 grams so on 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.329
 dimensions registrar that too 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.090
 It is important given that this thing will be 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.920
 hang on your windshield no matter how 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.200
 cool she shouldn't distract you from 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.509
 roads with their bulky dimensions 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.349
 in addition to all the above 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.289
 the recorder has a motion sensor 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:52.270
 built-in gps microphone and can also 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.580
 record time date and speed 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.950
 movements that up to the camera then it is here for 2 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.990
 megapixel has a very decent angle 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.259
 review is one hundred fifty six degrees 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.920
 123 diagonal in width and 90 in 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.959
 height 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.500
 now it's time to talk about 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.459
 younger model namely blackvue 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.829
 dr400g hd 2 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.989
 In this already slightly more weighty white 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.660
 box you will find of course yourself 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.519
 video recorder micro sd memory card 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.519
 the same volume as in the first case 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.500
 I recall this is 16 gigabytes by itself 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.579
 instruction in Russian all kinds 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.380
 cables and adapters 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.079
 and exactly the same fasteners for the wire 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.090
 Power supply is an important difference 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.980
 This model is the presence of these 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.709
 here are two cables this video 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.480
 in een video out by which very 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.069
 problem of absence is easily solved 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.139
 device screen 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.280
 so for example with the help of these two babes 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.290
 you can connect to your 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.900
 to the external registrar 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.859
 monitor and see everything he writes in 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.780
 real time 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.359
 Speaking of flash drives, I can say that here 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.569
 just like in a fairy tale micro sd card we 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:58.420
 stick a special adapter into it 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.950
 stick in the card reader and all this stuff we 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.910
 We stick in the computer well, really 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.739
 a duck in the egg and the egg in the hollow of what 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.750
 to the technical characteristics here 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.630
 serious difference visible except in weight 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.359
 The devices in this case are only 76 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.489
 gram versus 114 in the first case and the most 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.769
 cameras camera younger models though 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.440
 have the same 2 megapixels and all 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.260
 the same full hd at before 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.620
 these frames per second but inferior in the corners 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.850
 The review here is 120 degrees diagonal 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.560
 98 in width and 55 in height 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.930
 the device is nicely highlighted in 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.570
 work time and has a special big 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.790
 button so-called porkovka mode 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.700
 parking mode is automatically activated 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.740
 if your vehicle is standing on 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.470
 place a few minutes but optional 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:54.840
 with just one touch you can turn it on 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:57.120
 manually in the afternoon did not begin to remove their word 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.400
 so how if nighttime these 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.860
 two kids on the shoulder then i think that 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.440
 brightly lit daytime street they also 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.240
 reproduce without difficulty well and with 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.920
 you was Yuri in blood thanks for that 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.350
