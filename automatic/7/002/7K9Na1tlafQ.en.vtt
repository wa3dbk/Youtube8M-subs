00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
the tractor so you can see over it quite

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.330 
the tractor so you can see over it quite
easily<00:02:15.599> with<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.840> bucket<00:02:17.260> system<00:02:17.500> obviously

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340

easily with the bucket system obviously
you<00:02:18.520> can<00:02:18.700> certainly<00:02:19.090> raise<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.050> with

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
you can certainly raise it up with

still<00:02:24.640> experimenting<00:02:25.360> with<00:02:25.599> it<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:25.989> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
still experimenting with it but the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.190 
still experimenting with it but the
tractor<00:02:26.860> here<00:02:27.040> ran<00:02:27.220> great<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.019> fact

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
tractor here ran great I like the fact

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.350 
tractor here ran great I like the fact
that<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.680> particular<00:02:33.280> unit<00:02:33.670> does<00:02:34.330> have

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
that this particular unit does have

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.750 
that this particular unit does have
joystick<00:02:35.230> controls<00:02:35.739> that's<00:02:36.190> one<00:02:36.340> thing<00:02:36.550> John

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
joystick controls that's one thing John

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
joystick controls that's one thing John
Deere<00:02:36.970> did<00:02:37.120> really<00:02:37.330> well<00:02:37.569> with<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.959> 5055<00:02:38.560> u

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
Deere did really well with the 5055 u

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.300 
Deere did really well with the 5055 u
tractors<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:40.239> got<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> nice<00:02:41.620> hydraulic

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
tractors it's got a nice hydraulic

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.000 
tractors it's got a nice hydraulic
joystick<00:02:43.120> which<00:02:44.110> allows<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.709> pretty<00:02:44.890> much

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
joystick which allows you to pretty much

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.620 
joystick which allows you to pretty much
operate<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.610> blade<00:02:45.819> easily<00:02:46.480> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
operate the blade easily and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
operate the blade easily and
effortlessly<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:47.290> like<00:02:47.590> that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.890 

this<00:02:53.950> tractor<00:02:54.250> remember<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.849> not<00:02:55.000> hydrostatic

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
this tractor remember is not hydrostatic

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720 
this tractor remember is not hydrostatic
so<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.530> kind<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.799> shift<00:02:57.340> gears

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
so you have to kind of shift gears

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.020 
so you have to kind of shift gears
between<00:02:58.090> forward<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.660> reverse<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.730> takes

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
between forward and reverse so it takes

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.250 
between forward and reverse so it takes
me<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.239> little<00:03:01.450> bit<00:03:01.569> of<00:03:01.660> time<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:02.019> as<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.230> can

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
me a little bit of time there as you can

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.440 
me a little bit of time there as you can
see<00:03:02.380> them<00:03:02.739> not<00:03:03.280> quite<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.640> smoothest<00:03:04.090> at<00:03:04.299> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
see them not quite the smoothest at it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.839 
see them not quite the smoothest at it
but<00:03:04.660> I'll<00:03:05.170> certainly<00:03:05.410> get<00:03:05.739> better<00:03:05.950> at<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.340> the

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
but I'll certainly get better at it the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.670 
but I'll certainly get better at it the
snow<00:03:07.150> here<00:03:07.450> started<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> come<00:03:08.080> back<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.470> blow

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
snow here started to come back and blow

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.699 
snow here started to come back and blow
that<00:03:08.950> night<00:03:09.220> again<00:03:10.470> unfortunately<00:03:11.470> it

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
that night again unfortunately it

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.490 
that night again unfortunately it
started<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.430> pick<00:03:12.579> up<00:03:12.670> wind<00:03:12.970> wise<00:03:13.150> too<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.810> we

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
started to pick up wind wise too so we

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.650 
started to pick up wind wise too so we
managed<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.829> clear<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.340> out<00:03:15.489> but<00:03:16.209> only<00:03:16.329> for<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
managed to clear it out but only for the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.390 
managed to clear it out but only for the
time<00:03:16.840> being<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.380> snow<00:03:17.590> started<00:03:17.920> coming<00:03:18.250> back

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
time being the snow started coming back

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.890 
time being the snow started coming back
so<00:03:18.670> decided<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> tackle<00:03:19.269> again<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.840> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
so decided to tackle again in the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.300 
so decided to tackle again in the
morning

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.520 

here<00:03:30.310> we<00:03:30.459> are<00:03:30.489> again<00:03:30.819> in<00:03:30.939> the<00:03:30.970> morning<00:03:31.530> pretty

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
out again tractor system has started up

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.720 
out again tractor system has started up
without<00:03:38.110> being<00:03:38.379> in<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.560> barn<00:03:38.860> or<00:03:39.040> anything<00:03:39.310> from

without being in a barn or anything from
sitting<00:03:40.060> outside<00:03:40.209> which<00:03:40.689> is<00:03:40.720> great<00:03:42.180> now<00:03:43.180> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
sitting outside which is great now the

ground<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> little<00:03:43.989> bit<00:03:44.079> more<00:03:44.200> frozen<00:03:44.500> from

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
ground is a little bit more frozen from

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.530 
ground is a little bit more frozen from
where<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.129> plowed<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.549> night<00:03:45.700> before<00:03:45.879> so<00:03:46.359> made

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
where we plowed the night before so made

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.890 
where we plowed the night before so made
a<00:03:46.569> little<00:03:46.780> easier<00:03:47.170> as<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.099> can<00:03:48.310> see

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
a little easier as you can see

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.759 
a little easier as you can see
unfortunately<00:03:49.900> some<00:03:50.109> of<00:03:50.230> trackway<00:03:50.560> is

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
unfortunately some of trackway is

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.030 
unfortunately some of trackway is
completely<00:03:51.700> shut<00:03:51.970> itself<00:03:52.239> back<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.780> but<00:03:53.500> not<00:03:54.010> a

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
completely shut itself back in but not a

completely shut itself back in but not a
problem<00:03:54.430> for<00:03:54.579> this<00:03:54.670> big<00:03:54.939> rig<00:03:55.180> again<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:56.470> put

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
problem for this big rig again we put

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.250 
problem for this big rig again we put
that<00:03:56.829> boss<00:03:57.099> blade<00:03:57.489> down<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.150> put<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.109> in<00:03:59.200> about

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
that boss blade down and put it in about

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.050 
that boss blade down and put it in about
second<00:03:59.859> gear<00:04:00.069> and<00:04:00.099> just<00:04:00.459> took<00:04:00.579> our<00:04:00.760> time<00:04:01.000> and

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
second gear and just took our time and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
went right down the road here kind of

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.589 
went right down the road here kind of
had<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.359> reopen<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.959> whole<00:04:05.139> thing<00:04:05.379> back<00:04:05.620> up

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
had to reopen the whole thing back up

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
this tractor was going to need chains to

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.640 
this tractor was going to need chains to
be<00:04:27.280> able<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.460> push<00:04:27.729> with<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.330> heavy

plow in the front of it the plow weighs

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.900 
plow in the front of it the plow weighs
about<00:04:31.120> 800<00:04:31.900> pounds<00:04:32.050> by<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.470> way<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.699> again

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
about 800 pounds by the way and again

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.969 
about 800 pounds by the way and again
there's<00:04:34.300> no<00:04:34.449> there's<00:04:35.199> no<00:04:35.260> ballast<00:04:35.740> in<00:04:35.889> the

there's no there's no ballast in the

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.250 
there's no there's no ballast in the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
back of this tractor or so I wasn't sure

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.540 
back of this tractor or so I wasn't sure
if<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.440> was<00:04:38.530> going<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.740> be<00:04:38.830> able<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:39.010> do<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.250> but

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
if it was going to be able to do it but

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.060 
if it was going to be able to do it but
as<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.060> can<00:04:40.150> see<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.510> did<00:04:40.720> it<00:04:40.870> really<00:04:41.289> nicely<00:04:41.620> I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
as you can see it did it really nicely I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.899 
as you can see it did it really nicely I
had<00:04:42.930> literally<00:04:43.930> an<00:04:44.139> effort<00:04:45.039> effortless<00:04:45.639> time

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
had literally an effort effortless time

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.779 
had literally an effort effortless time
just<00:04:46.270> driving<00:04:46.720> it<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.919> was<00:04:48.010> pretty<00:04:48.190> smooth<00:04:48.520> it

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
just driving it it was pretty smooth it

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.689 
just driving it it was pretty smooth it
has<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:49.210> float<00:04:50.080> system<00:04:50.349> in<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.830> hydraulically

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
has the float system in it hydraulically

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.969 
has the float system in it hydraulically
so<00:04:52.090> basically<00:04:52.599> it<00:04:52.870> can<00:04:53.080> take<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.380> contours<00:04:53.949> of

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
so basically it can take the contours of

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.950 
so basically it can take the contours of
the<00:04:54.130> driveway<00:04:54.430> here<00:04:54.820> as<00:04:54.909> it<00:04:55.060> rocks<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:55.720> rolls

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
the driveway here as it rocks and rolls

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.800 
the driveway here as it rocks and rolls
up<00:04:56.229> up<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.130> down<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:58.150> last<00:04:58.449> part<00:04:58.750> the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
up up and down and this last part the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.480 
up up and down and this last part the
driveway<00:04:59.199> where<00:04:59.349> it<00:04:59.409> goes<00:04:59.560> up<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.860> about<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.039> 3%

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
driveway where it goes up to about a 3%

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.080 
driveway where it goes up to about a 3%
Hill<00:05:00.909> Climb<00:05:01.210> there<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:03.070> was<00:05:03.250> just<00:05:03.460> no<00:05:03.729> big<00:05:03.880> deal

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
Hill Climb there it was just no big deal

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.719 
Hill Climb there it was just no big deal
it<00:05:04.240> just<00:05:04.419> went<00:05:04.570> right<00:05:04.630> up<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:05.400> can't<00:05:06.400> speak

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
it just went right up it can't speak

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.300 
it just went right up it can't speak
highly<00:05:06.940> enough<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.659> plow<00:05:08.199> boss<00:05:08.530> system<00:05:09.099> there

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
highly enough the plow boss system there

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.670 
highly enough the plow boss system there
I<00:05:09.340> really<00:05:09.820> like<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.449> really<00:05:11.110> like<00:05:11.320> how<00:05:11.560> it

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
I really like I really like how it

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.219 
I really like I really like how it
operates<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.400> like<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.210> fact<00:05:13.419> that<00:05:13.659> it's<00:05:13.870> a<00:05:14.080> got

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
operates I like the fact that it's a got

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.379 
operates I like the fact that it's a got
a<00:05:14.260> universal<00:05:14.889> skid<00:05:15.130> steer<00:05:15.400> attachment<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.240> it

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
a universal skid steer attachment and it

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.360 
a universal skid steer attachment and it
just<00:05:16.630> instantly<00:05:16.960> attaches<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:17.949> front<00:05:18.190> end

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
just instantly attaches to the front end

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.550 
just instantly attaches to the front end
of<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.580> loader<00:05:19.240> like<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:19.750> five<00:05:20.050> five<00:05:20.320> three

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
of a loader like the five five three

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.089 
of a loader like the five five three
here<00:05:20.889> on<00:05:21.010> this<00:05:21.190> 50<00:05:21.880> 55<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.539> John<00:05:22.780> Deere<00:05:22.990> we<00:05:23.949> get

here on this 50 55 you John Deere we get
up<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.370> top<00:05:24.610> here<00:05:24.849> I'll<00:05:25.000> show<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.270> at

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
up to the top here I'll show you at

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:26.760 
up to the top here I'll show you at
least<00:05:25.449> some<00:05:25.720> of<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:25.930> range<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.289> motion<00:05:26.620> that<00:05:26.740> I

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
least some of the range of motion that I

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:35.830 
least some of the range of motion that I
have<00:05:27.039> with<00:05:27.280> it

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.409 

basically<00:05:36.740> one<00:05:37.010> hand<00:05:37.310> I<00:05:37.460> can<00:05:37.610> very<00:05:37.820> easily<00:05:38.030> do

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
basically one hand I can very easily do

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.129 
basically one hand I can very easily do
left<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.990> right<00:05:39.169> which<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:40.280> kind<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.550> nice<00:05:41.139> and

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
left and right which is kind of nice and

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.900 
left and right which is kind of nice and
I<00:05:42.260> can<00:05:42.410> also<00:05:42.530> do<00:05:42.830> obviously<00:05:43.280> up<00:05:43.460> and<00:05:43.700> down<00:05:43.880> I

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
I can also do obviously up and down I

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.150 
I can also do obviously up and down I
know<00:05:44.270> it's<00:05:44.419> hard<00:05:44.600> to<00:05:44.660> show<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:44.900> that<00:05:45.290> but

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
know it's hard to show you that but

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.100 
know it's hard to show you that but
tipping<00:05:46.730> it<00:05:46.850> also<00:05:47.030> can<00:05:47.419> do<00:05:47.570> so<00:05:47.780> can<00:05:47.930> tip

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
tipping it also can do so can tip

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.990 
tipping it also can do so can tip
forward<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.740> backwards<00:05:49.250> so<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:49.490> can<00:05:49.639> set<00:05:49.820> the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
forward and backwards so you can set the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.180 
forward and backwards so you can set the
angle<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.300> tip<00:05:50.540> I<00:05:50.840> don't<00:05:51.500> know<00:05:51.710> about<00:05:51.770> even

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
angle a tip I don't know about even

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.590 
angle a tip I don't know about even
getting<00:05:52.430> off<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.700> tractor<00:05:52.970> that's<00:05:53.240> quite
