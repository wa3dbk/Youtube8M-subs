another<00:00:04.770> type<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.069> shadow<00:00:05.490> board<00:00:05.990> we'll<00:00:06.990> go

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
another type of shadow board we'll go

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.799 
another type of shadow board we'll go
back<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.620> our<00:00:07.950> original<00:00:08.220> shadow<00:00:08.849> board<00:00:09.210> and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
back to our original shadow board and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.509 
back to our original shadow board and
experiment<00:00:10.440> some<00:00:10.590> project<00:00:11.160> when<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.309> get<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
experiment some project when we get a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.070 
experiment some project when we get a
day<00:00:11.700> that's<00:00:11.849> got<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> lot<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.389> Sun<00:00:12.630> right<00:00:12.840> now<00:00:13.019> we

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
day that's got a lot of Sun right now we

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.530 
day that's got a lot of Sun right now we
have<00:00:13.320> very<00:00:13.349> intermittent<00:00:14.130> Sun<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.150> I'm<00:00:15.299> going

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
have very intermittent Sun so I'm going

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.330 
have very intermittent Sun so I'm going
to<00:00:15.570> show<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.990> very<00:00:16.289> simple<00:00:16.560> method<00:00:16.949> that

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
to show you a very simple method that

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.609 
to show you a very simple method that
you<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.270> create<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.750> camp<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.140> about<00:00:19.350> five

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
you can create in camp in about five

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.400 
you can create in camp in about five
minutes<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.160> will<00:00:20.310> give<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.670> very<00:00:20.970> good

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
minutes that will give you a very good

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.439 
minutes that will give you a very good
general<00:00:22.410> direction<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.279> heading<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.210> can

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
general direction of heading and you can

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.929 
general direction of heading and you can
repeat<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.380> process<00:00:25.680> over<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.490> over<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:26.910> you

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
repeat the process over and over as you

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.810 
repeat the process over and over as you
leapfrog<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:28.140> stay<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.769> general<00:00:29.250> bearing

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
leapfrog to stay on that general bearing

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
leapfrog to stay on that general bearing
it<00:00:29.910> won't<00:00:30.119> give<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> any<00:00:30.650> exacting<00:00:31.650> bearings

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
it won't give you any exacting bearings

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.040 
it won't give you any exacting bearings
but<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.730> keep<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> good<00:00:33.329> general

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but it will keep you in a good general

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
but it will keep you in a good general
bearing<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.340> easy<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.760> set<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.090> very

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
bearing it's very easy to set up very

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.750 
bearing it's very easy to set up very
easy<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> use<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.829> you're<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.489> need<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
easy to use all you're going to need is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
easy to use all you're going to need is
a<00:00:38.790> flat<00:00:39.059> piece<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.360> wood<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:40.020> kind<00:00:40.260> like

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
a flat piece of wood of some kind like

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190 
a flat piece of wood of some kind like
this<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.300> could<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.570> split<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this one and you could just split a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.660 
this one and you could just split a
plank<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> from<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.309> piece<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
plank out for that from the piece of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.920 
plank out for that from the piece of
wood<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:44.910> whatever<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> case<00:00:45.329> may<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
wood or whatever the case may be and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
wood or whatever the case may be and
then<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> draw<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> simple<00:00:47.760> circle<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
then you draw a simple circle and all I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.350 
then you draw a simple circle and all I
did<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:48.899> outline<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.379> bush<00:00:49.620> pot<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.820> an<00:00:51.120> X

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
did was outline my bush pot I put an X

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
did was outline my bush pot I put an X
on<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.260> put<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> hole<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> middle

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
on here and I put a hole in the middle

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.459 
on here and I put a hole in the middle
of<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.640> omen<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.180> I'm<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.989> using<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
of it for an omen and I'm just using a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
of it for an omen and I'm just using a
Tenpenny<00:00:55.949> nail<00:00:56.280> through<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> hole<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.780> an

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
Tenpenny nail through that hole as an

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.819 
Tenpenny nail through that hole as an
omen<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.670> marked<00:01:00.170> south<00:01:01.170> north

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
omen and then I have marked south north

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.579 
omen and then I have marked south north
east<00:01:02.070> west<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> notice<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.140> East<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
east west now if you notice the East and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.890 
east west now if you notice the East and
the<00:01:04.619> West<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:05.129> reversed<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.510> compass

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the West are reversed in this compass

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.210 
the West are reversed in this compass
rosette<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.409> there's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> reason<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
rosette and there's a reason for that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.210 
rosette and there's a reason for that
and<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> way<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> Sun

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
and it's because of the way the Sun

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.859 
and it's because of the way the Sun
shadow<00:01:11.220> travels<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.240> board<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.630> we're

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
shadow travels on this board but we're

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
shadow travels on this board but we're
using<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.229> circle<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.700> way<00:01:14.850> this

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
using a circle here and the way this

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.340 
using a circle here and the way this
works<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.479> I'll<00:01:15.570> show<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.200> minute

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
works and I'll show you in just a minute

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.219 
works and I'll show you in just a minute
is<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.040> front<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> board<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.990> your

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
is the front of the board here is your

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
is the front of the board here is your
direction<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.710> travel<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> stand<00:01:20.850> with

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
direction of travel so you stand with

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.649 
direction of travel so you stand with
this<00:01:21.960> board<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.409> Sun<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.670> move<00:01:23.939> your

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this board in the Sun and you move your

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.950 
this board in the Sun and you move your
body<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> compass<00:01:26.960> until

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
body like you would with a compass until

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.420 
body like you would with a compass until
the<00:01:28.259> shadow<00:01:29.240> hits<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> area<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> compass

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the shadow hits the area of the compass

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
the shadow hits the area of the compass
in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> direction<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> travel<00:01:34.110> so

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
in the direction you want to travel so

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
in the direction you want to travel so
you<00:01:34.290> could<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:35.119> southeast

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you could actually do southeast

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
you could actually do southeast
Southwest<00:01:36.689> northeast<00:01:37.229> northwest<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
Southwest northeast northwest and you

okay<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.849> can<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.150> now<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> have<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.750> shadow

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
okay so you can see now I have a shadow

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.610 
okay so you can see now I have a shadow
moving<00:02:42.519> around<00:02:42.879> this<00:02:43.060> board<00:02:43.390> as<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:44.349> spin<00:02:44.560> my

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
moving around this board as I spin my

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.819 
moving around this board as I spin my
body<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:46.269> let's<00:02:46.450> spin<00:02:46.690> our<00:02:46.720> body<00:02:47.049> around<00:02:47.379> here

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
body so let's spin our body around here

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.890 
body so let's spin our body around here
and<00:02:47.920> we<00:02:48.040> have<00:02:48.220> our<00:02:48.459> arrow<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.480> western'

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
and we have our arrow in the western'

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.110 
and we have our arrow in the western'
quadrant<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:51.160> means<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.549> front<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.910> this

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
quadrant that means the front of this

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.699 
quadrant that means the front of this
should<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.810> pointing<00:02:53.200> in<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.319> western

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
should be pointing in a western

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.910 
should be pointing in a western
direction<00:02:55.260> okay<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.319> here's<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.859> we

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
direction okay so here's that that we

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.199 
direction okay so here's that that we
need<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.129> realize<00:02:57.519> while<00:02:57.790> we're<00:02:57.940> waiting<00:02:58.180> on

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
need to realize while we're waiting on

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.420 
need to realize while we're waiting on
the<00:02:58.329> Sun<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:59.260> that's<00:02:59.440> exactly<00:02:59.799> what<00:03:00.220> we<00:03:00.310> need

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
the Sun and that's exactly what we need

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.460 
the Sun and that's exactly what we need
to<00:03:00.519> realize<00:03:00.700> we're<00:03:01.090> waiting<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.750> Sun<00:03:01.989> this

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
to realize we're waiting on the Sun this

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.800 
to realize we're waiting on the Sun this
is<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.739> Sun<00:03:03.010> dependent<00:03:03.579> system<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.659> because

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
is a Sun dependent system but because

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.830 
is a Sun dependent system but because
it's<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.440> fast<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:06.549> works<00:03:06.760> very<00:03:07.060> quickly<00:03:07.359> and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
it's so fast it works very quickly and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.380 
it's so fast it works very quickly and
intermittent<00:03:08.560> Sun<00:03:08.829> unlike<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.640> shadow<00:03:10.030> stick

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
intermittent Sun unlike a shadow stick

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.670 
intermittent Sun unlike a shadow stick
and<00:03:10.569> things<00:03:10.720> like<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.109> have<00:03:11.409> to<00:03:11.560> be

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and things like that that have to be

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.289 
and things like that that have to be
left<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> ground<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.909> checked<00:03:13.150> and

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
left on the ground and checked and

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.330 
left on the ground and checked and
calibrated<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:14.319> allows<00:03:14.709> us<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:15.010> get<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
calibrated this allows us to get a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.069 
calibrated this allows us to get a
general<00:03:15.670> direction<00:03:16.239> or<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:16.359> general<00:03:16.659> heading

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
general direction or a general heading

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.050 
general direction or a general heading
and<00:03:17.230> stay<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:17.950> heading<00:03:18.370> over<00:03:18.609> distance

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
and stay on that heading over distance

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.530 
and stay on that heading over distance
even<00:03:19.569> with<00:03:19.840> intermittent<00:03:20.739> times<00:03:21.099> of<00:03:21.280> Sun<00:03:21.540> okay

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
even with intermittent times of Sun okay

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.849 
even with intermittent times of Sun okay
we're<00:03:22.720> getting<00:03:22.810> ready<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.079> get<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.260> shadow<00:03:23.500> here

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
we're getting ready to get a shadow here

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.580 
we're getting ready to get a shadow here
and<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:24.849> gonna<00:03:25.000> be<00:03:25.150> really<00:03:25.329> quick<00:03:25.599> all<00:03:26.530> right

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and it's gonna be really quick all right

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.830 
and it's gonna be really quick all right
see<00:03:27.040> we've<00:03:27.190> got<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.340> shadow<00:03:27.579> on<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.819> board<00:03:28.090> it's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
see we've got a shadow on the board it's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.190 
see we've got a shadow on the board it's
moving<00:03:29.230> around<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.650> board<00:03:29.889> now<00:03:30.810> if<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.959> want<00:03:32.139> to

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
moving around the board now if I want to

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.800 
moving around the board now if I want to
travel<00:03:32.470> west<00:03:33.060> boom<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.269> shadow<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.629> gone

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
travel west boom the shadow is gone

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.199 
travel west boom the shadow is gone
already<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.379> have<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.160> assume<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.879> board

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
already I have to assume that this board

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.349 
already I have to assume that this board
is<00:03:37.870> facing<00:03:38.169> in<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.500> westerly<00:03:38.829> direction<00:03:39.359> so

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
is facing in a westerly direction so

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.250 
is facing in a westerly direction so
let's<00:03:40.540> get<00:03:40.660> our<00:03:40.780> compass<00:03:40.959> out<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:43.840> we<00:03:43.989> put<00:03:44.169> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
let's get our compass out if we put the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.839 
let's get our compass out if we put the
needle<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.620> doghouse<00:03:44.889> on<00:03:45.250> this<00:03:45.430> compass

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
needle in the doghouse on this compass

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.800 
needle in the doghouse on this compass
our<00:03:46.060> east-west<00:03:46.930> line<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.500> right<00:03:47.799> here<00:03:48.810> I'm

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
our east-west line is right here I'm

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.750 
our east-west line is right here I'm
sorry<00:03:50.230> our<00:03:50.349> north-south<00:03:50.949> line<00:03:51.220> excuse<00:03:51.579> me<00:03:51.730> our

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
sorry our north-south line excuse me our

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.599 
sorry our north-south line excuse me our
north-south<00:03:52.269> line<00:03:52.599> is<00:03:52.870> running<00:03:53.169> right<00:03:53.319> here

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
north-south line is running right here

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.400 
north-south line is running right here
so<00:03:54.609> we<00:03:54.760> are<00:03:54.849> absolutely<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:56.079> westerly

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
so we are absolutely in a westerly

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.229 
so we are absolutely in a westerly
direction<00:03:56.530> yes<00:03:57.459> we're<00:03:57.669> a<00:03:57.699> few<00:03:57.819> degrees<00:03:58.030> off

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
direction yes we're a few degrees off

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.479 
direction yes we're a few degrees off
but<00:03:59.079> for<00:03:59.230> something<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.590> took<00:03:59.769> five<00:04:00.010> seconds

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
but for something that took five seconds

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.920 
but for something that took five seconds
and<00:04:00.669> the<00:04:01.269> Sun<00:04:01.480> was<00:04:01.599> gone<00:04:01.810> that's<00:04:02.349> pretty<00:04:02.650> good

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
and the Sun was gone that's pretty good

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.180 
and the Sun was gone that's pretty good
alright<00:04:04.930> guys<00:04:05.139> here's<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.560> couple<00:04:05.829> more<00:04:05.949> things

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
real quick waiting on the Sun again I

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.349 
real quick waiting on the Sun again I
want<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.560> give<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.769> guys<00:04:08.889> a<00:04:08.949> good<00:04:09.310> show<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.030> how

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
want to give you guys a good show of how

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.879 
want to give you guys a good show of how
you<00:04:10.419> find<00:04:10.750> north<00:04:11.019> with<00:04:11.230> this<00:04:11.349> thing<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:11.859> a

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
you find north with this thing for a

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.400 
you find north with this thing for a
travel<00:04:12.250> direction<00:04:12.669> the<00:04:13.239> sun's<00:04:13.540> back<00:04:13.959> in<00:04:14.169> for<00:04:14.349> a

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
travel direction the sun's back in for a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.740 
travel direction the sun's back in for a
minute<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:14.879> here's<00:04:15.879> another<00:04:16.090> beauty<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.630> this

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
minute so here's another beauty of this

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.129 
minute so here's another beauty of this
system<00:04:16.989> no<00:04:17.859> calibration<00:04:18.479> no<00:04:19.479> set-up<00:04:19.900> time

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
system no calibration no set-up time

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.509 
system no calibration no set-up time
really<00:04:20.410> other<00:04:20.530> than<00:04:20.650> drawing<00:04:20.949> a<00:04:21.099> circle<00:04:21.280> in

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
really other than drawing a circle in

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.130 
really other than drawing a circle in
the<00:04:21.639> X<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.000> marking<00:04:22.450> your<00:04:22.539> quadrants<00:04:22.960> and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
the X and marking your quadrants and

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.140 
the X and marking your quadrants and
then<00:04:23.260> remember<00:04:23.680> East<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.490> West<00:04:24.669> have<00:04:24.909> to<00:04:25.060> be

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
then remember East and West have to be

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.439 
then remember East and West have to be
reversed<00:04:25.539> for<00:04:25.900> this<00:04:26.409> system

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
reversed for this system

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.500 
reversed for this system
it's<00:04:28.449> simple<00:04:28.990> it's<00:04:29.260> ki<00:04:29.680> SS<00:04:30.490> that's<00:04:31.330> what<00:04:31.479> I

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
it's simple it's ki SS that's what I

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.590 
it's simple it's ki SS that's what I
like<00:04:31.810> about<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.320> system<00:04:33.210> it's<00:04:34.210> almost

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
like about this system it's almost

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.570 
like about this system it's almost
impossible<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.500> mess<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:35.979> unless<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.460> don't

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
impossible to mess up unless you don't

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.900 
impossible to mess up unless you don't
get<00:04:36.760> your<00:04:37.000> directions<00:04:37.990> reversed<00:04:38.350> right<00:04:38.560> here

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
get your directions reversed right here

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.580 
get your directions reversed right here
it's<00:04:39.910> stupid<00:04:40.690> simple<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.229> that's<00:04:41.350> what<00:04:41.560> I

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
it's stupid simple and that's what I

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.409 
it's stupid simple and that's what I
like<00:04:41.889> about<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.460> like<00:04:42.970> things<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.300> are

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
like about it I like things that are

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.300 
like about it I like things that are
bulletproof<00:04:43.870> in<00:04:44.260> survival<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:44.860> bushcraft

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
bulletproof in survival and bushcraft

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.310 
bulletproof in survival and bushcraft
and<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.880> is<00:04:46.030> pretty<00:04:46.210> bulletproof<00:04:46.600> for

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
and this is pretty bulletproof for

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.080 
and this is pretty bulletproof for
general<00:04:47.620> direction<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:48.460> is<00:04:48.669> probably<00:04:48.970> as

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
general direction this is probably as

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.060 
general direction this is probably as
close<00:04:49.330> as<00:04:49.479> you<00:04:49.600> could<00:04:49.750> possibly<00:04:50.169> get<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:51.040> a

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
close as you could possibly get to a

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.879 
close as you could possibly get to a

now simple deduction if I want to find

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.879 
now simple deduction if I want to find
north<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.780> sun's<00:05:02.020> going<00:05:02.380> down<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.800> know

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
north and the sun's going down I know

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.890 
north and the sun's going down I know
that<00:05:03.460> this<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.210> going<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.419> need<00:05:04.510> to<00:05:04.570> Point

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
that this is going to need to Point

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.390 
that this is going to need to Point
Northwest<00:05:05.410> because<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.710> sun's<00:05:05.949> in<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.190> West

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
Northwest because the sun's in the West

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.250 
Northwest because the sun's in the West
so<00:05:07.090> I'm<00:05:07.180> gonna<00:05:07.270> lay<00:05:07.449> this<00:05:07.570> on<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.780> ground<00:05:08.080> real

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
so I'm gonna lay this on the ground real

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.000 
so I'm gonna lay this on the ground real
quick<00:05:08.500> there<00:05:09.340> my<00:05:09.490> shadows<00:05:09.850> already<00:05:10.150> gone<00:05:11.010> I'll

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
quick there my shadows already gone I'll

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.629 
quick there my shadows already gone I'll
lay<00:05:12.190> this<00:05:12.570> look<00:05:13.570> at<00:05:13.660> that<00:05:13.690> guys<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:15.340> front<00:05:15.580> of

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
lay this look at that guys the front of

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.580 
lay this look at that guys the front of
that<00:05:15.729> compass<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.330> almost<00:05:16.660> facing<00:05:17.139> dead<00:05:17.289> North

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
that compass is almost facing dead North

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.620 
that compass is almost facing dead North
or<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.160> front<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.400> that<00:05:18.520> shadow<00:05:19.150> board<00:05:19.479> is

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
or the front of that shadow board is

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.930 
or the front of that shadow board is
almost<00:05:19.810> facing<00:05:20.470> dead<00:05:20.650> North<00:05:20.889> with<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.610> shadow

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
almost facing dead North with the shadow

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.469 
almost facing dead North with the shadow
facing<00:05:22.389> north<00:05:22.600> west<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.560> sun's<00:05:23.830> going<00:05:24.190> down

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
facing north west the sun's going down

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.820 
facing north west the sun's going down
simple<00:05:25.479> deduction<00:05:25.780> tells<00:05:26.169> me<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:26.680> the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
simple deduction tells me that the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.170 
simple deduction tells me that the
shadow<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.190> going<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.400> be<00:05:27.460> on<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.669> west<00:05:27.910> side

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
shadow is going to be on the west side

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.180 
shadow is going to be on the west side
of<00:05:28.539> this<00:05:28.870> quadrant<00:05:29.440> so<00:05:29.560> if<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.740> want<00:05:29.919> to<00:05:29.979> travel

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
of this quadrant so if I want to travel

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.140 
of this quadrant so if I want to travel
straight<00:05:30.460> north

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
straight north

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.770 
straight north
I<00:05:31.180> need<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.630> shadow<00:05:31.870> on<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.139> north<00:05:32.349> west<00:05:33.780> okay

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
I need the shadow on the north west okay

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.029 
I need the shadow on the north west okay
guys<00:05:34.990> well<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.260> hope<00:05:35.289> I<00:05:35.500> didn't<00:05:35.650> confuse<00:05:35.740> you

guys well I hope I didn't confuse you

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.980 
guys well I hope I didn't confuse you
too<00:05:36.130> much<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.610> if<00:05:36.669> I<00:05:36.760> did<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.180> can<00:05:37.690> make<00:05:37.840> future

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
too much and if I did I can make future

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.690 
too much and if I did I can make future
videos<00:05:38.500> here's<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.889> thing<00:05:39.099> I'm<00:05:39.520> excited

videos here's the thing I'm excited

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.360 
videos here's the thing I'm excited
about<00:05:40.090> this<00:05:40.419> because<00:05:40.599> it's<00:05:40.930> new<00:05:41.139> it's<00:05:41.620> not<00:05:41.889> how

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
about this because it's new it's not how

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.100 
about this because it's new it's not how
to<00:05:42.430> build<00:05:42.669> a<00:05:42.729> fire<00:05:42.940> how<00:05:43.479> to<00:05:43.539> make<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.780> shelter

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
to build a fire how to make a shelter

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.500 
to build a fire how to make a shelter
it's<00:05:44.740> not<00:05:44.979> what's<00:05:45.280> in<00:05:45.430> my<00:05:45.550> pack<00:05:45.789> it's<00:05:46.090> not<00:05:46.270> what

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
it's not what's in my pack it's not what

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.360 
it's not what's in my pack it's not what
knife<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.870> carry<00:05:47.139> it's<00:05:47.680> not<00:05:47.860> this<00:05:48.039> is<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.340> best

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
knife to carry it's not this is the best

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.100 
knife to carry it's not this is the best
knife<00:05:48.760> for<00:05:48.940> that's<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.180> best<00:05:49.450> knife

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
knife for that's the best knife

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.219 
knife for that's the best knife
what<00:05:50.349> this<00:05:50.530> is<00:05:50.800> is<00:05:51.300> ancient<00:05:52.300> technology<00:05:53.080> that

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
what this is is ancient technology that

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.930 
what this is is ancient technology that
I<00:05:53.260> have<00:05:53.470> melded<00:05:53.770> together<00:05:54.070> with<00:05:54.520> my<00:05:54.669> own

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
I have melded together with my own

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.150 
I have melded together with my own
theories<00:05:55.840> and<00:05:55.990> thoughts<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.470> create<00:05:56.860> a<00:05:56.889> new

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
theories and thoughts to create a new

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.469 
theories and thoughts to create a new
system<00:05:57.810> for<00:05:58.810> primitive<00:06:00.240> navigation<00:06:01.240> in<00:06:01.389> a

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
system for primitive navigation in a

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.870 
system for primitive navigation in a
sense<00:06:01.720> of<00:06:01.960> general<00:06:02.349> direction<00:06:02.979> finding<00:06:03.460> and

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
sense of general direction finding and

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.189 
sense of general direction finding and
it's<00:06:04.000> a<00:06:04.060> little<00:06:04.240> bit<00:06:04.449> more<00:06:04.630> accurate<00:06:04.840> than

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
it's a little bit more accurate than

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.170 
it's a little bit more accurate than
that<00:06:05.229> if<00:06:05.470> you<00:06:05.560> know<00:06:05.650> how<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:05.860> use<00:06:06.070> it<00:06:06.220> but<00:06:06.940> it's

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
that if you know how to use it but it's

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.620 
that if you know how to use it but it's
easy<00:06:07.539> to<00:06:07.870> teach<00:06:08.139> it's<00:06:08.860> easy<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:09.430> do<00:06:09.669> there's<00:06:10.419> no

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
easy to teach it's easy to do there's no

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.300 
easy to teach it's easy to do there's no
calibration<00:06:11.349> required<00:06:11.470> it<00:06:11.860> doesn't<00:06:12.160> matter

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
calibration required it doesn't matter

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.920 
calibration required it doesn't matter
what<00:06:12.490> season<00:06:12.760> of<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.000> year<00:06:13.180> it<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.449> it

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
what season of the year it is it

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.570 
what season of the year it is it
requires<00:06:14.320> very<00:06:14.620> little<00:06:14.710> materials<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.460> can

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
requires very little materials and can

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.080 
requires very little materials and can
be<00:06:15.699> made<00:06:15.849> from<00:06:15.910> all<00:06:16.180> natural<00:06:16.240> materials<00:06:16.900> and

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
be made from all natural materials and

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.700 
be made from all natural materials and
that<00:06:19.090> makes<00:06:19.389> it<00:06:19.539> dummy<00:06:19.900> proof<00:06:20.139> and<00:06:20.349> that's

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
that makes it dummy proof and that's

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.160 
that makes it dummy proof and that's
what<00:06:20.860> I<00:06:20.889> like
