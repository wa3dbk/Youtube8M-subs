00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100
 even to make a quick recap on 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.719
 the locations of objects to crafter and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.910
 how well started his part 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's start with the propeller composed of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 four pieces lying all in the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.430
 first room or in the second just 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.989
 opening the door at 750 points on 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 motor can be in the corner or 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.829
 on the desk comes out stroum the flag 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
 is leaning against the yellow railing or on 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.399
 the two small sofas present in the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 first trampoline room is in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 the stairs or against a wall in the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.829
 second room and the agly is backed 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.260
 against a wall in the second room and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.610
 against a wall in the first room the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.379
 small pieces of slapstick actors get 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.420
 find all in the corridors the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 tupperware can be on the barrel next 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 showers or the one in front of the table 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 of kraft age the bottle she is on 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.939
 the table where we turn on the power or at 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.009
 right of the kraft table the handle 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.079
 and on the kitchen or on a table in 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.999
 the current room and the sock 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.100
 to TV which is also the only 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.659
 object that do not change room for 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.969
 patches and the slip that made catr 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.679
 by the way I want to clarify Egypt 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.539
 you just have to pull all your 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.889
 loader ie the ten balls of 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.929
 your charger on the white board to 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.100
 side of the restaurant at home here I am 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.599
 wanted to sadri explain to you the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.369
 different strategies adopted from the 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.439
 round one at the sleeve without solo 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.060
 regards the solo before starting 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.039
 your party you must bring yourself 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.719
 assets mini juggernaut simply cough 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.609
 permanent gravestone that will have by 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.049
 following a great importance will not 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.209
 not how to get them there exists 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.279
 several studios on youtube private ctv 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.450
 also I advise you to drop to 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.389
 advance money in your bank 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.009
 final incentive 94 improved in the fridge 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.389
 you did not do it all you need 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.340
 simply to launch beforehand a 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:04.750
 part to do it or just 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.460
 to do it during your party 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.690
 his party start two options 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.979
 are available to you the first is 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.750
 to open the door leading to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.370
 the lift of the resuscitation and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.470
 mount your thruster piece by piece 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.420
 the second is probably the most 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.070
 safe and take the big lift from the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.570
 departure and go down to the hall of 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.900
 current who would take money to the 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.480
 bank 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.220
 helena 94 improve filed beforehand 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 in the fridge near the doors leading to 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.209
 the kraft table justifying and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.800
 build it but the current then 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.480
 get on the roof I was then 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.130
 mastodon that is in one of 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.990
 four departure lifts also throw 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.610
 there any double blow as well as the keys 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.470
 death and love text is thus 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.580
 on the roof suite jumped towards each other 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.440
 building and then build your 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.420
 thruster by helping you elevators 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.100
 throw the resuscitation and then turn 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.080
 hickory that is located either at 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.950
 the bar lift is at the elevator of 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.390
 the thruster room 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.590
 I also tell you that it is not necessary 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.180
 especially not take the trumps of the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.590
 clowns for a very simple reason 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.989
 in fact it is simply that 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.390
 from the moment you took a 5th 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.010
 - 6th at all with the colors you 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.630
 die you could not all 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.790
 just not get your 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.680
 resuscitation to distributors and so 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.330
 it's still a little embarrassing of 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.190
 do not have resuscitation so here we go 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.420
 remember to keep your four assets 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.940
 are now ready to start 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.799
 at least until the 30 downhill 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.230
 is at the very bottom of the building at the end of 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.820
 elbow had to camp on the second floor to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.769
 from the 30th inning to the withdrawal from 4 to 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.570
 14 improved will no longer need enough 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.610
 damage had therefore started to turn 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.739
 with our review at her patches and 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.600
 I predict two options available to you 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.000
 the first is to turn to the hall of 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.560
 technical throne and the most hype but 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.880
 she is not the fastest with no 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.530
 the most economical in terms of 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.500
 ammunition is applicable until the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.390
 sleeve 80 85 years old coming because of 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.579
 ammunition at the council this strategy so 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.239
 you are not beginner on this 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.920
 simply tablecloth 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.660
 the second option which was faster 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.459
 is applicable until the sleeve without 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.030
 riskier currencies and turn your 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.650
 shares in Chinese restaurant 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.120
 wii made some sequences all our 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.860
 parties while a photo 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.480
 he shows you well how to 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.700
 turn as well as where he is 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.800
 better to shoot with your fitter catr 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.730
 he is brought to die no panic he 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.590
 was there any permanent stone 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.450
 tombstone will not be losing your beings 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.830
 in chaos boutin dambach score 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.510
 your wave could go look for the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.100
 resuscitation in full heat you are at 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.600
 the hole room after the end of the 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.190
 sleeve then go get your 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.989
 schedule the case where you would be dead three 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.190
 times and so more resuscitation take 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.750
 instead the spinning top team 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.669
 attention this asset is much more 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.260
 risky because when you die a 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.490
 evening to appear in a very 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.500
 uncomfortable and make you directly 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.560
 submerged for example at the karment 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.150
 reappear time which is synonymous with 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.950
 sales part or in addition to that it's me 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.900
 already arrived here is the end of this 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.730
 solo part on how to wait for the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.840
 unsurprising round I hope it 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.750
 you will have pleased I will now leave 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.320
 a super pancake of the two-player blow 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.880
 this map 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.770
 in any case for the beginning of the game is 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.750
 pretty identical to the solo so the trumps 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.460
 permanent as minimum this rate charton 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.720
 bullet and the quick shit will be you 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.310
 essential for a good game 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.020
 started taking the elevator 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.470
 provided for a minimum of 40 miles in 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.419
 the bank 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.580
 take them and as solo was building 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.200
 the propeller and the sli that is miss and 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.360
 you assets mastodon animation 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.740
 fast sleight of hand you sulk 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.169
 who I call you will not be 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.850
 useful solo then made crates 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.500
 in order to get for the blue player who 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.750
 will have the role hard animators a knife 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.479
 ballistic that will need to be improved and a 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.650
 feast preferably laughs mark ii the 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.600
 player who knows he will have to 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.039
 bring a gun-type weapon as 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.200
 the chicotte to be able to fully 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.710
 enjoy the morasses tents and run 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.229
 faster 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.610
 a treat will do it and I want to 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.350
 specify that both players must 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.640
 imperatively having both the 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.090
 monkeys it's very important for the 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.470
 strategy 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.000
 once in possession of your weapons 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.560
 put yourself in the hallway next to the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.360
 hole room 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.830
 position your thruster at this 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.540
 place there story that zombies do not 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.220
 do not take you to the wrong side and then 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.139
 place dead keys behind you 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.120
 and camp up to the sleeve 3 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.710
 once this sleeve overtake return 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.419
 to the hole room and you would stay there 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.160
 until the round are the player wants to get 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.600
 will put in the corner with a producer 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.400
 in front of him who will kill the little night 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.840
 determined to attacked a thousand trains 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.910
 also behind him who will be very 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.500
 useful in case of overflows as in 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.030
 this situation the ben player will have to 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.590
 make chains with the slick and for 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.510
 do this he will shoot in this area 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.220
 and then make half turns to this 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.740
 place in order to kill a maximum of 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.180
 zombies with a single bullet avoid 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.820
 go back to where you shot 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.870
 to avoid slipping on soap 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.300
 could cause you dead 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.650
 rigor in the hole room it is 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.150
 very hard to make chains over 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.729
 200 years so lives in the high-end 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.930
 to the 70 81 of the two players will have to 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.880
 keep the zombies while the other 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.740
 will make crates to catch a new 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.900
 sli that we can not try to go to 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.490
 bar in cooperation it's really very 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.710
 complicated he would surely make us 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.880
 overwhelmed after a few months when 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.139
 the white and red player he launches 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.910
 directly a monkey so his 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.280
 teammate can resuscitate him quickly 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.660
 and easily with his friend stick and if 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.669
 the white player dies without having the 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.590
 time to launch his monkey the blue must 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.890
 very quickly react and launch his 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.150
 in order to ensure the war but 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.410
 bute on it's pope is to keep the 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.000
 as long as possible are minimal to 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.410
 this rate because without it the white day will have 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.090
 a lot more trouble making chains 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.919
 because it often requires slowing down 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.900
 enormously the zombies so she does not 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.120
 do not break it's really the same 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.039
 map without minima sto advise you to 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.630
 to really play safe is to keep very 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.580
 long time 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.140
 that's it for the blow hop it's 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.850
 true it's pretty fast but at the same 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.140
 time the strategy is rather simple 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.970
 so if you do not understand 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.310
 do not hesitate to ask me questions at 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.470
 me or dry and then I want to do 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.690
 a last little parenthesis on the 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.490
 severity of this map it's true that 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.680
 any little jump can you 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.240
 put red quickly we really do 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.650
 very well that they did not want to 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.930
 everywhere because you can very well 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.000
 to die even with a mass all minima 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.830
 this rate with a jump that does not appear 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.540
 so high that it's true that this 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.790
 map is really misleading at this level 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.860
 there and that's the guys this guide the 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.110
 survivor coming to an end I hope he 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.270
 you will help him well so I thank 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.000
 adri who really has me too much 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.530
 helped for this tutorial really made it 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.940
 great job so do not hesitate to go 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.110
 do a little trick on his channel that him 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.910
 will be fun then it will do me too 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.390
 pleasure because it's true he 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.790
 deserved 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.620
 so we'll do an episode number 2 on 

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.960
 this map that will explain how 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.460
 survive after the round without and in 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.350
 which will show you all the jumps 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.720
 he has to do with the thruster 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.610
 so we will send this video to coast 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.630
 cfq jaison be and good plans of the geek 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.790
 because I think she can help 

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.830
 a lot of players so here are the guys 

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.470
 it was great pancake in cooperation 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:11.210
 with adrie 764 and I tell you to the 

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.210
 next for a new ciao video
