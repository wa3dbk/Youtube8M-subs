00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and used it as a reference while I was

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
and used it as a reference while I was
filming<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.909> had<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> trial<00:01:12.600> copy<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.049> some

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
filming I had a trial copy of some

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.750 
filming I had a trial copy of some
stop-motion<00:01:13.439> software<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> could<00:01:14.400> run<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
stop-motion software that could run the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.399 
stop-motion software that could run the
reference<00:01:15.119> alongside<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.900> live<00:01:16.080> feed<00:01:16.320> from

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409

reference alongside the live feed from
my<00:01:16.590> camera<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.400> way<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> could<00:01:17.790> simply

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
my camera so this way I could simply

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
my camera so this way I could simply
take<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> picture<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:19.049> look<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.350> my<00:01:19.470> guide<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
take a picture then look at my guide and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.770 
take a picture then look at my guide and
recreate<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.909> screen<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.600> only

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
recreate what I see on screen the only

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.030 
recreate what I see on screen the only
problem<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.320> setup<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> my

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
problem with this setup is that my

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.620 
problem with this setup is that my
camera<00:01:23.100> can't<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:23.700> hook<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
camera can't actually hook up into a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
camera can't actually hook up into a
computer<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.229> run<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> software<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
computer to run the software it just

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.609 
computer to run the software it just
doesn't<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.939> ability<00:01:27.150> I've<00:01:27.509> tried<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
doesn't have the ability I've tried so I

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.800 
doesn't have the ability I've tried so I
attached<00:01:29.040> an<00:01:29.220> HD<00:01:29.610> webcam<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.390> shotgun

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
microphone and mounted it on top of my

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
microphone and mounted it on top of my
camera<00:01:32.790> pointing<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> LCD<00:01:34.020> screen<00:01:34.079> on

camera pointing it at the LCD screen on
the<00:01:34.409> back<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> take<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> picture<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.000> my

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
camera's remote control then I take a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.890 
camera's remote control then I take a
