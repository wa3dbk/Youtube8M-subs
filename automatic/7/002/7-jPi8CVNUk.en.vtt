00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 and you know in this time that we have taken 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.879
 together I have come to the motive of loving you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.160
 but in another way 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.619
 you know 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.330
 which is more difficult for me 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.610
 supposedly men have to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.529
 start with a word and it's good more 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.150
 well it 's something that I really feel and it's 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.220
 that I love you and a lot 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.980
 benyakar my console I love you with all my 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.980
 elbow but what the hell is wrong with you 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.900
 what happens to you respect and leave and it seems 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.800
 that nobody can have a private moment 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 with your console 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.620
 understand things that I do not want to see 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.290
 in my garden 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.760
 so go away do not come back I write it 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.450
 Of course, yes, I do know, sir, something 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.940
 except for Shanghai tourisms around 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.310
 eyes are still burning 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.500
 so do not worry friend I'll 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 turn off the eyes with this cup of coffee 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 super hot 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.270

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.270

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.109
 well this is very difficult to say more 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.479
 from me, because as your friend I ask you 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:31.340
 let me tell you something I can see 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.340
 Of course, you can tell me, Roque 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.980
 well the question is that you have a 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.110
 garbage on the tooth and when you smile 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.310
 everyone laughs because it seems like no 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.410
 you had a tooth 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.650
 I could have told you before but it gave me 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.650
 weakness 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.130
