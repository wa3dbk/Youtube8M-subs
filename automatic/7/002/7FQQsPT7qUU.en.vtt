00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.690
 the fc bavaria munich is in the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.910
 semi-final of the champions league and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.880
 wait curious who zugelost on friday 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 becomes halo matthias sammer halo 2 madrid 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.090
 and chelsea are in the pot have that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.380
 Feel that none of the three like that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.330
 really especially against us 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.850
 commencement 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.250
 yes, but I always stay with you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.359
 a draw one has no influence 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.099
 on it one must take the opponent the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.780
 Man zugelost get there 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.040
 certainly to every club one 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.110
 interesting story 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
 I would stay at the sport and say 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.750
 you have to have a top form in both 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.879
 play tactically against every opponent 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.399
 would certainly be a few differences 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.100
 give that then you have to analyze but 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.760
 the best the best statement is always 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.960
 that you pay attention to yourself and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.670
 possible in both play in absolute 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 is topform and then of course we have 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.329
 also come good opportunities to final 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.800
 in fact, a few differences tell you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.840
 at least have chelsea and atletico 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.659
 now as well as manchester are whole 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.260
 different style than we as fc bavaria yes 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.880
 I would say that also barcelona 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.880
 of course, with his style 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.000
 playing football against atletico madrid 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.670
 failed of course very ordered 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.030
 very compact but very structured 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.310
 different football so maybe a play 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.510
 a bit similar to chelsea real again 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.450
 different 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.940
 me another tick and it means 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.460
 inevitably if you get a result 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.280
 achieve or go a round further 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.960
 that of course always to the respective 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.900
 team to the respective games 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.720
 also a certain style must adapt 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.740
 of course transmitted from the respective 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.410
 Trainer 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.850
 and accordingly , these alone 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.040
 to analyze teams is already 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 exciting and interesting for you 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.660
 everything has opponents 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.300
 no I have no wish opponent if 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.170
 you also saw the last round 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.750
 how scarce the results were all how 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.090
 Yes, we were supposedly manunited 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.100
 have seen that again 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.470
 exceptional performance 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.590
 That was already very difficult 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.090
 piece work no at the level it applies 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.459
 really, I repeat myself there 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.230
 but make sure that we that we 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.700
 if possible in top form and saturday 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.950
 first comes borussia dortmund in the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.450
 Bundesliga to us we take the title 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.010
 fortunately it is won 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.670
 still remains for them the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.200
 bundesliga summit basically yes man 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.030
 must pay attention 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.370
 both teams then have one 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.230
 heavy cup in front of the chest 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.750
 Of course, she is also always in 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.090
 to look at the other side 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.860
 clearly there one fights for the second 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.230
 Place that 's what you want to achieve 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.990
 we are german champion i stay 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 still there 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.260
 prestige is all good and everything is beautiful 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.090
 but you also have to have intelligence 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.120
 both physically and mentally too 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.190
 control that is then task of it 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.320
 to pay attention that we are in our rhythm 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.880
 stay that we got ahead yesterday 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.530
 are very very important for them too 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.930
 mental attitude for the mental 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.510
 setting on this on this high 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.890
 level to think further and continue to 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.420
 I honestly tell them 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.490
 Of course we want that on Saturday 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.620
 but we also have to win everything 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.990
 do that and pep must be free of 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.500
 this decision he made for ours 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.120
 players and best for the team 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.770
 considers independent of the opponent on 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.790
 Saturday we can not do more than 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.530
 become German champion 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.910
 Nevertheless, we look forward to the game and he 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.770
 Of course we have 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.800
 Want to win no question 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.220
 and we are also happy that thank you 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.220
