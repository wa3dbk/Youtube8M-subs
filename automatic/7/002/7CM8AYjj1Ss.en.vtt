starting<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> gather<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:40.739> ideas<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.340> what

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
starting to gather some ideas and what

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
starting to gather some ideas and what
are<00:00:41.550> things<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.850> may<00:00:42.149> engage<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
are things that may engage them now that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.600

they may want to pursue and thoroughly

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.330 
they may want to pursue and thoroughly
research<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.180> study<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> future<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
research and study in the future I I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.580 
research and study in the future I I
knew<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> would<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.300> capstone<00:00:51.840> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
knew I would have to do capstone in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.639 
knew I would have to do capstone in
middle<00:00:53.520> school<00:00:53.910> probably<00:00:54.180> sixth<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.260> seventh

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649

seeing<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.930> possibilities<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.980> could

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
seeing all of the possibilities I could

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
seeing all of the possibilities I could
do<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> I've<00:01:04.019> known<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> while<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
and for my capstone project I did animal

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.710 
and for my capstone project I did animal
adoption<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.370> where<00:01:21.880> my<00:01:22.000> fieldwork<00:01:22.360> I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
adoption and where my fieldwork I

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.320 
adoption and where my fieldwork I
organized<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.770> dog<00:01:24.040> speed-dating<00:01:24.850> event<00:01:24.910> for

the Kennebec Valley Humane Society what

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.520 
the Kennebec Valley Humane Society what
we're<00:01:28.060> feeling<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.720> it's<00:01:29.140> not<00:01:29.290> just

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
we're feeling is that it's not just

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.930 
we're feeling is that it's not just
about<00:01:29.620> doing<00:01:29.979> school<00:01:30.250> anymore<00:01:30.670> it's<00:01:30.880> about

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
about doing school anymore it's about

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.360 
about doing school anymore it's about
really<00:01:31.390> engaging<00:01:31.750> kids<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.470> what's<00:01:32.680> in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
really engaging kids and what's in

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.130 
really engaging kids and what's in
projects<00:01:33.940> that<00:01:34.030> are<00:01:34.120> meaningful<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.570> them<00:01:34.870> not

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
projects that are meaningful to them not

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.719 
projects that are meaningful to them not
necessarily<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.979> school<00:01:36.220> district<00:01:36.640> or

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
necessarily to the school district or

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.880 
necessarily to the school district or
the<00:01:36.850> teacher<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.270> sits<00:01:37.510> before<00:01:37.660> them<00:01:37.960> really

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
the teacher that sits before them really

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.490 
the teacher that sits before them really
the<00:01:39.040> kids<00:01:39.840> initially<00:01:40.840> they<00:01:40.960> struggle<00:01:41.470> with

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
the kids initially they struggle with

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.950 
the kids initially they struggle with
that<00:01:41.920> what<00:01:42.130> am<00:01:42.490> what<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.360> want<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.600> do<00:01:43.720> what<00:01:43.930> I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
that what am what do I want to do what I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.660 
that what am what do I want to do what I
want<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.200> tackle<00:01:44.410> what<00:01:44.680> goals<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.190> have<00:01:45.430> for

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
want to tackle what goals do I have for

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.490 
want to tackle what goals do I have for
myself<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.600> they<00:01:46.720> struggle<00:01:47.259> through<00:01:47.410> the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
myself and so they struggle through the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.200 
myself and so they struggle through the
planning<00:01:47.890> process<00:01:47.920> much<00:01:48.430> like<00:01:48.460> us<00:01:48.820> as<00:01:48.970> adults

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
planning process much like us as adults
