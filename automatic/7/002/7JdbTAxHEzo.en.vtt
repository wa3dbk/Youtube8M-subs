 brothel by the kids with his record

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.940
 10 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:41.559
 on board six weeks at the town hall of 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:45.329
 young boys high tone in canada a lot 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.260
 many titles yes yes yes 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:56.440
 after day I asked you questions 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:57.759
 shit so you just want to explain to me 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.220
 why are you calling jean christophe 

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.500
 finally expects already jean christophe 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.700
 was again in gérard belzébuth jean 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.060
 Michel get him there is paula caswell 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.040
 no actually that there was that satan 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.750
 she thought that name we think it's great 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.520
 because it was effective 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.320
 we did not care at the time the group we 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.710
 did not care too that did not exist 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.780
 what and in fact like that it's annoying 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.119
 because we said we could not find 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.229
 not the name of satan on google because 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 than a little satan but there are some 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.190
 thousands of things about churches 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.960
 infernal and full of people who love 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.030
 to say that he's great this guy I 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.130
 plunge me to couch girl every night to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.409
 tubize down not you in the woods 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.440
 directly sinks his children would 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.000
 too many ears yes it's complicated to 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.440
 talk like that because like that it's 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.430
 really created as a kind of joke 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.510
 we never controlled anything that there 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.610
 had had criticism on the first 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.630
 album of guys tell people who 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.580
 were angry because jeans 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.860
 was called satan I was reproached 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.990
 there were 6x and x is 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.520
 shows and people but why they 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.140
 are part of the metal houses that are 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 hyper serious that we want 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.319
 so for you that she had done this 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.549
 cover and that they missed everything 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.560
 the world is not comprised the curds 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.720
 the Web 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.400
 here is a question we could 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 to put the green plant is if we put it 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.880
 in a concert of jc satan how she 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.490
 not react if it seems that the plants 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.690
 react the music we could 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.530
 take him to the shale concert and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.530
 expect we're going 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:57.420
 you are all baptized so two 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.450
 four patients 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.130
 I come from Lourdes where it has also this 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.540
 that pisses me off is to find a 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.950
 sense at all high 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.900
 you talk about religion because samuel 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.200
 Catholic is my essence compared 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.200
 to a name 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.010
 carew like music from elsewhere 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.510
 maybe just cool because it sounds 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.910
 It does not necessarily have a sense of garlic and full 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.060
 meaning behind all that does not want 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.680
 to say that it's not looking at all 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.810
 it's a risk it's exactly the same 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.700
 interview background on the cathos of which I am 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.100
 found like an idiot and I had a life 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.650
 really art is the keystone of 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.380
 my interview it was true super 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.540
 question is how do we do for 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.100
 to call himself Catholic this loan is signed 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.100
 on a record heat that will say 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.709
 the program qualifiers with a guy who 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.630
 is Marc Joudelat and he puts it 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.639
 that shit questions and in the end 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:23.100
 he says post in question is an answer 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:28.680
 So here not hammer it out 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.700
 I train at the end of the pleases 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.700
 my back me 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.000
 really 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.330
 yet security raising too much of 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.330
 police custody 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:13.750
 there we rotate around the pony 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.750
 securities 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.169
 at 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.980
 apple store banne 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.070
 so here we have the cathedral knows 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.870
 more how it's called started to 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.490
 to be built in the thirteenth century renovated at 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.080
 So here is the period 1830 pss 1830 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.200
 great return of the catholic church well 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.210
 venerates immaculate conception that is put 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.520
 in place in 18 Marian centers that's it 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:53.680
 more than the virgin return of the virgin 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:56.080
 and so, well, they made us old 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.310
 to reverse this technique on the 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.640
 rosette so I do not really know where they have 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.640
 cracked 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.770
 at 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:24.090
 is that Edward is the ones who play 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.669
 and just before on this amiens damage 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:33.379
 then tactical analyzes like that to 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:33.379
 hot is the big war 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.689
 it was okay it was cool rise 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.050
 personally I was embarked 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.879
 I was totally embarked on a 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.949
 group that I did not know and that was 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.210
 I was really keen yesterday and so suddenly 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:02.870
 I come back today to pour in 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.870
 the jack daniels
