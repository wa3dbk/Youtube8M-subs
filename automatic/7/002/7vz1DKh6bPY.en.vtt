00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.780 
the water table was to where the pond is
and<00:01:54.409> it<00:01:55.409> looks<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.430> from

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and it looks like it's about even from

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.249 
and it looks like it's about even from
here<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> thought<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.450> were<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.659> eight<00:01:57.990> feet

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
here I thought we were about eight feet

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.410 
here I thought we were about eight feet
but<00:01:59.100> we're<00:01:59.250> apparently<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> over<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> little

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
but we're apparently just over a little

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.270 
but we're apparently just over a little
a<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.719> over<00:02:01.020> five<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.009> where<00:02:02.159> we're

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a little over five up here where we're

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
a little over five up here where we're
walking<00:02:02.640> we're<00:02:03.240> gonna<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.509> using<00:02:03.780> those

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
walking we're gonna be using those

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.469 
walking we're gonna be using those
telephone<00:02:04.380> poles<00:02:04.969> for<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> front<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.420> back

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
telephone poles for the front and back

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.559 
telephone poles for the front and back
of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.140> wall<00:02:07.350> apini<00:02:07.710> right<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.069> ground

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
of the wall apini right on the ground

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.080 
of the wall apini right on the ground
right<00:02:09.569> where<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.750> trench<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
right where that trench is

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.640 
right where that trench is
actually<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.140> little<00:02:12.170> bit<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.620> left

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
actually just a little bit to the left

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.009 
actually just a little bit to the left
right<00:02:13.040> about<00:02:13.220> here<00:02:13.489> we're<00:02:14.360> gonna<00:02:14.450> be<00:02:14.690> putting

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
right about here we're gonna be putting

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.390 
right about here we're gonna be putting
those<00:02:15.140> all<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.410> way<00:02:15.470> across<00:02:15.739> those<00:02:16.190> are<00:02:16.310> going

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
those all the way across those are going

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.280 
those all the way across those are going
to<00:02:16.459> support<00:02:16.730> all<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.300> glazing<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:18.110> up

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
to support all the glazing going up

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.920 
to support all the glazing going up
right<00:02:19.220> here<00:02:19.459> at<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.640> 58<00:02:20.060> degree<00:02:20.330> angle<00:02:20.720> because

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
right here at a 58 degree angle because

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.860 
right here at a 58 degree angle because
we're<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.230> Boise<00:02:21.560> Idaho<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:22.569> those<00:02:23.569> things

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
we're in Boise Idaho and those things

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.360 
we're in Boise Idaho and those things
are<00:02:24.050> extremely<00:02:24.260> heavy<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.860> think<00:02:24.950> they're

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
are extremely heavy I think they're

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.940 
are extremely heavy I think they're
probably<00:02:25.610> 250<00:02:26.420> pounds<00:02:26.900> apiece<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.500> those<00:02:27.620> big

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
probably 250 pounds apiece for those big

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.199 
probably 250 pounds apiece for those big
pieces<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.340> glass<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.030> back

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
pieces of glass and then on the back

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.490 
pieces of glass and then on the back
we're<00:02:32.450> gonna<00:02:32.510> put<00:02:32.629> one<00:02:32.930> that'll<00:02:33.260> be<00:02:33.349> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
we're gonna put one that'll be the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.800 
we're gonna put one that'll be the
support<00:02:34.150> tomorrow<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.269> kind<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> big<00:02:35.660> day

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
support tomorrow it's kind of a big day

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.680 
support tomorrow it's kind of a big day
we're<00:02:35.989> gonna<00:02:36.049> put<00:02:36.349> in<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.590> sump<00:02:37.400> tank<00:02:37.690> we're

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
we're gonna put in the sump tank we're

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.110 
we're gonna put in the sump tank we're
gonna<00:02:38.750> put<00:02:39.019> in<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.230> drain<00:02:39.500> tile<00:02:40.000> we're<00:02:41.000> gonna

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
gonna put in the drain tile we're gonna

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.610 
gonna put in the drain tile we're gonna
wrap<00:02:41.360> them<00:02:41.480> with<00:02:41.540> fabric<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.290> we<00:02:42.470> don't

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
wrap them with fabric so that we don't

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.990 
wrap them with fabric so that we don't
get<00:02:42.709> any<00:02:42.860> dirt<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.220> there<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.579> it'll<00:02:43.700> just

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
get any dirt in there and it'll just

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.900 
get any dirt in there and it'll just
take<00:02:44.150> water<00:02:44.390> out<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:45.579> initially<00:02:46.579> we're<00:02:46.730> just

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
take water out and initially we're just

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.039 
take water out and initially we're just
going<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.060> pump<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.360> water<00:02:47.390> out<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.780> it'll

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
going to pump the water out and it'll

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.479 
going to pump the water out and it'll
probably<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.380> go<00:02:48.620> back<00:02:48.799> there<00:02:49.040> toward<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
probably just go back there toward the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.450 
probably just go back there toward the
creek
