we'll<00:05:29.120> pour<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.449> little<00:05:29.750> bit<00:05:29.990> of<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.229> into

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
we'll pour a little bit of that into

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.529 
we'll pour a little bit of that into
each<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:31.039> our<00:05:31.129> cups<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.699> we<00:05:31.819> can<00:05:31.969> top<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.419> up

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
each of our cups and we can top it up

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.540

with more hot water and that's just a

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.409 
with more hot water and that's just a
safer<00:05:35.000> way<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.389> go<00:05:35.569> about<00:05:35.780> doing<00:05:35.930> this<00:05:36.729> okay
