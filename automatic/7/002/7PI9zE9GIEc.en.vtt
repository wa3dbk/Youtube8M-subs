00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
moisturize so I used to always

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.450 
moisturize so I used to always
moisturize<00:00:57.030> even<00:00:57.510> when<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> was<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> teenager

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
moisturize even when I was a teenager

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
moisturize even when I was a teenager
but<00:00:59.460> another<00:01:00.149> thing<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> learned<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.140> do

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
but another thing that I learned to do

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.280 
but another thing that I learned to do
over<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.770> years<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.640> exfoliate<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.019> lot

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
over the years is to exfoliate and a lot

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.800 
over the years is to exfoliate and a lot
of<00:01:04.320> women<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.920> never<00:01:05.309> exploited<00:01:06.150> their<00:01:06.450> skin

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of women have never exploited their skin

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
of women have never exploited their skin
and<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.860> reason<00:01:08.159> why<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.790> important<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and the reason why it's so important is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.670 
and the reason why it's so important is
because<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:10.350> skin<00:01:11.119> has<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.450> dead<00:01:12.780> cells<00:01:13.260> on

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
because your skin has like dead cells on

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.600 
because your skin has like dead cells on
it<00:01:14.100> every<00:01:15.030> day<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.270> shed<00:01:15.990> skin<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it every day you shed skin just like you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
it every day you shed skin just like you
drop<00:01:17.909> hair<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.600> head<00:01:18.630> every<00:01:19.439> day<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
drop hair of your head every day you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.810 
drop hair of your head every day you
shed<00:01:20.130> skin<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:22.229> mean<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.710> skin<00:01:23.040> cells<00:01:23.460> die

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.330 
shed skin and I mean your skin cells die
on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> top<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:25.049> skin<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.220> know

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
on the top of your skin because you know

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.950 
on the top of your skin because you know
you<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.790> nine<00:01:27.000> layers<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.750> skin<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
you have like nine layers of skin and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.580 
you have like nine layers of skin and
that<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:31.200> cells<00:01:31.500> die<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.600> face<00:01:33.840> but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that your cells die on on your face but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
that your cells die on on your face but
you<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.189> women<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.119> can

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you don't see that women you can you can

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.149 
you don't see that women you can you can
see<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> sense<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.590> face<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
see it in the sense that your face you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.840 
see it in the sense that your face you
know<00:01:38.280> maybe<00:01:38.670> looking<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:39.930> glowy<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
know maybe looking not so glowy and you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.210 
know maybe looking not so glowy and you
know<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.180> dry<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.860> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> thing

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
know really dry and that kind of thing

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
know really dry and that kind of thing
and<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> reason<00:01:44.880> why<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.990> don't

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and the reason why is because you don't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.760 
and the reason why is because you don't
exfoliate<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:48.390> exfoliating<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.470> is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
exfoliate so what exfoliating is is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.310 
exfoliate so what exfoliating is is
you're<00:01:50.189> taking<00:01:50.729> off<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:50.970> dead<00:01:51.780> layer<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
you're taking off that dead layer of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.270 
you're taking off that dead layer of
skin<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.700> good<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.299> exfoliate<00:01:55.040> at<00:01:56.040> least

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
skin and it's good to exfoliate at least

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
skin and it's good to exfoliate at least
once<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> week<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.090> wouldn't<00:01:57.420> recommend<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
once a week out I wouldn't recommend you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.330 
once a week out I wouldn't recommend you
do<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> every<00:01:58.320> day<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:58.979> not<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
do it every day because it's not good to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.370 
do it every day because it's not good to
do<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> every<00:01:59.820> day<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.600> doing<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.020> once<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.350> week

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
do it every day but doing it once a week

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.139 
do it every day but doing it once a week
is<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:02.040> good<00:02:02.310> thing<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:02.759> you

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
is really a good thing because you

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.420 
is really a good thing because you
really<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> difference<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.770> your<00:02:05.369> skin

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
really see the difference in your skin

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.069 
really see the difference in your skin
if<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> exfoliate<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> tell

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
if you exfoliate now I'm going to tell

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.199 
if you exfoliate now I'm going to tell
you<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> different

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
you that there are a lot of different

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.800 
you that there are a lot of different
exfoliants<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.360> there<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.360> well

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
exfoliants out there I like that well

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
exfoliants out there I like that well
the<00:02:12.900> one<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> used<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.500> use

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the one I used to use

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.570 
the one I used to use
this<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.490> used<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.570> use<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.890> st.<00:02:17.220> Yves

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
this one I used to use this the st. Yves

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.710 
this one I used to use this the st. Yves
apricot<00:02:18.390> scrub<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.330> as

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
apricot scrub and I like it it's not as

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.760 
apricot scrub and I like it it's not as
some<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.470> particular<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.460> think<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:24.770> yeah

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
some this particular one I think is yeah

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.290 
some this particular one I think is yeah
this<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.190> regular<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:27.000> none<00:02:27.180> they

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
this is the regular one that's none they

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.120 
this is the regular one that's none they
have<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.660> that's<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.080> sensitive<00:02:28.530> skin<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.100> I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
have one that's for sensitive skin but I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.980 
have one that's for sensitive skin but I
think<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> regular<00:02:29.910> one<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.960> like

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
think this is the regular one and I like

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.110 
think this is the regular one and I like
it<00:02:31.560> because<00:02:31.710> it's<00:02:32.040> got<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> little<00:02:32.490> granules

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
it because it's got the little granules

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.630 
it because it's got the little granules
and<00:02:33.770> that's<00:02:34.770> what<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.070> watch<00:02:35.250> what<00:02:35.520> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
and that's what you watch what the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.130 
and that's what you watch what the
little<00:02:35.820> granules<00:02:36.270> because<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.960> can

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
little granules because then you can

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.650 
little granules because then you can
feel<00:02:37.460> that<00:02:38.460> it's<00:02:38.520> actually<00:02:38.940> working<00:02:39.390> it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
feel that it's actually working it's

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.250 
feel that it's actually working it's
almost<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.140> little<00:02:40.700> particles<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.790> sand<00:02:42.260> and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
almost like little particles of sand and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.170 
almost like little particles of sand and
I<00:02:43.560> used<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.890> use<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.850> mean<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.120> still

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
I used to use this one I mean I still

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.570 
I used to use this one I mean I still
have<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.570> because<00:02:46.050> i<00:02:46.260> bought<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.100> little

have it because i bought this a little

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.270 
have it because i bought this a little
while<00:02:47.730> ago<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:48.240> it's<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.680> bit<00:02:49.860> more

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
while ago but it's a little bit more

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.699 
while ago but it's a little bit more
expensive<00:02:50.910> than<00:02:51.600> another<00:02:51.990> brand<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.650> i

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
expensive than another brand that i

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.480 
expensive than another brand that i
found<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.220> i<00:02:53.340> actually<00:02:53.550> like<00:02:53.940> better<00:02:55.490> this

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
found that i actually like better this

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.690 
found that i actually like better this
one<00:02:56.820> looks<00:02:57.240> almost<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:58.110> like<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:58.860> but

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
one looks almost just like this one but

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.780 
one looks almost just like this one but
this<00:03:00.000> one<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.720> walgreens<00:03:01.320> brand<00:03:02.010> apricot

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
this one is walgreens brand apricot

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.230 
this one is walgreens brand apricot
scrub<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.709> it's<00:03:04.709> actually<00:03:05.010> probably<00:03:05.790> half

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
scrub and it's actually probably half

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.600 
scrub and it's actually probably half
the<00:03:06.270> price<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.690> st.<00:03:07.260> Yves<00:03:07.470> probably<00:03:08.220> about<00:03:08.310> 4

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the price of st. Yves probably about 4

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.530 
the price of st. Yves probably about 4
bucks<00:03:08.760> or<00:03:09.000> something<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.450> think

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
bucks or something like that I think

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.360 
bucks or something like that I think
this<00:03:09.810> one's<00:03:10.020> like<00:03:10.170> 719<00:03:10.890> out<00:03:11.040> or<00:03:11.130> something

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
this one's like 719 out or something

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.040 
this one's like 719 out or something
like<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.150> mean<00:03:12.360> either<00:03:12.600> way<00:03:12.750> those

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
like that but I mean either way those

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.050 
like that but I mean either way those
those<00:03:13.440> aren't<00:03:13.709> expensive<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.370> mean<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
those aren't expensive but I mean the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.640 
those aren't expensive but I mean the
cheaper<00:03:15.420> one<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.020> works<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.500> might

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
cheaper one that really works you might

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.949 
cheaper one that really works you might
as<00:03:16.770> well<00:03:16.890> get<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.420> one<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.690> I

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
as well get it I like this one because I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.140 
as well get it I like this one because I
can<00:03:19.140> actually<00:03:19.350> feel<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.890> granules<00:03:20.760> better

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
can actually feel the granules better

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.449
