00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
like that now this the thing about this

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
like that now this the thing about this
is<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.519> see<00:00:26.789> people<00:00:27.000> who<00:00:27.539> are<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:27.900> good

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
is when I see people who are really good

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
is when I see people who are really good
at<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.470> Christian<00:00:28.949> he<00:00:29.730> doesn't<00:00:30.029> like

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
at this like Christian he doesn't like

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.530 
at this like Christian he doesn't like
go<00:00:30.420> down<00:00:31.160> he<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.940> does<00:00:33.239> an

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
go down he like actually like does an

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.350 
go down he like actually like does an
actual<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.170> flick<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> kickflip<00:00:35.579> which

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
actual like flick like a kickflip which

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.700 
actual like flick like a kickflip which
is<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.200> beyond<00:00:38.160> my<00:00:38.640> realm<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.239> understanding

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
is so beyond my realm of understanding

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.030 
is so beyond my realm of understanding
it's<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.829> even<00:00:41.040> funny<00:00:42.680> probably<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it's not even funny probably going to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.619 
it's not even funny probably going to
end<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.460> flicking<00:00:44.700> down<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.270> because

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
end up just flicking down just because

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.830 
end up just flicking down just because
that's<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> only<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
that's the only way I can think with it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.299 
that's the only way I can think with it
the<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.500> flip<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> down<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.280> just

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the thing is like I flip it down it just

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.650 
the thing is like I flip it down it just
goes<00:00:50.579> straight<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> ground<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.480> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
goes straight to the ground and then I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.029 
goes straight to the ground and then I
go<00:00:51.899> away<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:53.960> Jen<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.110> never<00:00:55.469> learned<00:00:55.800> late

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
go away from it Jen I never learned late

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.700 
go away from it Jen I never learned late
flips<00:00:56.280> never<00:00:56.550> ever<00:00:56.789> I<00:01:00.170> feel<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.530> was

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
flips never ever I feel like that was

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.319 
flips never ever I feel like that was
really<00:01:01.739> close<00:01:02.219> even<00:01:02.579> though<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> didn't<00:01:03.030> hit<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
really close even though I didn't hit it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.550 
really close even though I didn't hit it
at<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:04.820> I<00:01:08.180> think<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.390> figured<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.409> what

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
at all I think I figured it out is what

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
at all I think I figured it out is what
I<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.710> trying<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.100> before<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I was trying to do before it's kind of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
I was trying to do before it's kind of
like<00:01:12.479> take<00:01:12.720> my<00:01:12.930> front<00:01:13.200> foot<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.310> go

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
like take my front foot off and then go

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820 
like take my front foot off and then go
like<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.650> it's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
like that but it's not like that it's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.670 
like that but it's not like that it's
like<00:01:16.950> your<00:01:17.430> back<00:01:17.640> foot<00:01:17.939> scrapes<00:01:18.930> back<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.470> hard

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
like your back foot scrapes back so hard

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950 
like your back foot scrapes back so hard
that<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> board<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.180> back<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that the board is going back and you

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.230 
that the board is going back and you
leave<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.350> front<00:01:22.530> foot<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.369> as

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
leave your front foot on there and as

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
leave your front foot on there and as
the<00:01:24.540> board<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.439> come<00:01:25.619> forward

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the board is going back you come forward

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.679 
the board is going back you come forward
so<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.310> front<00:01:26.490> foot<00:01:26.700> doesn't<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.450> come

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
so your front foot doesn't really come

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:39.319 
so your front foot doesn't really come
off<00:01:27.869> oh<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.070> no<00:01:38.250> idea<00:01:38.610> how<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> how<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
maybe if I do some regular kick flips it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.610 
maybe if I do some regular kick flips it
will<00:01:46.470> help
