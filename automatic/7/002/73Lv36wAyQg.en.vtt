00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
be hurting and the pain would wake me up
and<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.270> squirt<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.079> in

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and I just squirt a little bit more in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.700 
and I just squirt a little bit more in
there<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.220> back<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> sleep

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
there and go right back to sleep

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.399 
there and go right back to sleep
so<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.110> kind
