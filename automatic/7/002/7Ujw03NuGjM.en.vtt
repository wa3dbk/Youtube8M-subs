00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.529
 we are going to do battles it is me against the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.360
 other interns here on the editorial board and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.330
 let's start right away with my first 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.990

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.570

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.890
 happen I am beans I also crate beer 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.570
 is it at stake 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.119
 and now I think I work 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.779
 actually now to the family channel 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.779
 had a big one 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.809
 of challenging and of course you will 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.269
 show if you can beat it 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.860
 that is absolutely true because it is like me 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.880
 if I also lose it then sit 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.670
 you in the final 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.509

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.979
 channel 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.720
 I think if you two are against it 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.180
 each other that can be interesting though 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.840

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.759
 nice pass from whitish 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.330
 yet more pokemons can turn it 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.709
 defendant so that does well 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.810
 between biker david and psychÃ© giulia me 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.940
 I'm fucking curious how they are both 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.680
 real pokÃ©mon trainers who really like me 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.940
 have helped 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.940
 and I'm curious if he's out 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.290
 No 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.569
 beautiful 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.629
 sorry but it was not always fun 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.700
 what for you from the ice cream I found app-pick 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.349
 it was a bit of a bite battle anyway 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.079
 that I banished you at home 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.299
 exciting yes also really edge board bit 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.459
 so it still got exciting and went on 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.680
 think the game is played anyway 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.169
 but ultimately still one 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.940
 bit exciting but yes david 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.870

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.039
