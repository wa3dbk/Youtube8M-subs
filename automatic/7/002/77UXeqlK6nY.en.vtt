hi I'm Costa Mesa R&amp;D well today we have

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.400 
hi I'm Costa Mesa R&amp;D well today we have
a<00:00:10.950> little<00:00:11.099> Mercedes<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.820> spindle<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.900> our<00:00:13.139> Vice

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
a little Mercedes a spindle on our Vice

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.709 
a little Mercedes a spindle on our Vice
here<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> get<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> bushings<00:00:15.570> out

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
here and we have to get the bushings out

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.300 
here and we have to get the bushings out
so<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.109> put<00:00:16.289> some<00:00:16.320> new<00:00:16.560> ones<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.859> put<00:00:17.130> some

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
so we can put some new ones in put some

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.540 
so we can put some new ones in put some
new<00:00:17.400> kingpins<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.650> this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.949> bushing<00:00:20.400> we

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
new kingpins and this is the bushing we

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.490 
new kingpins and this is the bushing we
allowed<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> other<00:00:21.060> end<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.260> kind<00:00:22.439> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
allowed the other end this is kind of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
allowed the other end this is kind of
interesting<00:00:22.920> because<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.490> bushing<00:00:23.820> goes<00:00:23.970> in

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
interesting because the bushing goes in

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
interesting because the bushing goes in
but<00:00:24.660> there's<00:00:24.869> no<00:00:25.019> way<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.170> push<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
but there's no way to push it all the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.490 
but there's no way to push it all the
way<00:00:26.039> through<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:32.690> tap<00:00:33.690> into<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.200> bushing

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
way through the tap into this bushing

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.990 
way through the tap into this bushing
and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.100> knock<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.579> from<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> other

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and then knock it out from the other

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.020 
and then knock it out from the other
side<00:00:39.890> I'm<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> start<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.399> using<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.790> tap

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
side I'm going to start by using a tap

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.180 
side I'm going to start by using a tap
to<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.719> put<00:00:43.469> some<00:00:43.500> threads<00:00:43.950> in

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
to go in here and put some threads in

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
to go in here and put some threads in
the<00:00:44.340> bushing

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:10.639

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:36.160 

we<00:01:11.280> learn<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.759> three<00:01:12.570> quarters<00:01:12.899> of<00:01:13.049> an<00:01:13.140> inch

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:57.139 

we'll<00:01:37.170> take<00:01:37.349> a<00:01:37.409> brass<00:01:37.740> drip<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.819> there<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
we'll take a brass drip and there you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.169 
we'll take a brass drip and there you
have<00:01:57.209> it<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.739> have<00:01:58.739> it<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.189> put<00:01:59.399> new<00:01:59.640> bushings<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
have it I have it is put new bushings in

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.039 
have it I have it is put new bushings in
which<00:02:00.390> would<00:02:00.539> be<00:02:00.629> easy

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
which would be easy

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.940 
which would be easy
and<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:02.069> we<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.459> pin<00:02:02.729> them<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:04.140> I'm<00:02:04.379> as<00:02:04.709> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and then we have to pin them so I'm as I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.369 
and then we have to pin them so I'm as I
get<00:02:05.159> two<00:02:05.280> bushings<00:02:05.549> out<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.909> Mercedes<00:02:06.539> front

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:07.379 
get two bushings out of Mercedes front

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:13.370 
get two bushings out of Mercedes front
