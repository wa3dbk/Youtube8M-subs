strongly recommend that the seam needs

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.090 
strongly recommend that the seam needs
to<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.539> regenerated<00:00:58.230> properly<00:00:58.680> back<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.010> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
where the leak is so let's just make out

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
where the leak is so let's just make out
them<00:01:11.640> we're<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> put<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> leak<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.229> this

them we're going to put a leak in this
area<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> stitches<00:01:16.500> are

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
area here and it's the the stitches are

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
area here and it's the the stitches are
the<00:01:16.770> punch<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> tape<00:01:17.520> or<00:01:17.790> there's<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.659> dirt

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the punch of the tape or there's a dirt

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.109 
the punch of the tape or there's a dirt
under<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> tape<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.580> there's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.850> leak<00:01:21.090> in

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
under the tape but there's a leak in

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
under the tape but there's a leak in
this<00:01:21.390> area<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.409> need<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> replace

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this area here so we need to replace

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
this area here so we need to replace
this<00:01:23.220> piece<00:01:23.750> here<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.430> here<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.750> can

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this piece here and here so we can

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
this piece here and here so we can
actually<00:01:28.229> regenerate<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.460> need

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
actually regenerate that so what we need

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.749 
actually regenerate that so what we need
to<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:31.020> balance<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> actual<00:01:32.189> material

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
to do is balance out the actual material

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
to do is balance out the actual material
and<00:01:33.150> we're<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.450> focus<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.170> piece

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and we're going to focus on this piece

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.460 
and we're going to focus on this piece
and<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.770> piece<00:01:34.829> only<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> third<00:01:37.229> pair

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and that piece only we have a third pair

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.899 
and that piece only we have a third pair
of<00:01:37.560> scissors<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.340> actually<00:01:38.460> cut<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
of scissors so we can actually cut the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
of scissors so we can actually cut the
tape<00:01:39.150> again<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.439> actually<00:01:40.770> regenerate

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
tape again you can actually regenerate

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.639 
tape again you can actually regenerate
it<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> hot<00:01:41.970> air<00:01:42.150> paint<00:01:42.479> machine<00:01:42.869> ie<00:01:43.350> your

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it with a hot air paint machine ie your

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.730 
it with a hot air paint machine ie your
blower<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.840> an<00:01:45.990> iron<00:01:46.380> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
blower or you can do it with an iron but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.340 
blower or you can do it with an iron but
an<00:01:46.890> iron<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:48.090> careful<00:01:48.960> with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
an iron you need to be more careful with

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.840 
an iron you need to be more careful with
because<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.890> actually<00:01:50.040> scorch<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
because you can actually scorch the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.960 
because you can actually scorch the
liner<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.710> preferably<00:01:52.710> try<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> hot

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
liner so preferably try and get a hot

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.690 
liner so preferably try and get a hot
gun<00:01:54.210> paint<00:01:54.930> stripper<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.979> got<00:01:56.219> more<00:01:56.460> control

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
gun paint stripper it's got more control

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.649 
gun paint stripper it's got more control
so<00:01:57.829> gently<00:01:58.829> start<00:01:59.250> off<00:01:59.490> by<00:01:59.759> heating<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.299> area

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so gently start off by heating the area

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.039 
so gently start off by heating the area
that<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> want<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> take<00:02:02.280> out<00:02:02.960> you'll<00:02:03.960> see

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that you want to take out you'll see

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.789 
that you want to take out you'll see
that<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.570> tape<00:02:06.810> will<00:02:06.990> actually<00:02:07.350> start<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that the tape will actually start to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.830 
that the tape will actually start to
lift<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.709> again<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.310> emphasize<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:12.270> very<00:02:12.540> very

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
lift and again I emphasize be very very

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
lift and again I emphasize be very very
careful

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
careful

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
careful
because<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:14.820> too<00:02:14.880> hot<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:15.690> actually

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
because if we go too hot we can actually

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:28.940 
because if we go too hot we can actually
blister<00:02:16.830> what

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.070 

it<00:02:29.489> does<00:02:29.700> take<00:02:29.910> quite<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.180> lot<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.480> force<00:02:30.780> but

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
it does take quite a lot of force but

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
it does take quite a lot of force but
you<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:32.040> actually<00:02:32.220> cat<00:02:32.610> over<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you can actually cat over that now and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
you can actually cat over that now and
blister<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.739> by<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> tape<00:02:35.220> being<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.610> third

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
blister it so by the tape being a third

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.869 
blister it so by the tape being a third
fascia<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.560> actually<00:02:37.950> does<00:02:38.099> protect<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.700> blue

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
fascia it actually does protect the blue

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.699 
fascia it actually does protect the blue
tile<00:02:39.150> quite<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> lot<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.200> as<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.500> it's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
tile quite a lot so as you can see it's

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.540 
tile quite a lot so as you can see it's
starting<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.010> curl<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:42.150> enough<00:02:43.340> lift<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
starting to curl that's enough lift the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:55.790 
starting to curl that's enough lift the
edge

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:12.170 

get<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.830> bit<00:02:57.010> more<00:02:57.190> heat

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.240 

pull<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.780> back<00:03:16.370> cut<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.430> other<00:03:17.550> way<00:03:17.760> now<00:03:19.250> as

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
pull that back cut the other way now as

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.740 
pull that back cut the other way now as
you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.430> see<00:03:20.519> I've<00:03:20.730> also<00:03:20.879> damaged<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.540> patch

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
you can see I've also damaged the patch

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.190 
you can see I've also damaged the patch
so<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.080> can<00:03:22.230> actually<00:03:22.500> push<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.860> back<00:03:24.200> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
so I can actually push that back and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.630 
so I can actually push that back and
seal<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.590> back<00:03:25.739> down<00:03:25.980> there<00:03:26.190> now<00:03:26.310> I've<00:03:26.430> got

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
seal that back down there now I've got

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.240 
seal that back down there now I've got
to<00:03:26.879> bare<00:03:27.090> edges<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.799> just<00:03:28.830> need<00:03:29.099> to

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
to bare edges here so I just need to

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.339 
to bare edges here so I just need to
roller<00:03:29.580> them<00:03:29.879> in<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.720> make<00:03:30.870> sure<00:03:31.049> they<00:03:31.200> got

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
roller them in to make sure they got

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.229 
roller them in to make sure they got
good<00:03:31.830> adhesion<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.549> as<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.760> see<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> leak

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
good adhesion so as you can see the leak

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.550 
good adhesion so as you can see the leak
was<00:03:36.450> here<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.530> if<00:03:37.799> we<00:03:38.599> take<00:03:39.599> that<00:03:39.780> tape<00:03:40.110> we<00:03:40.379> know

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
was here so if we take that tape we know

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.180 
was here so if we take that tape we know
it's<00:03:40.769> in<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.040> middle<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.340> there<00:03:42.920> what<00:03:43.920> we<00:03:44.010> need

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
it's in the middle of there what we need

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.680 
it's in the middle of there what we need
to<00:03:44.280> do<00:03:44.430> now<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.819> go<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.060> get<00:03:45.180> another<00:03:45.299> piece<00:03:45.630> of

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
to do now is go and get another piece of

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.039 
to do now is go and get another piece of
tape<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.370> size<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.480> called<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> hot-melt

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
tape and size it it's called a hot-melt

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:57.440 
tape and size it it's called a hot-melt
tape<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.069> area<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.370> want<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.610> cover<00:03:56.450> don't

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
tape to the area you want to cover don't

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.000 
tape to the area you want to cover don't
we<00:03:57.629> find<00:03:57.870> them<00:03:58.049> over<00:03:59.420> exaggerating<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:04.010> layer

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
we find them over exaggerating it layer

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:15.590 
we find them over exaggerating it layer
that<00:04:05.220> down

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.060 

roller

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.040 

and<00:04:24.580> that's<00:04:24.760> allowed<00:04:25.090> me<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.450> recover<00:04:25.750> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
and that's allowed me to recover the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.340 
and that's allowed me to recover the
scene<00:04:26.610> what<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.730> can<00:04:28.000> do<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.450> overlap<00:04:29.080> it<00:04:29.260> a

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
scene what you can do is overlap it a

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.170 
scene what you can do is overlap it a
bit<00:04:29.500> more<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:29.980> today<00:04:30.250> I've<00:04:30.550> not<00:04:30.760> done<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.000> all

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
bit more on today I've not done it all

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.300 
bit more on today I've not done it all
previously<00:04:31.630> wants<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.930> show<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.200> that<00:04:33.190> you

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
can actually but it tight but I normally

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.410 
can actually but it tight but I normally
go<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.830> quarter<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.340> half<00:04:36.370> an<00:04:36.730> inch<00:04:36.790> over<00:04:37.060> either

go a quarter to half an inch over either
end<00:04:37.660> as<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.530> will<00:04:38.680> adhere<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:39.160> itself<00:04:39.490> but<00:04:39.790> I'm

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
end as it will adhere to itself but I'm

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.840 
end as it will adhere to itself but I'm
trying<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.660> demonstrate<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.850> you

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
can get right between the seam and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.640 
can get right between the seam and
budget<00:04:45.580> if<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.790> want<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.290> as<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.530> see

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
make sure you've covered the area again

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.690 
make sure you've covered the area again
that<00:05:02.200> patches<00:05:02.620> aren't<00:05:02.920> the<00:05:03.010> curl<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:03.490> let's

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
that patches aren't the curl so let's

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:14.940 
that patches aren't the curl so let's
give<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.120> bit<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.450> blow

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.500 

now<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.700> should<00:05:15.910> get<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.150> out<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.300> trouble

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
now that should get you out of trouble

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
order to get back to our to our factory

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.370 
order to get back to our to our factory
what<00:05:24.970> we<00:05:25.120> will<00:05:25.330> do<00:05:25.450> then<00:05:25.480> is<00:05:25.810> we'll<00:05:25.960> take<00:05:26.230> that

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
what we will do then is we'll take that

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.890 
what we will do then is we'll take that
scene<00:05:26.710> take<00:05:26.950> completely<00:05:27.700> off<00:05:27.850> through<00:05:28.750> that

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
scene take completely off through that

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.230 
scene take completely off through that
full<00:05:29.110> runner<00:05:29.350> scene<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:29.920> then<00:05:30.460> we'll<00:05:30.700> retake

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
full runner scene and then we'll retake

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.750 
full runner scene and then we'll retake
the<00:05:31.480> whole<00:05:31.690> area<00:05:32.080> as<00:05:32.140> a<00:05:32.170> complete<00:05:32.680> run<00:05:32.890> tape<00:05:33.130> so

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
the whole area as a complete run tape so

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.340 
the whole area as a complete run tape so
you<00:05:33.790> don't<00:05:34.000> have<00:05:34.090> no<00:05:34.300> joins<00:05:34.600> or<00:05:34.810> any<00:05:34.930> areas

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
you don't have no joins or any areas

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.440 
you don't have no joins or any areas
where<00:05:35.560> it<00:05:35.680> could<00:05:35.920> possibly<00:05:36.130> leave<00:05:36.610> so<00:05:37.300> by

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
where it could possibly leave so by

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.240 
where it could possibly leave so by
doing<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.840> that<00:05:37.960> way<00:05:38.020> it<00:05:38.380> comes<00:05:38.590> back<00:05:38.860> into<00:05:39.070> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
doing it that way it comes back into the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.280 
doing it that way it comes back into the
factory<00:05:39.610> let's<00:05:40.300> put<00:05:40.480> on<00:05:40.600> to<00:05:40.810> what<00:05:40.990> they<00:05:41.110> call

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
factory let's put on to what they call

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.860 
factory let's put on to what they call
the<00:05:41.380> hot<00:05:41.560> melt<00:05:41.800> machine<00:05:42.670> which<00:05:42.880> gives<00:05:43.660> it<00:05:43.780> even

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
the hot melt machine which gives it even

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.300 
the hot melt machine which gives it even
pressure<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:44.560> even<00:05:44.620> heat<00:05:44.980> all<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.190> way

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
pressure and even heat all the way

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.800 
pressure and even heat all the way
through<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.700> scene<00:05:45.880> so<00:05:46.060> we<00:05:46.210> can<00:05:46.420> regenerate

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
through the scene so we can regenerate

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.890 
through the scene so we can regenerate
