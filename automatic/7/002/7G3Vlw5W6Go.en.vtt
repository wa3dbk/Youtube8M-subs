00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello, how are you? I am the cooker and 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.550
 I want you to remember that this channel 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.530
 It is also yours and you can 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.599
 suggest step by step or techniques that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.519
 want to learn is the case of catherine 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.500
 peng the one who asked me who wanted to know a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.600
 little more of the caviar technique and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 velvet today we are going to do it but 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.980
 I want to warn you one thing and this is a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.230
 a fantasy technique so it's not going to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.180
 have a lot of durability then you 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.769
 can use it 12 days for an event 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.019
 special and ready 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.809
 you in a cold gel or it can be about 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.540
 use a shine or the same enamel not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.030
 use a glue because if you are not going to have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.190
 a little problem ready so we're going to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.170
 understand 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.399
 very well the materials that we will use 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.489
 to change that hair tweezers one 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.920
 brush and even apply with gel 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.650
 cold hopefully but if they do not have can be 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.040
 with any brightness 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.990
 apply caviar in this way and with 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.120
 a skewer will remove the excesses 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.100
 play a little glass down to pick up from 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.970
 new and can use the tips 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.130
 that are going to give 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.840
 the same thing we're going to do with the velvet 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.720
 but that will help me from a thorn 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.570
 it was like with the clamp the velvet and 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.360
 I put large groups and thick tube 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.820
 imposing until completing my 1 now 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.110
 I'm going to give it a little touch and with a 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.350
 dry skewer I will clean around and 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.810
 I put a pressure on the TV it seems 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.910
 feel a little more now I'm going to make a 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.770
 design with the caviar will help us 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.620
 its function I do to collect each 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.860
 nugget I apply look for the shine on 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.350
 everything to the base of my nail and start to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.470
 reconnect each one I will put the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.480
 nuggets where I want 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640
 I will also make a design with the 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.660
 active velvet with a brush and the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 xerez I will make a heart I put the group that 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.150
 I told them and when a broach I go to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.190
 clean so that only the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.220

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.850
