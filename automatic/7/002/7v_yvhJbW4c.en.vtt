00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
that the area is too exaggerated and

here are some superheroes so let's take
a<00:00:56.489> look<00:00:56.960> at<00:00:58.010> creating<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.039> interior

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
a look at creating the interior

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.080 
a look at creating the interior
musculature<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.960> type<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.350> character

musculature of this type of a character

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.979 
musculature of this type of a character
and<00:01:03.090> we'll<00:01:03.180> start<00:01:03.420> off<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.719> basic

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and we'll start off with a basic

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.590 
and we'll start off with a basic
construction<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.970> we'd<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> start

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
construction so that we'd have to start

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.590 
construction so that we'd have to start
just<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.320> scratch<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> take<00:01:07.979> too<00:01:08.520> long<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
just from scratch and take too long here

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.940 
just from scratch and take too long here
is<00:01:09.840> let's<00:01:10.140> show<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> where<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> parts<00:01:10.830> are

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
is let's show you where the parts are

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.640 
is let's show you where the parts are
this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> ribcage<00:01:11.990> then<00:01:12.990> look<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.260> look

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
this is the ribcage then look what look

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
this is the ribcage then look what look
what's<00:01:13.860> happening<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> ribcage<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
what's happening the ribcage actually is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
what's happening the ribcage actually is
high<00:01:15.479> enough<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.439> neck<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
high enough to go into the neck or the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
high enough to go into the neck or the
neck<00:01:17.159> actually<00:01:17.549> invades<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> ribcage<00:01:18.119> most

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
neck actually invades the ribcage most

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450 
neck actually invades the ribcage most
people<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> ribcage<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.920> below<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> but

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
people think the ribcage is below it but

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.910 
people think the ribcage is below it but
it<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.909> these<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.960> trapezius

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it is not these are the trapezius

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.020 
it is not these are the trapezius
muscles<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:24.659> come<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> wedge<00:01:26.030> right

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
muscles and they come in and wedge right

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.690 
muscles and they come in and wedge right
here<00:01:27.360> between<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.320> front<00:01:28.740> deltoid<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
here between the front deltoid and the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
here between the front deltoid and the
rear<00:01:29.939> deltoid<00:01:30.450> deltoids<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.140> shoulder<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
rear deltoid deltoids a shoulder so that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.100 
rear deltoid deltoids a shoulder so that
means<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.390> has<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> overlap<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
means that this one has to overlap it

means that this one has to overlap it
and<00:01:35.329> over<00:01:36.329> here<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.320> called<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and over here is this it's called the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.890 
and over here is this it's called the
acromion<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.180> bump<00:01:39.659> at

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
acromion which is that little bump at

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.210

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
here's the edge of it but you don't see

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.850 
here's the edge of it but you don't see
it<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.700> well<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> muscle<00:01:54.860> buries

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it that well because the muscle buries

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.630 
it that well because the muscle buries
that<00:01:56.250> collarbone<00:01:58.310> now<00:01:59.310> we're<00:01:59.399> gonna<00:01:59.490> make

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that collarbone now we're gonna make

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
that collarbone now we're gonna make
these<00:01:59.790> rounded<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:00.659> he's<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.619> muscular

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
these rounded because he's so muscular

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.219 
these rounded because he's so muscular
muscular<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.969> muscles<00:02:03.270> popping<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:03.960> over

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
muscular the muscles popping out over

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.100 
muscular the muscles popping out over
the<00:02:04.320> collarbone<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> straight<00:02:06.570> down<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:07.020> be

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the collarbone so straight down would be

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.619 
the collarbone so straight down would be
like<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> ribcage<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.849> his

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
like this on the ribcage but his

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360 
like this on the ribcage but his
pectoral<00:02:10.110> muscles<00:02:10.410> are<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.800> big<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.069> he's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
pectoral muscles are so big that he's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.290 
pectoral muscles are so big that he's
going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> actually<00:02:11.819> overlap<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
going to actually overlap that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.360 
going to actually overlap that
so<00:02:13.690> we're<00:02:13.780> gonna<00:02:13.870> draw<00:02:14.260> my<00:02:14.470> curve<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.130> way

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
so we're gonna draw my curve this way

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.260 
so we're gonna draw my curve this way
and<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.570> chest<00:02:17.380> muscles<00:02:17.860> angled<00:02:18.610> downward

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
and the chest muscles angled downward

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.650 
and the chest muscles angled downward
they're<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:19.840> square<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.680> angle<00:02:21.040> downward

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
they're not square the angle downward

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.120 
they're not square the angle downward
add<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.720> little<00:02:22.990> more<00:02:23.080> space<00:02:23.440> here<00:02:23.500> between

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
add a little more space here between

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.400 
add a little more space here between
them<00:02:24.580> define<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.600> cuz<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.140> two<00:02:26.290> different

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
them define it cuz it's two different

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.960 
them define it cuz it's two different
muscles<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.040> not<00:02:27.130> just<00:02:27.310> with<00:02:27.430> one<00:02:27.550> muscle<00:02:27.880> of

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
muscles and not just with one muscle of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.810 
muscles and not just with one muscle of
the<00:02:28.030> line<00:02:29.070> we're<00:02:30.070> gonna<00:02:30.160> go<00:02:30.310> off<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.520> ribcage

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
the line we're gonna go off the ribcage

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
the line we're gonna go off the ribcage
here<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:33.340> give<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.640> little<00:02:33.760> bit<00:02:33.910> more<00:02:34.120> muscle

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
here to give it a little bit more muscle

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.710 
here to give it a little bit more muscle
when<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.220> go<00:02:36.310> off<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.790> outline<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.480> really

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
when you go off the outline it really

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.060 
when you go off the outline it really
defines<00:02:38.110> something<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.560> really<00:02:38.620> brings<00:02:38.950> your

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
defines something it really brings your

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.610 
defines something it really brings your
attention<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.150> we're<00:02:40.930> gonna<00:02:41.050> stretch

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
attention to it and we're gonna stretch

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.510 
attention to it and we're gonna stretch
from<00:02:41.920> inside<00:02:42.460> this<00:02:42.730> shoulder<00:02:43.240> area<00:02:44.160> nice<00:02:45.160> big

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
from inside this shoulder area nice big

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.850 
from inside this shoulder area nice big
thick<00:02:45.820> muscle<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.450> stretch<00:02:46.750> inside<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.740> to

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
thick muscle to stretch inside here to

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.940 
thick muscle to stretch inside here to
create<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:49.150> part<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.410> connector

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
create this part this is the connector

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.130 
create this part this is the connector
between<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:52.030> deltoid<00:02:52.570> which<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.080> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
between the deltoid which is the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.640 
between the deltoid which is the
shoulder<00:02:53.500> muscle<00:02:53.770> again<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.430> arm<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:56.440> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
shoulder muscle again and the arm is the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.780 
shoulder muscle again and the arm is the
rear<00:02:56.830> deltoid<00:02:57.280> coming<00:02:57.610> down<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.940> way<00:02:58.180> so

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
rear deltoid coming down this way so

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.090 
rear deltoid coming down this way so
it's<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> teardrop<00:03:01.270> look<00:03:01.780> now<00:03:02.680> here's<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
it's like a teardrop look now here's the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.830 
it's like a teardrop look now here's the
bicep<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.790> we<00:03:03.970> all<00:03:04.090> know<00:03:04.240> about<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.660> that's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
bicep that we all know about so that's

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.020 
bicep that we all know about so that's
gonna<00:03:04.930> go<00:03:05.350> into<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.860> elbow<00:03:06.160> area<00:03:06.340> who<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:06.850> all

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
gonna go into the elbow area who you all

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.970 
gonna go into the elbow area who you all
are<00:03:07.330> familiar<00:03:07.480> with<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.870> bicep<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.530> here<00:03:08.890> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
are familiar with the bicep and here it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.850 
are familiar with the bicep and here it
is<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.400> big<00:03:09.820> I<00:03:10.120> want<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.290> weightlifter

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
is this big I want this is weightlifter

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.890 
is this big I want this is weightlifter
muscle<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.000> we<00:03:13.150> know<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.390> tricep<00:03:13.870> this

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
muscle and we know the tricep this

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.810 
muscle and we know the tricep this
muscle<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.500> sticks<00:03:14.800> up<00:03:14.980> here<00:03:15.310> on<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.580> back

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
muscle that sticks up here on the back

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.750 
muscle that sticks up here on the back
of<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.030> arm<00:03:16.240> kind<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.660> bunches<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:18.430> most

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
of the arm kind of bunches but most

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
of the arm kind of bunches but most
people<00:03:19.180> aren't<00:03:19.390> aware<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.200> something

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
people aren't aware this is something

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.220 
people aren't aware this is something
called<00:03:20.850> nebraska's<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.750> starts<00:03:23.050> in<00:03:23.170> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
called nebraska's and it starts in the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.430 
called nebraska's and it starts in the
back<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.800> deltoid<00:03:24.310> here<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:26.230> goes

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
back of the deltoid here and it goes

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.600 
back of the deltoid here and it goes
into<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:28.239> front<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.660> arm<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.520> it's<00:03:30.520> not

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
into the front of the arm so it's not

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.180 
into the front of the arm so it's not
just<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:31.030> bicep<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.050> tricep<00:03:32.170> there's<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.830> cut

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
just a bicep and tricep there's this cut

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.580 
just a bicep and tricep there's this cut
this<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.209> kind<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:34.540> buffer<00:03:35.020> zone<00:03:35.200> here

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
this is kind of like buffer zone here

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.120 
this is kind of like buffer zone here
and<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.610> elbow<00:03:37.350> crook<00:03:38.350> of<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.500> elbow<00:03:38.530> here

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
and the elbow crook of the elbow here

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.740 
and the elbow crook of the elbow here
this<00:03:40.000> comes<00:03:40.300> down<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:41.020> widens<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:43.239> comes<00:03:43.540> down

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
this comes down and widens it comes down

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.660 
this comes down and widens it comes down
and<00:03:44.080> widens<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.560> little<00:03:44.770> more<00:03:44.920> sharply<00:03:45.370> here

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
and widens a little more sharply here

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.280 
and widens a little more sharply here
because<00:03:45.940> there's<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.209> bone<00:03:46.510> at<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.930> interior

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
because there's a bone at the interior

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.199 
because there's a bone at the interior
of<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.650> elbow<00:03:47.920> right<00:03:48.130> here<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:49.030> that's<00:03:49.180> a

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
of the elbow right here so that's a

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.580 
of the elbow right here so that's a
little<00:03:49.390> sharper<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:51.459> then<00:03:52.260> we<00:03:53.260> bring<00:03:53.470> this

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
little sharper and then we bring this

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.820 
little sharper and then we bring this
muscle<00:03:54.400> from<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.820> back<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.420> elbow

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
muscle from the back of the elbow

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.490 
muscle from the back of the elbow
forward<00:03:57.660> like<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:58.989> give<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> little

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
forward like so you give a little

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.270 
forward like so you give a little
striation<00:04:00.070> right<00:04:00.220> here<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:01.300> here<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.690> that

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
striation right here and here is that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.320 
striation right here and here is that
deltoid<00:04:03.280> again<00:04:03.520> that<00:04:03.640> we're<00:04:03.760> defining<00:04:04.060> that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
deltoid again that we're defining that

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.380 
deltoid again that we're defining that
cap<00:04:04.660> there<00:04:05.200> called<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.470> melon<00:04:05.800> caps

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
cap there called a melon caps

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.060 
cap there called a melon caps
colloquially<00:04:07.390> we'll<00:04:08.110> bring<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.350> bicep<00:04:08.830> down

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
colloquially we'll bring that bicep down

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.650 
colloquially we'll bring that bicep down
here<00:04:10.769> crook<00:04:11.769> of<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.010> elbow<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:13.150> again<00:04:13.390> we<00:04:13.540> got

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
here crook of the elbow and again we got

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.620 
here crook of the elbow and again we got
that<00:04:13.780> little<00:04:13.900> sharper<00:04:14.709> angle<00:04:15.100> here<00:04:15.940> going

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
that little sharper angle here going

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.430 
that little sharper angle here going
into<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.019> forearm<00:04:17.650> because<00:04:17.769> here<00:04:18.580> is<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
into the forearm because here is the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.670 
into the forearm because here is the
bone<00:04:20.620> from<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.070> inner<00:04:21.489> elbow<00:04:22.229> these<00:04:23.229> muscles

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
bone from the inner elbow these muscles

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.210 
bone from the inner elbow these muscles
go<00:04:23.979> straight<00:04:24.840> from<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.200> position<00:04:26.650> on<00:04:26.860> the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
go straight from this position on the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.270 
go straight from this position on the
forearm<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:27.850> here<00:04:28.570> we<00:04:28.630> have<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:29.280> rocky

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
forearm and here we have that rocky

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.980 
forearm and here we have that rocky
Alice<00:04:30.669> again<00:04:30.789> puffing<00:04:31.419> up<00:04:31.510> on<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.690> inside<00:04:33.990> so

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
Alice again puffing up on the inside so

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.650 
Alice again puffing up on the inside so
we<00:04:35.080> bring<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.380> ribs<00:04:35.680> in<00:04:35.890> here<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:37.270> rib<00:04:37.450> kid

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
we bring the ribs in here the rib kid

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.840 
we bring the ribs in here the rib kid
goes<00:04:37.870> in<00:04:38.020> here<00:04:38.320> sort<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.770> comes<00:04:39.310> around<00:04:39.640> and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
goes in here sort of comes around and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.790 
goes in here sort of comes around and
makes<00:04:40.000> that<00:04:40.260> becomes<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:43.320> abdominal<00:04:44.320> wall

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.590 

and<00:04:47.800> we<00:04:47.979> bring<00:04:48.160> us<00:04:48.310> out<00:04:48.460> here<00:04:48.490> for<00:04:49.060> external

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
and we bring us out here for external

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.860 
and we bring us out here for external
oblique<00:04:49.990> which<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:52.270> part<00:04:52.600> everyone

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
oblique which is that that part everyone

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.690 
oblique which is that that part everyone
thinks<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.260> fat<00:04:53.530> but<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:53.919> actually<00:04:54.130> muscle

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
thinks is fat but this actually muscle

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.950 
thinks is fat but this actually muscle
it's<00:04:55.150> actually<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.510> muscle<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:57.370> here<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:57.960> notice

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
it's actually a muscle so here is notice

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.270 
it's actually a muscle so here is notice
there's<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.289> difference<00:04:59.560> between<00:04:59.650> the<00:05:00.130> rib

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
there's a difference between the rib

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.130 
there's a difference between the rib
cage<00:05:00.550> where<00:05:00.760> that<00:05:00.880> stops<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.450> back<00:05:01.600> here<00:05:01.870> this

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
cage where that stops and back here this

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.450 
cage where that stops and back here this
is<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.500> latissimus<00:05:02.979> dorsi

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
is the latissimus dorsi

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.520 
is the latissimus dorsi
this<00:05:03.700> is<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.030> back<00:05:04.240> muscle<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.229> can<00:05:05.350> see

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
this is the back muscle that you can see

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.830 
this is the back muscle that you can see
past<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:06.039> rib<00:05:06.190> cage<00:05:06.430> down<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.600> again

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
past the rib cage down and again

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.820 
past the rib cage down and again
external<00:05:08.410> oblique<00:05:08.740> here<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:10.570> hips<00:05:10.870> connect

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
external oblique here the hips connect

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.460 
external oblique here the hips connect
directly<00:05:12.220> into<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.400> here's<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.350> part<00:05:14.350> of<00:05:14.410> a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
directly into that here's the part of a

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.219 
directly into that here's the part of a
suit<00:05:14.770> here<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:16.060> now<00:05:16.390> instead<00:05:16.870> of<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.050> going

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
suit here and now instead of just going

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.020 
suit here and now instead of just going
with<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.740> straight<00:05:18.070> line<00:05:18.310> again<00:05:18.490> a<00:05:18.610> centerline

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
with a straight line again a centerline

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.480 
with a straight line again a centerline
it's<00:05:19.450> gonna<00:05:19.660> have<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.870> be<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.020> contour<00:05:20.680> lines<00:05:20.979> so

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
it's gonna have to be a contour lines so

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.990 
it's gonna have to be a contour lines so
it<00:05:22.090> goes<00:05:22.419> like<00:05:22.660> this<00:05:22.690> down<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:24.000> belly

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
it goes like this down to the belly

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.130 
it goes like this down to the belly
button<00:05:25.300> which<00:05:25.750> is<00:05:26.190> enables<00:05:27.190> halfway<00:05:28.140> between

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
button which is enables halfway between

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.830 
button which is enables halfway between
the<00:05:29.470> bottom<00:05:29.800> of<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.039> rib<00:05:30.220> cage<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:31.570> top

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
the bottom of the rib cage and the top

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.550 
the bottom of the rib cage and the top
of<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.080> hips

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
of the hips

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.040 
of the hips
now<00:05:33.430> most<00:05:33.610> people<00:05:33.700> show<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.030> 6-pack<00:05:34.750> as<00:05:34.930> they

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
now most people show a 6-pack as they

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.580 
now most people show a 6-pack as they
call<00:05:35.320> them<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:35.850> that's<00:05:36.850> basically<00:05:37.479> one<00:05:37.870> two

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
call them and that's basically one two

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.760 
call them and that's basically one two
three<00:05:39.340> muscles<00:05:40.020> there<00:05:41.020> is<00:05:41.110> actually<00:05:41.410> a<00:05:41.470> fourth

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
three muscles there is actually a fourth

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.430 
three muscles there is actually a fourth
a<00:05:41.919> fourth<00:05:42.550> muscle<00:05:42.940> here<00:05:43.270> which<00:05:43.900> is<00:05:44.050> not<00:05:44.200> seen

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
a fourth muscle here which is not seen

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.990 
a fourth muscle here which is not seen
unless<00:05:44.680> someone's<00:05:45.070> like<00:05:45.220> really<00:05:45.700> muscular

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
unless someone's like really muscular

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.440 
unless someone's like really muscular
but<00:05:46.479> he<00:05:46.690> is<00:05:46.870> so<00:05:47.260> we'll<00:05:47.650> put<00:05:47.860> one<00:05:48.010> here<00:05:48.450> and

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
but he is so we'll put one here and

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.040 
but he is so we'll put one here and
we'll<00:05:49.690> put<00:05:49.870> one<00:05:50.110> here<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:51.630> we'll<00:05:52.630> put<00:05:52.780> one<00:05:52.930> of

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
we'll put one here and we'll put one of

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.980 
we'll put one here and we'll put one of
the<00:05:53.260> belly<00:05:53.830> button<00:05:54.220> and<00:05:54.570> that<00:05:55.570> will<00:05:55.720> come<00:05:55.960> down

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
the belly button and that will come down

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.659 
the belly button and that will come down
all<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.590> way<00:05:56.710> here<00:05:56.890> this<00:05:57.039> is<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.250> longest

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
all the way here this is the longest

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.180 
all the way here this is the longest
part<00:05:58.360> of<00:05:58.599> the<00:05:58.750> abdominal<00:05:59.229> wall<00:05:59.260> right<00:05:59.860> here

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
part of the abdominal wall right here

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.870 
part of the abdominal wall right here
all<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.550> way<00:06:00.580> down<00:06:00.820> and<00:06:01.289> so<00:06:02.550> well<00:06:03.550> articulated

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
all the way down and so well articulated

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.559 
all the way down and so well articulated
one<00:06:04.599> bump<00:06:05.130> two<00:06:06.130> bumps<00:06:07.680> three<00:06:08.680> bumps<00:06:09.010> and<00:06:09.479> four

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
one bump two bumps three bumps and four

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.629 
one bump two bumps three bumps and four
and<00:06:11.659> again<00:06:12.439> we'll<00:06:12.589> articulate<00:06:13.099> it<00:06:13.219> here<00:06:13.520> a

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
and again we'll articulate it here a

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.089 
and again we'll articulate it here a
little<00:06:14.089> bit<00:06:14.409> bumping<00:06:15.409> forward<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:15.860> little<00:06:15.979> bit

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
little bit bumping forward a little bit

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:22.209 
little bit bumping forward a little bit
yeah<00:06:16.669> here<00:06:17.589> yeah<00:06:18.589> here<00:06:19.159> and<00:06:20.059> here<00:06:21.189> same<00:06:22.189> thing

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
yeah here yeah here and here same thing

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:27.070 
yeah here yeah here and here same thing
on<00:06:22.520> this<00:06:22.610> side<00:06:24.159> and<00:06:25.300> now<00:06:26.300> we<00:06:26.360> will<00:06:26.689> shade<00:06:27.050> a

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
on this side and now we will shade a

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.600 
on this side and now we will shade a
little<00:06:27.469> underneath<00:06:28.039> it<00:06:28.249> because<00:06:28.399> the<00:06:28.459> light

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
little underneath it because the light

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.879 
little underneath it because the light
comes<00:06:28.879> down<00:06:29.089> here<00:06:29.509> and<00:06:29.689> hits<00:06:30.229> the<00:06:30.379> top<00:06:30.649> of

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
comes down here and hits the top of

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.760 
comes down here and hits the top of
those<00:06:31.179> those<00:06:32.179> that<00:06:32.719> this<00:06:33.020> group<00:06:33.229> of<00:06:33.379> muscles

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
those those that this group of muscles

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.100 
those those that this group of muscles
but<00:06:34.669> not<00:06:34.849> the<00:06:35.029> bottom<00:06:35.949> see<00:06:36.949> how<00:06:37.069> that<00:06:37.219> looks

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
but not the bottom see how that looks

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.629 
but not the bottom see how that looks
now<00:06:39.110> one<00:06:39.349> thing<00:06:39.529> to<00:06:39.589> be<00:06:39.679> aware<00:06:40.069> of<00:06:40.249> is<00:06:40.429> that

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
now one thing to be aware of is that

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.209 
now one thing to be aware of is that
these<00:06:40.879> these<00:06:41.419> are<00:06:41.689> angles<00:06:42.169> slightly<00:06:42.740> downward

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
these these are angles slightly downward

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.249 
these these are angles slightly downward
like<00:06:43.669> that<00:06:43.939> that's<00:06:44.330> straight<00:06:44.629> across<00:06:44.869> as<00:06:45.139> I

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
like that that's straight across as I

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.839 
like that that's straight across as I
just<00:06:45.499> drawn<00:06:45.740> them<00:06:45.949> they're<00:06:46.099> angle<00:06:46.459> slightly

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
just drawn them they're angle slightly

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.010 
just drawn them they're angle slightly
downward<00:06:47.389> we<00:06:47.539> can<00:06:47.689> add<00:06:47.899> that<00:06:48.169> look<00:06:48.469> here<00:06:50.020> and

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
downward we can add that look here and

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.239 
downward we can add that look here and
look<00:06:51.139> more<00:06:51.259> natural<00:06:51.709> doesn't<00:06:51.889> look<00:06:52.069> more

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:52.249 
look more natural doesn't look more

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:54.040 
look more natural doesn't look more
natural<00:06:52.639> now<00:06:53.089> we<00:06:53.149> have<00:06:53.360> the<00:06:53.479> last<00:06:53.659> thing<00:06:53.899> we're

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
natural now we have the last thing we're

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.779 
natural now we have the last thing we're
going<00:06:54.169> to<00:06:54.229> do<00:06:54.439> is<00:06:54.649> we're<00:06:55.279> going<00:06:55.369> to<00:06:55.459> have<00:06:55.610> the

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
going to do is we're going to have the

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.510 
going to do is we're going to have the
ribcage<00:06:56.300> muscles<00:06:56.599> and<00:06:57.289> they're<00:06:57.770> short<00:06:58.099> here

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
ribcage muscles and they're short here

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.290 
ribcage muscles and they're short here
short<00:06:59.089> little<00:06:59.300> muscles<00:06:59.719> here<00:07:00.080> and<00:07:01.300> they

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
short little muscles here and they

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.749 
short little muscles here and they
interweave<00:07:02.930> like<00:07:03.499> so<00:07:03.800> and<00:07:04.069> they're<00:07:04.610> a<00:07:04.639> little

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 
interweave like so and they're a little

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.850 
interweave like so and they're a little
longer<00:07:05.360> in<00:07:05.449> the<00:07:05.479> front<00:07:05.839> as<00:07:06.019> they<00:07:06.379> follow<00:07:06.649> the

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
longer in the front as they follow the

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.309 
longer in the front as they follow the
bones<00:07:07.099> of<00:07:07.369> the<00:07:07.459> ribcage<00:07:07.669> so<00:07:08.599> a<00:07:08.659> short<00:07:09.050> ones

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 
bones of the ribcage so a short ones

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.639 
bones of the ribcage so a short ones
back<00:07:09.529> here<00:07:09.889> longer<00:07:10.669> ones<00:07:10.879> in<00:07:11.149> front<00:07:11.509> and<00:07:12.499> we

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:12.649 
back here longer ones in front and we

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.619 
back here longer ones in front and we
can<00:07:12.800> also<00:07:12.919> shade<00:07:13.610> those<00:07:13.819> in<00:07:14.059> a<00:07:14.119> little<00:07:14.479> bit

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:14.629 
can also shade those in a little bit

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.899 
can also shade those in a little bit
make<00:07:15.409> it<00:07:15.439> a<00:07:15.559> little<00:07:15.589> more<00:07:15.830> pronounced<00:07:16.339> let's
