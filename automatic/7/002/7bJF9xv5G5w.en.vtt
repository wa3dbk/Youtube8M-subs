00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
answer is no basically the reasons

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.719 
answer is no basically the reasons
because<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> cost<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.590> much<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.159> do

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
because it's going to cost so much I do

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.719 
because it's going to cost so much I do
have<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.000> kelvin<00:01:39.329> benjamin<00:01:39.540> card<00:01:40.049> i<00:01:40.579> got<00:01:41.579> his

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
have this kelvin benjamin card i got his

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
have this kelvin benjamin card i got his
collection<00:01:42.180> done<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.930> that's<00:01:43.079> pretty<00:01:43.290> nice<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
collection done so that's pretty nice to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800 
collection done so that's pretty nice to
have<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.820> i'll<00:01:44.939> probably<00:01:45.119> eventually<00:01:45.329> sell

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
have and i'll probably eventually sell

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.880 
have and i'll probably eventually sell
it<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.770> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it just because it's not really that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.069 
it just because it's not really that
great<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> card<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.450> i'm<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:48.689> not<00:01:48.840> doing

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
great of a card and i'm also not doing

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
great of a card and i'm also not doing
the<00:01:49.140> collection<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.770> i'll<00:01:50.220> probably<00:01:50.399> sell<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the collection so i'll probably sell it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
the collection so i'll probably sell it
hopefully<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> good<00:01:51.810> amount<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.079> coins<00:01:52.350> for

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
hopefully get a good amount of coins for

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.050 
hopefully get a good amount of coins for
it<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.220> i<00:01:53.280> also<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.759> Blake

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it and then i also have this Blake

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
it and then i also have this Blake
bortles<00:01:54.380> which<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:55.649> nice<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.070> well

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
bortles which is pretty nice as well

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.760
