00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.759

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.360
 in January to try if Christ wants 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.250

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.920
 it is this red house here that now 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.060
 we will visit it but first it will have to 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.160
 really review this way 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.910
 fucking fi i think i don't take away 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.830
 I think it's the only mode that I won't go 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.480
 to take off except when I go online 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.739
 heaven among the berlin boys then 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.720
 modica inserted and clays value a 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.430
 borealis all know their morals 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.230
 I hope I looked in the sky like like 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.079
 see for example now there is nothing 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.680
 you don't really see a dick but if i do 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.850
 I went to press time in the sense 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.070
 schedule 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.290
 the sun begins to set and look into the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.170
 heaven that cool java here at nine o'clock 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.820
 evening you start to admire stunted 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.649
 sin that does not move a thing yes 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.590
 really make a stuck image 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.009
 on the sky, however, she is a damn slut 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.960
 the more the night goes this thing goes 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:11.600
 always seeing ends of course the moon to gods 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.100
 I don't know why black borders 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 however it is just then it becomes into a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.619
 day this thing disappears another thing a 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.690
 very cool guys I am reflecting 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.700
 obviously also on the car on the asphalt 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.960
 of really a great cool there 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.729
 look at the northern lights that are 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.130
 reflected on the display of his door e 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.650
 oh well you really on car windows 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.720

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.340
 I went to extinguish the pardà headlights yes yes 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.110
 reflect here you also see on the mantle 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.540
 road that is all lit up by 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.670
 green and is really really pussy st 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.650
 fucking northern lights to propose the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.840
 let's move on to the second mode, yes 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.930
 call roadhouses as read and this 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.310
 what here on this red house that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.820
 now we 'll go what can be done 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.610
 anything 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.530
 as soon as we are at this point there 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.939
 they do missions to do that 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.619
 they give a bonus from 15 thousand to around 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.840
 $ 250,000 adds some 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.579
 game mode secondary missions 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.530
 that give a money whores too 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.570
 nice to do them so this fashion is 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.890
 really really well done I said there 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.959
 I make a video I do a mission 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.940
 china so much to show it 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.340
 ok here we are in the place while we find 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.490
 I don't know if these people are in here 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.410
 the bike was there before 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.300
 I don't really know a Zen back 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.040
 parked there what surely there is 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.410
 puts it in fashion because careful not 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.910
 is parked so easy for it 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.220
 been if then we will just enter 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.800
 inside this gate 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.780
 here you see we will come to the bottom indeed on the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.990
 mini mappa mission china 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.120
 lasi missions clean the place reward 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.310
 $ 98,000 to accept or 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.470
 go to press the noè key of the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.200
 keyboard and now you try it tells us go 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.180
 at the destination the destination is here 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.160
 so now we go to this 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.420
 point then another very cool thing later 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.520
 who has accepted the contract nor us 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.140
 let's take zen's cock back and get it 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.000
 let's go quietly to the point 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.740
 our mission while I move 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.910
 to make you see precisely the mission 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.290
 I'll show you one but there are 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.340
 there are so many missions from 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.170
 murderess 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.060
 the kind of missions clean one 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.760
 area in missions to protect a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.370
 guy while walking there are really a 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.380
 lots a lot of secondary missions e 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.610
 I'm really fucking hard 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.080
 guys in fact now I will put 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.090
 unspeakability because I don't want to die 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.830
 to do things 65 thousand times but 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.900
 trust yourself that they are from the missions 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.220
 really really hard there 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.540
 will really put a strain on and 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.820
 you must obviously also have a 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.410
 well advanced weapon arsenal for you 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.120
 otherwise we remain practically set 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.710
 almost to the point I go to put 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.330
 the indescribability so I only put it 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.100
 to show that precisely the mission 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.530
 function all things so as not to stop every 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.260
 time and make a 75-hour long video to whom 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.210
 everyone a little bit because in my opinion 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.500
 you kill me first so we're ok 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.000
 arrived here we find among for 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.770
 let's get to the point we need to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.110
 perform what the mission tells us 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.850
 which is practically killing everyone and 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.500
 we obviously do those that 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.440
 I'm really a bit more people 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.630
 you guys did it without tricks 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.670
 how am i doing i will have to stay 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.410
 covered we should not go so let's say 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.690
 fucking dog because otherwise 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.120
 we will die brutally so he has not 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.770
 as soon as we succeed in winning the mission 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.780
 that is already a finger in the ass even with i 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.610
 tricks because they really come out 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.960
 really a lot to here then the debt 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.480
 completed as you see on the map 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.090

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.430

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.100

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.110
 arrived at the point of the redhouse 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.730
 we park inside the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.280
 garage that we may first take away 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.050
 weapons so no jean marks this or that 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.760
 parked van we find a lot of 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.740
