00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.880
 mana there has never been a case because I respect the opinions of everyone xo 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.979
 but I always have the laundry in my players to fight until the ninetieth 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.589
 others until the referee whistles for which 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.859
 I will continue to try if I am winning to keep the victory if I am 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.640
 jogging to try to win if I'm losing try 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.060
 to equalize 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
 this marked my whole career and I will continue to do so here not 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.260
 fall asleep disrespect domestic ferret exact time 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.830
 ASL series coach heard my judgment was not lack of 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.380
 respect but will instead be great self-esteem in a deploy sample could 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.110
 solve the game at any time with a pass play 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.840
 continuous 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.400
 a penalty kick 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.980
 so it was only instead of great consideration of my captain 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.240
 these are my considerations 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.010
 you are not the only thing there are things 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.420
 mmm normal everyday we talked we joked we laughed 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.980
 we trained 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.240
 always agrees 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.230
 I don't think I do not believe it 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 I don't even believe the players 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.640
 as far as I'm concerned, don't make everyone look good 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.010
 they practice 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.220
 in a normal relationship 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.730
 professional where everyone wants 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.130
 look for the best in this league 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.610
 then he could go away June I didn't leave because for me the Rome is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.300
 all 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.390
 everything will continue to be as long as there is a contract in place I am a lot 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.410
 serene. determined 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.660
 as part of my professional history 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.040
 that I always made the maximum points that the hand team wanted to do 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.050
 but you are seeing this is the real rome 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.690
 for a first part it was the real romagna when beautiful when it burns 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.130
 these walls roma 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.950
 we need everyone in support of our audience 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.820
 we were able to possess matches and vat it - bella e 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.970
 how all the teams are doing the press 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.159
 I see the candidate as the scudetto 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:14.909
 and then there are then other teams then you also said the Roman 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.689
 Italian Renaissance Grillo 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.079
 cursed is in the air maroc 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.079
 person informed of the facts 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.779
 of course 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.559
 alejandro a boy 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.099
 that is making red progress 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.819
 we have 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.629
 - - 10 days we talked a lot 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.090
 I believe a lot in this guy in what he can give to Rome I think photos 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.819
 definitely effects when when the camomile team game system 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.040
 the years go by and the years go by, but not for everyone 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.889
 team no more mansini there is no more beautiful 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.420
 that game that once was made so it can also affect this 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.589
 . in cydia 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.919
 in addition we have a central bank comes 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.029
 is making many colors 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:07.719
 somewhere 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.729
 if they make me this is it 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:14.589
 a liferay football team is normal and normal even tomorrow 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.629
 nice ass 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.019
 eh we had players with features 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.019
 suitable to cover the whole band 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.759
 it would be a defensive offensive 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.759
 I mainly play offensive players 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.399
 so I feel like an offensive judy garland 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.629
 but in my opinion 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.769
 if we change the take to change takes means to go for points 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.199
 outside the home 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.979
 they recover 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.639
 it's a league we said particular 12 are ups and downs from 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.209
 part of all 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.099
 so we must be aware that we also want to fight for the rush 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.609
 final for the win 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.609
 tomorrow we have to do our rome race we did update the samdoria wheel 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.839
 because for me genoa sandals was one of the best matches in the rome 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:11.909
 so we put back in the field for the determination and desire to win 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.540
 and then we accept the result we have not always done
