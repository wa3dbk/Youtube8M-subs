00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello together we the film factory to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.279
 fourth birthday most successful 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.350
 and highest-revenue film of all time 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.950
 avatar constantly I feel the same today 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.509
 In 2154, humanity has such a thing 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.549
 energy problem and no right one 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.529
 Raw materials more what you need on the far 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.449
 distant planet pandora solved 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.900
 get live there but im huge 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.210
 large blue indigenous people the navi and the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 have such a very special raw material 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.750
 under the earth we would like 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.939
 stupid but if the complete navi 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.750
 is built on how we get 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.300
 So that's it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.010
 We reward the navy protect for you 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.350
 So, consciousness becomes rhine 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.660
 so-called avatar and people can 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 this from the far away base 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 control the whole takes over 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.690
 war veteran jack sully and is just learning 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.250
 know the breed and should at the same time 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.410
 but also fulfill his assignment 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.410
 how the whole looks you see here 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.630
 we want to talk to you about one 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.430
 to talk about a new beginning in a new world 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.430
 they could be something we thought 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.750
 I 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.220
 in berlin because of the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.600
 challenges i thought i can 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.320
 every test is made by a person only 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.330
 can exist 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 all I wanted was something for it 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.200
 worth fighting for 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.260
 they are no longer in kansas they are 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.720
 the pandora 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.930
 their faces are seen by the indigenous people 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.420
 Here, call navi that is very 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.980
 hard to kill her 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.720
 That's why we're here when those little ones 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.170
 gray stones ranked 20 million each 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.240
 kilo 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.830
 Her village is above the largest 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.540
 so they have to be relocated 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.770
 become 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.580
 these savages endanger our whole 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.230
 surgery 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.090
 we are on the verge of a war and 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.630
 they should be diplomatic 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.830
 find solution 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.120
 the basic idea is the remote controllable 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.860
 to steer body 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.300
 these avatars 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.920
 they become human dns 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.010
 bred with the dns the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.810
 Aboriginal combined maria in one 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.680
 avatar body is a mixture with 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.270
 potential 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.890
 get me what I want and you 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.340
 get her legs back her 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.469
 right legs 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.469
 All right, he looks like her 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.210
 relax and think about them 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.230
 nothing at all 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.230
 should not it be difficult 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.580
 it's easy 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.810
 I want her inside out 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.739
 I know wants to learn that their 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.739
 gain trust 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.360
 you should not be here 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.550
 to wake me up 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.540
 maybe all of that 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.540
 I need your help 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.700
 Super 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.970
 we have lost in a forest 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.940
 in the evening forget which team you 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.060
 the strong ones fall over the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.080
 weak no one takes care 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.760
 you have one hour 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.970
 knew that that happened has everything 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.970
 has changed 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.130
 horizon we can not do it 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.510
 stop 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.910
 we fight with arrows and turn against 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.720
 hans schreiber then we prefer 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.720
 the best of it 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.060
 have sent us the message that 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.680
 they can take everything they have 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.630
 want 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 we also send you one 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.400
 this one 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.400
 and 11 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.710
 But there is the highest-revenue film 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.410
 all the time just under $ 2.8 billion 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.540
 he has recorded by the cinema visionary 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.180
 James Cameron Yes that's really the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.010
 god what cinema version is concerned and then 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.200
 the 3d hype really got started and 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.970
 that's still what the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.010
 So film is the star of the film 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.510
 The visual effects are there now 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.710
 Not so much is going on 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.660
 been laid or on the 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.310
 actress that's what I think 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.330
 I the people he still in 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.140
 Remembrance remains for the man too 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.450
 actually on the big screen 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.130
 That's why they have to be seen 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.870
 all running at home and television 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.240
 answer it asks a morsel closer 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.730
 then you can go back to this world 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.020
 Dive in from the set design and 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.980
 of all this idea really 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.630
 become fantastic 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.890
 The story itself, however, is 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.950
 at all not new this 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.030
 Aboriginal ding is a classic 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.650
 American theme if you are so now 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.540
 Indian thinks the expelled 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.460
 So somehow, they are even included 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.410
 winnetou with many have also 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.120
 said to have to connect a bit 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.860
 because it also resonates with this 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.960
 the nature is actually in it 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.920
 pocahontas in two and a half hours with 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.530
 blue male 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.630
 because you have the critics right 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.730
 it's just as much trouble as you have 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.590
 in the story itself in the script 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.650
 not given what you also on the 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.670
 Therefore she is very bad 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.290
 one-dimensional very decals so 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.310
 there is no if or or only gives 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.930
 black or white 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.060
 and that's a bit clumsy 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.980
 but some do make something in turn 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.720
 It looks great and so does it 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.790
 is told very entertaining so one 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.590
 film of the extremely long is the once 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.390
 Not so long ago you can come 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.120
 So overlook the whole 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.010
 film event and nothing else is yes 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.300
 avatar will not do that at all 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.280
 clouded if you are now more critical 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.170
 I really want to do that 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.540
 I have to do a film criticism you just have to 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.490
 say because the story is itself 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.320
 so a little something on the 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.240
 remained a theatrical actor 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.740
 performance can be quite blatant good 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.110
 rate that guitar hero motion 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.460
 the capturing had such picture points in the 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.900
 face that was played 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.030
 digitized on these blue male 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.680
 everything looks reasonable you have just 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.360
 really the feeling i see blue 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.160
 male and no actor jimi 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.020
 have been digitized if I am now 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.300
 Think of another movie as bio 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.920
 court or polar express what has the 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.750
 robert zemeckis thus made with 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.240
 there is this motion capturing there but 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.770
 not yet 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.210
 good as avatar is now 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.099
 pretty well aged though he is four 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.099
 years old is still extremely fresh 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.900
 an absolute highlight as far as movies are concerned 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.759
 I'll have to be visual critical though 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.740
 I'll give a total of eight 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.599
 ten points it is such a strong movie 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.979
 But the story is just then 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.710
 to pump a bit too 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.509
 easy for people to say but I like 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.039
 so visual movies and i just want to 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.080
 just a fun blockbuster 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.680
 see is that the absolutely perfect movie 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.960
 and then also the highest score of 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.080
 but I think it is critical 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.310
 nevertheless 8 out of 10 points score nevertheless 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.380
 It is a film you absolutely 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.150
 must have seen and who in the cinema 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.250
 did not do it right now 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.800
 the couch that was a review to avatar 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.270
 I would like to know from you which movies 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.979
 Do you like it where you are 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.840
 Honestly, they would have to remember that 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.300
 also write to other stories 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.099
 the comments purely who prefer one 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.780
 want to see a christmas movie or 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.490
 you may hear the opinion of me 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.620
 just go down here on the couch 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.360
 actually prefer the classic 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.520
 last week or look here 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.530
 just a very different review 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.110
 namely to a big christmas block 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.789
 Buster looks over otherwise I'm glad
