pressure on him but if he's screwed for
a<00:01:25.399> few<00:01:25.820> more<00:01:26.000> turns<00:01:26.300> think<00:01:27.229> of<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.380> runner<00:01:27.560> is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.340 
a few more turns think of a runner is
pretty<00:01:28.009> good<00:01:28.160> at<00:01:28.250> putting<00:01:28.399> on<00:01:28.580> pressure

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
pretty good at putting on pressure

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.779 
pretty good at putting on pressure
actually<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.530> well<00:01:31.009> he<00:01:31.190> could<00:01:31.369> go<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:31.700> the

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
actually is well he could go for the

actually is well he could go for the

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
arrest that while depending on what I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.720 
arrest that while depending on what I
draw<00:03:26.329> but<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:27.489> see<00:03:28.489> no<00:03:28.640> real<00:03:28.850> reason<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.239> let<00:03:29.510> him

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.650 
draw but I see no real reason to let him
well<00:03:31.730> actually<00:03:32.030> that's<00:03:32.239> not<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.510> worst

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
well actually that's not the worst

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.770 
well actually that's not the worst
because<00:03:33.519> grass<00:03:34.519> doesn't<00:03:34.820> kill<00:03:35.090> Marauder<00:03:35.420> and

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
because grass doesn't kill Marauder and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.060 
because grass doesn't kill Marauder and
now<00:03:35.959> he's<00:03:36.110> protected<00:03:36.530> from<00:03:36.620> go<00:03:36.769> for<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
now he's protected from go for the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.830 
now he's protected from go for the
throat<00:03:37.340> or<00:03:37.549> spread<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.329> sickness<00:03:38.450> if<00:03:38.750> it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
throat or spread the sickness if it

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.810 
throat or spread the sickness if it
comes<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.920> withstand<00:03:40.489> death<00:03:40.609> might

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
comes to that so withstand death might

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.050 
comes to that so withstand death might
actually<00:03:40.970> be<00:03:41.180> decent<00:03:42.310> go<00:03:43.310> ahead<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.640> arrest

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060
