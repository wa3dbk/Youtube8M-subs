00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.750 
well this season because we've got good
players<00:02:58.380> right<00:02:59.380> now<00:02:59.590> we're<00:02:59.860> currently<00:03:00.040> first

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
players right now we're currently first

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.180 
players right now we're currently first
place<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.570> league<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.200> wifey<00:03:02.860> we've<00:03:03.040> got

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
place in the league and wifey we've got

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.920 
place in the league and wifey we've got
four<00:03:03.459> points<00:03:03.790> ahead<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.030> everyone<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> think

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
four points ahead of everyone so I think

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.300 
four points ahead of everyone so I think
