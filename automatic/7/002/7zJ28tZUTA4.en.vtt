00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:12.650
 Nice to meet you. Let's learn about minor codes this time. 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:13.519
 9 Now feel the actors in the leading edge caching and code t Yoriko such as water to feel 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.550
 You are. 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:24.920
 Ah , you do not even learn to read the code, so you'll only learn two more major codes. 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.170
 First is c coding and g code 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.220
 If you look at your family first, 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:36.470
 Now the three presentations this week, you can see four'm the first Christmas No. 1 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.000
 Next, in line 4 of this pre 3 and 5 of line 3 plus 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.650
 Catch this. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.650
 One car ohsigo 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.900
 Check that you know the sound. As I said at first, 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.610
 Lack of power in the hands was a gun rack sounds just 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:01.410
 Yes, due to line 1 so that the first finger is caught 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.280
 Keep your hands up so that you can not hear anything and make no noise. 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.470
 If you do not like it a little, 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.470
 M3 important to secure space 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.430
 Here c referred to the Code 9 US four of this code as a quality code, let's eat 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 Let's see the press's aid. 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.450
 Next, line 3 to 8 and line 6 and line 3 to line 4, 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.450
 You can catch the line. 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:37.320
 But hasyeoseo be a bit of a hand in the air, where you see the hand 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:39.810
 Not something that starts from the normal speed as you order from the second finger 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.620
 You can catch it. 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 In other words codes were gathered two kinds so this 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.420
 One last time, with Rael's last finger, his last finger 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.100
 I can do this, 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:03.240
 There are two ways to find the reason why I want to create a way to do this later 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.229
 The two shapes to make it easier to see when a strong spurs in different poses 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.019
 Will be too 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.019
 Cause I think God will tell you what to do with your fingers. 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:22.250
 ch3 e 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:26.750
 The stock now live or c Le Chi Oh Yeah 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.650
 Now let's see a little bit more code now Jesus Lesson Minor Code 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.640
 I'm calling. 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.350
 Our classroom code first minor 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:40.580
 Minor of this time, this time, Creel 3 line 5 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.030
 Do you see the need to stop to catch unable to gaengji 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.030
 right 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:53.600
 Then, in this law, 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.600
 Then you can take a touch. Yes, history. 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.690
 I would just go to the late forearm. 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.170
 4 e minor forget o'clock on Next, 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:13.870
 I'll learn a minor negative we learned of a loved one 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:18.670
 4 a, I will fold this press doctor category again. 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:24.460
 Then at Liverpool ah Japanese pet first time this week at the school 1 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:28.450
 Then, grasp and I give this pressure 43 times the pet dressed as a line again 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.150
 The first time the press line this pen 4 wonjun 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:36.370
 Line 2 to line 3 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.310
 Please refer to the attached table records will make it easier to learn 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.640
 On-the -go - lots more advice on buying 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.750
 Minor sound'm in a spot 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.170
 As you can see in the first paragraph, 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.170
 It is important 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.260
 If you do not hear the sound again, emi again 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.220
 So let's start with the overflow case . 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.220
 And then the buyer 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:12.000
 Here we are once again, let's review the code've learned in the summer 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.610
 Let's take a proverbial touch. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.020
 Did you catch 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:24.600
 The first coat I did this time Shark 8 3 days after the therapy in the 5th office pool 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.480
 You have to start backwards . 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:32.760
 I do not think as a cross in Japan speed 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:37.410
 But you have to go down three to eight times and come with your little finger. 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:41.850
 g then the t code and the business d 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.370
 You've eaten a lot of it, and it 's the third line in the mouth application and the new one in this building 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.240
 2 server processor is not good 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.240
 4 lead 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.290
 Then let him write the code to a minor 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.290
 That's it . 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.690
 Coming ah ah ah 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:16.090
 228 you or c class 7 class this line * 3 line 4 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:16.090
 And the overflow in the third pool So the new code is complete, 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.720
 Arr 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:29.940
 The small screen flew Avian , 4 c code, 4 pounds. 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:35.910
 Come in this state so the third finger second finger tube US 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:39.120
 4 Then mr goes back to c in the third finger 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:44.130
 , Grasp the side of the bottom line is the negative 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.440
 It's just a minor code. Elo, so this line is four in Liverpool. 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.720
 Compressor Line 3 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:54.240
 You can put a lot of U in the cotton without history. 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.210
 Son 5 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:03.320
 In fact, I value tied up quickly once 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:05.790
 de minor one without 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.940
 more cd2.avi 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:14.100
 2 Well, the code we learned 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.920
 Almost no other dangled hey put a lot of code just very possible 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.220
 I can not do anything about this. 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.220
 4 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.339
 wer 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:39.479
 we 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:39.479
 on our way 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:52.180
 This song can also, now that the four now the slogan spell next time 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:58.050
 have 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.050
 Applying the code will try to practice singing just once
