 opportunity a fifa 14 tutorial that 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.470
 serves to learn ramón and learn 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.610
 to shoot and tarragona this special shot 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.400
 that can allow us to center pull 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.870
 centers or define in front of the goalkeeper 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.000
 difficult difficult very difficult but nothing 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.440
 that the practice does not allow us 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.130
 and there we are seeing some images 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.059
 that they capture with Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 player that within his record has the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.220
 class card which enables it 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.290
 to throw rabones knows pull the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.489
 rabona there we are seeing the controls 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.989
 we have to press the button on l 2 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.550
 not looking at the bow always one 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.920
 diagonal position to be able to see in 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.680
 the videos and once we throw l 2 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.300
 diagonal to the bow and the button 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.509
 center the center button the rabona goes out 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.800
 immediately as I told them all 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.070
 the players are enabled to 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.320
 throw the rabona not inside his chips 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.050
 in the area of ​​features they should have there 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.320
 as the word class appears in the video 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.960
 If you do not have this qualification 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.360
 the player will not throw the rabona there 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.970
 we are seeing as without looking at the arch in 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.640
 diagonal immediately then to lose 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.619
 the fingers pressed in the direction 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.570
 towards the arch and we press the button 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.020
 center 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.080
 there we see as a new failed attempt 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.159
 de rabona goes well above the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.190
 crossbar 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.360

 again in the hands of Peter they have 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.750
 account for an important detail that 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.450
 I mentioned is that I can not let it go 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.250
 I will repeat it is important not to be 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.050
 looking towards the arch if we're looking 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.160
 to the arch does not come out we have to go in 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.380
 diagonal without looking at the goalkeeper 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.390
 immediately new point to where 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.850
