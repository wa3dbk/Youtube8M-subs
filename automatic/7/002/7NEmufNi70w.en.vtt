probably<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> most<00:00:30.869> difficult

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
probably one of the most difficult

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.340 
probably one of the most difficult
things<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.710> shoot<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.600> there's

usually either no light or not enough
light<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.450> half<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.800> focus<00:00:38.719> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
light to half the time you can focus the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
light to half the time you can focus the
other<00:00:39.870> thing<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.559> crowded<00:00:40.860> there's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
other thing is it's crowded there's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
usually not enough room to you know

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.220 
usually not enough room to you know
really<00:00:44.399> walk<00:00:44.730> around<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
of got that much better back after that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.500

happened<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.890> now<00:01:01.890> shoot<00:01:02.190> using<00:01:02.430> ace<00:01:02.760> deep<00:01:03.270> end

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
happened I now shoot using ace deep end

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.280 
happened I now shoot using ace deep end

xdh star 16 to 50 millimeter to 8 the
reason<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.220> wide<00:01:08.549> angle<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.240> semi

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
reason I use a really wide angle to semi

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.609 
reason I use a really wide angle to semi
telephoto<00:01:10.350> lens<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:12.630> 16<00:01:13.110> millimeters

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
telephoto lens is that at 16 millimeters

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
telephoto lens is that at 16 millimeters
you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.340> three<00:01:14.909> feet<00:01:15.119> away<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.330> someone

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you can be three feet away from someone

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.270 
you can be three feet away from someone
almost<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.200> their<00:01:16.439> entire<00:01:16.560> body<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
almost get their entire body in the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.999 
almost get their entire body in the
frame<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.020> packed<00:01:19.470> crowded

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
frame so if it's a really packed crowded

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
frame so if it's a really packed crowded
place<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.580> sitting<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.479> 60

millimetres<00:01:22.140> pretty<00:01:22.320> much<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> whole<00:01:22.680> time

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
millimetres pretty much the whole time

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
millimetres pretty much the whole time
because<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> great

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
because you're not going to get a great

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
because you're not going to get a great
shot<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.110> 50<00:01:25.380> millimetres<00:01:25.830> besides<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
shot at 50 millimetres besides of you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.450 
shot at 50 millimetres besides of you
know<00:01:26.880> their<00:01:27.030> ears<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> eyeballs<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.890> invest

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
know their ears and eyeballs so invest

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.340 
know their ears and eyeballs so invest
in<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> decent<00:01:29.850> wide-angle<00:01:30.479> lens<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.900> kit<00:01:31.110> lens

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
in a decent wide-angle lens the kit lens

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.179 
in a decent wide-angle lens the kit lens
works<00:01:31.590> pretty<00:01:31.860> well<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.340> -<00:01:33.829> if<00:01:34.829> not

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
works pretty well for this - if not

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.149 
works pretty well for this - if not
probably<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> best<00:01:35.640> would<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.890> 14<00:01:37.890> -

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
probably the best would be like the 14 -

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.800 
probably the best would be like the 14 -
eh<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:39.119> some<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> off-brand<00:01:40.740> Sigma<00:01:41.250> lenses

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810

eighth of a second shutter speed and

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.729 
eighth of a second shutter speed and
that<00:04:17.420> go<00:04:17.600> as<00:04:17.750> low<00:04:17.930> as<00:04:17.959> once

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
that go as low as once

that go as low as once
at<00:04:18.829> sharp<00:04:19.130> speed<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:20.479> reason<00:04:20.780> being<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.169> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
at sharp speed the reason being is the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.070 
at sharp speed the reason being is the
ambient<00:04:22.009> light<00:04:22.250> will<00:04:23.120> come<00:04:23.630> in<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.840> little<00:04:23.930> bit

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
ambient light will come in a little bit

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.230 
ambient light will come in a little bit
more<00:04:24.350> plus<00:04:25.100> you<00:04:25.340> can<00:04:25.490> play<00:04:25.699> with<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:25.910> light

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
more plus you can play with that light

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.589 
more plus you can play with that light
and<00:04:26.479> I'll<00:04:26.569> explain<00:04:26.900> why<00:04:27.139> later<00:04:28.360> aperture<00:04:29.360> I

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
and I'll explain why later aperture I

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.430 
and I'll explain why later aperture I
stay<00:04:30.590> as<00:04:30.770> low<00:04:31.039> as<00:04:31.220> f-35<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.440> that's

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
stay as low as f-35 and that's

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.960 
stay as low as f-35 and that's
forgivable<00:04:34.009> if<00:04:34.370> you're<00:04:34.520> shooting<00:04:34.819> at<00:04:34.940> a

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
forgivable if you're shooting at a

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.430 
forgivable if you're shooting at a
really<00:04:35.180> wide<00:04:35.389> angle<00:04:35.780> because<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.139> depth<00:04:36.319> of

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
really wide angle because the depth of

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.200 
really wide angle because the depth of
field<00:04:36.620> is<00:04:36.770> greater<00:04:37.039> but<00:04:37.819> if<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:37.970> started

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
field is greater but if you started

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.960 
field is greater but if you started
zooming<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:40.250> depth<00:04:40.490> of<00:04:40.610> field<00:04:40.759> is<00:04:40.849> really

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
zooming in that depth of field is really

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.600 
zooming in that depth of field is really
thin<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.110> may<00:04:42.259> want<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.560> try<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> 4/5<00:04:43.370> that's

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
thin so you may want to try a 4/5 that's

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.070 
thin so you may want to try a 4/5 that's
usually<00:04:43.880> where<00:04:43.970> I<00:04:44.030> start<00:04:44.330> off<00:04:44.479> when<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.720> jumped

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
usually where I start off when I jumped

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.860 
usually where I start off when I jumped
in<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.289> bar<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.819> usually<00:04:47.000> stay<00:04:47.449> with<00:04:47.630> an<00:04:47.750> F

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
in the bar and I usually stay with an F

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.610 
in the bar and I usually stay with an F
for<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:48.199> 4/5<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.039> entire<00:04:49.310> time
