free<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> make<00:01:28.140> carriers<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.009> he<00:01:29.070> spread<00:01:29.460> his

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
free to make carriers and he spread his

free to make carriers and he spread his
star<00:01:29.880> gets<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.329> three<00:01:30.659> different

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
star gets out in three different

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.620 
star gets out in three different
locations<00:01:31.020> also<00:01:31.770> which<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.759> very<00:01:33.090> interesting

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
locations also which is very interesting

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
locations also which is very interesting
it's<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.290> kind<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> cool<00:01:34.890> tactic<00:01:35.280> something

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it's a kind of a cool tactic something

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.819 
it's a kind of a cool tactic something
often<00:01:36.270> times<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.810> players<00:01:36.960> will<00:01:37.320> will

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
often times you see players will will

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
often times you see players will will
put<00:01:38.070> their<00:01:38.280> stargates<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.270> same<00:01:39.390> spot

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
put their stargates all in the same spot

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
put their stargates all in the same spot
so<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.560> harder<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:40.979> spot<00:01:41.220> them<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so that it's harder to spot them you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.639 
so that it's harder to spot them you
know<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> can't<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> random<00:01:43.229> come<00:01:43.439> sat

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
know you can't just do a random come sat

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.830 
know you can't just do a random come sat
in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> main<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.360> find<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.450> carriers<00:01:45.750> are

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
in the main and find out carriers are

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.830 
in the main and find out carriers are
coming<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.649> case<00:01:47.270> see<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> comes

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
coming but in this case see if it comes

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
coming but in this case see if it comes
that's<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> them<00:01:49.649> he'll<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that's one of them he'll see that the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.180 
that's one of them he'll see that the
carriers<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:50.880> coming<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.659> he<00:01:51.780> won't<00:01:52.020> know

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
carriers are coming but he won't know

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.000 
carriers are coming but he won't know
how<00:01:54.030> many<00:01:54.330> are<00:01:54.450> coming<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.830> now

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
how many are coming right and so now

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.560 
how many are coming right and so now
there's<00:01:56.310> actually<00:01:56.610> three<00:01:56.640> stargates<00:01:57.330> popping

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
there's actually three stargates popping

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.000 
there's actually three stargates popping
out<00:01:57.660> so<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.870> he<00:01:57.960> comps<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.650> top

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
out so if he comps at it at the top

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.800 
out so if he comps at it at the top
right<00:01:59.190> location<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.850> Stargate<00:02:00.660> in<00:02:00.750> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
vultures which I find very interesting I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
vultures which I find very interesting I
would<00:03:03.270> have<00:03:03.360> thought<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.540> he<00:03:03.750> wanted<00:03:03.989> to

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
would have thought that he wanted to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.020 
would have thought that he wanted to
wait<00:03:04.680> longer<00:03:04.980> although<00:03:05.280> maybe<00:03:05.459> he<00:03:05.670> knows<00:03:05.820> he's

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
wait longer although maybe he knows he's

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.270 
wait longer although maybe he knows he's
been<00:03:06.209> calm<00:03:06.390> setted<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.989> why<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:07.830> he<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.160> that

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
been calm setted and why is he have that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.830 
been calm setted and why is he have that
floating<00:03:08.670> starport<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.630> really

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
floating starport there it's really

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.770 
floating starport there it's really
interesting<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:11.209> mean<00:03:12.209> he's<00:03:12.300> not<00:03:12.390> using<00:03:12.600> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
interesting I mean he's not using the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.020 
interesting I mean he's not using the
starport<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.230> guess<00:03:13.380> right<00:03:13.530> now<00:03:13.590> but

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
starport I guess right now but

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.760 
starport I guess right now but
might<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.810> well<00:03:15.840> floated<00:03:16.260> out<00:03:16.319> somewhere<00:03:16.740> and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
might as well floated out somewhere and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.640 
might as well floated out somewhere and
I<00:03:17.510> don't<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.750> guess<00:03:18.990> make<00:03:19.290> sense<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.560> get

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
I don't know I guess make sense to get

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.890

goons and so now but without the carers
the<00:05:23.450> parent<00:05:23.750> Carrie<00:05:23.990> is<00:05:24.080> able<00:05:24.290> to<00:05:24.380> attack<00:05:24.500> the

the parent Carrie is able to attack the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.080 
the parent Carrie is able to attack the
tanks<00:05:24.950> in<00:05:25.100> that<00:05:25.430> case<00:05:25.640> you<00:05:25.700> just<00:05:25.790> had<00:05:26.000> the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
tanks in that case you just had the

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.460 
tanks in that case you just had the
carriers<00:05:26.420> because<00:05:26.480> kind<00:05:26.750> of<00:05:26.840> overhead<00:05:27.230> just

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
carriers because kind of overhead just

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.680 
carriers because kind of overhead just
kind<00:05:27.650> of<00:05:27.680> tacking<00:05:28.040> strand<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.400> stuff<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:28.790> the

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
kind of tacking strand of stuff and the

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.390 
kind of tacking strand of stuff and the
goons<00:05:30.020> were<00:05:30.230> just<00:05:30.410> getting<00:05:30.620> shelled<00:05:30.890> by<00:05:30.950> tanks

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
goons were just getting shelled by tanks

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.640 
goons were just getting shelled by tanks
so<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.880> didn't<00:05:32.090> do<00:05:32.150> as<00:05:32.210> much<00:05:32.360> good<00:05:32.390> bc<00:05:33.020> low<00:05:33.290> is

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
so it didn't do as much good bc low is

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.410 
so it didn't do as much good bc low is
not<00:05:33.830> going<00:05:34.040> in<00:05:34.190> for<00:05:34.280> another<00:05:34.400> shot<00:05:34.670> looks<00:05:35.270> like

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
not going in for another shot looks like

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.450 
not going in for another shot looks like
he<00:05:35.510> might<00:05:35.600> be<00:05:35.660> going<00:05:35.810> around<00:05:36.290> to<00:05:37.130> attack<00:05:37.220> a
