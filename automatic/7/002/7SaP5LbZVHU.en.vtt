over<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.230> years<00:00:01.410> of<00:00:01.589> unfortunate<00:00:02.159> work<00:00:02.280> with

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
over the years of unfortunate work with

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.400 
over the years of unfortunate work with
so<00:00:02.909> many<00:00:03.000> great<00:00:03.149> backstrokers<00:00:04.020> Matt<00:00:04.200> Welsh

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
so many great backstrokers Matt Welsh

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.579 
so many great backstrokers Matt Welsh
John<00:00:04.890> Rooney<00:00:05.130> Olympic<00:00:06.029> medalists<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.720> one<00:00:07.529> of

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
John Rooney Olympic medalists and one of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.720 
John Rooney Olympic medalists and one of
the<00:00:07.649> things<00:00:07.799> I've<00:00:07.919> found<00:00:07.950> with<00:00:08.280> all<00:00:08.490> great

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the things I've found with all great

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.980 
the things I've found with all great
backstrokers<00:00:09.300> they're<00:00:09.450> generally<00:00:09.719> great

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
backstrokers they're generally great

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.020 
backstrokers they're generally great
kickers<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:11.340> let's<00:00:11.519> have<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.730> look<00:00:11.880> at<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
kickers so let's have a look at the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.940 
kickers so let's have a look at the
backstroke<00:00:12.450> kick<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.740> maintain

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
backstroke kick and how we can maintain

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.730 
backstroke kick and how we can maintain
the<00:00:14.910> perfect<00:00:15.360> technique<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:16.320> get<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> most

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the perfect technique to get the most

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.830 
the perfect technique to get the most
out<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.949> our<00:00:17.100> legs<00:00:17.369> now<00:00:18.150> what<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.390> want<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.630> see

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
out of our legs now what we want to see

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
out of our legs now what we want to see
on<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> backstroke<00:00:19.680> kick<00:00:19.949> as<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.850> know<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
on the backstroke kick as we know it's a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
on the backstroke kick as we know it's a
very<00:00:21.420> relaxed<00:00:22.020> action<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.100> want<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> make

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
very relaxed action but we want to make

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.330 
very relaxed action but we want to make
sure<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> toes<00:00:24.330> remain<00:00:24.840> extended<00:00:25.740> all

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
sure that the toes remain extended all

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.950 
sure that the toes remain extended all
the<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.670> through<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> kicking<00:00:27.420> action<00:00:27.779> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the way through the kicking action I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.929 
the way through the kicking action I
think<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> swimmers<00:00:29.279> make<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> mistake

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
think a lot of swimmers make the mistake

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.749 
think a lot of swimmers make the mistake
of<00:00:30.119> lifting<00:00:30.960> their<00:00:31.109> toes<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.890> getting<00:00:32.579> no

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
of lifting their toes up and getting no

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.479 
of lifting their toes up and getting no
propulsion<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> down<00:00:33.899> kick<00:00:34.370> one<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
propulsion on the down kick one of the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
propulsion on the down kick one of the
things<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> used<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> talk<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> Matt<00:00:36.630> Welsh

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
things when I used to talk to Matt Welsh

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.290 
things when I used to talk to Matt Welsh
about<00:00:37.170> his<00:00:37.350> backstroke<00:00:37.800> kick<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.399> he<00:00:39.120> used<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
about his backstroke kick is he used to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
about his backstroke kick is he used to
always<00:00:39.329> talk<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.440> propulsion<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.340> he

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
always talk about the propulsion that he

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.420 
always talk about the propulsion that he
created<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.360> his<00:00:42.690> down<00:00:43.050> kick<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> that's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
created on his down kick and that's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
created on his down kick and that's
something<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:45.239> want<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> see<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.899> now

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
something we want to see right now

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.970 
something we want to see right now
on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.190> kick<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:48.469> just<00:00:49.469> notice<00:00:49.800> with

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
on the kick just here just notice with

on the kick just here just notice with
Daniel<00:00:50.430> how<00:00:50.879> he's<00:00:51.090> feet<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.660> fully<00:00:52.230> extended

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
Daniel how he's feet are fully extended

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
Daniel how he's feet are fully extended
facing<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> back<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> pool<00:00:54.739> notice<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
facing the back of the pool notice that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.910 
facing the back of the pool notice that
relaxed<00:00:56.460> action<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.680> notice<00:00:58.680> how<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
relaxed action and notice how the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.700 
relaxed action and notice how the
movement<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> from<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> hips<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> legs

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
movement is from the hips with the legs

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.609 
movement is from the hips with the legs
nice<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.129> long<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.820> too<00:01:03.000> bendy<00:01:03.470> one<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
nice and long not too bendy one of the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.250 
nice and long not too bendy one of the
drills<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.729> overcorrect<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
drills you can do to overcorrect the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
drills you can do to overcorrect the
backstroke<00:01:07.799> legs<00:01:08.189> being<00:01:08.400> too<00:01:08.580> bendy<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
backstroke legs being too bendy is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.359 
backstroke legs being too bendy is
getting<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> kick<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> straight<00:01:11.130> leg

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
getting the kick with a straight leg

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.060 
getting the kick with a straight leg
even<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.360> bit<00:01:12.540> deeper<00:01:12.900> kick<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
even a little bit deeper kick and that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.399 
even a little bit deeper kick and that
can<00:01:14.369> reinforce<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:15.119> full<00:01:15.659> extension<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
can reinforce a full extension of the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.010 
can reinforce a full extension of the
legs<00:01:16.619> getting<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> most<00:01:17.610> Drive<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.720> need<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
legs getting the most Drive we need to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
legs getting the most Drive we need to
keep<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.290> full<00:01:19.560> extension<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
keep that full extension and get the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
keep that full extension and get the
most<00:01:20.700> ever<00:01:20.970> legs<00:01:21.270> by<00:01:21.630> engaging<00:01:21.810> our<00:01:22.350> glutes

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
most ever legs by engaging our glutes

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
most ever legs by engaging our glutes
and<00:01:22.799> our<00:01:22.890> hammies<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> using<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> whole<00:01:24.810> leg

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and our hammies and using the whole leg

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.560 
and our hammies and using the whole leg
up<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> down<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.530> fairly<00:01:26.040> straight<00:01:27.030> position

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
up and down a fairly straight position

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.730 
up and down a fairly straight position
but<00:01:27.720> relaxed<00:01:28.200> position<00:01:30.320> let's<00:01:31.320> look<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.560> some

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
but relaxed position let's look at some

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.380 
but relaxed position let's look at some
of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> drills<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.640> use<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.150> develop

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
of the drills that we can use to develop

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.460 
of the drills that we can use to develop
the<00:01:33.659> speed<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.829> our<00:01:35.070> backstroke<00:01:36.060> kick<00:01:36.409> one<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the speed in our backstroke kick one of

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
the speed in our backstroke kick one of
the<00:01:37.530> things<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.890> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the things I do a lot of in all the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
the things I do a lot of in all the
strokes<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.869> through<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.110> lot<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.470> vertical

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
strokes is is through a lot of vertical

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
strokes is is through a lot of vertical
kicking<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:42.420> sometimes<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.079> with

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
kicking we sometimes do that with

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
kicking we sometimes do that with
weights<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:44.369> medicine<00:01:44.850> balls<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.210> our<00:01:45.329> chest

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
weights or medicine balls on our chest

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
weights or medicine balls on our chest
or<00:01:46.170> sometimes<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.860> use<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.220> poolside

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430

factors<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.200> were<00:01:52.290> trying<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> develop

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
factors so if we were trying to develop

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.399 
factors so if we were trying to develop
speed<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:54.060> would<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:54.570> 10<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.049> 15

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409

seconds<00:01:55.860> trying<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> fastest<00:01:57.719> action

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
seconds trying to get a fastest action

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.300 
seconds trying to get a fastest action
as<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.290> possibly<00:01:58.680> can

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
as we possibly can

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.389 
as we possibly can
but<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> find<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> an<00:02:00.689> easy<00:02:01.020> way<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.770> get

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
but I find this is an easy way to get

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.550 
but I find this is an easy way to get
the<00:02:02.549> pressure<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> kick<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the pressure on the kick so we get the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
the pressure on the kick so we get the
propulsion<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.399> kick<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.850> also<00:02:06.450> on

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
propulsion on the up kick and also on

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.779 
propulsion on the up kick and also on
the<00:02:06.659> down<00:02:06.869> kick<00:02:07.170> now<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.160> notice<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.610> at

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the down kick now just notice now at

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510 
the down kick now just notice now at
Daniel<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.420> his<00:02:09.959> vertical<00:02:10.319> kicking<00:02:10.830> how<00:02:11.340> his

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
Daniel with his vertical kicking how his

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.490 
Daniel with his vertical kicking how his
toes<00:02:11.760> remain<00:02:12.390> extended

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500

a<00:02:13.620> good<00:02:13.980> relaxed<00:02:14.490> action<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.060> notice<00:02:15.810> how

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
a good relaxed action and notice how

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.930 
a good relaxed action and notice how
he's<00:02:16.140> getting<00:02:16.260> propulsion<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.580> front

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
he's getting propulsion on the front

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.770 
he's getting propulsion on the front
movement<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.080> backward<00:02:19.530> movement
