 Moin Moin viewers of or finds Berlin welcome to 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.009
 the app uses Lord of Test Track Chon 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
 Let's Play Together Challenge 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.569
 but before I do 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.849
 start with this game 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:18.829
 around 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.380
 I have a pizza for you and Swatch 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.159
 you have uploaded this video from this point on board 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.269
 Slopes next 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.579
 Nuremberg on Monday 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.400
 Customers from that mothers of 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 stand with the description 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.300
 have the possible options to choose my character you see I've got there 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.729
 always started 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.160
 the video is up to 17 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.270
 So you are allowed 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.470
 my character choose that of a partner but not for my opinion 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.450
 which are available for selection 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.450
 7 characters 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.680
 seven character classes to choose from 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.910
 from left to right the Apart 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.900
 the Amazon gap can be of use to lock 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.950
 fight 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.900
 so lock the litter 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.620
 Single player and that will 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.570
 accounts for BOM fighting 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.220
 pretty mass killing 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.250
 So class really 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 Mass destruction is written here quite large 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.930
 then we would have the assassins out of them 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.380
 a Med NorCom skills take their opponents apart but also with falling 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.430
 which, in the case of Cissé, destroy measures 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.430
 Act 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.579
 Honoré Daumier's cloak has to summon or top dead 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.780
 the collar 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.080
 As the name already suggests, he can and skeleton splatter evokes the dead 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 Marias Klettke mark the device 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.530
 around 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.840
 Resuscitate a monster 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.990
 at a certain level 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.640
 Summon Bohlens but it can also curse very well so 5 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 divide the opponent's weaknesses 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.239
 and around 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.940
 He also has some poison and bone skills with which he is also pretty 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.859
 great for mass destruction 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.269
 can organize 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.019
 then discarded 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.599
 He was indeed great at mass destruction Sannitz Carsten 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.529
 Gersdorf an ability 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:34.299
 otherwise in front of Anna Kemper, which is quite unspectacular 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.060
 Jones was already over him, although he still can 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.000
 he still has pretty strong to argue about the roasting and portraits 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.529
 Percent "Man of the Bieb 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:51.259
 Increase or strengthen the life of mates of the ERC Group 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.259
 Peking 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.089
 paladin 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.199
 The bollard is going to cash Karen everything the barbarian can 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.379
 just in my opinion 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.729
 better 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.689
 he has percent augrund none 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.179
 the no mana cost 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:13.459
 may for a workup ManU be active at the same time 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.109
 unless you have different 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.670
 than otherwise the AUA 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.670
 but also have sometime later in the Challenge 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.239
 he has 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.330
 NorCom skills that were pretty damning to the masses 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.499
 but the woman was completely cold as well 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.499
 badly damaging percent 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.749
 and the pretty strong protective room 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.609
 or more protection before and in Dessau and still 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.609
 to 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.319
 for goods 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.389
 boat 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.489
 or the sorceress is actually completely new to mass destruction 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.669
 that can be designed 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.949
 to light up the elemental fire of lightning and ice 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.109
 and pretty devastating 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.559
 So in terms of mass destruction, there are probably no I think 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.079
 Class of those so far the 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.699
 somehow approaching the damage of the sorceress 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:16.900
 Know woman 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.209
 Yavuz good to them 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.319
 minute 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.300
 In my opinion, the most versatile would have to be me 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.229
 he can 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.809
 Summon animals 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.729
 he can Allemann kicked with a salsa with the wife were about to shoot 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.059
 the 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.599
 Damage can but also watch only possible if the 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.249
 In-house mail changed 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.369
 he is a bit weaker than the Amazon the Offense Line and the 

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:46.439
 sorceress 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.919
 still very funny to see the whole country 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.969
 then he can still 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.969
 otherwise he would not be a druid if he were not 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.599
 Which could transform only 16, including only 2 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.740
 AR 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.600
 who BA and the werewolf have pretty heavy thunderstorms on 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:10.729
 so 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.729
 where does it stop growing no more grass 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.529
 good that probably already to the classes 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.400
 As I said it is one of the ZKE Reto Keller Challenge 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.620
 I will not play alone 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.509
 my partner will come to that 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.319
 when the time comes 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.170
 and 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.809
 Picture I Sprothen on active participation 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.249
 at the Walter class and I'm really curious what class I'm from 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:41.409
 you aufrummt 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.099
 who will get then 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.499
 percent or should I mention 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:50.499
 Device says what's special about this challenge 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.210
 the main reason why I think cells shame him 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.069
 is a definite one 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.069
 Modos for yourself 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.089
 10 2 percent hardcore 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:05.749
 that means 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.749
 Wenisch 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.889
 should or should my partner be staring during these cells 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.889
 Spit on this challenge for this person 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:19.869
 that has it all 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:20.919
 second 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.629
 Of course that is completely over 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.499
 only if he fails 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:28.419
 who will go on alone for a while, including me 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.419
 Failure will be 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.379
 bayer-profi has actually just said I do not know how scratches 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.529
 For Random Geblubber definitely profile means Haiterbach Arco means 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.479
 If the character dies, Roth says he can not be revived AP 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:48.330
 percent 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.439
 Do not come back to town or any other way 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:52.680
 and I will 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.020
 this game 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.010
 complete 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.010
 normal by NATO is my primary goal 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.699
 complete act 1 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.430
 2 3 4 and soon additional clock 5 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.630
 and as far as the stars 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.220
 so far there is no German complete let's exist 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.849
 Get up funds or let's play from Diablo 2 because people have stopped in the 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:21.159
 Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:25.769
 tattoo around the game seems so boring for tattoo tattoo 

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:27.439
 she does not need to understand 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.949
 because I have spent two and a half years of my life with this game 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.909
 but that's the good piece he's off 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:37.909
 or is already a long way back 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.190
 I just dug up in March some time ago 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.889
 Hard drive popped and thought 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:44.879
 Damascus 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:48.229
 that could make it in the challenge 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:52.990
 The Wars I think now so far from my side and around there was the 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.379
 morning 

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:55.039
 Until next time 

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:55.569
