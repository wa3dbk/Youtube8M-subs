00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
very heavy

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.249 
very heavy
Luke<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:24.009> like<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> tank<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:26.919> moves<00:04:27.310> slowly<00:04:28.259> but

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
Luke is like a tank it moves slowly but

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.219 
Luke is like a tank it moves slowly but
crushes<00:04:30.009> everything<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.349> in<00:04:32.919> its<00:04:33.370> way

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
crushes everything that is in its way

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.990 
crushes everything that is in its way
maybe<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:36.310> paint<00:04:36.669> this<00:04:36.910> knife<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.650> king

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
maybe I can paint this knife to the king

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.520 
maybe I can paint this knife to the king
but<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.800> not<00:04:42.099> wise<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:43.199> move<00:04:44.199> a<00:04:44.860> piece<00:04:45.849> flies

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
but it is not wise to move a piece flies

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:54.900 
but it is not wise to move a piece flies
when<00:04:47.530> opening<00:04:49.349> so<00:04:52.319> maybe<00:04:53.319> a<00:04:53.530> better<00:04:53.919> idea<00:04:54.310> is

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
when opening so maybe a better idea is

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.010 
when opening so maybe a better idea is
to<00:04:55.690> detain<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.500> night<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:57.310> at<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.810> same

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
to detain this night and at the same

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.510 
to detain this night and at the same
time<00:04:59.409> to<00:05:00.069> develop<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.639> piece<00:05:00.849> now<00:05:02.520> he's

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
time to develop a piece now he's

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.670 
time to develop a piece now he's
thinking

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
thinking

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.520 
thinking
hahaha<00:05:05.680> now<00:05:06.669> he<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.330> thinking<00:05:08.759> rooks<00:05:09.759> are<00:05:10.539> very

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
hahaha now he is thinking rooks are very

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:18.110 
hahaha now he is thinking rooks are very
powerful<00:05:12.389> and<00:05:13.389> very<00:05:13.800> valuable<00:05:16.259> like<00:05:17.259> any

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
powerful and very valuable like any

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.680 
powerful and very valuable like any
weapon<00:05:19.120> in<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.449> Russian<00:05:19.840> army

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
the tank is millions of dollars and so

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.570 
the tank is millions of dollars and so
is<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:29.560> rook<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.539> pondering<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:33.400> meaning

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
is the rook is it pondering the meaning

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:42.629 
is the rook is it pondering the meaning
of<00:05:33.940> life<00:05:37.889> we<00:05:38.889> will<00:05:39.099> have<00:05:39.509> to<00:05:40.509> wait<00:05:40.719> for<00:05:41.639> the

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
of life we will have to wait for the

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:50.490 
of life we will have to wait for the
answer<00:05:45.090> this<00:05:46.090> one<00:05:46.650> has<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.949> king's<00:05:48.340> mark<00:05:49.500> this

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
answer this one has a king's mark this

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.830 
answer this one has a king's mark this
is<00:05:50.860> because<00:05:51.280> in<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.360> old<00:05:52.599> American<00:05:53.729> notation

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
is because in the old American notation

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.969 
is because in the old American notation
they<00:05:55.840> used<00:05:56.199> to<00:05:56.740> mark<00:05:57.509> the<00:05:58.509> King's<00:05:58.840> rook<00:05:59.259> and

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:07.589 
they used to mark the King's rook and
the<00:06:00.449> King's<00:06:01.500> Knight<00:06:04.080> with<00:06:05.080> a<00:06:05.110> small<00:06:05.560> crown<00:06:06.599> so

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
the King's Knight with a small crown so

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.550 
the King's Knight with a small crown so
that<00:06:07.930> you<00:06:08.139> know<00:06:08.849> which<00:06:09.849> rook<00:06:10.409> started<00:06:11.409> the

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560

it is the most interesting piece of them
all

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
all

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.970 
all
it<00:06:36.370> is<00:06:36.610> a<00:06:36.640> simple<00:06:37.030> pound<00:06:37.600> a<00:06:38.490> simple<00:06:39.490> peasant

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
it is a simple pound a simple peasant

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:49.440 
it is a simple pound a simple peasant
but<00:06:42.810> the<00:06:43.810> peasant<00:06:44.440> is<00:06:44.710> small<00:06:46.230> and<00:06:47.550> puny<00:06:48.550> only

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
but the peasant is small and puny only

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.080 
but the peasant is small and puny only
then<00:06:49.690> alone<00:06:50.610> when<00:06:51.610> the<00:06:51.850> peasants<00:06:52.180> gang<00:06:52.990> up<00:06:54.090> and

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.560 

forward<00:07:07.500> but<00:07:08.500> I'm<00:07:08.710> afraid<00:07:08.890> this<00:07:09.640> night<00:07:09.970> will

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
forward but I'm afraid this night will

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.210 
forward but I'm afraid this night will
be<00:07:10.780> pushed<00:07:11.110> away<00:07:11.650> by<00:07:12.570> these<00:07:13.570> three<00:07:14.320> key<00:07:14.530> pounds

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
be pushed away by these three key pounds

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.110 
be pushed away by these three key pounds
and<00:07:15.370> they<00:07:16.150> become<00:07:16.510> very<00:07:16.780> powerful<00:07:17.910> when<00:07:18.910> they

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 
and they become very powerful when they

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.980 
and they become very powerful when they
support<00:07:19.690> each<00:07:19.960> other<00:07:21.150> when<00:07:22.150> they<00:07:22.330> care<00:07:22.630> for

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
support each other when they care for

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.040 
support each other when they care for
each<00:07:23.140> other<00:07:23.880> when<00:07:24.880> they<00:07:25.150> love<00:07:25.450> each<00:07:25.990> other<00:07:26.970> and

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
each other when they love each other and

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:36.870 
each other when they love each other and
when<00:07:29.050> they<00:07:29.190> sacrifice<00:07:30.190> for<00:07:31.230> each<00:07:32.230> other<00:07:35.880> you

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 
when they sacrifice for each other you

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:46.839 
when they sacrifice for each other you
Castle<00:07:37.860> yourself
