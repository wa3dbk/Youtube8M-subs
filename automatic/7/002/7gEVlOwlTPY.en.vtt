00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 Hello everyone, Ivan is still with you today 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.749
 tell you again about object 704 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.839
 Soviet Fri-Sau ninth level in 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:24.570
 past my video i called this fri sau 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.230
 dull and kosorilym still earthen 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 worm 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.409
 but of course any earth worm 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.739
 there may be epic fights with brutal 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.870
 trudge up there without any sadness 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.390
 the gun will hit every shot well 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.820
 any any degree to sarah flippers 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.920
 absolutely and even if our Fri-Sau 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 designed for standing in the bushes from not 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.579
 mean we are all slaughter stand in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.710
 bushes 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.929
 there are always exceptions there are always 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.629
 brutal naked I'd shoot a palm tree 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.660
 projectile goes to hell knows where guys 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.850
 just here it dissolves in the air you 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 Can't imagine how I burned 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.640
 since the last battle is still when I fuck 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 knows where the shells were and the shells 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.740
 actually disappear in two 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 cases 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 in the first case you did not hit at all 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.320
 nowhere 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.049
 the projectile flew off somewhere exploded somewhere 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.210
 know outside your and second 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.280
 the case before the tank in which you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 shot stood another tank and you hit 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.799
 just this very different tank this 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 battle epic it's a battle gone know y 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.880
 we are unsuccessful here 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
 passed the bat that showed you 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.469
 on to the marina here everything flies even 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 if she misses an enemy tank 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.850
 it still does not mean gets on 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.790
 another enemy tank 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 Here is the team despite the fact that it seems 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.219
 according to statistics should merge plays 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.340
 fine 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.320
 she shines well that is all the time in 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.470
 the light hit enemy tanks I'm all 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.570
 time they shoot at 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.100
 not all the time shells disappear can 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.380
 say all the missing shells 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.350
 then at the end of the fight I could find 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.990
 watch here actually one of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.650
 in patients whose account you now 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.020
 projectile is enemy ferdinand well and 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.000
 here a very successful position succeeded 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.740
 take a few know the position successful 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.050
 but it is generally in life this position 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.180
 successful is one of the best positions on 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.760
 This card is generally for almost any 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.430
 Tank very well that my comrades on 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.030
 team center shine with the entire center 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.650
 glow 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.920
 it is possible with this position very well 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.660
 throw as a rule and the players are not very 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.850
 I understand the tactics they do not really understand 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.760
 what if there were some tanks occupied 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.220
 position means they need to shift to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.350
 they could shoot from this position here 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.540
 we go to the lion and I see no point 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.130
 here generally stand because we 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.890
 a huge numerical advantage on this 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.670
 flank a 40 four very competently 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.100
 comes she comes back me too 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.900
 flipping back to not 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.209
 interfere with my teammate we 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.550
 Naturally all this plea we make out well 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.680
 there our third tank should have 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.019
 would just stop by the bar just 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.840
 so as not to stand under his barrel 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.209
 no matter how much his side needed 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.040
 how could you figure it out but it's not 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.930
 that in this case does not affect as you can see 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.870
 the enemy merges in full 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.959
 I know who's got 42 percent on 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.770
 victory i see that sneaker i 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.160
 I can not shoot it there 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.560
 hiding on the base trying to kick it I 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.080
 the food go here so I can see on the balcony 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.080
 what is there i am enemy yagtigr and 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.120
 there obviously wants to break through one more 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.730
 lion food meal food meal meal with my 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.370
 teammates get up in a bush and 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.490
 I 'm starting to come down to an enemy act 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.460
 the usual game from such a distance of course 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.260
 I miss a distance of 200 meters 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.350
 that's a lot for my fri-sau 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.830
 but here I get for a change 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.100
 well and since i have very very very 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.650
 very epic recharge in this sauna 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.180
 for 750 damage a single time you have to pay 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.210
 naturally i'm literally on some share 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.280
 I don't have time for a second 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.070
 mod that blocks the shooting of corpses 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.560
 but the moment I shot 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.630
 the enemy tank was not a corpse yet 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.970
 and here let's look here on our 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.540
 wonderful chassis at all on its quality 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.220
 look how epic I'm going i mean i 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.710
 there was just a little more to 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.430
 return your body to take a closer look 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.260
 to drive out here and barely have me 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.250
 my fun rides usb and and of course for 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.160
 nervous I just leave the enemy 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.080
 lion 's not coming down then in general without 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.150
 complete information too shoot him too 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.340
 fall there you know know fights 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.020
 when each and projectile will fall 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.430
 bikes are generally live 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.050
 Well, here I am here the enemy tiger 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.180
 body bevel falls 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.970
 I generally had hoped that he was not the selection will 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.800
 Well, it didnâ€™t work out unfortunately 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.080
 here I just stupidly drive past the tiger 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.620
 why do i need a more tasty target there 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.800
 worth 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.300
 tiger of course with such a topic ofigel long 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.759
 thought of whom to shoot at whom 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.150
 unfold well and as a result I 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.909
 sucked off very very fat damage with 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.789
 arson on enemy fun is all very 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.669
 well I go well and farther in 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.199
 dividing the last two frags i 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.580
 I can not participate unfortunately all 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.400
 everything will end without me 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.810
 I get three medals I get new ones 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.060
 medals main caliber 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:35.669
 arrow and support well and see 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:40.620
 the result is economy tank almost 30,000 i 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:44.430
 nafarmil 1200 pure experience i got and 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.129
 more than 7 thousand damage I dealt with 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.770
 two shots very well see entered 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.270
 blinds shorts a to other tanks and 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.430
 principle, I missed only one 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.050
 the only time I shot a palm tree 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.289
 and he suddenly 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.449
 while the projectile was flying died in general that I 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.520
 I can say well, fun bends of course 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.759
 same i like as i said in the previous 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.759
 video and in principle of course she has 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:13.229
 there are good funny battles but in principle 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.800
