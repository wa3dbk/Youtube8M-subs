 This computer mouse is, here it is this 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.270

 silver has a red black bill 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.950
 some in this case consider how 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.830
 I would buy this mouse to my wife 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.560
 There is she principle color and chose 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.740
 Well, in principle, as if the color is of particular importance 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.320
 has 2 hours consider its external savings 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.040
 in advance very interesting that is 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.140
 enough 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.190
 let's say not bored everyday 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.410
 as ordinary mouse but this here 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.960
 futuristic even so to speak 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:36.970
 it seems to him something and earthly something 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:41.180
 here that is, the mouse opens and 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:47.390
 so here we from is on the table here 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.860
 so we take advantage we will drive then 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.689
 there is here we have a cap 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.610
 which opened us have a usb receiver 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.560
 which we insert our computer or 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:05.200
 laptop here we have a bay for 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.720
 batteries it is powered by two batteries 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.070
 3g standard 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.630
 it is written that we work 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:17.600
 start those 2 4 gigahertz cool here 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.720
 we are just an infrared sensor which 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:27.540
 take the signal surface moves 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:30.390
 a button of our mouse wheel piss 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 let's try inserting batteries for me 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:47.180
 and batteries and about miracle it earned 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:51.209
 great to hold in your hands and and in principle I 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.970
 would say what is convenient because 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.099
 whole palm rests entirely on the mouse all 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.670
 so it is clear that there is such a couple 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.439
 drunk once passes that is the back 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.989
 not failing that is if not 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.510
 put your hand but she's good all palm 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.090
 relies on the mouse itself and pretty 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.980
 comfortable and move the side edges here they are 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.620
 plastic but honestly she 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.939
 the feeling is nothing like rubber 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.659
 that is, we are for the fact that they are 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:24.689
 grooved but then as it's sense of 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.659
 There is such a right mouse at all 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.569
 The cost is about six dollars 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.000
 have a wireless mouse for $ 6 with 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.940
 this design seems to be simple 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.560
 fiction because the cheapest 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.019
 models that are sold to our market 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.400
 start from 12 dollars but it's like 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.829
 close even 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:50.729
 they are after the mouse is not lying still very 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.989
 interesting in this mouse which is very convenient 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.769
 transport if you use 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:00.379
 laptop or netbook put here 8 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.699
 the receiver as you can see the power is turned off 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:08.370
 that is, in this way you can save 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:11.489
 battery charge and can you be sure 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.769
 that I will not lose you this too 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.030
 very important principle of transportation in 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:21.380
 principle can also be at home when not 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.060
 enjoys easy and close and all 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.070
 such a cool thing 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.680
 it turns out I would love it 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.340
 I have not used on the computer 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.210
 Works fine according to seller statements 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.120
 specifications which 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.830
 he wrote something about 600 thousand dp 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.290
 I do not know what cults are like but 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.170
 works well fine money back 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.990
