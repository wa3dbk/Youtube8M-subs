00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.859

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.859

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.660
 westfield and highlight namely on 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.190
 westfield city will be expanded that 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 will allow you to cover the flank on the board from 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.670
 lumbago slightly raise the landscape zones 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.160
 cutting to reduce time 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 expendable uphill added 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.860
 some shelter allowing 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.300
 move along flank well and still 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.910
 some changes you can 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.070
 see right now on their screens 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.449
 now hi you added elevations 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.460
 that will enable the center 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.019
 maps move safely around the flank 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.059
 there are also some changes 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.650
 associated with vegetation namely 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.019
 removed the forest in one place added in 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.560
 friend well, and he himself was transferred to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.150
 center of the map creation 7 y well 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.190
 the main thing is to have a balance 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.380
 it is also worth noting that some 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.790
 opinions touch card prokhorovka but here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.570
 yet without special details 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.580
 next new french with t-10m x30 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 many have heard about him but not all 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.270
 know about those and here before I say about 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 them a few words should be mentioned 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 that it really hurts you 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.320
 can still change a hundred times and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 blah blah blah 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.969
 the gun personally reminds me about 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.979
 what is e50m only worse plan 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.200
 accuracy rate of fire and but 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.259
 not much still scatter 032 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.799
 it's pretty accurate straight seat 2 and 3 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.409
 also go as well as pierce and 260 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.409
 millimeters to a projectile base with 390 damage 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.640
 you probably have enough but I repeat it 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.600
 preliminary tth 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.549
 it is still very early to judge at all 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.590
 short notes on 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.810
 changes of some american cars 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 so for example, learning will be better 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.080
 the corners of the vertical pickup was seven 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.380
 10 t28 concept will be added 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.090
 one crew member minus loader and have 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.640
 superpershing like many others 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.710
 tanks transferred leaders slightly 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.560
 change the armor and the last for today 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.830
 news on 10 Windows were tested 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.590
 tanks and a miracle on the new operating 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.510
 system tanks give a little more fps 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.270
 well really it is only about 5 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.550
 percent but the fact remains 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.210
 Now you can start thinking about 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.270
 buying from buying dec 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.650
