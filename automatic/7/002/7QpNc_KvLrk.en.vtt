00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
material is set we're gonna now slide in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.790 
material is set we're gonna now slide in
our<00:00:24.480> impression<00:00:25.080> coping<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.650> actually

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
our impression coping and we're actually

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.660 
our impression coping and we're actually
going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> inject<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> around<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
going to inject in and around that that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.120 
going to inject in and around that that
area<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:32.700> let's<00:00:33.270> find<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.899> let's<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
area so let's find out let's see that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.400 
area so let's find out let's see that
way<00:00:35.809> first<00:00:36.809> thing<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> gotta<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
way first thing you gotta do is you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.720 
way first thing you gotta do is you
gotta<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.649> sure<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> buckle<00:00:38.489> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
gotta make sure you got the buckle and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
gotta make sure you got the buckle and
the<00:00:38.940> lingual<00:00:39.300> lined<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.719> properly<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.379> that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the lingual lined up properly so that's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.319 
the lingual lined up properly so that's
that's<00:00:41.040> important<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> again<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that's important so again this is the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
that's important so again this is the
buckle<00:00:45.660> aspect<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> lingual<00:00:46.890> this

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
buckle aspect that's a lingual this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
buckle aspect that's a lingual this
double<00:00:47.489> check<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:49.079> make<00:00:49.110> sure<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> yes<00:00:52.140> indeed

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
double check to make sure and yes indeed

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.850 
double check to make sure and yes indeed
that's<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.340> stay<00:00:54.000> oriented<00:00:54.860> now

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that's what it is so stay oriented now

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
that's what it is so stay oriented now
imagine<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:57.090> without<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.690> blue

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
imagine if this was without the blue

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.450 
imagine if this was without the blue
material<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.680> would<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.129> place<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
material you would then just place that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.410 
material you would then just place that
in<00:00:59.730> there<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> thin

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
in there like so and you want the thin

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
in there like so and you want the thin
portion<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> inner<00:01:07.460> proximate<00:01:08.460> wien<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
portion in the inner proximate wien the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
portion in the inner proximate wien the
teeth<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.600> tighten<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.110> down

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
teeth then tighten it down

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.969 
teeth then tighten it down
hand<00:01:10.979> tighten<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> down<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.970> sixteen<00:01:12.979> fifteen

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
hand tighten it down to sixteen fifteen

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.760 
hand tighten it down to sixteen fifteen
or<00:01:14.189> sixteen<00:01:14.400> newton<00:01:15.119> centimeters<00:01:18.409> once<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.619> do

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
or sixteen newton centimeters once we do

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
or sixteen newton centimeters once we do
that<00:01:20.009> everything<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.909> I'm<00:01:21.060> gonna<00:01:21.240> lower

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that everything is in I'm gonna lower

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.410 
that everything is in I'm gonna lower
the<00:01:21.689> light<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:25.670> we'll<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.850> ready<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.150> our

hand piece and a burr all right let's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:17.400 
hand piece and a burr all right let's
just<00:02:07.870> trim<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.410> little<00:02:08.830> bit<00:02:15.930> there<00:02:16.930> we<00:02:17.050> go

just trim that a little bit there we go
now<00:02:17.590> that's<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.070> cingulum<00:02:18.730> area<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.090> just

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
now that's the cingulum area I'm just

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.910 
now that's the cingulum area I'm just
trimming<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.780> back<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.050> little<00:02:20.350> bit<00:02:20.530> giving<00:02:20.860> a

little<00:02:21.130> more<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.460> depth<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:23.650> can

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
little more of a depth to it so we can

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.710 
little more of a depth to it so we can
see<00:02:24.070> we're<00:02:24.250> gonna<00:02:24.370> spray<00:02:24.760> air<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.300> there<00:02:25.510> get

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
see we're gonna spray air in there get

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.870 
see we're gonna spray air in there get
all<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.050> out<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.380> there<00:02:28.230> okay<00:02:29.640> let's<00:02:30.640> put
