00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.609
 as soon as it does with hand processed and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.009

 experience 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.380
 I'm full of the motocycles in 1986 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.940
 founded with the idea extraordinary 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.520
 to build motorcycles own 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 construct and sell 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.930
 you like it just north three 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.300

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.560
 already build a small booked 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.210
 here manufacture principle for everything yourself 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.620
 until the drive we catch 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.270
 actually where harley davidson 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.200
 Of course, I want to be in the same style as me 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:24.550
 I started practicing through life 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.370
 always better just study directly on the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.830
 bike on summer already happened most 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.020
 and then that went hard for hours 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.640
 where you try it all night long 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 works because he has to stop by 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.820
