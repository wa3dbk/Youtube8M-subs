00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
like and let's see as far as miso soup

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.309 
like and let's see as far as miso soup
goes<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:02.220> made<00:03:02.580> from<00:03:02.610> soybeans<00:03:03.090> as<00:03:03.660> most

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
goes it's made from soybeans as most

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.550 
goes it's made from soybeans as most
things<00:03:04.650> are<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.220> Japan<00:03:05.670> um<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.110> made<00:03:07.350> from

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
things are in Japan um so it's made from

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.000 
things are in Japan um so it's made from
soy<00:03:08.010> beans<00:03:08.450> rice<00:03:09.450> or<00:03:09.810> barley<00:03:10.560> or<00:03:10.920> a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
soy beans rice or barley or a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.080 
soy beans rice or barley or a
combination<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.450> three<00:03:12.480> okay<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.609> red

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
combination of the three okay so the red

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.479 
combination of the three okay so the red
with<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.720> red<00:03:15.900> miso<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.530> reason<00:03:17.070> why<00:03:17.250> it's

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
with the red miso the reason why it's

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.699 
with the red miso the reason why it's
red<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.970> because<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.480> has<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> higher<00:03:19.049> soybean

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
red is because it has a higher soybean

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.030 
red is because it has a higher soybean
content<00:03:20.250> least<00:03:21.120> that's<00:03:21.299> what<00:03:21.420> I'm<00:03:21.510> hearing<00:03:21.780> a

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
content least that's what I'm hearing a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.710 
content least that's what I'm hearing a
higher<00:03:23.040> soybean<00:03:23.549> content<00:03:24.030> than<00:03:24.209> other<00:03:24.450> types

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
higher soybean content than other types

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.590 
higher soybean content than other types
and<00:03:25.970> as<00:03:26.970> far<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.769> Sheetal<00:03:28.769> me<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.359> this<00:03:30.359> has

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
and as far as the Sheetal me so this has

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.509 
and as far as the Sheetal me so this has
like<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.140> guess<00:03:31.560> they<00:03:31.709> must<00:03:31.950> use<00:03:32.100> more<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
like I guess they must use more of the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.190 
like I guess they must use more of the
rice<00:03:32.730> or<00:03:32.970> barley<00:03:33.150> which<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.810> why<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.140> a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
rice or barley which is why it's a

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.979 
rice or barley which is why it's a
lighter<00:03:34.410> color<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.000> Allah<00:03:36.329> say<00:03:36.540> me

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
lighter color and then the Allah say me

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.020 
lighter color and then the Allah say me
so<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.500> mix<00:03:37.739> kind<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> mix<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
so is it mix kind of like a mix of the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.069 
so is it mix kind of like a mix of the
two<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:40.350> color<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.220> also<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.359> between<00:03:42.720> the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
two and the color is also in between the

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.830 
two and the color is also in between the
two<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:44.400> white<00:03:44.609> miso<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.570> actually

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
two and with white miso is not actually

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.620 
two and with white miso is not actually
white<00:03:46.730> you'll<00:03:47.730> see<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.299> moment<00:03:48.570> I'm

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
white you'll see in just a moment I'm

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.630 
white you'll see in just a moment I'm
going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.810> show<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.170> paste<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:50.280> miso

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
going to show you the paste the miso

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.030 
going to show you the paste the miso
paste<00:03:50.880> isn't<00:03:51.359> white<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.739> make<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
paste isn't white but when you make the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.440 
paste isn't white but when you make the
soup<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.489> ends<00:03:53.700> up<00:03:53.790> being<00:03:53.819> like<00:03:54.120> an<00:03:54.269> off-white

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
soup it ends up being like an off-white

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.069 
soup it ends up being like an off-white
ish<00:03:54.840> color<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:56.670> think<00:03:57.209> that's<00:03:57.420> pretty<00:03:57.840> much

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
ish color and I think that's pretty much

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.620 
ish color and I think that's pretty much
everything<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.859> get<00:03:58.980> us<00:03:59.130> started<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> i'm

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
everything to get us started so i'm

going to show you what the different

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.160 
going to show you what the different
types<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.890> pace<00:04:02.130> look<00:04:02.609> like<00:04:02.880> different<00:04:03.720> pastes

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
types of pace look like different pastes

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.319 
types of pace look like different pastes
look<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.980> then<00:04:05.010> we'll<00:04:05.760> make<00:04:05.910> some<00:04:06.120> soup

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
look like and then we'll make some soup

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.000 
look like and then we'll make some soup
ok<00:04:06.840> see<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.859> soon<00:04:09.290> ok<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.350> let's<00:04:10.650> look<00:04:10.739> at<00:04:10.889> the

ok see you soon ok so let's look at the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.550 
ok see you soon ok so let's look at the
three<00:04:11.280> different<00:04:11.670> types<00:04:11.819> of<00:04:12.060> miso<00:04:12.540> paste<00:04:12.810> ok

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
three different types of miso paste ok

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.460 
three different types of miso paste ok
so<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.310> first<00:04:14.340> one<00:04:14.730> here<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.989> kadeshi

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
so the first one here this is a kadeshi

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.099 
so the first one here this is a kadeshi
and<00:04:16.979> i<00:04:17.760> don't<00:04:17.940> know<00:04:18.090> why<00:04:18.269> this<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.510> coloured

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
and i don't know why this is coloured

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.270 
and i don't know why this is coloured
brown<00:04:19.470> instead

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
brown instead

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.820 
brown instead
read<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:21.150> is<00:04:21.359> actually<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.810> color<00:04:21.989> red<00:04:22.200> but

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
read this is actually the color red but

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.810 
read this is actually the color red but
this<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.460> our<00:04:23.670> red<00:04:23.910> miso<00:04:24.330> paste<00:04:24.540> okay<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.920> now

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
this is our red miso paste okay so now

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:40.150 
this is our red miso paste okay so now
just<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.180> show<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.360> what<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.780> looks<00:04:27.810> like

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.260 

okay<00:04:40.970> so<00:04:41.030> that's<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.600> red<00:04:41.810> miso<00:04:42.200> paste<00:04:46.270> okay

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
okay so that's the red miso paste okay

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.170 
okay so that's the red miso paste okay
and<00:04:47.480> this<00:04:47.690> is<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.550> Sheetal<00:04:49.550> or<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.940> white

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
and this is the Sheetal or the white

00:04:50.180 --> 00:05:03.119 
and this is the Sheetal or the white
miso<00:04:50.750> paste<00:04:51.070> okay<00:04:55.750> oops

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129

and<00:05:03.669> as<00:05:03.879> you<00:05:04.029> can<00:05:04.209> see<00:05:04.239> that's<00:05:04.599> not<00:05:04.869> white<00:05:05.289> at

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:05.559 
and as you can see that's not white at

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.439 
and as you can see that's not white at
all<00:05:05.739> but<00:05:06.429> when<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.639> actually<00:05:06.729> make<00:05:07.029> the<00:05:07.209> soup

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
all but when you actually make the soup

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:15.619 
all but when you actually make the soup
you'll<00:05:07.659> see<00:05:07.869> why<00:05:08.459> ok<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:13.529> the<00:05:14.529> last<00:05:14.559> one<00:05:14.949> I

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
you'll see why ok and the last one I

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.199 
you'll see why ok and the last one I
mean<00:05:16.629> this<00:05:16.719> is<00:05:16.929> the<00:05:17.050> AH<00:05:17.080> wass<00:05:17.439> a<00:05:17.679> missile<00:05:18.309> ok<00:05:18.999> I

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:19.209 
mean this is the AH wass a missile ok I

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:36.710 
mean this is the AH wass a missile ok I
loss<00:05:19.809> a<00:05:19.959> missile<00:05:20.379> or<00:05:21.029> the<00:05:22.029> mixed<00:05:22.479> miso<00:05:23.050> paste

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.230 

okay<00:05:37.500> so<00:05:38.130> that's<00:05:38.310> really<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.700> difference<00:05:38.880> if

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
okay so that's really the difference if

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.620 
okay so that's really the difference if
you<00:05:39.270> take<00:05:39.540> a<00:05:39.570> look<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:40.590> course<00:05:40.950> like<00:05:41.220> the

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
you take a look of course like the

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.130 
you take a look of course like the
kadeshi<00:05:42.630> or<00:05:43.230> the<00:05:43.950> red<00:05:44.190> miso<00:05:44.610> is<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.940> lot<00:05:45.810> darker

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
kadeshi or the red miso is a lot darker

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.820 
kadeshi or the red miso is a lot darker
than<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.470> other<00:05:46.500> two<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:47.130> it's<00:05:48.090> also<00:05:48.330> like

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
than the other two and it's also like

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.250 
than the other two and it's also like
it's<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.980> heavier<00:05:50.430> paste<00:05:50.760> as<00:05:51.000> well<00:05:51.240> so<00:05:51.870> when<00:05:52.170> you

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
it's a heavier paste as well so when you

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.930 
it's a heavier paste as well so when you
put<00:05:52.410> it<00:05:52.560> in<00:05:52.680> your<00:05:52.710> soup<00:05:53.370> is<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.550> little<00:05:53.820> bit

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
put it in your soup is a little bit

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.800 
put it in your soup is a little bit
thicker<00:05:54.320> not<00:05:55.320> much<00:05:55.560> but<00:05:55.800> a<00:05:55.860> little<00:05:55.950> bit<00:05:56.370> and<00:05:56.810> in

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
thicker not much but a little bit and in

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.810 
thicker not much but a little bit and in
my<00:05:57.870> opinion<00:05:58.140> this<00:05:58.560> one<00:05:58.770> is<00:05:58.860> like<00:05:59.010> has<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.340> harder

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
my opinion this one is like has a harder

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.260 
my opinion this one is like has a harder
your<00:06:00.000> taste<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.310> and<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.580> middle<00:06:02.820> one<00:06:02.970> if

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
your taste to it and the middle one if

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.630 
your taste to it and the middle one if
you<00:06:03.660> notice<00:06:04.440> with<00:06:04.650> this<00:06:04.800> one<00:06:05.040> the<00:06:05.160> paste<00:06:05.430> is<00:06:05.610> a

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
you notice with this one the paste is a

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.560 
you notice with this one the paste is a
lot<00:06:05.850> softer<00:06:06.560> it's<00:06:07.560> a<00:06:07.710> very<00:06:07.860> soft<00:06:08.160> paste<00:06:08.570> and

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
lot softer it's a very soft paste and

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.480 
lot softer it's a very soft paste and
with<00:06:10.170> this<00:06:10.290> one<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.650> has<00:06:10.800> maybe<00:06:11.070> more<00:06:11.340> of<00:06:11.400> the

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
with this one it has maybe more of the

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.310 
with this one it has maybe more of the
soybeans<00:06:11.910> or<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.360> I'm<00:06:12.750> sorry<00:06:12.990> more<00:06:13.200> of<00:06:13.260> the

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
soybeans or the I'm sorry more of the

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.440 
soybeans or the I'm sorry more of the
barley<00:06:13.650> or<00:06:13.680> rice<00:06:13.980> in<00:06:14.250> it<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:15.000> it's<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.270> much

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
barley or rice in it and it's a much

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.620 
barley or rice in it and it's a much
lighter<00:06:15.690> color<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.700> osa<00:06:17.700> or<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.060> mix<00:06:18.240> me<00:06:18.420> so

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
lighter color and osa or the mix me so

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.780 
lighter color and osa or the mix me so
really<00:06:19.380> looks<00:06:19.590> like<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.770> mix<00:06:20.070> between<00:06:20.220> these

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
really looks like a mix between these

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.110 
really looks like a mix between these
two<00:06:21.060> okay<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.140> as<00:06:22.920> far<00:06:23.100> as<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.370> consistency

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
two okay and as far as the consistency

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.750 
two okay and as far as the consistency
it's<00:06:24.240> that<00:06:24.480> it's<00:06:24.660> the<00:06:24.810> same<00:06:25.050> thing<00:06:25.610> so<00:06:26.610> I'm

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
it's that it's the same thing so I'm

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.220 
it's that it's the same thing so I'm
actually<00:06:26.880> going<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.180> grab<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.390> fork<00:06:27.780> real<00:06:27.990> quick

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
actually going to grab a fork real quick

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.750 
actually going to grab a fork real quick
so<00:06:28.410> you<00:06:28.440> can<00:06:28.560> see<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.980> difference<00:06:29.370> in<00:06:29.520> the

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
so you can see the difference in the

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:43.580 
so you can see the difference in the
consistency<00:06:30.720> of<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.870> paste

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.550 

okay<00:06:44.550> so<00:06:44.610> at<00:06:44.970> the<00:06:45.060> red<00:06:45.240> miso<00:06:47.120> white<00:06:48.120> miso<00:06:48.560> lot

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
softer and then in between the OSA me so

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.890 
softer and then in between the OSA me so
okay<00:06:55.320> but<00:06:56.220> they're<00:06:56.550> all<00:06:56.760> really<00:06:57.270> really<00:06:57.690> good

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
okay but they're all really really good
