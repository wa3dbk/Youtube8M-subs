00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
the downside of hiking isn't a matter

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.840
it's because hikers don't prepare well, too simple

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.420
just bring a bottle of water only

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:24.100
the misconception of convenient stores are everywhere in HK: easy get water and food supply

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.420
or having meal at restaurant first when time is available

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:46.760
look at the price, eat and eat more....

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.780
at the end: too full

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.840
and do hiking right a way and 'black out' right a way too

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:11.180
non-official statistic: if you read newspaper about the hiking accidents about dehydration and overheat....

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.980
mostly are been to fastfood restaurant which drink too much high sugar beverage

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:20.294
received by sunlight and end up with this...

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.200
the another downside of hiking is poor preparation of not enough food and water,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.140
thus too rush too hurry for a meal

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.040
the pace too fast that hurt the knees

00:01:35.560 --> 00:02:13.720
hikers should keep pace in moderate, and have more breaks, sit and walk

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.780
why the knee hurt so pain ?

00:02:18.697 --> 00:02:24.957
because too much pressure on the knee during a fast pace

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.540
the Japanese and Taiwanese people have a good practice of warn-up before hiking

00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:09.474
the team leader in a right place will begin

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.340
a briefing about the route

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:56.480
then follow with warn-up excerise

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.780
the reason is make your bone and muscle re-strength

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.140
so that it won't easy to get hurt and

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.380
in case you fall down, your reaction quicker to protect

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.480
this exercise only 3 - 5 minutes

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.440
somehow in Hong Kong, this warn-up seem not too popular

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.380
so I am not intend to teach now....

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.600
I had people from Japan and they are very happy with this warm up exercise

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.660
it's because they are popular with that, and so Taiwan is too

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.439
but not popular in Hong Kong

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.380
HK people like watching "clown" but less likely being "clown"

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.606
it is true

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.400
so if everyone can used to have this group warm-up, it should be ok
