00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
be located right here and then you just

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.019 
be located right here and then you just
put<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> scavenge<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.310> parts<00:00:20.609> around<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
put the scavenge for parts around the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.970 
put the scavenge for parts around the
map<00:00:21.240> what's<00:00:21.900> cool<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.439> gun<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.740> that

map what's cool about this gun is that

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
map what's cool about this gun is that
there's<00:00:23.279> two<00:00:23.460> different<00:00:23.699> ways<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.060> use<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.689> if

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
there's two different ways to use it if

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.390 
there's two different ways to use it if
you<00:00:25.170> use<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.529> right<00:00:25.680> trigger<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.220> can

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you use the right trigger you can

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310 
you use the right trigger you can
actually<00:00:26.609> fire<00:00:26.880> individual<00:00:27.689> shots<00:00:28.019> though<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
actually fire individual shots though a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.769 
actually fire individual shots though a
little<00:00:28.529> pulses<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.369> energy<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:30.000> fire<00:00:30.330> towards

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
little pulses of energy of fire towards

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
little pulses of energy of fire towards
the<00:00:30.929> aliens<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> actually<00:00:31.830> charge<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the aliens but if you actually charge it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.270 
the aliens but if you actually charge it
up<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.450> unleash<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.079> big<00:00:34.530> ball<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> energy

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
up you can unleash a big ball of energy

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
up you can unleash a big ball of energy
that<00:00:35.700> actually<00:00:36.180> will<00:00:36.329> kill<00:00:36.719> many<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that actually will kill many of the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.560 
that actually will kill many of the
aliens<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.250> its<00:00:38.399> path<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.270> gun<00:00:39.540> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
aliens in its path now what this gun is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
aliens in its path now what this gun is
most<00:00:40.020> useful<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.670> taking<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
most useful for is actually taking the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.319 
most useful for is actually taking the
ancients<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.950> charge<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> mx1

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
ancients you can do is charge up the mx1

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.869 
ancients you can do is charge up the mx1
and<00:00:46.140> fire<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> ancient<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.579> that'll

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and fire it at the ancient what that'll

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.569 
and fire it at the ancient what that'll
do<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.329> remove<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.020> Sheetal<00:00:49.469> another<00:00:50.280> thing

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
do is remove is Sheetal another thing

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
do is remove is Sheetal another thing
you<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> fire<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> individual<00:00:52.170> little

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
you can do is fire the individual little

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.889 
you can do is fire the individual little
pulses<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> ancient<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.750> will

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
pulses at the ancient and it will

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
pulses at the ancient and it will
actually<00:00:55.050> take<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> large<00:00:55.980> chunk<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.489> his

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
actually take out a large chunk of his

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 
actually take out a large chunk of his
health<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> seriously<00:00:58.140> consider

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
health if you want to seriously consider

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
health if you want to seriously consider
taking<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> ancients<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
taking out the ancients I would have to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.029 
taking out the ancients I would have to
one<00:01:00.629> hundred<00:01:00.809> percent<00:01:01.020> recommend<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
one hundred percent recommend that you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.170 
one hundred percent recommend that you
use<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.520> ns1<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.690> gun<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.519> amazing<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.820> few

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
use the ns1 this gun is amazing a few

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.330 
use the ns1 this gun is amazing a few
things<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.510> note<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.439> takes<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.860> 13

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
things to note is that it takes about 13

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
things to note is that it takes about 13
seconds<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> charge<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.290> gonna

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
seconds to charge up so you're gonna

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
seconds to charge up so you're gonna
have<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> keep<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.189> mind<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> never

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
have to keep that in mind that you never

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.719 
have to keep that in mind that you never
run<00:01:12.540> out<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> ammo<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.590> hit<00:01:13.740> zero<00:01:14.159> you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
run out of ammo so if you hit zero you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
run out of ammo so if you hit zero you
just<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.090> wait<00:01:15.299> 14<00:01:15.810> seconds<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
just have to wait 14 seconds or so and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
just have to wait 14 seconds or so and
then<00:01:16.890> you'll<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:17.970> turnarounds<00:01:18.720> back

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
then you'll have all turnarounds back

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
then you'll have all turnarounds back
but<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> don't<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> wait<00:01:19.830> til<00:01:20.009> 10<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.640> you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
but you don't have to wait til 10 if you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
but you don't have to wait til 10 if you
could<00:01:20.880> wait<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> five<00:01:21.720> six<00:01:22.080> seven<00:01:22.290> eight

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
could wait to do a five six seven eight

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
could wait to do a five six seven eight
it<00:01:22.799> doesn't<00:01:23.100> matter<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> go

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it doesn't matter that's just how you go

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.660 
it doesn't matter that's just how you go
about<00:01:24.570> getting<00:01:25.020> more<00:01:25.200> ammo

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
about getting more ammo

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.190 
about getting more ammo
just<00:01:25.820> come<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.150> just<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.630> wait<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> little

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
just come you just have to wait a little

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.170 
just come you just have to wait a little
bit<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.770> I'd<00:01:27.920> honestly<00:01:28.100> say<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:28.670> motrin

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
bit and I'd honestly say that motrin

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.820 
bit and I'd honestly say that motrin
second<00:01:29.780> isn't<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:30.259> bad<00:01:30.470> when<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.740> consider

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
second isn't that bad when you consider

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.340 
second isn't that bad when you consider
how<00:01:31.189> powerful<00:01:31.759> this<00:01:31.909> weapon<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.509> you<00:01:33.080> can<00:01:33.229> also

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
how powerful this weapon is you can also

how powerful this weapon is you can also
use<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.799> get<00:01:34.009> yourself<00:01:34.369> out<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.520> 3d
