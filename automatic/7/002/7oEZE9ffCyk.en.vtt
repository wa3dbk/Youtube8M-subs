bucket of boiling water and that fixes
the<00:00:58.800> ferment<00:00:59.190> ability<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> point<00:00:59.879> we

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the ferment ability at this point we

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
the ferment ability at this point we
want<00:01:00.210> everything<00:01:00.449> clean<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.379> don't

really<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> worry<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.280> sanitizing

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
really have to worry about sanitizing

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.490 
really have to worry about sanitizing

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
in here just in this pot will try and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.100 
in here just in this pot will try and
minimize<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> splashing<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.330> hose<00:01:27.840> gets

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
minimize the splashing the hose gets

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840 
minimize the splashing the hose gets
really<00:01:28.500> rubbery<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.280> hot<00:01:29.460> liquid

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
really rubbery with this hot liquid

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.390 
really rubbery with this hot liquid
there<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.329> ok<00:01:30.920> I'm<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> gently

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
there which is ok I'm going to gently

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.710 
there which is ok I'm going to gently
put<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.850> back<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.450> top<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> grain<00:01:34.079> bed

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
put this back in on top of the grain bed

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
put this back in on top of the grain bed
so<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.810> try<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.140> move<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.979> around<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.430> bit<00:01:38.460> here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
so we try and move it around a bit here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.249 
so we try and move it around a bit here
we<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.060> want<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> stir<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.600> grain<00:01:39.810> bed<00:01:39.990> too

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
we don't want to stir the grain bed too

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.219 
we don't want to stir the grain bed too
much<00:01:40.970> because<00:01:41.970> again<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> great<00:01:42.600> bed<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.930> also

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
much because again the great bed is also

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.880 
much because again the great bed is also
acting<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> filter<00:01:44.689> for<00:01:45.689> us<00:01:45.899> alright<00:01:46.619> well

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890

just turn it down a minute ago there it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.790 
just turn it down a minute ago there it
goes<00:02:25.910> pour<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:26.940> right<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:30.770> put<00:02:31.770> a

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
boiling work may actually turn down a

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.310 
boiling work may actually turn down a
little<00:03:54.930> bit<00:03:55.049> first<00:03:55.320> Oh<00:03:56.840> splash<00:03:57.840> them<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.230> my

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
little bit first Oh splash them on my

little bit first Oh splash them on my
finger

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.630 

they're<00:04:03.750> finished<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.739> boil<00:04:05.330> this<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.510> about

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
they're finished the boil this is about

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.670 
they're finished the boil this is about
three<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.760> half<00:04:08.790> gallons<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.569> there<00:04:09.780> would

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
three and a half gallons in there would

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.350 
three and a half gallons in there would
be<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.830> little<00:04:11.010> bit<00:04:11.129> less<00:04:11.310> from<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.610> boil<00:04:11.909> off<00:04:12.150> I

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
be a little bit less from the boil off I

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.899 
be a little bit less from the boil off I
get<00:04:12.569> two<00:04:12.780> gallons<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.230> water<00:04:13.440> cold<00:04:14.099> water<00:04:14.190> beer
