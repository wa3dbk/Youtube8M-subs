00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
I think it'd look pretty cool with a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.359 
I think it'd look pretty cool with a
clone<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.159> top<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:42.140> use<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.470> both<00:01:43.860> sides<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.340> think

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
clone on top I use on both sides I think

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.990 
clone on top I use on both sides I think
it'd<00:01:44.700> look<00:01:44.729> cool<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:46.399> need<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.640> two<00:01:47.880> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
then this little plot on the platforms

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.220 
then this little plot on the platforms
on<00:02:10.619> both<00:02:10.830> sides

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
on both sides

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.080 
on both sides
and<00:02:12.319> this<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.620> also<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:13.010> both<00:02:13.190> sides<00:02:13.489> of<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.849> TIA

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and this is also on both sides of a TIA

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.000 
and this is also on both sides of a TIA
with<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> control<00:02:14.750> panel<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:16.390> these<00:02:17.390> are
