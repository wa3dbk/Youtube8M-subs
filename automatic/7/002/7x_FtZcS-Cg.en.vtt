00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.480
 in the excess on the map 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.090
 the only way that we do not currently 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.860
 come and bring a trick that rreef 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.830
 actions basically was the one that found 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.560
 do not 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.269
 same 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.830
 and let's start from the beginning we 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.590
 come on first thing we have to do 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.149
 is to open this door here they can also 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.239
 go inside those doors have 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.820
 to open two doors to the straight not to open 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.830
 a two follow straight down would be 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.710
 750,000 would be needed around 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.960
 3000 to be able to open all the doors 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.220
 not in case you want to catch first 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.740
 elected and they would be like around 15 thousand 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.380
 to open all the doors not 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.410
 so well I'm going to do it that way 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.880
 now not because it's better to try a 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.550
 little more that I do not have to go for the 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.530
 bed and open so many doors 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.850
 basically open this door that I 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.220
 makes it cost very much in 1250 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.680
 750 in fact April let's move on from 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.530
 round for 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.490
 then to get to point 4 and I'm going to 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.369
 basically explain the whole trick not 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.100
 because surely many will not know that 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.850
 trick 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.310
 it's a cliché it's a pretty good day to 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.799
 me the truth I already round 21 and it's 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.990
 basically because I realized what 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.930
 that I will explain now a little more 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.850
 late but good let's take a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.090
 little bit we need about two 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.090
 minutes 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.670
 do not 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.180
 like now 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 let's see let's see go five 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 bullets 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.350
 ok the essential thing of this type is to buy 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.730
 a weapon that this has to be these not 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.490
 I recommend nadal has returned and the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.890
 it's really pretty bad or some 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.620
 weapon that is on the cake or in 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.720
 corridors there from here already when you 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.970
 you get here from here to here until 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.740
 be here, that is, weapons that are not so 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.780
 far from where I'm going to teach you the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.569
 tap no because if not the truth that they are 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.640
 to spend a lot of work 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.180
 so let's throw some 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.180
 pomegranate 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.350
 It makes me good and with this we have 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.940
 good enough let's open this 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.300
 door in case you arrive here 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.920
 not with the trick is pretty basic this 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.360
 door if they come around they took the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.640
 done first will surely have it 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.350
 open well, it's going to buy this 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.140
 arms the truth that is not the best weapon 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.970
 of the world 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.520
 but it's the closest I have and 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.020
 it makes me that is the best for this 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.290
 trick since you have it basically to 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.580
 side and maybe you can buy ammo 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.959
 whenever you feel like it 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.450
 good dirty work on this desk and 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.400
 will point not necessarily have to 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.800
 point but good and take hanging 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.020
 here as you see manga to be done 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.610
 little balls is man in this trick can 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.560
 be all the players in fact 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.560
 there may also be two on that side 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.650
 it's a pretty good and good trick 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.379
 when it comes out of those are the ones that are 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.819
 go ahead and go backwards not the 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.739
 true that some trick quite effective 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.780
 what the only thing that fails here is that 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.810
 the dogs I do not recommend this place 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.910
 for dogs and it's basically because 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.459
 because the dogs behind three blows 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.290
 they throw you two are going to give you what 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.239
 which there should not be 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.560
 but we're going to pass another round for 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.680
 that they see 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.209
 and now I will explain why 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.180
 buy this weapon or you can change 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.060
 buy me but I know it's there or the m-14 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.849
 that is there also, that is, weapons that 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.470
 can the tank the fresh penalty not that 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.480
 it does not cost them so much work in the search 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.190
 especially in high rounds that the truth 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.739
 removed involution well 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.710
 very quick truth that this weapons and the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.380
 improvement is pretty good 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.660
 but good as it is, you can put 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.920
 even up here back to here and 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.230
 he told them they are going to give him 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.950
 as he has it next to me and he does not give me 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.950
 same 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.230
 r 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.880
 the truth that is a trick that I liked 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.940
 a lot because if you can not do not be a 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.900
 player but all but good now 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.760
 Talk about something else 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.860
 the work is that this trick some cakes 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.080
 multi word since then possibly the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.660
 players from other public games the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.010
 declare cheats not because there are 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.100
 some of them that if they eat these 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.680
 serious and what good I do not recommend you 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.050
 do this in multiplayer not that what 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.190
 do in private and good because I tell them 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.230
 about the ammunition because for example 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.220
 now I'm running out of ammunition truth and 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.590
 what you can do in case 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.420
 Have the ex or you get low purchases ammo 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.530
 and come back and go up understand and do not have the 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.660
 risk of going to buy ammunition from a 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.270
 other side not so good this is the 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.910
 cliché are going to bring you other clips that 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.200
 they told me around so well I hope 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.030
 that you liked to comment subscribe 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.350
 leave a like if they are not 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.350
 well we already repeat it 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.650
 goodbye 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.060
 carlos to chaos 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.050
 you
