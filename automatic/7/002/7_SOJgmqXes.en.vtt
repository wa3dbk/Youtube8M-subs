00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.219
 [music] 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.699
 so on the internet a bunch of videos about how 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.199
 understate the suspension in most cases 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.720
 people say just need to take off 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.820
 springs and cut and tell you how 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.490
 correctly understate the suspension and why 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.529
 you can not cut the spring began to give 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.380
 let's figure out why do you need to charge 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.939
 suspension two options either 2 to 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.790
 improve car handling because 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.200
 that he may be too tall of him 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.719
 center of gravity is too high and 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.570
 against it just can deploy something 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:42.230
 there is either an option often more suitable 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.770
 more often in 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.630
 so you and do it to improve 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.739
 the appearance that is possible below night 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.739
 steeper choose abruptly 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.360
 notice the springs like from 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.189
 helix business goes on but at the end u 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.810
 her special groove special santa 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.610
 made to fit snugly to 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.950
 shock absorbers but that it is not 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.250
 jumped off and there was nothing if you like 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.510
 it is usually said 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.150
 cut three coils in front and two behind 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.580
 then if the hole is so much or is it worth 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.890
 this one anyway you will hang around here 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.420
 it's a snag and you will not be tight 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.640
 adjoining the springs of your shock absorber 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.830
 that is , you are on the posts 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.140
 crunch crunch but it's not the most 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.070
 big problem the problem is that if 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.360
 you cut the springs make it smaller 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:41.750
 review the show on the example of maksara here 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.470
 you drive drove over a bump into a pit and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.540
 the wheel has completely opened 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.430
 image of the goods compressed state then you 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.200
 chances are that the spring is just 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.930
 so the spring will come off the groove 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.790
 No need to cut if you want to take 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.580
 suspension with springs then at least 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.159
 need to buy other springs and another 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.850
 car which will be shorter but 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.680
 tougher 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.909
 need to specifically pick a spring under in 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.659
 car given its weight 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.329
 the car 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:13.250
 but even if you buy springs which 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.810
 will be harder on anything less and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.420
 problems so that she can come off 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.770
 will not disappear so you need to buy not 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.310
 only new springs but new ones 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.709
 shock absorbers also based on length 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:31.069
 here I will show you specifically 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:36.920
 removed the wheel for this walter resistant 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.319
 the spring fits tightly here 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.470
 adjoins if you cut it will 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.930
 creak crunch and so on will 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.160
 wag your nerves if they are shorter than us 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.200
 will jump off so it's best 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.790
 buy new spring and new risotto 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.350
 if you still want to understate 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:59.590
 suspension using springs and so on this 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.590
 thank you very much.
