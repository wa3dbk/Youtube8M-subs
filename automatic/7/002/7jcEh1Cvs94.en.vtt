00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.770
 how are two or three as if I do not know 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.779
 ended this video one more video for me 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.639
 channel and one this time shows like 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.730
 they are watching him playing 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.099
 street 3 I recommend them very much 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.250
 because it's done to me personally 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.099
 makes this great game and addictive 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.019
 good 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.960
 I was playing a little with arriving 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.880
 killing the animals hunting the and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.990
 removing their skin is also done to me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.000
 a bit like the network game have 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.420
 tension I do not know if you have played 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.910
 but if I already made this video guys for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.370
 explain a little about this mission where 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.670
 you have to find the software 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.350
 the big and good foot quickly we go 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.829
 to listen a bit to the history of these 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.829
 four what 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.280
 he walks upright like a man but his 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.160
 body is covered with a thick skin 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.519
 his pace is slow and wobbly I've 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.369
 seen with my own eyes is ready 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.320
 always at a distance or with something between 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.869
 us as if he knew where I'm going to 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 be before you get where you are going to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.050
 things disappear that sure all class 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.200
 of trinkets was carried to the highs of 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.060
 a deer in a cabin also takes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.729
 to the prey of the traps by opening the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 with their big tents someone should 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.610
 bring your head and show it to everyone 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.610
 world 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.870
 and good guys already after listening to 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.150
 this story I'm going to open the map and they're going to 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.820
 see where I'm going to be the I think where 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.800
 I'm right now it's called border and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.780
 I'm almost in the middle between here 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.720
 these camps where they tell you this 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.090
 kind of stories of let's say UFOs 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.920
 of software and other things too 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.280
 but if we are going to go everything all towards 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.530
 the northwest star all towards the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.620
 left up right now they will see 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.720
 where 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.490
 but if it causes that I had to cut a 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.680
 little the video because I still did not have the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.440
 unlocked map but if you are looking 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.230
 up says the border is still 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.350
 the same map and if we see everything towards 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.130
 up we will find here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.100
 this kind of rock type in the footprints 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.410
 second the sas watch and good already after 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.780
 let's go into this cave and what 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.260
 let's find is something that was done to me 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.240
 in the particular something funny and good 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.700
 so the jewelery hopefully 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.070

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.170

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.670
 hello are you the guy who was hill 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.370
 down not welcome a deer leg 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.770

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.569

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.290
 Thank you 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.500
 who are you and what is this place 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.659
 I'm just a man and this is my home no 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.760
 it looks a lot from the outside but there it is 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.799
 the grace I am not too sociable that 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.560
 let's say the locals believe that you are some 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.269
 kind of demon that's what they are 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.159
 saying 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.489
 surely frustrated by my little one and 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:41.000
 unpleasant habit I stay with things 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.460
 I know it's wrong I know but I can not 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.120
 avoid it 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.830
 The truth is that I like my privacy 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.200
 if I give you money you could save the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.200
 secret of my house I would appreciate it 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.110
