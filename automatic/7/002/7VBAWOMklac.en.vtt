00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
toilet will be no big deal because you

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.519

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
didn't pay as much as say an iPad so

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.490 
didn't pay as much as say an iPad so
that's<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.520> well<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.730> good<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.140> problem

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
that's all well and good but the problem

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.790 
that's all well and good but the problem
is<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.490> tablet<00:00:23.850> itself<00:00:24.230> isn't<00:00:25.230> exactly

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is that the tablet itself isn't exactly

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.939

exciting if you look at the outside it's

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.040 
exciting if you look at the outside it's
got<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> standard<00:00:29.400> design<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.869> nice

got a standard design it's got a nice

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.720 
got a standard design it's got a nice
black<00:00:31.439> bezel<00:00:31.710> around<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> seven-inch<00:00:32.669> screen

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
black bezel around the seven-inch screen

black bezel around the seven-inch screen
the<00:00:33.450> screen<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.809> actually<00:00:34.140> fairly<00:00:34.890> bright

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it's a little fuzzy in some of the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.420 
it's a little fuzzy in some of the
videos<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.649> took<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.160> it's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
videos that we took but it's it's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
videos that we took but it's it's
acceptable<00:00:39.410> what<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.500> didn't<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.860> however

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
acceptable what we didn't like however

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.209 
acceptable what we didn't like however
was<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.360> certain<00:00:42.690> points<00:00:42.989> especially<00:00:43.860> up

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
was that at certain points especially up

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
was that at certain points especially up
here<00:00:44.250> around<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> edge<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.829> around

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
here around the edge and up here around

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.130 
here around the edge and up here around
this<00:00:47.340> edge<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:48.000> would<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> 105<00:00:49.079> degrees

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this edge it would get up to 105 degrees

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
this edge it would get up to 105 degrees
and<00:00:49.440> generally<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.550> anything

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
and generally we think that anything

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.959 
and generally we think that anything
over<00:00:51.719> 95<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.500> uncomfortable<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> mean

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
over 95 is uncomfortable so I mean

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.220 
over 95 is uncomfortable so I mean
you're<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.449> exactly<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.050> touching

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you're not exactly going to be touching

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.540 
you're not exactly going to be touching
these<00:00:55.469> areas<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:55.829> still<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
these areas but still it's it's a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
these areas but still it's it's a
drawback<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.300> also<00:00:57.449> didn't<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
drawback we also didn't like the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
drawback we also didn't like the
speakers<00:00:58.320> which<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.559> located<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.370> on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
speakers which are located right here on

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.110 
speakers which are located right here on
the<00:00:59.579> bottom<00:01:00.109> they<00:01:01.109> kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.379> sit<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:02.120> where

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the bottom they kind of sit here where

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
the bottom they kind of sit here where
you<00:01:03.239> would<00:01:03.359> generally<00:01:03.570> hold<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> tablet<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you would generally hold the tablet and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
you would generally hold the tablet and
they<00:01:05.519> didn't<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> best<00:01:06.270> sound

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
they didn't put out the best sound

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
they didn't put out the best sound
quality<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:07.950> really

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
quality at all really

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.280 
quality at all really

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
while we were listening to things like

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.520 
while we were listening to things like
bass-heavy<00:01:10.950> songs<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.909> had<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> wobble

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
bass-heavy songs it had a lot of wobble

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
bass-heavy songs it had a lot of wobble
to<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.130> had<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> lot<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> distortion<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> when

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to it I had a lot of distortion and when

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
to it I had a lot of distortion and when
we<00:01:15.930> listened<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.979> trouble<00:01:17.189> heavy<00:01:17.430> songs

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
we listened to more trouble heavy songs

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.539 
we listened to more trouble heavy songs
there's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> lot<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> tinny<00:01:18.780> action<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.549> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
there's a lot of tinny action to it so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.920 
there's a lot of tinny action to it so
it's<00:01:20.729> not<00:01:20.820> exactly<00:01:21.180> something<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> want

it's a little textured plastic it's not
you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.000> exactly<00:01:36.740> gonna<00:01:37.740> save<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> from

you know exactly gonna save you from

you know exactly gonna save you from
dropping<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.450> much<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.840> mean<00:01:39.869> unless

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
dropping it that much I mean unless

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.109 
dropping it that much I mean unless
you're<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.740> gripping<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> super<00:01:41.729> hard<00:01:41.939> but

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you're really gripping it super hard but

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.200 
you're really gripping it super hard but
it's<00:01:42.600> better<00:01:42.780> than<00:01:42.869> using<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.939> slippery<00:01:44.939> kind

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it's better than using the slippery kind

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's better than using the slippery kind
of<00:01:45.270> plastic<00:01:45.659> back<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:47.009> right<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
of plastic back here all right on the

over here though is as you can see this

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.310 
over here though is as you can see this
is<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.850> camera<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.060> rear<00:01:54.240> camera<00:01:54.390> when<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
is the camera the rear camera when you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.870 
is the camera the rear camera when you
put<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.649> fingers<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.640> kind<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
put your fingers up here you kind of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
put your fingers up here you kind of
cover<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> camera<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.750> leave<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
cover up the camera so you can leave a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.780 
cover up the camera so you can leave a
lot<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> fingerprints<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> camera<00:01:59.520> put

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
lot of fingerprints on the camera put

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.160 
lot of fingerprints on the camera put
some<00:01:59.909> smudges<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> there<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.110> don't

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
some smudges on there and you don't

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.330 
some smudges on there and you don't
exactly<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> be

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
exactly want that if you're going to be

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.109 
exactly want that if you're going to be
using<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.570> regular<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.969> with<00:02:05.969> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
using this on the regular but with that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.540 
using this on the regular but with that
said<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:07.290> camera<00:02:07.799> doesn't<00:02:08.099> take<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> best

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550

images<00:02:09.140> really<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:11.129> got<00:02:11.310> some<00:02:12.060> shots<00:02:12.480> outside

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
images really we got some shots outside

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760

outside of our Manhattan office and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.170 
outside of our Manhattan office and
there<00:02:16.080> were<00:02:16.170> kind<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.440> blurry<00:02:16.910> action<00:02:17.910> shots

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
there were kind of blurry action shots

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.120 
there were kind of blurry action shots
just<00:02:18.480> streaked<00:02:19.230> all<00:02:19.380> over<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> place<00:02:19.860> cab

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
just streaked all over the place cab

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.440 
just streaked all over the place cab
zooming<00:02:20.520> by<00:02:20.610> looks<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.660> crummy<00:02:22.590> basically

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
zooming by looks really crummy basically

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.600 
zooming by looks really crummy basically
video<00:02:24.450> didn't<00:02:25.350> look<00:02:25.470> very<00:02:25.830> good<00:02:25.980> either<00:02:26.160> there

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
video didn't look very good either there

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670 
video didn't look very good either there
was<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> lot<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.030> distortion<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.080> felt

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
was a lot of distortion to it I felt

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.930 
was a lot of distortion to it I felt
like<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> lot<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.220> cutting<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.610> jagged

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
like it was a lot of cutting and jagged

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.900 
like it was a lot of cutting and jagged
edges<00:02:30.590> there's<00:02:31.590> also<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.920> front-facing<00:02:32.430> camera

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
edges there's also a front-facing camera

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.020 
edges there's also a front-facing camera
as<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.300> see<00:02:33.450> right<00:02:33.870> here<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:35.520> isn't

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
as you can see right here that isn't

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
as you can see right here that isn't
exactly<00:02:36.810> too<00:02:37.320> good<00:02:37.560> either

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
exactly too good either

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280 
exactly too good either
as<00:02:38.460> far<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.700> front-facing<00:02:39.180> cameras<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.690> it's

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
as far as front-facing cameras go it's

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.780 
as far as front-facing cameras go it's
passable<00:02:40.740> but<00:02:41.430> you're<00:02:42.150> gonna<00:02:42.240> get<00:02:42.620> kind<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
passable but you're gonna get kind of

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.270 
passable but you're gonna get kind of
poor<00:02:44.790> coloring<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.420> lot<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.900> oranges<00:02:46.380> we

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
poor coloring a lot of oranges we

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.030 
poor coloring a lot of oranges we
noticed<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.230> not<00:02:49.350> exactly<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.830> greatest

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
noticed so it's not exactly the greatest

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.240 
noticed so it's not exactly the greatest
camera<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.090> not<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.600> up<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.260> say<00:02:52.680> iPad

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
camera it's not you know up to say iPad

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.430

level<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:54.120> terms<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.630> things<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.230> did

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
level in terms of things that we did

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.410

like<00:02:55.620> about<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.100> tablet<00:02:56.310> obviously<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
like about this tablet obviously the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.440 
like about this tablet obviously the
initial<00:02:57.720> $99<00:02:58.410> price<00:02:58.680> tag<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.070> really<00:02:59.340> fun<00:02:59.550> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
initial $99 price tag is really fun the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.250 
initial $99 price tag is really fun the
fact<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.440> got<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:01.980> sturdy<00:03:02.400> feel<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.970> it

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
fact that it's got a sturdy feel to it

fact that it's got a sturdy feel to it
the<00:03:04.260> problem<00:03:04.650> though<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:04.970> going<00:03:05.970> back<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the problem though is going back to the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.190 
the problem though is going back to the
price<00:03:06.570> at<00:03:06.890> $99<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:09.000> only<00:03:09.300> for<00:03:09.660> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
price at $99 that is only for the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.980 
price at $99 that is only for the
initial<00:03:10.830> cost<00:03:11.700> what<00:03:12.510> you're<00:03:12.630> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> end<00:03:12.930> up

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
initial cost what you're going to end up

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.550 
initial cost what you're going to end up
doing<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.670> by<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:15.000> two<00:03:15.630> year<00:03:15.870> data<00:03:16.050> plan<00:03:16.320> through

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
doing is by a two year data plan through

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.990 
doing is by a two year data plan through
sprint<00:03:16.830> at<00:03:17.250> $19.99<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.600> month<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:19.020> after

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
sprint at $19.99 a month and after

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.949 
sprint at $19.99 a month and after
overtime<00:03:21.000> that'll<00:03:21.360> end<00:03:21.450> up<00:03:21.510> costing<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
overtime that'll end up costing you

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.210 
overtime that'll end up costing you
around<00:03:22.580> more<00:03:23.580> than<00:03:23.760> $500<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.220> essentially

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
around more than $500 so essentially

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.250 
around more than $500 so essentially
what<00:03:26.880> you're<00:03:26.970> really<00:03:27.480> paying<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
what you're really paying for is the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.520 
what you're really paying for is the
data<00:03:28.709> plan<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.220> while<00:03:29.730> that's<00:03:30.330> all<00:03:30.690> good<00:03:31.410> and
