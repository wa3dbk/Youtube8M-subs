 in the afternoon it goes very well it is very rich and 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.209
 notice that in a way I love 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.760
 this kind of lucy recipes because many 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.090
 Sometimes big children or boys do not 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.730
 they want to eat fruit and it's a way to 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.580
 put the fruit with them that the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.419
 salads in this type of desserts so 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.190
 rich 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.440
 let's put fruit for those of some 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.480
 way they will eat it be I do not know a quarter 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.760
 of piece of apple penalty of what 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.860
 be because how difficult it is for many 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.500
 moms make children eat fruit and 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.020
 this preparation is very good and good 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.550
 we can do it very often to the best 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.560
 restrict sugars a bit though 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.600
 is a little less sweet but that 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.910
 our children eat light fruits and had 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.380
 only the important thing and also what can 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.290
 make peach 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.900
