looking for a medium waiver I have a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.139 
looking for a medium waiver I have a
very<00:00:39.930> small<00:00:40.920> waiver<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> very<00:00:41.940> much

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
very small waiver which is very much

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.080 
very small waiver which is very much
like<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.530> crimper<00:00:43.850> which<00:00:44.850> looks<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.120> this

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.230 

and<00:00:48.540> then<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.650> a<00:00:49.860> bigger<00:00:50.640> deep<00:00:51.000> waver

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
and then I have a bigger deep waver

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.430 
and then I have a bigger deep waver
which<00:00:51.570> looks<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:51.840> this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.360 

anyway<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.500> wanted<00:00:56.860> something<00:00:57.070> in<00:00:57.280> between

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
anyway I wanted something in between

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.050 
anyway I wanted something in between
something<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.450> I<00:00:58.480> used<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.900> have<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:00.940> was

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
something that I used to have when I was

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.870 
something that I used to have when I was
younger<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.770> ones<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.220> they<00:01:03.400> had<00:01:03.610> back

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
younger and the ones that they had back

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.090 
younger and the ones that they had back
in<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.150> day<00:01:04.180> or<00:01:04.510> straight<00:01:04.870> metal<00:01:05.320> which

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
in the day or straight metal which

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.220 
in the day or straight metal which
probably<00:01:06.430> fried<00:01:06.910> your<00:01:07.120> hair<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.690> this<00:01:07.930> is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
probably fried your hair so this is

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.980 
probably fried your hair so this is
tourmaline<00:01:08.830> ceramic<00:01:09.280> it's<00:01:10.270> going<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.810> be

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
tourmaline ceramic it's going to be

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.180 
tourmaline ceramic it's going to be
gentler<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.890> your<00:01:11.920> hair<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:14.530> will<00:01:14.710> say<00:01:14.920> that

the coolest spot to hold it and if you

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.070 
the coolest spot to hold it and if you
hold<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.800> like<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.300> you're<00:02:22.300> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.660> get

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
hold it like this you're going to get

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.010 
hold it like this you're going to get
your<00:02:23.410> skin<00:02:24.190> caught<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:27.459> here<00:02:28.030> when<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.690> open

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
your skin caught in here when you open

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.199 
your skin caught in here when you open
it<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.290> that's<00:02:29.920> happened<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.430> me<00:02:30.459> I've<00:02:30.790> I've

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
it and that's happened to me I've I've

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.490 
it and that's happened to me I've I've
held<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.930> wrong<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.819> open<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.440> my<00:02:35.440> skin

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
held it wrong and when I open it my skin

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.430 
held it wrong and when I open it my skin
got<00:02:36.069> caught<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.640> there<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.510> really<00:02:38.170> have

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
got caught in there so you really have

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.390 
got caught in there so you really have
to<00:02:38.709> hold<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:41.099> which<00:02:42.099> can<00:02:42.340> be

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
to hold it like this which can be

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.900 
to hold it like this which can be
awkward<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.300> it's<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.599> really<00:02:44.020> ergonomic

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
awkward and it's not really ergonomic

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.820 
awkward and it's not really ergonomic
because<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.420> small<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.560> know<00:02:47.680> why

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
because it is so small you know why

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.530 
because it is so small you know why
don't<00:02:47.890> they<00:02:48.130> make<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.340> bigger<00:02:48.760> version<00:02:49.150> like

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
don't they make a bigger version like

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.620 
don't they make a bigger version like
this<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:50.140> always<00:02:50.650> do<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.040> from<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.400> bottom<00:02:51.819> up

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630

and I'll leave a link to the deep waver

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.960 
and I'll leave a link to the deep waver
which<00:02:58.990> is<00:02:59.170> exactly<00:02:59.680> how<00:02:59.830> I<00:02:59.860> did<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.640> with

mini<00:03:29.730> waver<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.630> wake<00:03:30.870> more<00:03:31.380> info<00:03:31.620> on

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
mini waver on this wake more info on

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.290 
mini waver on this wake more info on
this<00:03:31.950> wave<00:03:32.130> will<00:03:32.370> be<00:03:32.490> left<00:03:32.670> alone<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.090> when<00:03:33.210> you

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.520 
no temperature setting okay so as soon
as<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.030> turn<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.419> on<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.840> will<00:05:27.960> go<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.169> four

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
as you turn it on it will go to four

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.230 
as you turn it on it will go to four
hundred<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.919> thirty<00:05:28.979> there's<00:05:29.400> no<00:05:29.580> intervals

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
hundred and thirty there's no intervals

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.100 
hundred and thirty there's no intervals
so<00:05:30.750> what<00:05:30.900> I<00:05:30.930> suggest<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:32.669> only<00:05:33.360> leave<00:05:33.840> it<00:05:33.870> on

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
so what I suggest is to only leave it on

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.129 
so what I suggest is to only leave it on
