00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
spend so much time on one thing it would

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.369

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
feel so off this arc flows the way it

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.409 
feel so off this arc flows the way it
does<00:04:14.530> because<00:04:14.799> Oda<00:04:15.400> keeps<00:04:15.790> switching<00:04:16.120> between

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
does because Oda keeps switching between

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.629 
does because Oda keeps switching between
each<00:04:17.139> segment<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.310> just<00:04:18.459> makes

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
each segment of it and it just makes

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.099 
each segment of it and it just makes
everything<00:04:18.789> feel<00:04:19.180> natural<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.750> it's<00:04:19.900> awesome

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
everything feel natural and it's awesome
