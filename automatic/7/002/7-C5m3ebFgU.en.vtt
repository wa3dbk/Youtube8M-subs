maybe<00:02:44.069> that's<00:02:44.580> why<00:02:44.910> Wells<00:02:45.240> let<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.569> particle

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
maybe that's why Wells let the particle

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.870 
maybe that's why Wells let the particle
accelerator<00:02:46.319> exploded<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.670> could

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
accelerator exploded so that you could

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.870 
accelerator exploded so that you could
