basically our multimedia corner because
here<00:00:04.710> we<00:00:04.890> show<00:00:05.609> our<00:00:05.850> new<00:00:05.879> solutions<00:00:06.779> for

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
here we show our new solutions for

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.089 
here we show our new solutions for
multimodal<00:00:09.110> mobility<00:00:10.110> which<00:00:10.440> means<00:00:10.769> we

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
multimodal mobility which means we

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.120 
multimodal mobility which means we
connect<00:00:11.670> mobility<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.840> connectivity<00:00:13.799> with

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
the next level of functional integration

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.960 
the next level of functional integration
means<00:00:42.110> we<00:00:42.470> will<00:00:42.620> provide<00:00:43.160> value<00:00:43.820> and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
means we will provide value and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.940 
means we will provide value and

functions comfo functions for the
bicycle<00:00:46.460> rider<00:00:46.700> because<00:00:47.510> we<00:00:47.750> see<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.590> more

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
bicycle rider because we see the more

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.860 
bicycle rider because we see the more
electrification<00:00:49.640> we<00:00:50.180> have<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.840> more

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
for functions ease of use so we

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.880 
for functions ease of use so we
integrate<00:00:55.610> with<00:00:55.820> our<00:00:55.850> shift<00:00:56.570> platform<00:00:57.170> three

it's<00:01:08.720> basically<00:01:09.110> automatic<00:01:09.860> shifting<00:01:10.280> like

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
it's basically automatic shifting like

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.100 
it's basically automatic shifting like
you<00:01:10.580> know<00:01:10.729> from<00:01:10.970> cars<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:11.510> bring<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:11.870> to<00:01:12.080> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
you know from cars we bring this to the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.550 
you know from cars we bring this to the
bicycle<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.910> works<00:01:14.180> together<00:01:14.530> with<00:01:15.530> our

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
bicycle and it works together with our

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.219 
bicycle and it works together with our
ebike<00:01:16.340> system<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> power<00:01:17.390> comes<00:01:17.840> from<00:01:17.930> our

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
ebike system so the power comes from our

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.980 
ebike system so the power comes from our
battery<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.000> controls<00:01:20.000> are<00:01:20.390> controlled

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
battery and the controls are controlled

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.880 
battery and the controls are controlled
from<00:01:21.200> our<00:01:21.650> head<00:01:22.369> unit

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.730 

so<00:01:26.890> two<00:01:26.950> major<00:01:27.460> trends<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.090> we<00:01:28.450> see<00:01:28.480> one<00:01:29.470> is

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
so two major trends that we see one is

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.240 
so two major trends that we see one is
we<00:01:30.670> want<00:01:30.910> to<00:01:30.970> bring<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:32.770> know<00:01:32.890> if<00:01:33.010> you<00:01:33.100> can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
we want to bring I don't know if you can

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.060 
we want to bring I don't know if you can
take<00:01:33.550> that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.570 

these<00:01:38.820> videos<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> tuba<00:01:41.040> dealers<00:01:41.370> for

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
these videos to the tuba dealers for

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.430 
these videos to the tuba dealers for
their<00:01:41.790> shop<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.300> a<00:01:42.420> mountain<00:01:42.870> video<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
their shop that is a mountain video I

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.340 
their shop that is a mountain video I

want to show Iman liking is multi
wagging<00:01:46.740> Cadillacs<00:01:47.930> bicycles<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.290> therefore

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
wagging Cadillacs bicycles so therefore

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
wagging Cadillacs bicycles so therefore
immortan<00:01:50.310> bikes<00:01:50.520> are<00:01:50.760> mountain<00:01:51.119> bikes<00:01:51.300> we
