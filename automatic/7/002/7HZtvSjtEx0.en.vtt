this and most importantly take a look at
this<00:01:20.020> door<00:01:20.259> look<00:01:20.530> at<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.770> opening<00:01:21.100> that's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
this door look at the opening that's

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.969 
this door look at the opening that's
underneath<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:21.759> door<00:01:22.000> here<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.710> can<00:01:23.830> see

underneath this door here so you can see

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.770 
underneath this door here so you can see
your<00:01:24.100> soffit<00:01:24.550> stare<00:01:24.789> you've<00:01:25.000> got<00:01:25.179> some<00:01:25.450> bug

your soffit stare you've got some bug
screen<00:01:26.140> up<00:01:26.259> there<00:01:26.289> that<00:01:26.950> bug<00:01:27.130> screen<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:27.550> can

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
screen up there that bug screen I can

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.190 
screen up there that bug screen I can
probably<00:01:27.939> just<00:01:28.090> poke<00:01:28.420> my<00:01:28.570> hand<00:01:28.780> through<00:01:29.049> it

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
probably just poke my hand through it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.170 
probably just poke my hand through it
