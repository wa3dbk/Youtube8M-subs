useful<00:02:53.660> switching<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.320> piano<00:02:54.590> things

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
useful switching for the piano things

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.720 
useful switching for the piano things
like<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> touch<00:02:56.260> hold<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.320> down<00:02:57.500> again<00:02:57.860> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
like the touch hold that down again and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.260 
like the touch hold that down again and
it<00:02:58.850> changes<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:01.370> touch<00:03:01.580> sensitivity<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.209> the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
it changes the touch sensitivity of the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.530 
it changes the touch sensitivity of the
key<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:03.350> one<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.830> instance<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:05.360> much

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
key so on one for instance it's much

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.370 
key so on one for instance it's much
lighter<00:03:05.750> touch<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.700> medium<00:03:08.300> three<00:03:09.260> is

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
lighter touch to is medium three is

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.260 
lighter touch to is medium three is
harder<00:03:09.770> so<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.950> have<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.220> put<00:03:10.820> more<00:03:10.940> effort<00:03:11.150> in

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
harder so I have to put more effort in

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.110 
harder so I have to put more effort in
to<00:03:11.390> get<00:03:11.540> more<00:03:11.720> volume<00:03:12.700> all<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.910> does<00:03:14.090> is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
to get more volume all that does is

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.820 
to get more volume all that does is
change<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.750> sensitivity<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.650> doesn't

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
change the sensitivity of it it doesn't

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.500 
change the sensitivity of it it doesn't
actually<00:03:15.980> change<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.550> physical<00:03:16.760> action<00:03:17.330> and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
actually change the physical action and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.870 
actually change the physical action and
the<00:03:17.870> same<00:03:17.989> thing<00:03:18.140> with<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.320> brilliance

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
the same thing with the brilliance

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.390 
the same thing with the brilliance
default<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.030> two<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.049> can<00:03:21.230> put<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.650> up<00:03:21.769> so

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
default to two but you can put it up so

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.539 
default to two but you can put it up so
it's<00:03:22.489> brighter<00:03:22.730> or<00:03:23.209> make<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.540> more<00:03:24.260> mellow<00:03:24.549> so

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
it's brighter or make it more mellow so

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.150 
it's brighter or make it more mellow so
lots<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.060> nice<00:03:26.209> functions<00:03:26.630> on<00:03:26.720> there<00:03:26.900> too<00:03:27.170> to

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
lots of nice functions on there too to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.860 
lots of nice functions on there too to
do<00:03:28.280> what<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.430> want<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:28.820> let's<00:03:29.180> test<00:03:29.330> B<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.720> 80

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
do what you want so let's test B to 80

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.060 
do what you want so let's test B to 80
go<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.200> check<00:03:30.320> one<00:03:30.410> out<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.709> store<00:03:30.920> near

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
go and check one out and the store near

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:47.380 
go and check one out and the store near
you

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390
