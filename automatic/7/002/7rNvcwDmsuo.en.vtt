00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the problem is for some reason the mp3

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.169 
the problem is for some reason the mp3
files<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.659> been<00:02:04.049> converted<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:06.320> mono

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
files have been converted with a mono

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.960 
files have been converted with a mono
output<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.920> translation<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
output and the translation of that to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.090 
output and the translation of that to
stereo<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.599> basically<00:02:13.170> going

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
stereo is basically going

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.580 
stereo is basically going
so<00:02:14.400> what<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.420> convert<00:02:15.840> me<00:02:16.140> mp3

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so what you have to do is convert me mp3

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.980 
so what you have to do is convert me mp3
files<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> specific<00:02:17.700> wave<00:02:17.880> format<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.840> get

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
files to a specific wave format to get

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.890 
files to a specific wave format to get
the<00:02:19.080> stereo<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.560> then<00:02:19.770> back<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.310> mp3<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.750> all

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the stereo and then back to mp3 but all

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.690 
the stereo and then back to mp3 but all
this<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> bit<00:02:22.560> time-consuming<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.550> stuff

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
this is a bit time-consuming and stuff

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700 
this is a bit time-consuming and stuff
like<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.600> actually<00:02:24.870> decided<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
like that so I have actually decided to

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.800
