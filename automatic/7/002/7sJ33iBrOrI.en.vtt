00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
it right to do so yeah I don't actually

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.230 
it right to do so yeah I don't actually
know<00:05:15.620> what<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:15.980> might<00:05:16.190> not<00:05:16.370> need<00:05:16.610> help<00:05:16.910> with

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
know what you might not need help with

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.310 
know what you might not need help with
other<00:05:17.480> models<00:05:18.050> but<00:05:19.330> maybe<00:05:20.330> it's<00:05:20.510> just<00:05:20.570> me<00:05:21.020> and

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
other models but maybe it's just me and

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.010 
other models but maybe it's just me and
then<00:05:21.560> use<00:05:21.740> help<00:05:22.240> but<00:05:23.320> SD<00:05:24.320> models<00:05:24.800> are<00:05:25.100> kind<00:05:25.430> and

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
then use help but SD models are kind and

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.940 
then use help but SD models are kind and
I<00:05:27.020> think<00:05:27.370> extra<00:05:28.370> help<00:05:28.550> wouldn't<00:05:29.120> be<00:05:29.270> bad<00:05:29.950> you
