00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
there was definitely very tough but I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.250 
there was definitely very tough but I
was<00:01:07.050> fortunate<00:01:07.320> enough<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:08.900> outlast<00:01:09.900> quite<00:01:10.230> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
was fortunate enough to outlast quite a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
was fortunate enough to outlast quite a
few<00:01:10.440> great<00:01:10.590> players<00:01:10.860> income<00:01:11.190> second<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.820> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
few great players income second that so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.960
