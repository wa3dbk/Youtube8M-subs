there now trying to get the attention of
the<00:01:06.900> matilda<00:01:07.439> which<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.920> crossed<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:09.890> path

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the matilda which just crossed the path

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.940 
the matilda which just crossed the path
over<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.760> nope<00:01:12.060> oh<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.680> enemy

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
over there but nope oh and then an enemy

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.330 
over there but nope oh and then an enemy
comes<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.110> then<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.979> full<00:01:17.729> HP<00:01:19.340> t28

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
comes there and then the a full HP t28

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
comes there and then the a full HP t28
which<00:01:20.880> could<00:01:21.210> probably<00:01:21.689> win<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> game<00:01:22.770> for

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
which could probably win the game for

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.990 
which could probably win the game for
the<00:01:23.189> enemy<00:01:23.580> team<00:01:24.380> probably<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:26.280> has<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.790> good

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the enemy team probably if he has a good

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
the enemy team probably if he has a good
gun<00:01:27.409> just<00:01:28.409> suicides<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.470> stack<00:01:31.470> screw

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
gun just suicides to get a stack screw

00:01:31.770 --> 00:02:03.040 
gun just suicides to get a stack screw
and<00:01:32.720> therefore<00:01:33.720> loses<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> battle<00:01:34.950> easily

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.110
