00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
on the wall there there is also an m14

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.720 
on the wall there there is also an m14
there<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.619> hurry<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.189> video<00:00:29.490> up

wall<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.899> 750<00:00:42.899> points<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.469> then

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
wall here which is 750 points and then

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
wall here which is 750 points and then
you<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.219> want<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> keep<00:00:44.640> running<00:00:44.969> around<00:00:45.450> to

this area and you want to go towards no
man's<00:00:49.320> land<00:00:49.520> but<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:52.280> no<00:00:53.280> man's<00:00:53.579> land

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
man's land but to get to no man's land

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
man's land but to get to no man's land
and<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.719> generated<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.739> generator<00:00:56.160> is

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and to be generated the generator is

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.410 
and to be generated the generator is
where<00:00:56.579> we're<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.030> training

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
where we're going to be training

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.170 
where we're going to be training
basically<00:00:57.780> boy<00:00:57.960> does<00:00:58.199> need<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.530> no<00:00:58.680> man's<00:00:58.949> land

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
but to get to that door I didn't know

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.850 
but to get to that door I didn't know
until<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.000> started<00:01:03.390> making<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:03.960> 750

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
until I started making this at 750

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
until I started making this at 750
points<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.939> door<00:01:06.000> through<00:01:06.750> that

door even so you just need to rack out

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
door even so you just need to rack out
your<00:01:09.510> points<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.049> fairly<00:01:10.650> easy<00:01:10.799> those

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.630 
stairs and you have the zombies spawning
to<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.829> mostly<00:01:58.829> become<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to your right mostly become from the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.270 
to your right mostly become from the
stairs<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.420> few<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.710> actually

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
stairs a few of them do actually

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.030 
stairs a few of them do actually
eventually<00:02:02.939> come<00:02:03.240> from<00:02:03.810> behind<00:02:03.930> me<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
eventually come from behind me there and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.510 
eventually come from behind me there and
but<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.570> wreck

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
but what I would wreck

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.020 
but what I would wreck
not<00:02:07.909> doing<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.780> actually<00:02:09.319> running<00:02:10.039> down<00:02:10.640> to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
not doing is actually running down to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.800 
not doing is actually running down to
the<00:02:11.150> left<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:12.080> get<00:02:12.890> speed<00:02:13.340> Cola<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.060> training

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the left to get speed Cola and training

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.229 
the left to get speed Cola and training
there<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.500> can<00:02:15.769> train<00:02:16.099> if<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.550> jump<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
there you can train if you jump on the

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.270 
there you can train if you jump on the
wooden<00:02:17.420> platform<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.379> platform<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
wooden platform and the platform in the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.210 
wooden platform and the platform in the
middle<00:02:19.610> but<00:02:20.269> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.629> run<00:02:20.900> around<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.650> outside

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
middle but if you run around the outside

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.150 
middle but if you run around the outside
it<00:02:22.700> actually<00:02:23.300> slows<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.840> down<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:25.040> can

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
it actually slows you down and you can

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.119 
it actually slows you down and you can
get<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:25.549> totally<00:02:26.209> messed<00:02:26.480> up<00:02:26.750> by<00:02:27.019> all<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
get just totally messed up by all of the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.089 
get just totally messed up by all of the
zombies<00:02:28.519> it<00:02:28.670> happened<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.180> me<00:02:29.360> before<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:31.010> in

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
zombies it happened to me before not in
