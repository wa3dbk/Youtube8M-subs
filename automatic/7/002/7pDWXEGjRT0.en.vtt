00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.760
 SZ 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.739
 that went all in all in the sale of all that we ourselves 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:24.880
 can prepare 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.970
 we can prepare ourselves for all the situation in the familiar encounter 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.390
 Of course we need our own arguments, that is, we 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.360
 We need to use the help we bring to our interlocutors 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 Dementia can solve these tasks 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.970
 Many say that I have a problem that could and should be 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.890
 the right words for it needs the right arguments that's a point 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.610
 which you can prepare very well 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.750
 one point 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.740
 and to have a good conversation 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.569
 another point to stay in good conversation it's the East 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.389
 with the so-called resisting a male or to avoid death 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.890
 can 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.670
 and also 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.540
 China is like that "These are shops that are going to sell empty is basically always 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.900
 the same today it is the one argument that is tomorrow and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 the day after tomorrow and a day after tomorrow repeated 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.219
 in my view that is 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.690
 The pass on beautiful sold does not prepare us here 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.080
 that is, if we do not have a nice answer here on one 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.690
 applied to beautiful locations then we are guilty 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.070
 that means we could in the preparation, however, the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.509
 Resistances you collect 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.200
 and on these standards resistors also standard an end find Rheine the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.960
 People we talk to 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.480
 Fink of each never 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.610
 and from there 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.160
 there is just a little more peace in the conversation there is one 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.630
 a bit more confidence 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.870
 there are 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.250
 Complete more opportunities to complete faster 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.140
 complete 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.120
 and only because we have a good sales pitch 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.450
 I wish you good luck and if you know exactly where you are 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 my training that very very exactly I train 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 This appeal to them a lot of success 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.529
 If you are looking for fifth place, you would like to give it a try 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.299
 I have two examples Christel example number one for the benefit what 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.569
 I mean with the benefit it must be tangible for the people I am me 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.620
 would say to them now just come to me for a sales training 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.549
 then you can sell better 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.240
 So that is the hiking 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.929
 as you probably heard some things out there 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:34.649
 Justina statement if they come to me for a sales training 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.969
 then they really did not train that at the end of the day 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.399
 Trainings also possible this self-confidence have these techniques 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.559
 Also, they do not just get a place that makes them sometime 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:50.369
 Shelf set they get from me material that looks right in the course 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.969
 edit that SIMfix ready concept because the possibility in the 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.729
 Training with others 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.379
 too much not realistic to try out what she did the day after 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.659
 then threaten again in their own environment with their prospects then 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.319
 the second example is the example of a canvas 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.169
 probably the most active in the sales they are always new people 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:13.779
 to meet 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.319
 or want to meet 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.649
 and you could say that the statement for example be St drink we have 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:21.809
 already go 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.709
 and that is of course a standard objection and to the question I already have 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.450
 only on the statement 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.879
 more thorough than a seasoned salesman answers 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.199
 if I give them 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.589
 Once again, bringing an advantage can be something that will help you a lot more 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:38.589
 they are then open for a conversation of two to three minutes 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.649
 and that's it 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.789
 What I mean by that you are prepared you did not like the mouth 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:49.089
 you have more options more flexibility and if you have this 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.479
 Flexibility week by week month by month to expand more sea 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.259
 then they sign up in my newsletter there they get everyone 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.879
 month 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.930
 a pulse 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.249
 because she guaranteed to bring a piece forward 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:02.170
 I'm glad 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.930
 on her registration newsletter 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.930
 Thomas Leif is discussed 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 SID 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.699
 is 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.050
 is
