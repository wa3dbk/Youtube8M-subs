touch<00:02:10.970> connected<00:02:17.260> hopefully<00:02:18.280> some<00:02:19.280> reason<00:02:19.640> is

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
touch connected hopefully some reason is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.479

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.630 
not wanting image creep 3g single right
now<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:23.709> sometimes<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:25.160> doesn't<00:02:25.459> want<00:02:25.580> to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
now so sometimes it doesn't want to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:38.510 
now so sometimes it doesn't want to
connect

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.970 

it<00:02:39.360> might<00:02:39.570> be<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.020> glitch<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.530> program

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
it might be just a glitch in the program

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.300 
it might be just a glitch in the program
I<00:02:41.240> found<00:02:42.240> if<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:42.900> not<00:02:42.990> on<00:02:43.140> preachy<00:02:43.770> it
