when I was going out I could just get

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.840 
when I was going out I could just get
something<00:01:39.680> like<00:01:39.979> with<00:01:40.130> bread<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.700> or

something like with bread in it or

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.940 
something like with bread in it or
something<00:01:41.150> like<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.330> instead<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.260> you<00:01:42.860> know

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
something like that instead of you know

the sabar Sabra classic hummus so that's

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.520 
the sabar Sabra classic hummus so that's
exactly<00:05:08.030> what<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.330> eat<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.660> with<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.290> little

exactly what I eat it with the little
baby<00:05:09.950> carrots<00:05:10.430> also<00:05:11.090> one<00:05:11.810> main<00:05:12.050> tip<00:05:12.290> is<00:05:12.440> when<00:05:12.560> I

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
baby carrots also one main tip is when I

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.560 
baby carrots also one main tip is when I
eat<00:05:12.770> salads<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.460> lot<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:13.880> calories<00:05:14.300> come

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
eat salads a lot of the calories come

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.140 
eat salads a lot of the calories come
from<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:15.380> dressing<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:15.890> put<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.220> so<00:05:16.610> I'm

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
from the dressing that you put on so I'm

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.360 
from the dressing that you put on so I'm
running<00:05:17.630> out<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.870> this<00:05:17.990> but<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.440> use<00:05:18.770> the

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
running out of this but I use the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.780 
running out of this but I use the
balsamic<00:05:19.820> vinegar<00:05:20.330> member<00:05:21.760> Progresso<00:05:22.760> I

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
balsamic vinegar member Progresso I

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.060 
balsamic vinegar member Progresso I
guess<00:05:23.030> whatever<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:24.260> a<00:05:24.380> regular<00:05:24.830> balsamic

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
guess whatever just a regular balsamic

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.900 
guess whatever just a regular balsamic
vinegar<00:05:25.730> and<00:05:25.850> not<00:05:26.030> vinaigrette<00:05:26.570> that

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
vinegar and not vinaigrette that

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.430 
vinegar and not vinaigrette that
subtracts<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:28.970> lot<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.210> calories<00:05:29.420> from<00:05:29.960> your

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
subtracts a lot of calories from your

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.980 
subtracts a lot of calories from your
salad<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.460> that<00:05:31.730> might<00:05:32.150> actually<00:05:32.450> be<00:05:32.960> a

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
salad and that might actually be a

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.170 
salad and that might actually be a
little<00:05:33.320> bit<00:05:33.470> boring<00:05:33.740> for<00:05:34.520> some<00:05:34.700> people<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.150> I

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
little bit boring for some people so I

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.140 
little bit boring for some people so I
suggest<00:05:35.780> to<00:05:35.930> put<00:05:36.110> in<00:05:36.350> red<00:05:37.130> onions<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.940> kind

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
suggest to put in red onions that kind

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.820 
suggest to put in red onions that kind
of<00:05:38.300> gives<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.660> little<00:05:38.810> bit<00:05:38.960> more<00:05:39.020> flavor<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.590> the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
of gives a little bit more flavor to the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.890 
of gives a little bit more flavor to the
salad<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:40.880> you're<00:05:41.000> not<00:05:41.120> just<00:05:41.390> kind<00:05:41.480> of<00:05:41.570> eating

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
salad so you're not just kind of eating

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.400 
salad so you're not just kind of eating
really<00:05:42.080> bland<00:05:42.470> salad<00:05:43.040> um<00:05:44.080> those<00:05:45.080> are<00:05:45.200> kind<00:05:45.350> of

I wasn't doing anything crazy maybe a

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.820 
I wasn't doing anything crazy maybe a
little<00:06:16.940> bit<00:06:17.030> of<00:06:17.150> weights<00:06:17.390> but<00:06:18.169> if<00:06:18.440> you're<00:06:18.590> just

training<00:06:25.160> to<00:06:25.310> balance<00:06:25.640> it<00:06:25.760> out<00:06:25.880> but<00:06:26.270> cardio

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
training to balance it out but cardio

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.550 
training to balance it out but cardio
does<00:06:26.990> burn<00:06:27.650> fat<00:06:28.430> so<00:06:28.790> I<00:06:29.540> was<00:06:30.169> just<00:06:30.350> doing

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
does burn fat so I was just doing

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.900 
does burn fat so I was just doing
running<00:06:30.740> basically<00:06:31.160> because<00:06:31.430> it<00:06:31.550> clears<00:06:31.790> your

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
running basically because it clears your

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.580 
running basically because it clears your
mind<00:06:31.970> gets<00:06:32.510> to<00:06:32.660> really<00:06:32.900> really<00:06:33.169> kind<00:06:33.470> of

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
mind gets to really really kind of

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.409 
mind gets to really really kind of
running<00:06:34.100> is<00:06:34.160> a<00:06:34.220> really<00:06:34.430> great<00:06:34.550> thing<00:06:34.850> it<00:06:35.390> just

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
running is a really great thing it just

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.740 
running is a really great thing it just
relaxes<00:06:36.350> you<00:06:36.800> and<00:06:37.150> you<00:06:38.150> burn<00:06:38.360> off<00:06:38.540> calories

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
relaxes you and you burn off calories

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.420 
relaxes you and you burn off calories
and<00:06:39.350> I<00:06:39.410> would<00:06:39.590> just<00:06:39.710> do<00:06:39.860> that<00:06:39.980> I<00:06:40.040> would<00:06:40.310> just

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
and I would just do that I would just

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.150 
and I would just do that I would just
literally<00:06:40.700> run<00:06:40.940> and<00:06:41.180> maybe<00:06:41.330> just<00:06:41.630> go<00:06:41.720> up<00:06:41.870> to

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
literally run and maybe just go up to

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.980 
literally run and maybe just go up to
lift<00:06:43.160> a<00:06:43.370> few<00:06:43.550> things<00:06:43.760> for<00:06:44.210> a<00:06:44.270> little<00:06:44.600> bit<00:06:44.720> and

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
lift a few things for a little bit and

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.770 
lift a few things for a little bit and
that<00:06:45.200> was<00:06:45.380> it<00:06:45.680> so<00:06:46.220> just<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.550> light<00:06:46.760> exercise<00:06:47.270> and

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
that was it so just a light exercise and

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.110 
that was it so just a light exercise and
definitely<00:06:48.350> consuming<00:06:49.220> less<00:06:49.370> calories<00:06:49.850> will

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
definitely consuming less calories will

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.990 
definitely consuming less calories will
make<00:06:50.360> you<00:06:50.510> lose<00:06:50.720> weight<00:06:51.280> also<00:06:52.280> don't<00:06:52.700> give<00:06:52.850> in

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
make you lose weight also don't give in

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.690 
make you lose weight also don't give in
to<00:06:53.260> treats<00:06:54.260> but<00:06:54.530> then<00:06:54.710> again<00:06:54.830> I<00:06:55.220> would<00:06:55.520> always
