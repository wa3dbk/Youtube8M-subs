woods<00:01:25.869> in<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.110> studio<00:01:26.439> I<00:01:26.679> think<00:01:26.979> Jim<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.520> it

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
woods in the studio I think Jim that it

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.639 
woods in the studio I think Jim that it
goes<00:01:28.659> without<00:01:28.750> saying<00:01:28.929> Island<00:01:29.439> they've<00:01:29.530> got

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
goes without saying Island they've got

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.039 
goes without saying Island they've got
to<00:01:29.770> win<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.159> but<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:31.179> could<00:01:31.360> be<00:01:31.450> decisive<00:01:31.780> in

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
to win this but it could be decisive in

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.050 
to win this but it could be decisive in
just<00:01:32.259> less<00:01:32.380> than<00:01:32.409> 18<00:01:33.039> months<00:01:33.159> time<00:01:33.520> by<00:01:33.880> how

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
just less than 18 months time by how

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.889 
just less than 18 months time by how
many<00:01:34.119> they<00:01:34.450> win<00:01:34.600> it

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
many they win it

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.870 
many they win it
yeah<00:01:35.289> goal<00:01:35.530> difference<00:01:35.950> obviously<00:01:36.130> counts

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
yeah goal difference obviously counts

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.059 
yeah goal difference obviously counts
quite<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.149> lot<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.659> but<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.140> think<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.560> key<00:01:39.039> to

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
quite a lot and but I think the key to

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.740 
quite a lot and but I think the key to
is<00:01:39.460> what<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.759> just<00:01:39.969> said<00:01:40.179> they've<00:01:40.390> got<00:01:40.569> to<00:01:40.659> win

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
is what you just said they've got to win

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.589 
is what you just said they've got to win
it<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:42.220> never<00:01:42.429> easy<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:43.119> Turks<00:01:43.390> have

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
it and that's never easy the Turks have

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.559 
it and that's never easy the Turks have
got<00:01:43.780> bottle<00:01:44.849> disorganize<00:01:45.849> themselves<00:01:46.479> a

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
got bottle disorganize themselves a

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.419 
got bottle disorganize themselves a
little<00:01:46.720> bit<00:01:46.929> but<00:01:47.349> one<00:01:47.530> would<00:01:47.740> expect<00:01:48.189> with

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
little bit but one would expect with

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.410 
little bit but one would expect with
this<00:01:48.959> Irish<00:01:49.959> side<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.560> they<00:01:50.679> would<00:01:50.890> win<00:01:51.420> but

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
this Irish side that they would win but

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.870 
this Irish side that they would win but
it's<00:01:52.599> got<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.470> be<00:01:53.619> one<00:01:53.799> that's<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.399> key<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.610> it

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
it's got to be one that's the key to it

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.969 
it's got to be one that's the key to it
that<00:01:55.209> is<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.569> number<00:01:55.869> one<00:01:55.989> priority<00:01:56.349> not<00:01:56.770> by

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
that is the number one priority not by

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.130 
that is the number one priority not by
how<00:01:57.099> many<00:01:57.399> but<00:01:57.759> let's<00:01:57.789> get<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.509> two<00:01:58.689> points<00:01:59.049> in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
how many but let's get the two points in

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.539 
how many but let's get the two points in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
pre-match talking point isn't it the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.960 
pre-match talking point isn't it the
Irish<00:02:02.439> side<00:02:02.679> because<00:02:03.069> we've<00:02:03.429> only<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.670> heard

it<00:03:06.459> will<00:03:06.639> be<00:03:06.819> up<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.150> over<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.510> think<00:03:07.630> they

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
it will be up and over I think they

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.229 
it will be up and over I think they
might<00:03:08.079> play<00:03:08.349> their<00:03:08.590> way<00:03:08.620> into<00:03:09.400> good<00:03:09.730> attacking

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
might play their way into good attacking

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.479 
might play their way into good attacking
positions<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.319> key<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.919> is<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.310> they're

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
positions the key to it is that they're

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.589 
positions the key to it is that they're
all<00:03:12.609> playing<00:03:12.910> very<00:03:13.150> well<00:03:13.209> at<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.569> moment
