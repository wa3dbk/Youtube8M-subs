and now for the gradient let's start
with<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.650> gray<00:02:49.250> scale<00:02:49.550> for<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.060> gray<00:02:50.240> scale

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
with the gray scale for the gray scale

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.930 
with the gray scale for the gray scale
there<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:51.050> very<00:02:51.470> mild<00:02:51.860> separation<00:02:52.520> visible

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
there was very mild separation visible

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.620 
there was very mild separation visible
and<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:54.680> could<00:02:55.280> only<00:02:55.400> be<00:02:55.580> seen<00:02:55.880> because<00:02:56.120> I

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
and this could only be seen because I

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.100 
and this could only be seen because I
went<00:02:57.260> looking<00:02:57.500> for<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.310> real<00:02:58.790> life<00:02:59.110> this

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
went looking for it in real life this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.300 
went looking for it in real life this
would<00:03:00.440> not<00:03:00.710> be<00:03:00.950> very<00:03:01.160> apparent<00:03:03.220> for<00:03:04.220> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
would not be very apparent for the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.120 
would not be very apparent for the
primary<00:03:04.670> colors<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.600> gradient<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.530> very

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
primary colors the gradient was very

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.020 
primary colors the gradient was very
very<00:03:07.400> smooth

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
very smooth

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.170

there<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:09.080> almost<00:03:09.470> no<00:03:09.940> separation<00:03:10.940> visible

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
there is almost no separation visible

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:30.380

this<00:03:54.580> is<00:03:54.760> primarily<00:03:55.239> due<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.630> fact<00:03:55.750> that
