00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.660 

we're<00:00:41.090> out<00:00:41.210> here<00:00:41.510> running<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.170> mine<00:00:42.740> lab<00:00:42.950> SDC

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
we're out here running the mine lab SDC

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.380 
we're out here running the mine lab SDC
2300<00:00:44.630> and<00:00:45.040> we<00:00:46.040> think<00:00:46.310> we<00:00:46.430> might<00:00:46.610> have<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:46.880> target

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
2300 and we think we might have a target

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.010 
2300 and we think we might have a target
in<00:00:47.510> through<00:00:47.720> here<00:00:51.280> good<00:00:52.280> sound<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.730> me<00:00:52.910> oh<00:00:53.210> yeah

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
in through here good sound to me oh yeah

in through here good sound to me oh yeah
baby<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:58.879> see<00:00:59.120> what<00:00:59.270> he's<00:00:59.360> doing<00:00:59.540> here<00:00:59.840> folks

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
baby you see what he's doing here folks

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.560 
baby you see what he's doing here folks
what<00:01:00.470> he's<00:01:00.590> doing<00:01:01.010> he's<00:01:01.489> using<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.030> edge<00:01:02.300> of

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
what he's doing he's using the edge of

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.670 
what he's doing he's using the edge of
the<00:01:02.690> coil<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.379> pinpoint<00:01:04.390> where<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:05.750> he's

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
the coil to pinpoint where it is he's

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.410 
the coil to pinpoint where it is he's
using<00:01:07.040> that<00:01:07.070> edge<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.729> coil<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:08.300> it's

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
using that edge of the coil so it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.260 
using that edge of the coil so it's
right<00:01:08.660> down<00:01:08.899> in<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:09.229> area<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:09.890> now<00:01:10.100> he<00:01:11.000> knows

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
right down in that area so now he knows

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.639 
right down in that area so now he knows
where<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.800> concentrate<00:01:12.800> his<00:01:13.520> scooping<00:01:14.090> all

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:30.999 

right<00:01:18.970> he's<00:01:19.970> got<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.420> out<00:01:29.619> all<00:01:30.619> right<00:01:30.770> here<00:01:30.950> we

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
right he's got it out all right here we

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:45.550 
right he's got it out all right here we
go<00:01:31.040> moment<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.580> truth<00:01:44.110> okay<00:01:45.110> did<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.409> hear

that folks I can see it as soon as you
hear<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.200> bang<00:01:48.560> did<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.100> see<00:01:49.340> what<00:01:49.490> he<00:01:49.580> was

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
hear that bang did you see what he was

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.929 
hear that bang did you see what he was
doing<00:01:50.090> he<00:01:50.810> was<00:01:50.990> slowly<00:01:51.439> dumping<00:01:52.250> dirt<00:01:52.460> on<00:01:52.760> the

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
doing he was slowly dumping dirt on the

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.830 
doing he was slowly dumping dirt on the
coil<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.600> then<00:01:54.200> soon<00:01:54.619> as<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.010> hit<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.250> coil<00:01:55.850> it

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
coil and then soon as it hit the coil it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.250 
coil and then soon as it hit the coil it
makes<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.260> little<00:01:57.409> noise<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.909> go<00:01:59.090> ahead<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.450> see

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
makes a little noise so go ahead and see

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.280 
makes a little noise so go ahead and see
it<00:02:00.380> oh<00:02:00.590> my<00:02:01.159> gosh<00:02:01.400> oh<00:02:01.790> my<00:02:01.939> gosh<00:02:02.180> look<00:02:03.020> at<00:02:03.110> this

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
it oh my gosh oh my gosh look at this

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.259 
it oh my gosh oh my gosh look at this
folks<00:02:03.560> look<00:02:04.369> at<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:04.670> right<00:02:05.030> there<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:07.269> think

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
folks look at this right there I think

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.220 
folks look at this right there I think
that's<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.890> little<00:02:10.549> piece<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.209> gold<00:02:11.600> made

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
that's it that little piece of gold made

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.900 
that's it that little piece of gold made
all<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.980> sound

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
all that sound

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.000 
all that sound
so<00:02:14.450> as<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.660> dumped<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.080> last<00:02:15.470> little<00:02:15.739> bit<00:02:15.980> of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
so as you dumped that last little bit of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.539 
so as you dumped that last little bit of
dirt<00:02:16.280> out<00:02:16.810> when<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.900> makes<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.320> noise<00:02:18.620> then

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
dirt out when it makes that noise then

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.310 
dirt out when it makes that noise then
all<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.910> have<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.239> do<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.480> fan

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.720 

you<00:02:24.320> see<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.620> don't<00:02:24.740> get<00:02:24.890> as<00:02:25.040> much<00:02:25.160> noise<00:02:25.490> in

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you see you don't get as much noise in

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.970 
you see you don't get as much noise in
the<00:02:25.850> middle<00:02:25.970> okay<00:02:26.720> but<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:30.380> go<00:02:30.560> around<00:02:30.830> that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the middle okay but you go around that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.100 
the middle okay but you go around that
edge<00:02:31.220> that's<00:02:31.550> your<00:02:31.850> hot<00:02:32.000> spot<00:02:32.210> on<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.750> coil

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
just seen it we just pulled that nugget

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.890 
just seen it we just pulled that nugget
out<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.870> here<00:03:09.110> well<00:03:09.500> guess<00:03:09.710> what

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.780 

another<00:03:14.900> signal<00:03:15.500> now<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:16.100> first<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.610> we<00:03:16.760> got

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
another signal now the first one we got

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.000 
another signal now the first one we got
was<00:03:17.180> right<00:03:17.390> there<00:03:17.720> well<00:03:18.500> now<00:03:18.650> he's<00:03:18.830> got

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
was right there well now he's got

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.860 
was right there well now he's got
another<00:03:19.310> target<00:03:19.760> right<00:03:19.910> there<00:03:22.540> see<00:03:23.540> how<00:03:23.690> he's

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
another target right there see how he's

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.990 
another target right there see how he's
turning<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.380> coil<00:03:24.650> sideways<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
turning that coil sideways and the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.240 
turning that coil sideways and the
closer<00:03:26.300> you<00:03:26.690> get<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.930> target<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.680> coil

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
closer you get the target to the coil

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:39.660 
closer you get the target to the coil
the<00:03:28.670> better<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.180> use<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.630> on<00:03:29.780> edge
