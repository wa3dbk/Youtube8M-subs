 From these stocks we correctly 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.540
 with all three characters totally broke 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.540
 are 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.330

 We also drive on the map 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.990
 Marked point the title I'll show you 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.259

 You bought yes you see again 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.670
 That's where the internet comes in here 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.460
 Video 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.570
 I have to explain more cordially 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.400
 and that's the point you will then 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.640
 look the same, where it starts a 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.530
 random event when investing 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.990
 these blue dots or red dots 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.270
 on the map from time to dive 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.240
 these random events and that 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.240
 start there no matter what time of day 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.030
 and it is the event the accidental 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:28.520
 Event hitchhiker 1 or for the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:34.010
 play english version is it is 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.410
 a relatively easy random mission 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.710
 it's about a banker in there 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.690
 the one car breakdown has to the airport too 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.230
 drive 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.150
 You mean two in game hours 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.060
 Time to arrive there is a bit 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:59.120
 short but feasible also explained the same 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.610
 how he does it and the flight divided 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.890
 always two hours later from 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.930
 the time from where you see the passenger 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.580
 with the accommodating should then absorbs and 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.200
 then drive to the airport for this 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.510
 mission selects her franklin for the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.000
 This special ability has this 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.240
 drive slow motion car and there you can 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.730
 then with your card just full throttle 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.640
 give most of it is highway of the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.530
 You see, you get forgiven with grass 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.180
 and drive most of the time in this 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.190
 special event at the same time 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.959
 seen though shorter unverschildter 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.250
 function but you see and that's what you do 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.350
 use special ability for the thing 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.730
 if he counts the bets the 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.560
 seconds even at this time 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.209
 practically so it will hardly be time for you 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.170
 subtracted as you can see I think I have 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:02.480
 me once a ingame hour halt for the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.130
 away to the airport needed that 's up 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.950
 definitely a really good trick to 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.890
 one while then still in the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.220
 opposing colors or sofas or 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.170
 the ability also invites the whole 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.019
 time again and you can almost the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.940
 all the way 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.109
 in this capacity of so here now 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.490
 see my friends on the map 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.370
 left in the west to los santos 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.740
 this highway where you get to this 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.590
 Beach houses can turn because there has 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.000
 the type to be mature panne learn her 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.919
 then with franklin now so i do that 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.330
 do then you also invite yourself here 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.440
 Yourself on the card Blaupunkt 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.710
 appeared you take the type from now 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.990
 it goes around 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.690
 time is now running two minutes 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.970
 time two minutes right time two 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.770
 hours of ingame time take you on 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.699
 Best I search the subject mobile phone high 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.080
 then you can see what time it is 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.430
 and you see here with the 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.720
 special ability as I do that 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.380

 you leave here first the airport 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.409
 because it persists as long as the 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.919
 taxi area then you have the want on 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:06:00.200

 then it went down again and that 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.890

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.870
