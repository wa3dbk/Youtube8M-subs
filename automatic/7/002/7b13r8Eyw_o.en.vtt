 very funny, however, it is a brand 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.719
 among the honored rigor he hopes at least 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 70 euros is free 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:51.149

 around the team fortress universe 2 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 this title has secured a breath 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.659
 of novelty and freshness that it still is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.610
 difficult to overcome the plot comes 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.380
 shown through movies or comics 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.470

 there is no single player campaign 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.100
 the storyline enriches and fills the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.990
 game context 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 evoking situations already seen and already

 in the comics on the official website that a 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.250
 purpose 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.470
 read them beyond the modalities of 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.080
 I play what definitely characterizes 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.230
 team fortress 2 is the presence of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.890
 classes there are nine classes divided into 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.430
 three categories defense and support attack 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.190
 the scout soldier and pyro attack classes 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.410
 they are the hard core of the offensive 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.930
 heavy demoman defense classes e 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.720
 the engineer serves to protect the points 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.610
 nerves of our team 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.560
 the support classes and the doctor on 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.510
 sniper is the spy makes nations that 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.050
 allow to overturn the fortunes of a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.330
 game 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.980
 covering the shoulders of their companions o 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.720
 putting the stick between the wheels of the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.820
 opponents 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.000
 this is exciting for team fortresses 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.520
 2 is that there is a style of play very well 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.390
 differentiated from class to class 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.459
 it almost seems to have nine games in one 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.580
 the scout is very fast and skillful 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.709
 of the double balance but very little health the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.239
 soldier is well placed and from a 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.610
 rocket launcher with firepower 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.560
 devastating that allows him to jump 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.180
 very high by sacrificing some of the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.310
 your health 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.680
 the pyro is equipped with a flamethrower with 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.820
 to set your enemies on fire 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.739
 damaging them over time 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.870
 it is also possible to blow air for 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.030
 push enemies or to extinguish them 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.530
 the women flames on their allies 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.370
 grenade launches that can 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.790
 bounce or stick to surfaces 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.100
 levy and the very slow heavy artillery 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.630
 very sturdy and with a machine gun 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.280
 devastating 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.740
 the engineer can build teleporters 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.500
 health point and ammunition distributors 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.380
 and above all automatic machine guns 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.720
 they hit enemies independently on 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.520
 medical care allies is once that 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.920

 make themselves invisible to the eyes of the women 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.980
 he can dress himself by stabbing from behind 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.250
 your opponents or sabotaging the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.660
 unfortunately the engineer buildings 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.760
 time available for this 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.890
