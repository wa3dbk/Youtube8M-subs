00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.760
 welcome to this new session measures 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.490
 to the fourth in which we're going to see the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.260
 types of silences previously same 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.810
 the figures now let's see the 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.390
 silences that make up a work or what 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.410
 we can find ourselves in a work well 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.410
 we have silences 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.960
 and we are going to do it as with the figures 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.970
 let's make your representation of the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 figure its representation as a 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.770
 silence and its representation in the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.770
 compass here let's put figure 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.179
 figure 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.219
 Y 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.010
 ah 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.229
 ical 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 silence 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.830
 Y 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.770
 we give him 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 round 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.550
 the band is a round 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.120
 as we saw before the 15 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.120
 silence 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.359
 that representation is a compass 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.359
 is this 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.109
 more or less a bit weird 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.970
 you have to have a lot of eye with the 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:18.810
 differentiation between the round 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.040
 the white because the round is here 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.200
 up in the room 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.819
 subject by the bottom of the room 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.700
 line is the third in the 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.790
 part of above and the plant we will see 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.790
 now 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.760
 have 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.520
 a difficulty because it's the same 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.319
 but instead of being subject from the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.459
 line above 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.459
 be subject 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.930
 the line below 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.880
 here you see the third line above and the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.770
 fourth line down the difference between 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.270
 during the round also another 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.130
 difference then that in a compass of two 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.410
 for four are another you will find 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.960
 never never because it is worth four 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.930
 time 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.069
 and they were 2 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.709
 this is the one that you will find 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.280
 and in a compass of 4.4 is where are you going to 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.749
 find this eyes of these 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.579
 preferably it is if the 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:28.489
 following in a row is nonsense 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.840
 put two we put one and not strictly 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.840
 problems well 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.010
 the times are in the same times 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.660
 when in the same as the musical figure of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.770
 his figure 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.200
 his sound figure equal to four times 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.230
 were the times were a while and 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.500
 well progressively dividing by 2 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.070
 ok let's go to 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.070
 silence 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.790
 silence is this 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.240
 and its representation in it 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.240
 staff 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.870
 is 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.880
 in the middle of very high and low in the middle 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.310
 in the middle of the score 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.500
 does not have to start in a 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.760
 site or end in another here yes here 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.460
 it has to be is in the third and 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.460
 is in the fourth but in this medium 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.500
 quaver 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.500
 here 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.240
 in that better we will not see it 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:52.230
 It is silly doing well as 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.030
 eighth note there is only a small 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.030
 difference that I will comment 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.920
 3. 4. 5 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.530
 do not 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.740
 do not confuse us 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.300
 and here we put in ballet half always 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.409
 righ now 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.710
 this is the figure or the sound the figure 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.470
 or the symbol of the silence of the 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.810
 eighth note for the same half of the 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.200
 black vale 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:33.070
 a quarter of white and one eighth of 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.500
 round - talking mathematics eighth 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.410
 well the porsche know that you have a 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.289
 clasp this bracket makes like it 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.469
 doubles like this is done as well as a little circle 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:47.669
 and that's the symbol now we do have a 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.669
 simple eighth note let's see here 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.969
 more or less it becomes 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.629
 the sound becomes silent would be 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.629
 A) Yes 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.380
 and so on if there's more 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.720
 divisions 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.040
 the more brackets have more sticks 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.960
 of these we have to put in the 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.920
 silence and even there is represented equal 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.320
 that is in the middle of the score and without 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.420
 any 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.000
 no order how to place it 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.630
 it is usually placed between the third and 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.400
 the fourth normally the first of the 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.560
 sticks but if it is very big then 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.200
 logically if for example we have one 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.700
 of five or six that are already divisions 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.120
 very small that we will see later 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.560
 because now they are not very necessary , 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.510
 can see is a work 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.190
 yes yes the first one and this is a 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.110
 little higher but let it not 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.110
 necessary to put it 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:58.979
 to the third line 4a this is fine 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:01.409
 and that's already the classification of the 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.849
 silences the directions you have to have 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.859
 consider how it silences what is the same 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:07.549
 that the musical figure of sound is worth 

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:11.489
 same you have to be very careful with 

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:14.989
 these with these you have to have a lot 

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:14.989
 be very careful 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.090
 why 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.010
 but I live it that this although it 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.390
 it seems it's not the same, it's not the same 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.460
 that I'm placed a little bit higher 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.890
 a little bit lower this with the 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.540
 practice and with reading scores you're not going to 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:33.639
 have a problem this later what 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.740
 we will see but good as 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:38.050
 differentiation this is the hardest thing I 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.530
 I believe in learning the silences 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:45.400
 these two because they look a lot like 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.289
 they seem very good, because this is already 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.580
 the end of session number four we 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:50.710
 we see in the next session where 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.650
 We will see the types of measures according to their 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.810
 subdivision first in the subdivision 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.449
 binary with its corresponding 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.580
 compasses and later the subdivision 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:01.930
 ternaria and we will see the difficult one of the 

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.439
 division to the difference between 

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.439
 those two 

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.930
 alive 

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.430
 Y
