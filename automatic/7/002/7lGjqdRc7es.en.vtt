00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello to all i'm pissed at hervé 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.440
 cooking items like today 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.269
 let's make a recipe together 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 delight your children I'm sure there 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.619
 these are the sources of donuts 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.480
 elongated star-shaped 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.580
 typically in Spain beats right away 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.539
 lovers for the recipe you'll have 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.160
 we are for the puff pastry 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.960
 raises 250 g of flour also 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.239
 250 milliliters of cold water 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.660
 we will put a teaspoon 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.879
 of salt and a pinch of 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.200
 bicarbonate 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.210
 finally in the dough I would put a little 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.239
 little olive oil is here 20 grams 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 you can put 20 g of butter otherwise 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.910
 for frying I would take oil 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.170
 of grape seeds could make 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.750
 sunflower oil too so when I 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.539
 review a liter and finally will make a small 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.129
 simple sauce with chocolate 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.570
 chocolate butter and pastry 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.600
 cream 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.199
 the first step team bring you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.199
 water to a boil 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.350
 that's after I'll start 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.760
 take advanced 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.090
 I will heat my oil so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.720
 you use a deep fryer or a large 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.720
 bock like that 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.280
 the him he must be at 180 degrees so if 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.000
 you have a cooking thermometer 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.149
 do not hesitate to check 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.970
 no stronger in the flour you put 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:33.030
 salt bicarbonate 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.729
 I will put olive oil in the middle 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:45.909
 pressed in the flour and we add 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:47.890
 boiling water and we mix and that's it 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.890
 you have to get a good sticky dough 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.479
 like that so if you do not have enough 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.850
 of water do not hesitate to add one 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.590
 little bit one to get this 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.590
 sticky consistency 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.130
 here you fill a pocket to 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:08.979
 socket with your preparation and you 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.370
 use of course a mouthpiece intends to lead 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.110
 canvas here is the I use a pocket 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.910
 socket with a small shaped tip 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.299
 canvases and it's gone oilz 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.100
 boiling 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:22.540
 we will start cooking things so 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.810
 you are making sweet fall in 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.810
 oil 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.970
 hop 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.350
 so here are the chevreuse me I do them 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.790
 cook 4.5 at a time so they do not 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.980
 stick together while cooking 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.600
 so you see that it sleeps pretty fast in 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.270
 gold after a minute or two max 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.940
 it's ready it's very pretty 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.500
 here I show you and it swells well 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.160
 then you put the drivers on 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.240
 absorbent paper 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.690
 like those we just sprinkle with 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.990
 sugar 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.860
 here and then we put them aside and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.860
 we will cook more 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.350
 last step before tasting our 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.690
 things I'm high school with a 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.130
 whip the chocolate that I put with the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.670
 cream in the microwave during a small 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.500
 minute 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.160
 and here's a guard and we get a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.090
 great gourmet chocolate sauce 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.190
 consumption turns out that with things 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.650
 and here is mission accomplished noshur 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.820
 homes are ready well hot near 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.680
 to taste it soaked in chocolate 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.850
 and eaten like that I you 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.080
