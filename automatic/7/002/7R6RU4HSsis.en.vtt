obadah<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:02.040> believe<00:00:02.669> it's<00:00:02.850> in<00:00:02.939> 96<00:00:03.510> or<00:00:03.689> 97

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
obadah I believe it's in 96 or 97

sea-doo<00:00:05.430> GTX<00:00:06.089> with<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.259> Rotax<00:00:08.240> Bombardier

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
sea-doo GTX with the Rotax Bombardier

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.720 
sea-doo GTX with the Rotax Bombardier
Rotax<00:00:09.750> engine<00:00:10.349> out<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.190> machine<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
Rotax engine out of the machine the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.480 
Rotax engine out of the machine the
engine<00:00:12.360> had<00:00:12.480> failed<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.950> guess<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.340> owner

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
engine had failed and I guess the owner

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.220 
engine had failed and I guess the owner
decided<00:00:14.969> he<00:00:15.179> was<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.540> try<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.839> fix<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
decided he was going to try and fix it

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.980 
decided he was going to try and fix it
so<00:00:16.410> he<00:00:16.440> yanked<00:00:16.800> out<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.949> motor<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.990> lost

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
so he yanked out the motor and lost

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.019 
so he yanked out the motor and lost
interest<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.949> got<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.670> really<00:00:20.789> good

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
interest so I got it for a really good

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269 
interest so I got it for a really good
price<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.480> came<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> nice<00:00:22.020> trailer<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.619> if

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
price it came on a nice trailer if if

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.040 
price it came on a nice trailer if if
all<00:00:23.460> goes<00:00:23.519> bad<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.210> sell<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> trailer<00:00:24.930> in

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
all goes bad I can sell the trailer in

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.130 
all goes bad I can sell the trailer in
part<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> Moschino<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.480> main

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
part the Moschino but one of the main

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929 
part the Moschino but one of the main
problem<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.619> guess<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
problem I guess in here is one of the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.020 
problem I guess in here is one of the
connecting<00:00:30.420> rods<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.160> very<00:00:32.160> loose<00:00:32.520> against

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
connecting rods is very loose against

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.290 
connecting rods is very loose against
the<00:00:33.270> crank<00:00:33.660> shot<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.309> shine<00:00:35.850> my

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the crank shot now if I can shine my

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
the crank shot now if I can shine my
phone<00:00:36.600> light<00:00:36.870> down<00:00:37.140> through<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.950> intake<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
phone light down through the intake and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.080 
phone light down through the intake and
give<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.120> shake<00:00:39.329> back<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.899> forth<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> can

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
give this a shake back and forth you can

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
give this a shake back and forth you can
see<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:43.500> there's<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> ton<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> play<00:00:45.350> between

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
see that there's a ton of play between

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
see that there's a ton of play between
that<00:00:46.559> connecting<00:00:47.100> rod<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.489> shinier<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.149> on

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
cast piece of steel inside now I suspect

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
cast piece of steel inside now I suspect
the<00:00:54.780> bearing<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.590> there<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.160> I've<00:00:56.309> never

the bearing if there is one I've never

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450 
the bearing if there is one I've never
had<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.059> apart<00:00:57.420> before<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:58.460> gone

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
had one of these apart before is gone

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.410 
had one of these apart before is gone
out<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.770> connecting<00:01:01.770> rod<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.969> crank

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
out of the connecting rod and the crank

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.109 
out of the connecting rod and the crank
has<00:01:03.570> ground<00:01:03.840> away<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.970> connecting<00:01:05.970> rod

has ground away at the connecting rod

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
has ground away at the connecting rod
and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.960> probably<00:01:07.140> need<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> new<00:01:07.530> router<00:01:07.860> new

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and I probably need a new router new

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469 
and I probably need a new router new
bearing<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.700> might<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.090> send<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
bearing and I might have to send this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.090 
bearing and I might have to send this
cranking<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> machined<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> go

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
cranking to have it machined and go

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
cranking to have it machined and go

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
bigger bearing on this side we come over

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.929

what<00:01:35.280> I'm<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> pop<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.600> open<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
what I'm gonna do is pop this open and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.130 
what I'm gonna do is pop this open and
do<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.670> further<00:01:38.880> investigation<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.840> figure

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
do some further investigation and figure

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
do some further investigation and figure
out<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.530> worth<00:01:40.680> actually<00:01:40.979> repairing

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
out if it's worth actually repairing

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
out if it's worth actually repairing
this<00:01:42.150> or<00:01:42.390> replacing<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> bottom<00:01:43.740> end<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.009> don't

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
this or replacing the bottom end I don't

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
this or replacing the bottom end I don't
know<00:01:44.310> I've<00:01:44.460> never<00:01:44.490> torn<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.720> these<00:01:45.810> apart

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
know I've never torn one of these apart
