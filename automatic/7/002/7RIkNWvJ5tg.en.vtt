00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
before I use it just because I feel like

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
before I use it just because I feel like
it's<00:00:21.480> best<00:00:21.720> distracting<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.410> work<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.830> but

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it's best distracting to work with but

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.130 
it's best distracting to work with but
of<00:00:23.160> course<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.550> step<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.269> necessary<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
of course this step is not necessary and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.630 
of course this step is not necessary and
you<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.650> start<00:00:25.769> working<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.430> whatever

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
you just can start working with whatever

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.310 
you just can start working with whatever
clay<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.840> have

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
so the first use is standing up small

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.590
