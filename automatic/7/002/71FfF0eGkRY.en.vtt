 thiago very close to me and so will be 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.690
 and I say 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.980
 it's short 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.370
 but they do not understand thinks there's no I think 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.979
 that there's no way he does not get 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.720
 here disease will refer not us 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.850
 we talk about money only when it 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.020
 collapsed he says sorry love but I'm going to 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.850
 go crazy 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.530
 here is the phrase that yes we had 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.190
 taken everything from madness has not been 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.010
 gone to all 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.380
 he wants me with my dad his father is 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.200
 dead I have done are both today 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.840
 buried in myself in the same 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.820
 Hot plot peace and here comes the topic 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 sorry love or sanction it with a peking 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.530
 with my dad and that comes to you that is 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.660
 strong force to 8,000 kilometers I'm going to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.340
 you expect that when she starts 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.170
 call and take to the side of this 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 because it can be crazy 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.409
 now that if I have an illness 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.720
 that I can not cure and that it does them badly 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.150
 everyone 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.560
 pity that we do not have can not be 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.390
 look for guys the part where the sister 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.610
 talk about the disease when you can 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.560
 yes we can but also no no me 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.780
 it happened to me to ask for it because 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.960
 we talk about the disease but 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.870
 coincides with progress if now the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.030
 disease was not physical is clear no 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.680
 see a man who was with the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.090
 terminal illness and that decides the 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.679
 bring forward the end of his life 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.500
 I think we are talking about a 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.129
 illness that had to see some 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.129
 they say with 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.310
 maybe spend more than he had or such 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.370
 the life of doing business that the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.480
 exceeded transmission 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.670
 If at some point maybe 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.110
 have committed to things that are not 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.060
 they could hold for me out there more the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.129
 depression because of what I heard 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.080
 of the sisters and that's not the first 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.170
 Once he threatened to kill her 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.260
 time more then I live maybe that's it 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.239
 the statement that he maybe is a 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.560
 consequence of what Jorge says type 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.410
 that if it gets after the lack of 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.720
 answers in front of a reality that you 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.280
 he harasses everywhere and people who 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.959
 technically you for a matter of 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.700
 education you respond well to the fact 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.170
 not having answers takes you to the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.870
 depression and I tell you 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.030
 but live clear to see a person 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.709
 that is always playing or that there 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.879
 played several times with I'm going to 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:20.910
 kill me governments and also 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:24.400
 tendencies to have talking because 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.680
 He says he does bad to everyone and yes because 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.530
 It must be horrible so it's fine but 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.660
 but let's say it's a disease the 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.090
 depression terrible disease 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.410
 but you you have to control how I 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.550
 I think it speaks of another disease the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.420
 Matera the mind the theme of silver says 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.420
 because there is such
