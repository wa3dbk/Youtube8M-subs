is at 120 volt technology by using
higher<00:00:38.860> voltage<00:00:39.370> we<00:00:39.850> can<00:00:40.120> get<00:00:40.270> better

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
higher voltage we can get better

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.690 
higher voltage we can get better
performance<00:00:40.750> out<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:41.470> this<00:00:41.590> stuff<00:00:41.860> but<00:00:42.460> you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
performance out of this stuff but you

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.549 
performance out of this stuff but you
also<00:00:43.059> have<00:00:43.540> to<00:00:43.720> really<00:00:44.079> know<00:00:44.230> what<00:00:44.380> you're

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
also have to really know what you're

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.470 
also have to really know what you're
doing<00:00:44.890> we've<00:00:45.460> invented<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:46.120> thing<00:00:46.149> called

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
doing we've invented a thing called

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.500 
doing we've invented a thing called
super<00:00:46.870> op<00:00:47.050> amps<00:00:47.470> which<00:00:48.100> are<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.370> huge<00:00:48.700> part<00:00:49.300> of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
super op amps which are a huge part of

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.140 
super op amps which are a huge part of
what<00:00:49.690> we<00:00:49.840> do<00:00:50.020> but<00:00:50.620> bottom<00:00:50.980> line<00:00:51.160> is<00:00:51.400> this<00:00:51.910> is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
what we do but bottom line is this is

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.890 
what we do but bottom line is this is
the<00:00:52.270> world's<00:00:52.600> first<00:00:53.100> 120<00:00:54.100> volt<00:00:54.340> summing<00:00:55.330> mixer

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
the world's first 120 volt summing mixer

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.750 
the world's first 120 volt summing mixer
with<00:00:56.910> pen<00:00:57.910> pods<00:00:58.540> for<00:00:59.500> via<00:00:59.740> got<00:00:59.980> pan<00:01:00.220> pods<00:01:00.520> and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
with pen pods for via got pan pods and

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.180 
with pen pods for via got pan pods and
you<00:01:01.180> got<00:01:01.360> faders<00:01:01.930> because<00:01:02.590> people<00:01:02.950> used<00:01:03.100> to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
you got faders because people used to

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.649 
you got faders because people used to
say<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.430> us<00:01:03.520> when<00:01:03.790> we<00:01:03.910> did<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.150> first<00:01:04.180> mix

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
say to us when we did the first mix

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.810 
say to us when we did the first mix
stream<00:01:04.930> she<00:01:05.560> it's<00:01:05.740> great<00:01:06.040> but<00:01:06.159> I<00:01:06.220> wish<00:01:06.460> we<00:01:06.490> had

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
stream she it's great but I wish we had

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.880 
stream she it's great but I wish we had
faders<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.360> pan<00:01:07.570> pods<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.020> we<00:01:08.110> said<00:01:08.350> if<00:01:08.740> we're

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
faders and pan pods and we said if we're

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.590 
faders and pan pods and we said if we're
going<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.040> do<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:09.850> might<00:01:10.090> as<00:01:10.150> well<00:01:10.270> make<00:01:10.540> a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
going to do that we might as well make a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.480 
going to do that we might as well make a
console<00:01:11.170> well<00:01:11.470> we<00:01:11.680> thought<00:01:11.890> about<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.340> and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
console well we thought about it and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.210 
console well we thought about it and
decided<00:01:12.909> if<00:01:13.810> we're<00:01:14.020> going<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.409> we're<00:01:14.979> going<00:01:15.130> to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
decided if we're going to we're going to

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.880 
decided if we're going to we're going to
go<00:01:15.340> 120<00:01:16.060> volt<00:01:16.240> like<00:01:16.420> our<00:01:16.570> mastering<00:01:17.020> stuff<00:01:17.259> so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
go 120 volt like our mastering stuff so

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.320 
go 120 volt like our mastering stuff so
you've<00:01:18.040> got<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.189> 120<00:01:18.939> volt<00:01:20.100> 24<00:01:21.100> channel<00:01:21.640> summing

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
you've got a 120 volt 24 channel summing

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.300 
you've got a 120 volt 24 channel summing
device<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.409> also<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.890> monitoring

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
device and it also is a monitoring

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.520 
device and it also is a monitoring
console<00:01:24.880> what's<00:01:25.479> nice<00:01:25.720> is<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.170> you've<00:01:26.320> got

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
console what's nice is so you've got

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.740 
console what's nice is so you've got
well<00:01:26.770> these<00:01:26.890> are<00:01:27.070> all<00:01:27.130> stereo<00:01:27.790> faders<00:01:28.540> so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
well these are all stereo faders so

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.530 
well these are all stereo faders so
these<00:01:28.900> are<00:01:29.110> all<00:01:29.500> stereo<00:01:29.979> channels<00:01:30.520> but<00:01:31.270> if<00:01:31.390> you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
these are all stereo channels but if you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.270 
these are all stereo channels but if you
want<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.810> go<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:32.110> mono<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.710> just<00:01:32.890> pop<00:01:33.070> into

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
want to go is mono you just pop into

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.640 
want to go is mono you just pop into
mono<00:01:33.549> button<00:01:33.909> that's<00:01:34.540> all<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.930> do<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.380> then

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
mono button that's all you do and then

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.340 
mono button that's all you do and then
you<00:01:35.830> can<00:01:36.100> send<00:01:36.400> things<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.180> monitor<00:01:38.170> only

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
you can send things to just monitor only

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.560 
you can send things to just monitor only
so<00:01:38.740> if<00:01:38.860> you're<00:01:39.010> monitoring<00:01:39.460> in<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.180> couple<00:01:40.479> of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
so if you're monitoring in a couple of

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.630 
so if you're monitoring in a couple of
channels<00:01:40.780> in<00:01:41.080> your<00:01:41.229> DAW<00:01:41.380> whatever<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.460> can

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
channels in your DAW whatever you can

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.140 
channels in your DAW whatever you can
simply<00:01:43.090> send<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:44.260> mono<00:01:44.710> only<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.640> take

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
simply send it to the mono only and take

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.690 
simply send it to the mono only and take
it<00:01:46.330> out<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.690> record<00:01:47.049> bus<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.280> know

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
it out of the record bus so you know

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.969 
it out of the record bus so you know
you've<00:01:49.270> got<00:01:49.540> choices<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.560> how<00:01:50.680> you're<00:01:50.860> going

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
you've got choices and how you're going

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.969 
you've got choices and how you're going
to<00:01:51.040> do<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.430> but<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.180> bottom<00:01:52.510> line<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:52.990> 120

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
to do that but the bottom line is 120

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.350 
to do that but the bottom line is 120
volt<00:01:54.190> Grill<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.840> 24<00:01:56.530> channels<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.549> summing<00:01:58.180> and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
volt Grill of 24 channels of summing and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.399 
volt Grill of 24 channels of summing and
the<00:01:59.170> noise<00:01:59.470> floor<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:00.720> ridiculously<00:02:01.720> low<00:02:02.020> so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
the noise floor is ridiculously low so

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.149
