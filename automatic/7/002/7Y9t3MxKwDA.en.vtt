you need to sew a 1/2 inch seam along

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.149 
you need to sew a 1/2 inch seam along
that<00:01:59.150> open<00:01:59.479> edge<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:00.020> backstitch<00:02:00.770> at<00:02:00.950> each

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.819 
that open edge and backstitch at each
point<00:02:01.600> then<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.840> time<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.200> fold<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.619> out

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
point then it is time to fold it out

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.789 
point then it is time to fold it out
turn<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.520> out<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.259> there<00:02:06.259> are<00:02:06.350> two<00:02:06.560> ways<00:02:06.770> you

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
turn it out and there are two ways you

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.649 
turn it out and there are two ways you
can<00:02:07.220> accomplish

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
can accomplish

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.030 
can accomplish
this<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:09.670> our<00:02:09.759> sample<00:02:09.910> today<00:02:10.269> we<00:02:11.050> turned<00:02:11.920> it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
this for our sample today we turned it

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.839 
this for our sample today we turned it
out<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.580> left<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.810> seam<00:02:14.140> right<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.069> one<00:02:15.640> edge

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
out and left the seam right on one edge

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.119 
out and left the seam right on one edge
but<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.660> can<00:02:16.810> also<00:02:16.989> turn<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.440> out<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
but you can also turn it out so that the

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.140 
but you can also turn it out so that the
seam<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.489> resting<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.560> inside<00:02:21.069> of<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
seam is resting on the inside of the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.199 
seam is resting on the inside of the
headband<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:24.040> need<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.459> put<00:02:24.640> two<00:02:24.970> rows

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
headband then you need to put two rows

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.360 
headband then you need to put two rows
of<00:02:25.420> gathering<00:02:25.810> stitches<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.440> each<00:02:27.010> end<00:02:27.220> don't

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
of gathering stitches on each end don't

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.190 
of gathering stitches on each end don't
be<00:02:27.760> concerned<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.299> this<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.510> an<00:02:28.720> open<00:02:28.989> end

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
be concerned that this is an open end

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.410 
be concerned that this is an open end
later<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.190> step<00:02:30.430> where<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.640> insert<00:02:31.269> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
later on in the step where we insert the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.940 
later on in the step where we insert the
elastic<00:02:31.629> band<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:33.040> will<00:02:33.340> become<00:02:33.760> secure<00:02:34.299> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
elastic band it will become secure and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.380 
elastic band it will become secure and
nicely<00:02:35.950> finished<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.519> put<00:02:37.030> two<00:02:37.180> rows<00:02:37.360> of

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
nicely finished so put two rows of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.789 
nicely finished so put two rows of
gathering<00:02:37.840> thread<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:38.260> notice<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.650> we've
