00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 when you pay 0 6 oxide health as 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.240
 always on our knees today 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.130
 The review is so interesting unfairly 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.840
 ignored knife ganzo g 706 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 on 2 legs was ordered by me from gackt on 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.939
 a gift but under his mail had 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.609
 gift immediately replace another but 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 getting this knife but somehow stayed 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.070
 wild desire to keep him why 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.489
 I try now as that's all it is 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.590
 explain means the price of their pass and 12 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.390
 US dollars excluding shipping mean 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 the knife is made of 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 made aluminum frame liner calls 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.870
 could the weight of the knife 120 grams there are two 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.020
 blade 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.210
 there is a straight blade with an arrow sharpening and 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.360
 there is a blade of a series of thorns 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 lettered for. blade length five s 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.570
 half centimeters clinic performed 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.869
 in the form of shih food food food 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.090
 This is the form of knives which 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.470
 used for shearing sheep and and therefore 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:27.900
 and kept its name blades 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:34.950
 made of steel often found show 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.909
 here knees are made of steel 41 641 16 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.380
 circle that is 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.659
 interesting is the fact that he himself is confused 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.860
 Ukrainian online stores and so 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.140
 can when sold indicated steel 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.670
 440 synod never dropped this knife 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.560
 at 447 always use 4116 steel 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.100
 which by the way is successfully used and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.680
 cold steel is interesting in 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.500
 that here even legs will swing up 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.420
 another copy of the famous gerberas Skog 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.899
 the knife again the Chinese have stolen the regatta 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.870
 nobody stole this so-called 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.630
 Oh and m product that is the original and 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.700
 creeping manufacture product but all 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.910
 legal grounds of the company ganzo 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.250
 produces this knife for the gerber company 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.480
 puts there a gerbel logo and so can you 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.290
 already becoming a gerbera 106 you will see 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.630
 gerber knife store 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.810
 97 08 know and show just do 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.370
 companies hans all legal all laws 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.550
 everything is beautiful so I told you that 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.290
 grip say grip something hard 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.220
 Of course not darken handle 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.530
 performed on a lion's aluminum frame and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.400
 there is a clip the clip is not rearranged 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.239
 clip unilaterally such an average is not 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.310
 hard soft from cold normally available 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.840
 lanyard hole or let's say 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.840
 more of course I see him as a key chain 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:13.019
 the main hinge we have made rings and 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.720
 when i already have a ganzo g704 706 knife i 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:21.320
 I consider myself fully the sovereign 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.790
 rings mean 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.549
 pleased very pleased in 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.780
 this knife for. 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.130
 out of the box of such visual sharpening 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.870
 take that going down to diathesis 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.850
 half the blade down a little bit concave 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.660
 slightly concave information in principle here 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.670
 not so big but shave guys 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.489
 say he shaves say nothing 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.200
 he really shaves he really 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.160
 shaves at the root I tried particular 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.160
 when demonstrate 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:13.370
 notice this sharpening i'm not 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.790
 I have met none of our firms from 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.130
 the boxes are not on branded and not on 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.620
 Chinese no children attention hand 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.640
 just shaved i.e. 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.730
 small pocket shaver that can 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.430
 be useful in different situations 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.560
 I wonder what this knife counting 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.169
 manufacturer is positioned as tar 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.390
 his words in a knife that is a small knife 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.300
 for survival I donâ€™t know how there 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:49.910
 survive this knife here but by itself 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.650
 spoke knife and here is a very interesting very 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.830
 so worthy you can give the rector 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.310
 Brysa did not try immediately say it 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.260
 probably all the same will be tough service 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:06.669
 shave serreytor that's how I said 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.630
 the blade is fixed liner lock and there is 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.610
 there is still an additional mechanism 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:19.310
 fixing the blade closed state here 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:21.320
 we have fluoroplastic washers of course 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.120
 the wedge there does not fly like that there and 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.710
 honestly somehow throw it out 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.790
 learn and here is such a razor 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.710
 sharpness but honestly I don't risk 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.650
 there is no backlash that is all the rink 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:38.180
 good quality and collected in my 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.280
 a glance is one of the knives in the hanse lineup 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.510
 which you do all the same with elevated 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.240
 such attention to the number 704 and along with 301 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.830
 multitool 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.979
 it is clear that all the same attention has been put here 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.570
 it was well verified and so 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:02.030
 Further, that is one of the qualitative 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:05.500
 There are such goods here, that's about the wedge 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.490
 told about steel said 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.689
 markings are all welcome 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.239
 welcome and there are 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.979
 here are the pegs on the blades one-sided and 

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:21.139
 two-way here is just not realistic 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:25.239
 do yourself you understand here that is 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.239
 such a very interesting model 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:31.969
 decided to keep myself strong enough to stand up and honest 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.860
 They say we even recommend because 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:39.739
 let's say position this knife like 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:41.569
 weapon aux archer for everyone 

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:52.429
 law enforcement will 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:54.949
 difficult and I am but use 

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:55.489
 its like a weapon given vigilant 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:59.719
 the start 

00:06:55.489 --> 00:07:05.269
 this wedge table to my opinion this 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:08.749
 really such an interesting spy 

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:13.879
 knife ganzo g 706 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:17.800
 2 that's kind of how you and everyone thanks for all 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:17.800
 view bye
