00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.490
 now 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.150
 hello and welcome to this new title the accident facilitated them together with 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.420
 today we are going to do a topic of which I have been many questions 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.769
 lately 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.910
 and this one like exporting from rows nobody or 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.510
 start exporting your animations to youtube or simply 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.869
 because it will be exported behind 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.929
 to video 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.189
 and good first thing we have to take into account especially if you want 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.980
 then there would be video to youtube is the dimension of the document 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.340
 and to change it maciel the properties the dimensions for youtube if you want 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.100
 that is in high definition or the spi 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.840
 you have to have dimensions of 1280 by 720 in height 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.740
 so let's put that 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.530
 and well here we have the size document 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.480
 who is going to put the city on youtube 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.190
 then one of the big problems when exporting rows to video is when 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.949
 we have 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.670
 an animation within a film dye as I have it at this moment 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.520
 let's be two clicks on this robot we will see that here in the mobile lic 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.469
 I have 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.049
 the animation and I have 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.909
 90 frames have been milestones clicks and I'm going out we'll see that in Latin the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.010
 Main time I do not have anything 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.990
 and good if it is for all and nothing more this this animation that I have here to the lion 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.000
 good to know nothing and what I have to do is the following simply go to 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.590
 frame 90 because it's the number of frames that I have 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.770
 within the frame within the seven films we are going to go the frame 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 90 kimber made to try frame 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.700
 just leave this space here we do not have to place anything but we're 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.080
 saying to flash hundred is too hard 90 frames 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.510
 very well and this is what we have to do is go to fahuel gualchi there 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.280
 export sport mundi 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.729
 and then obviously select place here in format I recommend you with an 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.670
 for 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.740
 whatever you want to export if it's video 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.510
 and exposed saved 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.009
 quito have followed other options percent 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.699
 what is the size the document that we already put thousand 280 by 720 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.689
 I remove in the options this first one and it stays up and it prohibited that if 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:18.789
 you want to keep 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:24.199
 good in the dimensions wake hundred pressure if you want transparency in the 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.349
 video game if you want to keep your color and here I am to hundreds of options that 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.879
 I did 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.949
 stop ex sporting where to re-export we will defeccionar the first option 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:37.150
 what I did when the last frame was reached because obviously we arrived 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.599
 here these frames and we want it to finish 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.459
 entel fotogram 90 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.839
 it is extortion to leave it as it is here 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.279
 and something very important because you probably want to go to 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.059
 export but you have to go here on the left I did cuita in serín 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.129
 sporting 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.289
 Normally, if I did not make a mistake, let's continue 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:02.079
 in gaz mind to be another size that you put in the document then of 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.229
 here you have to change it to one thousand 280 by 720 one more time 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.680
 let's see what the x and you want to change in the quality of the sound you can do 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.020
 with some twitter effects 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.379
 etcetera lanzarote and exhibitions that to export to export the video 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.759
 now the 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:24.319
 the solution that can work for you if you are using phrases c3po any 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.919
 higher version but if you're working for example with flash 8 what 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.499
 what are you going to have to do 10 convert your movie clips your symbol of 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.949
 seven movies graphic symbol 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.469
 and to do that what you have to do is select your symbol and then 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.209
 action of ice type the select graphic symbol and then here in 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.769
 the properties we're going to select the iguana scoop run once what's going 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:49.809
 do that is 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:54.209
 run the animation that we have inside the mobile click here visualize it in 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.939
 lalin the main time 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.209
 then here I will want you linear main time saws stretches the scoreboard 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.840
 line the good time we start to see the animation that is inside 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.719
 our graphic symbol instead we return to what is the mobile click and 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.009
 we do the same 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.179
 this does not happen 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:14.299
 anses and these are two photos to a version 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.010
 below I recommend that you try sixth the graphic symbol and export from this 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.879
 way 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.719
 in the deadlines and amézketa caudal do not work this I recommend you look 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:33.039
 swallowed he made strong d converter of that double uu efe video then search 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:33.940
 in this way 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.880
 It's all good faith 2 video tupi screen you can also search 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.819
 of the next 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.210
 what she doubled effect lived alive in hiring and this costs 

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:50.979
 find that forced efe that is the file those of the animations 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.029
 any in this video format 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:58.639
 and finally if you have a windows PC this is the option that is most going to 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.360
 agree 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.010
 and finally, yes, you have already voted all the options and nothing is working 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.680
 good as long as the last resort to use a are strong video capture 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.689
 online screen capture like the one used not to record this tutorial 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.369
 well then correct animation giving control entere and then record the 

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:18.349
 that way 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.339
 but I do not recommend it because generally the speed of the 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.940
 frames is not very good but as a last resort you can use it 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.780
 I hope that one of the doubts that you sent me by mail or 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.700
 for comments via youtube 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.310
 about exporting rows to video 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.949
 until next time
