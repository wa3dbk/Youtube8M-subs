00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that original I used to get but this one

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
that original I used to get but this one
right<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> want<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
right here is not the one you want to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.619 
right here is not the one you want to
install<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.140> install<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.680> unless<00:00:56.629> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
install do not install this unless you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.529 
install do not install this unless you
can<00:00:58.050> watch<00:00:58.350> other<00:00:58.559> videos<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.539> because

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
can watch other videos but I because

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.020 
can watch other videos but I because
it's<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.800> reliable<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
it's more reliable this one you have a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.039 
it's more reliable this one you have a
very<00:01:03.989> very<00:01:04.320> big<00:01:04.680> chance<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.189> getting<00:01:05.549> dropped

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
very very big chance of getting dropped

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.789 
very very big chance of getting dropped
from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> server<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> i<00:01:09.630> prefer<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.320> because

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
from the server so i prefer this because

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.740 
from the server so i prefer this because
i<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> proxy<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.770> meteor

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
i have a proxy and you go into meteor

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
i have a proxy and you go into meteor
download<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.470> wary<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.340> cannot

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
download it be wary that you cannot

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.510 
download it be wary that you cannot
uninstall<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> only

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
uninstall this so that's the only

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.749 
uninstall this so that's the only
downside<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.600> cannot<00:01:21.840> uninstall<00:01:22.759> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
downside to it you cannot uninstall so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
downside to it you cannot uninstall so
install<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.900> own<00:01:25.020> risk<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.830> going

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
install at your own risk it's not going

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
install at your own risk it's not going
to<00:01:26.070> break<00:01:26.220> your<00:01:26.400> device<00:01:26.750> but<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.049> could<00:01:28.530> not

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to break your device but I could not

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.780 
to break your device but I could not
figure<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.159> way<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> uninstall<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
figure out a way how to uninstall it so

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.109 
figure out a way how to uninstall it so
yeah<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.600> worried<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> once<00:01:36.000> that

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
yeah just be worried so once that

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
yeah just be worried so once that
installed<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.900> basically<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.530> spire<00:01:37.860> if

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
installed it's basically like spire if

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.530 
installed it's basically like spire if
you<00:01:38.220> ever<00:01:38.369> use<00:01:38.460> power<00:01:38.820> before<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you ever use power before you know you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.010 
you ever use power before you know you
need<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> proxy<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:42.150> it'll<00:01:42.840> come<00:01:42.990> up

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
