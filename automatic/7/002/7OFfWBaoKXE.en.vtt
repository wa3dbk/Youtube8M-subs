away<00:01:31.710> we're<00:01:32.040> still<00:01:32.250> unpacking<00:01:32.399> it<00:01:34.250> was<00:01:35.250> almost

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
away we're still unpacking it was almost

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.690 
away we're still unpacking it was almost
certainly<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.030> had<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.330> out<00:01:36.479> here

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
certainly would have had it out here

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
certainly would have had it out here
yeah<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.880> still<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.300> down<00:01:43.040> it's<00:01:44.040> taken

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
yeah it still going down it's taken

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.150 
yeah it still going down it's taken
about<00:01:44.550> a<00:01:44.700> 45-degree<00:01:45.420> turn<00:01:46.050> down<00:01:46.619> towards<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
about a 45-degree turn down towards the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:02:00.050 
about a 45-degree turn down towards the
Earth<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.160> about<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> disappear<00:02:00.030> out

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
Earth it's just about to disappear out

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.530 
Earth it's just about to disappear out
of<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:01.399> sight

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:24.620 

so<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.230> got<00:02:07.380> swollen<00:02:07.590> stake<00:02:08.100> down<00:02:08.310> now

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.790 

it<00:02:25.630> may<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:25.960> been<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:28.290> medial<00:02:29.290> because<00:02:29.650> we've

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
it may have been a medial because we've

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.340 
it may have been a medial because we've
had<00:02:31.680> arrow<00:02:32.680> media<00:02:32.890> all<00:02:33.100> right<00:02:34.170> hasn't<00:02:35.170> hit<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
had arrow media all right hasn't hit the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.690 
had arrow media all right hasn't hit the
ground<00:02:35.530> yet<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.070> not<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.280> new<00:02:36.490> you're

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
ground yet so it's not a new you're

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.940 
ground yet so it's not a new you're
right<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.710> be<00:02:38.770> very<00:02:38.890> shortly

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
right but it's going to be very shortly

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.770 
right but it's going to be very shortly
it's<00:02:41.950> kind<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.190> land<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.670> ocean<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:49.570> unless

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
it's kind of land in the ocean so unless

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.090 
it's kind of land in the ocean so unless
it<00:02:49.840> was<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:51.240> big<00:02:52.240> plane<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.750> trouble<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:54.070> no

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
it was a big plane in trouble that no

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.010 
it was a big plane in trouble that no
but<00:02:54.460> it's<00:02:54.610> finished<00:02:55.000> hello<00:02:55.600> we<00:02:55.720> got<00:02:55.870> another

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
but it's finished hello we got another

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:08.630 
but it's finished hello we got another
plane<00:02:56.350> going<00:02:56.560> across<00:02:56.800> there<00:02:57.070> now

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.220 

it<00:03:09.150> certainly<00:03:09.540> traveled<00:03:09.960> a<00:03:10.020> long<00:03:10.170> distance

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
it certainly traveled a long distance

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.970 
it certainly traveled a long distance
whatever<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.069> was<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.819> if<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.209> contrail

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
whatever it was and if it's a contrail

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.199 
whatever it was and if it's a contrail
then<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.160> planes<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.640> serious<00:03:18.000> trouble

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
then that planes in serious trouble

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.880 
then that planes in serious trouble
cause<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.840> disappeared<00:03:19.410> behind<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
cause it's just disappeared behind the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.730 
cause it's just disappeared behind the
houses<00:03:20.990> heading<00:03:21.990> straight<00:03:22.350> for<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.650> ocean

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.690 

unreal<00:03:28.740> oh<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:31.650> guess<00:03:31.890> we'll<00:03:32.040> hear<00:03:32.280> about<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.520> on
