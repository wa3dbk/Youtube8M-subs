00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.219
 and very good to all of you and that's 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.230
 cristian and today I come with a tutorial and 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.490
 Today I am going to explain to you what the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.640
 good compass 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.240
 most people that I've seen that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.000
 has compasses 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.820
 I've seen myself good just come and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.510
 your pretty ones come in but a compass here 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.120
 so that our garbage 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.730
 with seen ahead but do not know the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.940
 great tool they are pulling 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.059
 hany kauam I 'm going to explain to you 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 can do with this tool gave hit 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.150
 and sheets can be a tool 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.330
 too useful 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.500
 and I'll teach you how to make good one 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.430
 paper and a compass for a quantity 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.370
 considerable power 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.070
 put the same place 1 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.909
 we put here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.909
 we put the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.819
 but if the paper here around as if 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.850
 out an oven but it's not word and now 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.230
 I can fly to the middle in no way in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.660
 White 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.870
 when the target is clicked 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.870
 straight 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.030
 we can see that a map is made 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.030
 all right 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.000
 a map 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.520
 with my case it is made of glass 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.060
 orange can not be seen in this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.060
 moment 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.650
 you can not see the ceiling so it's 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.020
 logical 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.780
 and good 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.869
 so if you want to talk about 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.240
 this map that is to enlarge what the rest 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.100
 so they look smaller and they're going to put 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.289
 many parts so blank that you 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.200
 they have to discover it and it would be 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.640
 enlarging the map so as not to get lost 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 because for example 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.150
 here we are here here we can not anymore 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.780
 there he stays there he will stay 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.480
 that is the coso you are going to appear and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.840
 are we going to the side of the arch or something not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.430
 they will know where they are 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.170
 so I can recommend something 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.170
 I voted it here this is not 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.750
 I will recommend it 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.450
 come a little more for here 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.280
 in the middle and put a ballot here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 we grab this 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.879
 and what happened to you 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.850
 well no change has not changed this to 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:12.160
 Sometimes it happens I do not know why but 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.160
 dad but always not worth 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.350
 do not 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.350
 What is it 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.820
 Y 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.130
 I do not know why that always happens but 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.630
 then we have there is 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.080
 maps 7 come see they look more 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.080
 small 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.490
 now we will be able to investigate more 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.440
 I put some around here now let's be able to 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.800
 investigate more and we will not miss 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.150
 because we know that like that square that 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.120
 is there in our house 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.299
 and we could not get lost so I 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.459
 I think I have concluded teaching them the 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:13.490
 great tool that can be done with 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.880
 him with a compass and paper 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.130
 good 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.550
 and I hope it has served me 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.550
 tutorial 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.200
 and give him little hand up share and 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.170
 subscribe well I think that over here 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.460
 I'm going to leave, we'll see each other until 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.460
 next video goodbye
