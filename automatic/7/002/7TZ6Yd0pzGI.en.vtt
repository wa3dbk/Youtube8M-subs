00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
of a soft brown by Mac and then also

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.569 
of a soft brown by Mac and then also
texture<00:03:41.699> by<00:03:41.879> Mac<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:43.230> something<00:03:43.590> kind<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
texture by Mac it's something kind of a

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.000 
texture by Mac it's something kind of a
little<00:03:44.760> warmer<00:03:45.660> vineyard<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.799> little
