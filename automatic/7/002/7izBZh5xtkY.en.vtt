00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
scissors I don't need to be too exact

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.399 
scissors I don't need to be too exact
but<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.329> my<00:01:42.420> projects<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.170> one's

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
but like a lot of my projects this one's

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.649 
but like a lot of my projects this one's
great<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.040> using<00:01:44.189> scrap<00:01:44.610> wood<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> piece

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
great for using scrap wood it's a piece

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.389 
great for using scrap wood it's a piece
of<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.990> being<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.380> year<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.009> I've<00:01:47.130> pitched

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
of it being a year and then I've pitched

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.670 
of it being a year and then I've pitched
some<00:01:47.610> hogni<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.270> actually<00:01:48.659> prefer<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
some hogni I actually prefer the look of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
some hogni I actually prefer the look of
mahogany<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.310> bubinga<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> lot

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
mahogany to bubinga which I know a lot

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
mahogany to bubinga which I know a lot
of<00:01:51.570> people<00:01:51.869> send<00:01:52.079> mad<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.890> bing<00:01:53.070> is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
of people send mad because the bing is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.209 
of people send mad because the bing is
an<00:01:53.340> exotic<00:01:53.640> hardwood<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.290> mahogany<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
an exotic hardwood but this mahogany is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.039 
an exotic hardwood but this mahogany is
a<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.460> too<00:01:56.670> thick<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:57.420> use<00:01:57.869> this

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
a bit too thick so I'm actually use this

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.810 
a bit too thick so I'm actually use this
bubinga<00:01:58.469> because<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> half<00:01:59.610> an

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
bubinga because it's a bit a half an

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.760 
bubinga because it's a bit a half an
inch<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.210> five<00:02:00.450> eighths<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:00.930> inch<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
inch or five eighths of an inch so I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.170 
inch or five eighths of an inch so I
think<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.250> would<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.430> perfect<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
think this would be perfect for the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:15.770 
think this would be perfect for the
bureau

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.320 

all<00:02:16.710> right<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.040> looks<00:02:17.430> pretty<00:02:17.730> crop<00:02:18.000> when<00:02:18.240> you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
all right so looks pretty crop when you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330 
all right so looks pretty crop when you
take<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> forest<00:02:18.960> off<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> bond<00:02:19.470> some<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:20.040> just

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
take a forest off the bond some if just

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.190 
take a forest off the bond some if just
ten<00:02:20.610> down<00:02:20.850> some<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.240> parts<00:02:21.600> below<00:02:21.840> I'll<00:02:21.960> never

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
ten down some the parts below I'll never

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.050 
ten down some the parts below I'll never
do<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.500> signed<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.550> curves

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
do it signed all the it's like curves

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.420

welcome so let's do that goes wrap some

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.740 
welcome so let's do that goes wrap some
sandpaper<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.170> pencil<00:03:04.470> no<00:03:05.750> usually

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
sandpaper or in this pencil no usually

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.360 
sandpaper or in this pencil no usually
what<00:03:06.840> people<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.530> they<00:03:07.709> grab<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> piece

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
what people do is that they grab a piece

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.100 
what people do is that they grab a piece
like<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.660> wrap<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.080> around

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
like this and then this wrap it around

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.600 
like this and then this wrap it around
but<00:03:10.410> see<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> problem<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.250> don't<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.489> if

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
but see the problem is I don't know if

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.640 
but see the problem is I don't know if
you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.850> hear<00:03:12.090> -<00:03:12.270> but<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.840> kind<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.110> bending

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
you can hear - but it's kind of bending

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.440 
you can hear - but it's kind of bending
and<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.340> doesn't<00:03:14.850> really<00:03:14.970> go<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.360> what

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
and it doesn't really go and what

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.820 
and it doesn't really go and what
happens<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.930> when<00:03:16.080> you're<00:03:16.200> using<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.620> just

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
happens is when you're using it just

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.240 
happens is when you're using it just
goes<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> good<00:03:18.750> trick<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.140> do<00:03:19.320> it

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
goes like that so a good trick to do it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.800 
goes like that so a good trick to do it
makes<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.670> bit<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:21.000> difference<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.600> when<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
makes a bit of a difference is when you

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.210 
makes a bit of a difference is when you
have<00:03:21.989> your<00:03:22.080> piece<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.290> wood<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.560> put<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.100> over

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
have your piece of wood just put it over

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.850 
have your piece of wood just put it over
the<00:03:23.430> edge<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.820> any<00:03:23.970> surface<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.660> roll<00:03:25.590> like

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
the edge of any surface and roll like

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.979 
the edge of any surface and roll like
this<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.340> pay<00:03:26.580> some<00:03:26.850> paper<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.239> mean<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
this so you pay some paper I mean and it

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.199 
this so you pay some paper I mean and it
gives<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.260> clans<00:03:28.500> natural<00:03:29.160> curve<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:29.910> way

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
gives a clans natural curve so that way

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.270 
gives a clans natural curve so that way
when<00:03:30.450> you're<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> wrapping<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.200> around<00:03:31.440> your

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
when you're a wrapping it around your

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.699 
when you're a wrapping it around your
pencil<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.299> kind<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.630> wants<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.200> fit<00:03:34.500> that

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
pencil it kind of wants to fit that

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.710 
pencil it kind of wants to fit that
shape<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.730> now<00:03:35.880> when<00:03:36.030> you're<00:03:36.180> using<00:03:36.420> tha

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
shape so now when you're using tha

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.570 
shape so now when you're using tha
doesn't<00:03:37.140> Bend<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.799> doesn't<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.430> lot

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580
