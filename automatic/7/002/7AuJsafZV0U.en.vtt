cancer<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:16.369> figured<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.850> video<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
cancer I figured I make this video the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.439 
cancer I figured I make this video the
first<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> series<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.859> videos<00:00:20.369> telling<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
first in a series of videos telling you

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.179 
first in a series of videos telling you
about<00:00:21.630> my<00:00:21.900> experiences<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
about my experiences with it and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.089 
about my experiences with it and
hopefully<00:00:23.369> will<00:00:24.300> help<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.840> other<00:00:25.470> men<00:00:25.830> who

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
hopefully will help out other men who

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.390 
hopefully will help out other men who
might<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.730> facing<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.300> same<00:00:27.510> situation<00:00:28.400> I'm

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
might be facing the same situation I'm

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.229 
might be facing the same situation I'm
located<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.359> San<00:00:31.050> Diego<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.180> i'm<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
located here in San Diego and i'm a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.709 
located here in San Diego and i'm a
member<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.040> Kaiser<00:00:35.040> Foundation<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.390> I'm

member of the Kaiser Foundation and I'm

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.540 
member of the Kaiser Foundation and I'm
just<00:00:36.989> looking<00:00:37.469> enough<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.040> say<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:40.550> they

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
just looking enough to say that they

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.500 
just looking enough to say that they
offered<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.450> numerous<00:00:45.079> treatment<00:00:46.079> methods<00:00:47.510> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
offered a numerous treatment methods to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.189 
offered a numerous treatment methods to
choose<00:00:48.780> from<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:50.460> choice<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.210> something

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
choose from and the choice is something

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
choose from and the choice is something
that<00:00:52.350> each<00:00:52.530> individual<00:00:53.160> has<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.850> because

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that each individual has to make because

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.650 
that each individual has to make because
it's<00:00:54.870> based<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> number<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.129> factors<00:00:56.660> I

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it's based on a number of factors I

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.549 
it's based on a number of factors I
chose<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> consider<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.180> best<00:01:00.930> method

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
chose what I consider the best method

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.390 
chose what I consider the best method
for<00:01:01.910> me<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.329> probably<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.470> main<00:01:04.710> reason<00:01:04.739> for

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
for me and probably the main reason for

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.060 
for me and probably the main reason for
it<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:07.080> my<00:01:07.380> dad<00:01:07.710> lived<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.850> 93<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
it is because my dad lived to be 93 and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.750 
it is because my dad lived to be 93 and
I'm<00:01:11.070> 63<00:01:11.640> now<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.439> my<00:01:13.439> mom<00:01:13.680> lived<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.220> her<00:01:14.340> 80s

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
I'm 63 now and my mom lived in her 80s

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780 
I'm 63 now and my mom lived in her 80s
and<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> think<00:01:16.200> hopefully<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.460> number

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and so I think hopefully I have a number

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.950 
and so I think hopefully I have a number
of<00:01:18.060> years<00:01:18.270> ahead<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.840> me<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:21.330> getting

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
of years ahead of me and I think getting

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
of years ahead of me and I think getting
the<00:01:22.939> surgery<00:01:24.320> for<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.799> best<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the surgery for me is the best bit of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
the surgery for me is the best bit of
beating<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.479> cancer<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:31.070> unfortunately

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
beating this cancer and unfortunately

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.760 
beating this cancer and unfortunately
the<00:01:32.280> downside<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.530> probably<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the downside is it is probably one of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130 
the downside is it is probably one of
the<00:01:34.979> most<00:01:35.130> stressful<00:01:35.810> there's<00:01:36.810> three

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the most stressful there's three

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
the most stressful there's three
different<00:01:37.320> types<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> surgery<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:39.329> going

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
different types of surgery and I'm going

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.539 
different types of surgery and I'm going
for<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> robotic<00:01:42.079> radical<00:01:43.549> prostatectomy

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
for the robotic radical prostatectomy

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.630 
for the robotic radical prostatectomy
and<00:01:45.229> from<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.470> understand<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.430> my

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and from what I understand and from my

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.990 
and from what I understand and from my
research<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.680> old<00:01:49.950> other<00:01:50.280> two<00:01:50.579> open<00:01:51.000> surgery

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
research the old other two open surgery

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.270 
research the old other two open surgery
and<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.450> laparoscopic<00:01:53.170> surgery<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.160> the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
and the laparoscopic surgery and the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.640 
and the laparoscopic surgery and the
robotic<00:01:54.880> surgery<00:01:55.390> actually<00:01:55.570> for<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.350> if<00:01:56.530> you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
robotic surgery actually for that if you

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.800 
robotic surgery actually for that if you
count<00:01:56.860> them<00:01:57.040> all<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.600> outcomes<00:01:59.070> are<00:02:00.810> pretty

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
count them all the outcomes are pretty

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.500 
count them all the outcomes are pretty
much<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.050> same<00:02:02.260> from<00:02:03.190> all<00:02:03.430> of<00:02:03.580> them<00:02:03.760> but<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
much the same from all of them but the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
much the same from all of them but the
laparoscopic<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.620> robotic<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:08.110> big

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
laparoscopic and robotic have the big

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.880 
laparoscopic and robotic have the big
advantage<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.399> that<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.869> healing<00:02:11.290> time<00:02:11.560> is

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
advantage in that the healing time is

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.460 
advantage in that the healing time is
much<00:02:12.610> quicker<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.870> recovery<00:02:14.470> time<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
much quicker the recovery time and the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.920 
much quicker the recovery time and the
after<00:02:17.470> surgery<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.310> discomfort<00:02:19.180> it's<00:02:19.690> much

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
after surgery of discomfort it's much

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.470 
after surgery of discomfort it's much
less<00:02:20.260> because<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.490> way<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.790> procedure<00:02:22.209> is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
less because of the way the procedure is

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.890 
less because of the way the procedure is
set<00:02:22.720> up<00:02:22.900> now<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:24.160> would<00:02:24.700> also<00:02:24.910> be<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.720> other

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
set up now that would also be the other

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.729 
set up now that would also be the other
options<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.739> had<00:02:27.010> were<00:02:28.020> two<00:02:29.020> different<00:02:29.530> types

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
options I had were two different types

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.940 
options I had were two different types
of<00:02:30.100> radiation<00:02:30.690> open<00:02:31.690> beam<00:02:31.900> radiation<00:02:32.440> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
of radiation open beam radiation and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.270 
of radiation open beam radiation and
seed<00:02:33.670> implant<00:02:34.500> implantation<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.130> other

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
seed implant implantation the other

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.080 
seed implant implantation the other
options<00:02:36.820> besides<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.570> surgery<00:02:38.340> were<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.600> I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
options besides the surgery were the I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.880 
options besides the surgery were the I
forgot<00:02:43.090> what<00:02:43.239> was<00:02:43.390> now<00:02:44.880> hormone<00:02:45.880> therapy<00:02:46.480> and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
forgot what was now hormone therapy and

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.020 
forgot what was now hormone therapy and
then<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> two<00:02:48.190> different<00:02:48.640> types<00:02:48.820> of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
then the two different types of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.270 
then the two different types of

what's<00:03:00.340> called<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.760> watchful<00:03:01.000> waiting<00:03:01.480> program

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
what's called a watchful waiting program

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.199 
what's called a watchful waiting program
in<00:03:02.680> other<00:03:02.980> words<00:03:03.220> they<00:03:03.430> were<00:03:03.459> monitoring

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
in other words they were monitoring

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.539 
in other words they were monitoring
because<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.870> type<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.110> cancer<00:03:05.530> is<00:03:05.860> very<00:03:05.890> slow

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
because this type of cancer is very slow

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.530 
because this type of cancer is very slow
growing<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:08.970> large<00:03:09.970> number<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.420> people

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
growing and a large number of people

growing and a large number of people
with<00:03:11.019> this<00:03:11.230> actually<00:03:11.799> you're<00:03:11.890> going<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.310> pass

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
with this actually you're going to pass

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.460 
with this actually you're going to pass
away<00:03:12.730> from<00:03:13.120> something<00:03:13.390> else<00:03:13.720> other<00:03:14.080> than<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
away from something else other than the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.250 
away from something else other than the
cancer<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:16.030> watchful<00:03:16.510> waiting<00:03:16.660> people

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
cancer so the watchful waiting people

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.009 
cancer so the watchful waiting people
are<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:18.030> keeping<00:03:19.030> an<00:03:19.180> eye<00:03:19.299> on<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.750> getting

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
are just keeping an eye on it getting

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.740 
are just keeping an eye on it getting
PSA<00:03:20.709> tests<00:03:21.100> every<00:03:21.489> three<00:03:21.730> or<00:03:21.760> six<00:03:22.120> months<00:03:22.269> and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
PSA tests every three or six months and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.940 
PSA tests every three or six months and
then<00:03:22.900> once<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.350> year<00:03:24.840> perhaps<00:03:25.840> getting<00:03:26.140> another

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
then once a year perhaps getting another

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.520 
then once a year perhaps getting another
biopsy<00:03:27.280> which<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.180> really<00:03:28.450> no<00:03:28.690> big<00:03:28.959> deal<00:03:29.230> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
biopsy which is really no big deal and

about<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.799> same<00:03:32.980> they<00:03:33.700> save<00:03:34.060> themselves<00:03:34.329> from

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
about the same they save themselves from

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.199 
about the same they save themselves from
