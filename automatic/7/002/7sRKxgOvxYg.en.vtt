trial<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.900> worked<00:02:24.650> out<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> great<00:02:25.970> idea

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
trial in worked out this is a great idea

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.780 
trial in worked out this is a great idea
because<00:02:27.830> when<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.040> look<00:02:28.250> at<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.489> composition

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
because when I look at the composition

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.729 
because when I look at the composition
of<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.209> briquettes<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:30.410> our<00:02:30.500> waste

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
of the briquettes this is our waste

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.580 
of the briquettes this is our waste
materials<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:32.480> we<00:02:32.780> are<00:02:32.810> reaching<00:02:33.320> with<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
materials and we are reaching with the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.520 
materials and we are reaching with the
materials<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.390> don't<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.630> any<00:02:35.840> reason<00:02:36.320> why<00:02:36.350> we

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
materials I don't see any reason why we

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.470 
materials I don't see any reason why we
should<00:02:36.830> continue<00:02:37.010> using<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.790> mean<00:02:38.000> cutting<00:02:38.360> or

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
should continue using I mean cutting or

bit<00:03:31.280> sound<00:03:31.549> so<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.720> one's<00:03:32.900> us<00:03:33.110> how<00:03:33.260> we<00:03:33.320> have

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
bit sound so that one's us how we have

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.050 
bit sound so that one's us how we have
now<00:03:33.709> really<00:03:34.310> known<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.640> really<00:03:34.940> these

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
now really known that really these

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.390 
now really known that really these
briquettes<00:03:35.329> are<00:03:35.570> really<00:03:35.959> faster<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
briquettes are really faster the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.460 
briquettes are really faster the
briquettes<00:03:37.790> are<00:03:38.060> also<00:03:38.239> much<00:03:38.630> cleaner<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.260> use

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
briquettes are also much cleaner to use

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.800 
briquettes are also much cleaner to use
they're<00:03:40.310> easy<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.730> store<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.269> they<00:03:41.630> don't

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
they're easy to store and they don't

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.500 
they're easy to store and they don't
