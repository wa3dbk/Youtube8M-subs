00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.480
 reading material 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.849
 in fact the content about the work 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.890
 social housing and social housing is 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.529
 that is more comprehensive and we are 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.720
 here alongside consultant Ana Claudia and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.690
 From teacher maria do carmo brant to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.060
 talk exactly about this content 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 the teacher Maria of the car was the author 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.470
 content that you have in your 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.310
 reading book teacher maria do 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.440
 car 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:50.790
 what is the definition of social work is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.610
 a fundamental question is the concept of 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.000
 social work and social work we 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 we understand how an intervention in the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.570
 on the ground of politics itself 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.750
 the service which is happening 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.920
 example I'm doing a program 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.780
 a sanitation program 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.170
 that it is located and there with those 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.250
 residents is not enough the inter gaucho one 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.210
 it is not enough for me to deliver 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.990
 housing or urbanization of the favela 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.049
 these urban interventions 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.260
 they must have meaning for the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.950
 population that will be the beneficiary is 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.549
 The importance of social work 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.439
 we do social work that is the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.700
 who want to inform the population about the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:58.080
 what will happen there open opportunities 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.509
 channels for them to participate in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.450
 throughout the process 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.650
 of that physical intervention is to say 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.899
 participate in the urbanization of the favela 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.169
 participate in the registration of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.469
 inhabitants in the selection of those who will 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.370
 priority in these new homes which 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.909
 they will be fine 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.970
 benefited by plumbing sewage 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.680
 sanitation and electricity they 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.510
 need to come back all the time 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.340
 participating in it 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.470
 what is the main element of these 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.769
 processes of participation 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.769
 looks at the key elements is 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.170
 first of all i need to believe 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.290
 what people can participate 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.079
 I can believe that the population of 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.129
 low income living in slums or house 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:53.910
 precarious in the periphery can participate 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:57.480
 has potential and know what you want you have a 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.480
 accumulated history of learning 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.970
 urban life and indeed the very fact of it 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.390
 being a favela resident already shows 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.379
 how much he is a coproducer in the city and 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.500
 City 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.239
 so first precise technicians 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.620
 believe that participation is 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.420
 important 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.400
 it is necessary to believe that the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.639
 residents and beneficiaries of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.090
 housing programs is very 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:30.959
 important is very important there are many 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.319
 know there accumulated exactly as I 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.190
 said nursery has life experiences 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.250
 between them they built a knowledge about the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.160
 urban life over their dwelling 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.169
 about the very way in which that 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.650
 housing what is better 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:52.680
 etc etc and in this context of having a 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.500
 new normative for work work 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.530
 This represents a change of 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.900
 policy that will have an impact on 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.090
 in the work of social teams as 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.790
 role of these teams and which are 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.959
 the important innovations that the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.310
 21 behind 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.760
 Look at this concierge 2011 is 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.849
 very important 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.060
 first by its own meaning is a 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:22.949
 ordinance that gives importance to work 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.680
 explicit social and regulates the work 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:28.830
 society from now on 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.500
 technicians do not go to the area without having 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.950
 regulation in 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.550
 indication of procedures and 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.660
 content and actions in programs 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.900
 housing 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.840
 then this first ordinance begins with 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.580
 define social work 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.990
 it defines as a set of actions of 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:58.100
 process strategies that aim at 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.750
 guarantee the autonomy of this population to 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:05.900
 their insertion in the enterprise that 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.870
 going to occur is occurring how much later 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.110
 their inclusion in the town itself its 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.169
 inclusion and a sense of belonging to 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.560
 urban fabric and the city she introduced 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.890
 an important innovation in what is the 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.090
 concept of micro air and macro area 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:29.540
 so we usually worked on the 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.790
 passed only in the micro-area of ​​intervention 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.430
 where it was even occurring 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.070
 housing intervention sanitation 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.100
 now we do not want this 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:44.870
 population has guaranteed insertion 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:48.110
 macro area because it killed area in the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.830
 where she lived with new 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:54.710
 new social networks and other relationships 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.740
 public services it will access 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.460
 then this resident needs to be 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:05.180
 appropriate from the macro area to actually 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.780
 I make sure they get into the mesh 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.600
 feel like you belong to the city and 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.160
 not out of the city as in most 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.810
 has occurred and that it has 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.910
 effective insertion opportunities 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:25.970
 productive insertion in the tell and 7 center 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:29.060
 then the concierge itself will regulate 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:33.620
 that I will continue working in the post 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:36.550
 bought an action plan for 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.580
 socio-territorial development 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:43.409
 exactly to go to give time to this 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.009
 population to have roots 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:48.179
 in this new territory and in this new 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.179
 habitat 

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:53.309
 you can see how important it is 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:55.399
 is the social work that will permeate 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:58.979
 our course during those months that you 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:07:00.629
 is approaching each of these 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.119
 concepts of each of these relationships 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.489
 that the teacher Maria of the car since 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:07.589
 then do not forget to 

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:10.259
 resume the content in your 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:13.519
 reading and checking is your knowledge 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.519
 the same proposed activity
