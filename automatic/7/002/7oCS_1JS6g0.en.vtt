00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.920
 good today I bring you a 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.889
 totally unique tutorial where you 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.100
 I want to show how to recover a 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.890
 Lost password 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.840
 as for your operating system either 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.900
 windows 7 windows vista or windows xp me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.060
 I do not know how many of you have passed 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.939
 or you've even met people who 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.640
 maybe they can not find the key anymore 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.740
 they have been lost and they have no way of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 enter or access windows I think that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.020
 for many people the solution more 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.570
 quick is maybe they would format the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 computer and let's say that in that way 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.390
 spend that putting the key but in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.489
 many cases that is not the solution 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.519
 adequate because you can have 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.409
 files that you really occupy within 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.089
 that operating system 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.239
 format the computer in this case 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.530
 I would format everything now I want 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.030
 give them a warning that this 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.210
 tutorial has the purpose only 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.570
 educational that no motive I am 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.180
 It provides that provides well providing 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.430
 downloads I'm not leaving downloads 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.250
 illegally so it's that I 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.899
 I teach the technique and you take care of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.550
 get that program through the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.490
 resources that you can 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.080
 but really understand it but at 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.450
 provide other information 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.870
 different to what it is to educate me 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.960
 would affect as a user that I am in 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.040
 good youtube let's start the first thing 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.970
 what we have to do is 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.970
 sign to start or control panel 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.680
 because I'm going to put a password 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.690
 of this operating system that has not yet 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.300
 have through some users 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.820
 I'm going to select the accounts now 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.530
 next let's say that I have the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.710
 administrator account that is called 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.750
 ' I'm going to let you create a 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.390
 password and put a password and I'll 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.930
 put the password I will choose the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.420
 password 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and here below in 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.120
 the ying and it's something that reminds us of that 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.060
 password 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.670
 I'm going to put a 6 we're going to put you create 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.160
 password or password and let's say that 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.220
 up to this point we have already created 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.630
 our computer password like this 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.630
 that I'm going to restart the computer 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.069
 I'll wait for windows to start and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.750
 that once I find myself in this window 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.420
 to be able to write anything here is going 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 to give whole to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.790
 and we need the password 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.500
 really to enter the note now 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.080
 suppose that from this point you 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 you lost and you do not know the password what 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.120
 let's do is restart the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.640
 computer and as soon as I start I'm going to 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.660
 press the voice of the f 12 key to 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.730
 that bring me a menu so that I 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.580
 indicate to start from the city room from 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.250
 the room benghazi computer I'm going to 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.250
 have recorded what the file is 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.780
 practically this program I have it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.569
 put on a disc and I tell you how 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.579
 download this program after that is how it is 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.340
 that in the next window I'm going to 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:22.430
 press any key on my keyboard to 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.430
 how to start from the disk 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.319
 Now we will wait to start this 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.950
 program and well then here is already 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:37.319
 practically almost starting seems 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.870
 like I'm starting one more time 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.150
 and then good once in this window 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.579
 here you have the possibility to choose 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.560
 your language seems to come to us in 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.999
 Spanish you will have to leave in 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.999
 they are in English sorry 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.670
 but here on this side you have the 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.750
 possibility of doing two things 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.850
 different one of them is to change the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.730
 current password or the password that 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.720
 had that operating system or maybe 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.020
 another option that shows you what is that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.600
 password what exactly do I go 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.200
 to be me you can select this second 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.200
 option 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.330
 that means he's going to look for the 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:27.610
 password of users who have 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.800
 that operating system in the same way 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.509
 there is an administrator account let's say 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.090
 that each member of the family had 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:37.139
 your account when you select this account at 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.139
 select this option 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.390
 I'll give it next or continue all 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.130
 we are going to leave these options 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.920
 what they are like and we are going to give 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.790
 next and in this next window we're going 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.950
 to give once next or continue and from this 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.340
 side as you can tell me 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.350
 the account could be listed or 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.380
 all the accounts that were created 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.020
 inside this windows in this case the 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.700
 What interests me is the one that you left because 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.740
 It is practically the administrator to 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.980
 just like this above we are going to give 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:19.330
 here find password or find in the 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:22.030
 passwords and let's wait 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.800
 we wait 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.320
 well , he's done the scan 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.409
 remember what password to choose I chose 1 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.389
 2. 3 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.360
 about the account of who on the account 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:39.239
 of hash that there practically since 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.849
 I already have the password I'm going to 

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:43.499
 let out 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.270
 and I must say yes 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:50.009
 we wait for that says windows the 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.009
 password was 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:55.189
 now as we already know we start windows 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:58.009
 and we put the password we put here 1 2 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:01.099
 3 4 5 6 and we give you here in input and 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:05.139
 I'm automatically entering the 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.139
 account so easy 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.449
 now if you were an observer when I was 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.770
 me doing it to do the operation of 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.099
 look for the contractions of with the 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.960
 program that moment there I appeared in 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.710
 what is the website about the 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.250
 The company that sells this program 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.690
 call ask.com as well as see it there if you 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.050
 you come to the products section 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.440
 the program that I use is this 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.430
 He says 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.950
 here 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:39.120
 you can give him read mont and learn a 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:41.240
 little bit more and you can download this 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.130
 this program 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.110
 maybe it 's a person who 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.120
 repair computers and I think it's worth the 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.360
 penalty that you download it and then the 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.800
 you had in your machine and then and offer 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.910
 your service to people who 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.670
 require 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.000
 only 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.000
 i
