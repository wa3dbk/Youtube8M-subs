and jacked up the car put a couple jack
stands<00:00:24.180> under<00:00:24.570> there<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.930> doesn't<00:00:25.170> fall

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
stands under there so it doesn't fall

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.509 
stands under there so it doesn't fall
down<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:26.960> then<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> put<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> clamp

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
down and then we're going to put a clamp

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.479 
down and then we're going to put a clamp
on<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> squish<00:00:31.500> down<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> caliper<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
on here and squish down the caliper so

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.209 
on here and squish down the caliper so
that<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:33.710> everything<00:00:34.710> comes<00:00:34.770> apart<00:00:35.100> really

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that way everything comes apart really

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.240 
that way everything comes apart really
nicely<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> i<00:00:37.079> put<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.410> clean<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.950> here

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
nicely so i put this clean up on here

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.790 
nicely so i put this clean up on here
and<00:00:39.290> just<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.469> tighten<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> down<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
and just going to tighten it down and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
and just going to tighten it down and
that<00:00:43.800> squeezes<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> caliper<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.390> all

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
that squeezes the caliper so it's all

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.180 
that squeezes the caliper so it's all
the<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.690> open<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.770> put<00:00:46.800> our<00:00:46.980> new

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
pins so that way I can regress something

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.979 
pins so that way I can regress something

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
now i'm going to put in my new outer pad

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.589 
now i'm going to put in my new outer pad
the<00:03:12.380> outer<00:03:12.500> pad<00:03:12.860> has<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.459> squeaker<00:03:13.940> on<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.329> at

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
the outer pad has a squeaker on it at

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.009 
the outer pad has a squeaker on it at
least<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:14.989> does<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.620> mine<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:17.019> you're

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
least it does on mine and you're

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.539 
least it does on mine and you're
supposed<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.380> change<00:03:18.560> out<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.950> shim<00:03:19.280> from

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
supposed to change out the shim from

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.000 
supposed to change out the shim from
this<00:03:19.910> one<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.269> that<00:03:20.450> one<00:03:20.480> but<00:03:20.870> my<00:03:21.530> new<00:03:21.680> one<00:03:21.829> came

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
this one to that one but my new one came

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.979 
this one to that one but my new one came
with<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.310> shim<00:03:22.489> already<00:03:22.819> so<00:03:23.150> that's<00:03:23.780> kind<00:03:23.959> of

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
with it shim already so that's kind of

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:33.099 
with it shim already so that's kind of
nice

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.309 

then<00:03:34.109> it's<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.379> same<00:03:34.560> way<00:03:34.739> on<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.980> inner<00:03:35.129> one

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
then it's the same way on the inner one

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.420 
then it's the same way on the inner one
day<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:37.469> you're<00:03:37.620> supposed<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.920> put<00:03:38.040> some<00:03:38.159> anti

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
day is you're supposed to put some anti

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.130 
day is you're supposed to put some anti
squeak<00:03:38.700> compound<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.329> there<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.689> I<00:03:39.900> don't

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
squeak compound on there but I don't

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.959 
squeak compound on there but I don't
have<00:03:40.230> any<00:03:40.290> today<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:40.769> I'm<00:03:41.640> not<00:03:41.790> going<00:03:41.909> to

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:41.969 
have any today so I'm not going to

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:52.280 
have any today so I'm not going to
bother<00:03:42.090> with<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:51.359> this<00:03:51.540> caliper<00:03:51.900> wasn't

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
bother with it and this caliper wasn't

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.929 
bother with it and this caliper wasn't
quite<00:03:52.469> squeezed<00:03:52.950> down<00:03:53.099> all<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> way<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:53.519> I

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
quite squeezed down all the way so I

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.970 
quite squeezed down all the way so I
just<00:03:54.840> went<00:03:54.959> ahead<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.230> squeezed<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.799> rest

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
just went ahead and squeezed it the rest

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.819 
just went ahead and squeezed it the rest
of<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.159> way<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.549> goes<00:03:59.730> back<00:03:59.939> on<00:04:00.000> there

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:11.490 

they're<00:04:04.829> gone<00:04:08.840> tighten<00:04:09.840> down<00:04:09.870> these

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
they're gone tighten down these

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:27.950 
they're gone tighten down these
14<00:04:12.400> millimeter<00:04:12.880> bolts<00:04:13.270> that<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.480> took<00:04:13.540> off

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.330 

that's<00:04:28.560> pretty<00:04:28.860> much<00:04:29.009> it<00:04:29.069> I<00:04:31.130> got<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.220> all

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
that's pretty much it I got it all

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.010 
that's pretty much it I got it all
tightened<00:04:32.789> up<00:04:32.819> now<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.360> double-checked

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
tightened up now and double-checked

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.420 
tightened up now and double-checked
everything<00:04:34.169> made<00:04:34.680> sure<00:04:35.009> everything<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.370> tight

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
everything made sure everything is tight

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.879 
everything made sure everything is tight
and<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.720> should<00:04:36.900> be<00:04:36.930> good<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.169> go<00:04:37.349> for<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.680> couple

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
and it should be good to go for a couple

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.220 
and it should be good to go for a couple
years<00:04:38.009> now
