00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
what level it's on if it's even possible

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.509 
what level it's on if it's even possible
within<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.450> game<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:01.859> do<00:03:02.040> something<00:03:02.489> like

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
within the game to do something like

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.900 
within the game to do something like
this<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.389> elements<00:03:04.019> will<00:03:04.260> come<00:03:04.530> through

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
this the elements will come through

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.970 
this the elements will come through
that's<00:03:05.910> why<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.989> doesn't<00:03:07.349> matter<00:03:07.380> what<00:03:07.769> type

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
that's why it doesn't matter what type

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.150 
that's why it doesn't matter what type

the system is flawed what's its flawed

that's<00:03:25.139> why<00:03:25.349> we<00:03:25.590> see<00:03:26.450> wide<00:03:27.450> receivers<00:03:28.049> having
