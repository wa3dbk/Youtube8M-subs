00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:08.998
The last thing I wanted as a kid
was a big-ass pair of glasses hanging off my face

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:09.274
*Pop*

00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:13.123
Which is unfortunate, when you
just so happen to blind as shit as a kid

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.481
I was so blind..
You know the big E on the seeing-eye charts?

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:18.280
Yeah, I couldn't even see that bitch

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.159
I'd be playing a little league as a kid

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.682
Be all the way out in the outfield,
couldn't see shit, be like,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.629
"Hey guys, are we still playing?"

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:25.635
*Whoooosh-thwack!*

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.989
In the school it was even worse,
the teacher'd be like,

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:30.324
"Do all these math problems on the chalkboard"

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:34.048
And of course, I'm sitting 100,000 miles away,
 practically in the fucking hallway

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:35.913
Like, "There's a chalkboard in here?"

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:38.046
My parents would take me
to the doctor and they'd be like,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.844
"Our kid keeps running into walls..
uuhhmm.. we think he's autistic?"

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:45.285
And the doctor's like, "Well, he's not autistic,
he just can't fucking see anything"

00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:46.840
"Why doesn't he have glasses yet?"

00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:50.791
And I was like, "Shut your mouth, old man!
I don't want any of these goddamn glasses!"

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.652
When they'd test our vision in school,
I'd just wait, have a bunch of kids go ahead of me

00:00:54.692 --> 00:00:57.335
And just memorize what they would say,
when they'd read off the chart

00:00:57.413 --> 00:00:58.612
"Next person!"

00:00:58.817 --> 00:01:01.722
"Ahem.. EZYXWVUT!"

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.349
"Boom! You can all suck it!
I can see just fine!"

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:06.268
"Uh.. the chart's over there!"

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:08.593
So I'd go to the shitty-ass eye doctor

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:11.829
And if you've never been to the eye doctor before,
then you don't know what hell on earth is

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:14.702
And one of the first tests
they put you through, is for glaucoma

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.611
And the doctor's like, "Just put
your chin up on this machine here"

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.984
"And we're gonna shoot
a little puff of air into your eyeball"

00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:22.138
"Okay? You'll barely feel anything.."

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.412
*Damn thunderous bang*

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:27.540
"Alright, let's do the next eye"

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.276
And then they throw their
torture chamber device on your head

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.183
And start making you read stuff

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.883
"Alright, tell me what you see"
Like, well, I still don't fucking see anything

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:38.111
But I feel obligated to at least make a guess

00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:40.096
Like I'm playing some shitty carnival game

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:43.147
Like they're gonna give me an oversized
stuffed gorilla if I get them all right

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:48.777
I'm like, "Uh.. M.. lowercase q,
the 'at symbol'.. uhhh.."

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.934
"A Goomba from Super Mario World"

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:52.116
"How am I doing, doc?"

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.062
"You got 'em AAALLLLRIGHT!"

00:01:54.087 --> 00:01:56.006
*Hooorrraaayyy*
*Applause*

00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:59.014
No, not even close.
I was clearly blind as shit

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:02.218
So they put me out in the waiting room,
and I'm looking at all these frames on the wall

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:06.620
And I'm thinking, "Well, if I got to wear glasses,
I might as well go for the Jeff Goldblum look"

00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:08.750
Because.. because he was fly as shit!

00:02:08.803 --> 00:02:13.025
And the doctor's like, "Easy there, Sonnie.
Your family's insurance only covers these frames"

00:02:13.068 --> 00:02:17.790
And he point to one lonely shelf, that's filled with
 the most hideous glasses you've ever seen in your life

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:19.745
Ones with double bridge frames in there

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.386
So your glasses won't break
when the kids throw rocks at ya

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.974
Glasses, that would be bigger,
than kids' book bags at school

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.463
"I can't feel my nose"

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.814
Well, that's because
your fucking glasses are 14 pounds

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:31.653
I'm like, "Oh, thanks a lot, doc!"

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.066
"I said Jeff Goldblum,
not fucking Jeffrey Dahmer!"

00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:39.110
"I'm not wearing these glasses, Mom and Dad!
I'm gonna get kicked in the balls!"

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.540
Zachary gets kicked in the balls
every day at school

00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:42.388
Fuck that!

00:02:42.432 --> 00:02:45.059
I'll keep catching baseballs
with my face, before that happens

00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:47.513
My parents are over there,
trying to make me feel better

00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:49.608
"Well, you definitely look a lot smarter!"

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.151
"No, I look like I'm gonna get my ass beat
at school, that's what I look like, Mom!"

00:02:53.226 --> 00:02:54.568
But I did wear them outside of school

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.516
Because it was actually pretty nice
to see things every once in a while!

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.613
Everything didn't look like
Nintendo 64 graphics anymore

00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.862
Everything was so vivid!

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:04.795
I didn't even recognize my friends
the first time I've seen them again

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:07.007
"Man, you guys look different!"

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:10.833
We're in the car on the ride home, I'm looking
out the window, reading everything that I can

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.383
"That sign says 'STOP',
that sign says 'Speed limit 25'"

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:15.314
"That sign says.."

00:03:15.368 --> 00:03:17.297
"Shut the fuck up! Okay? We get it!"

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:19.990
"You can see again,
telescope eyes, it's no big deal"

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:21.487
"Why don't you go read yourself a book?"

00:03:21.614 --> 00:03:23.765
"With your Judge-Judy-looking ass"
