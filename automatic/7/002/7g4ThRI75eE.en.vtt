00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.899
 I've been bringing the tutorial on how to cure 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.689
 one a day are not bugs 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:27.009
 that's how it will sound very useless but like that 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.840
 of boys the zombie villagers have 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.130
 healing and good guys before 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.570
 to begin I would appreciate it if you would give me 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.430
 with your like to get to the amount of 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.100
 500 lake if in this video guys I know 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.929
 that we can get to this amount and tsj 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.399
 great like in this video and some 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.989
 guys then let's start first of all 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.660
 we have to have what would be bottles 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:48.160
 glass gold bullion apples 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.100
 nuggets spider eyes sugar eyes o 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.390
 mushrooms coffee powder and last but not least 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.920
 this we have to make a position worth 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.690
 after these guys then we have 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.370
 to take what would be the positions and 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.899
 do what would be positions worth 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.640
 we have to fill the water guys 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.989
 as we can see here we fill them and 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.940
 after these guys we are going to enter 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.890
 what would be the potions support 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.930
 let's put here guys what would be 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.310
 the potions first before anything 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.799
 let's put the positions here 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.049
 and after these guys we're going to go to 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.369
 the kraft table and let's change what 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.200
 that would be spider's eye has fermented 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.320
 here as we see it corresponds with what 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.990
 that will be a spider's eye a sugar and a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.729
 eye fungus z coffee and good the eye of spider 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.409
 is achieved by killing the spider by giving it 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.119
 critical hits is to say giving it a 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.950
 Critical blow makes a spark come out 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.679
 and well let's capture the guys by 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.869
 here we are going to create this let's grow to 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.829
 catch it here and good once kraft 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.630
 we will not go to the support of 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.119
 positions we're going to put in here what 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.890
 it would be fermented eye of spider and good 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.350
 guys this serves to capture what 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.360
 that would be the position of weakness for 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.459
 the zombie this serves so that the zombie 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.610
 have weakness and can not this let's say 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.500
 like it would be to attack you a little more with 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.970
 more force if you can say that and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.520
 also to be able to add what 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.409
 It would be a small little golden apple 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.869
 that good for now I do not know if I know crafter 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.250
 but good to see we go here to support 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.630
 of positions and good guys like 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.580
 we can see here we already have what it would be 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.360
 the position of weakness of one minute and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.429
 30 seconds 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.780
 let's take what would be a gunpowder 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.580
 of flu how good that gets 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.810
 basically this what would be killing 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.569
 clippers 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.190
 let's wait here and good here to 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.810
 put what would be gunpowder guys or 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.790
 does what would be a position like this 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.069
 that would be a weak position of 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.989
 splash it good this serves what 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.160
 would be to launch it and as we can see and 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.660
 well let's go to what it would be that the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.700
 support positions will wait 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.890
 I think that what would be the position 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.540
 of weakness that is thrown and good a 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.160
 once done these guys are going to grab 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.019
 what would be the positions we are going to 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.700
 take the and well now we're going to 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.769
 direct to direct in what would be the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.900
 zombie although I just hope I kinda 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.310
 let's remove this here and good 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.920
 let's throw what would be the position 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.080
 of weakness we are going to throw ones 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.519
 once thrown guys the zombies are going to 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.989
 have what would be its small effects 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.350
 those little particles that can 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.730
 come you can see there and good apple 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.830
 Gold guys do not have at the moment 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.180
 kraft but I do not know why but good of 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.030
 Here we will spend what would 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.670
 creative let's go here we go here and we 're going to 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.230
 creative let's go guys and good 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.730
 once we entered creative guys we are going to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.260
 take what would be the golden apple that 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.930
 as I say it is already craft with gold nuggets 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
 and an apple or with gold cubes and one 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.319
 Apple 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.579
 once this done we guys are going to 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.930
 hit what would be or touch the villager 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.569
 with the apple 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.150
 and some particles come out like what kind 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.769
 red as we can see there good we're going to 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.750
 see here good these do not have guys 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.980
 but good when it comes to putting what 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.599
 it would be the apple they will leave 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.370
 red particles guys how can we see 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.019
 This means there guys already 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.269
 we are healing and good with the passage of 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.639
 time of what would be the minecraft the 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.469
 villager is going to be cured in less 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.599
 what good we do not know about 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.010
 how good it does not have like it would be a 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.439
 definite time at the time of curing it 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.409
 but if you are you are going to explore or something 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.790
 so you know you have the target and go 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.290
 to be cured why because then you 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.450
 you gave what will be the weakness potion 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.370
 and I also added this whatever the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.720
 gold apple worth we will add what 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.819
 that here what will be the position of 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.370
 weakness let's add here is the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.310
 we launch we are going to add an apple of 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.800
 gold to this one 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.330
 and this and as I tell you guys, no 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.950
 have definite time at the time of 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.959
 get cured so we have to wait 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.940
 to see here is not going to heal cure 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.500
 sorry but well I hope that a 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.900
 small cut guys at the time of when 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.459
 are already cured and we are back and good 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.080
 guys, how can we see the villager there? 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.419
 has been healed guys as we can see 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.830
 there are only three there now because good one 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.570
 it escaped me there at the time of 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.400
 release it because good this little guy 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.750
 I wanted to eat it and well now as 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.520
 we can see guys the villager just 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.650
 be healed guys how could they see there 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.330
 he was transformed was a zombie baby villager 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.190
 and good and nothing else is to wait for 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.570
 it will also be cured and so it would be 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.460
 basically the whole guys tutorial 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.290
 it is simply to throw in whatever the 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.360
 position of weakness give him an apple 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.760
 gold and villager in a short time 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.320
 it would be ballet this one had already healed 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.729
 but apparently the zombies this one I see 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.710
 they reinfected him again so 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.510
 I had to return something that would be shed 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.100
 the position and put the apple and 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.320
 Well, nothing like that, basically, is the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.750
 tutorial on how to cure a zombie villager 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.580
