00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.150
 a new video let's talk about a couple of 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.339
 pretty interesting things about the 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.410
 white acts that good he did not get it out of 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.990
 no side but well I think it does 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.980
 reconsider a bit of thinking different 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.440
 things 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.189
 targets 2 will be released for playstation 3 xbox 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.259
 360 and pc there's nothing about u and there's no 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.759
 nothing about wifi and that's what makes me 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.680
 think of several things not several 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.230
 hypothesis that good that maybe go into 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.180
 an environment of madness but it is always 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.670
 well raise the so that the people then 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.920
 I have knowledge of new things already 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.820
 you know that good xbox microsoft has 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.550
 an exclusivity of one month with respect to 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.260
 new maps regarding times not 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.930
 we know when it's finished it's supposed to be 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.860
 an annual contract that probably 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.159
 already finished when this season of 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.540
 of elite, the best for November because 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.580
 has finished and welcomes another does not take another 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.500
 that contract does not nobody is not 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.500
 clear that the other PC users the 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.080
 of ps3 we are angry they did not pay the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.780
 elite for absolutely nothing not for 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.360
 have a month later some maps that the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.200
 Xbox 360 users already enjoy not 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.190
 Pay Pay paid a subscription 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.600
 supposedly to improve the quality of 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:26.640
 your tlc so you have them 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 Later, many would have thought 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.030
 comes the following for wii has not been 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.280
 announced nothing at least so that I 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.740
 have information for good statement 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.290
 nothing might come a surprise on the e3 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.090
 on June 3 that is when it is usually 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.860
 announce everything important not the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.640
 brain of the most important game of 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 world 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.979
 can you show something interesting maybe 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.840
 a black hawk all for a me would be the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.490
 first call of duty next 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.409
 generation let's make flattering 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.409
 always in next generation is not it 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.729
 that analysts do what the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.930
 video game experts usually do not 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.050
 put it aguayo the next generation 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.690
 although it does not fit much, even if it's 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.000
 obsolete perhaps with the specifications 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.070
 techniques that are rumored to be said and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.540
 for really being true it's not a 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.700
 little better than ps3 a little bit 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.319
 better than the one that by 60 could be the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.000
 first call of duty next 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.560
 generation the white cars and maybe for 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.560
 celebrate it intent would not be so so 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.209
 imbecile doing doing that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.450
 temporary exclusivity contract of 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.290
 times out for them without many direct 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.560
 from here 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.109
 sometimes in a world it goes around a lot and 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.950
 things happen that we expect them to be 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.530
 possible if it is entirely possible 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.900
 Nintendo has money they are and has money 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.950
 and microsoft has money that pays the most 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.500
 it is clear that getting that 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.060
 temporary exclusivity although no longer 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.319
 announcement would be a surprise not that 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.340
 teaching activision money would be 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.019
 totally comical not a ridiculous 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.239
 and I guess each of the three for 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.129
 have that contract if you do not have it 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.950
 none will be a big surprise but 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.379
 very large 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.989
 in case of being week and it would come 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.430
 pretty good to be able to increase sales 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.340
 of exit and such because it is said that I can 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.849
 follow in November of December this 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.890
 ie year at Christmas it will be good 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.200
 for its exit because to have exclusivity 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.360
 temporary temporary maps and seven a 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.310
 month then imagine there are many people 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.319
 Maybe I know it would be cool or if it's something 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.690
 stupid and stupid maybe not the boss 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.120
 that we have seen so much invites us to 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.480
 play a nail burning but good 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.940
 everything is possible everything can happen and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.560
 Nintendo is not stupid or at least not 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.530
 I think I think more than his great 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.799
 committee of counselors that I suppose that the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.290
 will have and know the money that moves a 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.490
 call of duty and more the expectations that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.980
 they are lifting black ops 2 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.220
 and there I leave it there I leave it all to think what 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.470
 what do you want I really do not know is 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.930
 possible everything is possible everything I say 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.550
 many times it may be that it may not 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.950
 it's something that left him there at random is something 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.840
 that I have thought many times so 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.000
 possible that it happened so you have to 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.440
 be aware of all this and nothing else this 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.730
 if not everything again if in the next 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.730
 video until next time
