first of all a limited number of years
secondly<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.590> their<00:02:36.070> proposal<00:02:36.610> had<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:38.220> very

over the course of time players would

not be receiving the full value of their

not be receiving the full value of their

agreement<00:02:49.360> or<00:02:49.480> anything<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.110> there's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
agreement or anything like that there's

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.040 
agreement or anything like that there's
no<00:02:51.130> suggestion<00:02:51.580> in<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.120> owners<00:02:52.510> proposals

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
no suggestion in the owners proposals

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.930 
no suggestion in the owners proposals
that<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.320> would<00:02:53.500> be<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> case<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.850> think

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
that that would be the case and I think

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.090 
that that would be the case and I think
what<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.300> just<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:56.110> need<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.410> do<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.650> ask<00:02:56.830> them

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
what you just you need to do is ask them

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.570 
what you just you need to do is ask them
that<00:02:57.930> we<00:02:58.930> had<00:02:59.110> been<00:02:59.350> proceeding<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.220> basis

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
that we had been proceeding on the basis

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.970 
that we had been proceeding on the basis
of<00:03:00.730> agreed<00:03:01.060> upon<00:03:01.180> growth<00:03:01.690> rates<00:03:01.990> their<00:03:02.709> view

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
of agreed upon growth rates their view

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.380 
of agreed upon growth rates their view
now<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.550> those<00:03:03.730> growth<00:03:03.970> rates<00:03:04.240> are

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
now is that those growth rates are

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.410 
now is that those growth rates are
unlikely<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.959> be<00:03:05.230> there<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.790> changes<00:03:07.390> things

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
unlikely to be there that changes things

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.790 
unlikely to be there that changes things
of<00:03:07.810> course<00:03:07.990> if<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:09.180> flow<00:03:10.180> into<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:11.560> if

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
of course if you flow into that but if

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.830 
of course if you flow into that but if
the<00:03:12.130> notion<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:12.820> they<00:03:13.209> are<00:03:13.239> honoring<00:03:13.720> all

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
the notion is that they are honoring all

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.240 
the notion is that they are honoring all
the<00:03:13.959> contracts<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.590> everybody's<00:03:15.010> going<00:03:15.190> to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the contracts and everybody's going to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.680 
the contracts and everybody's going to
get<00:03:15.370> paid<00:03:15.550> everything<00:03:16.239> they<00:03:16.420> were<00:03:16.480> supposed

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
get paid everything they were supposed

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.080 
get paid everything they were supposed
to<00:03:17.170> be<00:03:17.920> paid<00:03:18.280> according<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.850> letter<00:03:18.970> of

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
to be paid according to the letter of

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.120 
to be paid according to the letter of
the<00:03:19.180> contracts<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.200> course<00:03:20.770> not<00:03:20.920> true

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
the contracts it's of course not true

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.400 
the contracts it's of course not true
and<00:03:21.310> no<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.640> never<00:03:21.970> has<00:03:22.209> been<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.600> don't<00:03:23.110> quite

i<00:04:17.170> think<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.620> say

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
i think to say

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.650 
i think to say
that<00:04:18.739> if<00:04:19.009> you<00:04:19.160> write<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.400> memo<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.419> it's<00:04:20.570> a

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
that if you write a memo and it's a

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.050 
that if you write a memo and it's a

quick one that you necessarily have to

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.610 
quick one that you necessarily have to
summarize<00:04:23.479> but<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.169> doesn't<00:04:24.470> have<00:04:24.560> anything

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
out a way to do it tomorrow and you keep

out a way to do it tomorrow and you keep
at<00:05:40.070> it<00:05:40.099> as<00:05:40.370> long<00:05:40.610> as<00:05:40.820> you<00:05:41.090> know<00:05:41.210> somebody's

at it as long as you know somebody's
willing<00:05:42.289> to<00:05:42.440> do<00:05:42.650> that<00:05:42.770> what<00:05:43.340> impact<00:05:43.970> is<00:05:44.449> the

now having on negotiations in terms of
the<00:05:48.409> numbers<00:05:49.630> well<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.960> has<00:05:51.500> an<00:05:51.650> impact<00:05:51.949> but

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
the numbers well it has an impact but

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.860 
the numbers well it has an impact but
one<00:05:52.430> of<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.639> things<00:05:52.669> we<00:05:53.060> made<00:05:53.270> explicitly

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
one of the things we made explicitly

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.379 
one of the things we made explicitly
clear<00:05:54.169> today<00:05:54.610> when<00:05:55.610> we<00:05:55.789> gave<00:05:56.120> them<00:05:56.270> the

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
clear today when we gave them the

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.760 
clear today when we gave them the
comparison<00:05:56.900> of<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.080> numbers<00:05:57.349> in<00:05:57.500> which<00:05:57.620> we

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
comparison of the numbers in which we

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.409 
comparison of the numbers in which we
said<00:05:58.010> that<00:05:58.159> we<00:05:58.340> didn't<00:05:58.699> think<00:05:58.789> we<00:05:59.030> were<00:05:59.150> as<00:05:59.240> far

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
said that we didn't think we were as far

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.520 
said that we didn't think we were as far
apart<00:05:59.659> as<00:05:59.810> they<00:05:59.870> said<00:06:00.229> that<00:06:00.800> we<00:06:00.949> were<00:06:01.130> was<00:06:02.030> that

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
apart as they said that we were was that

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.750 
apart as they said that we were was that
we<00:06:03.530> would<00:06:03.680> look<00:06:03.860> at<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.130> structure<00:06:04.430> of<00:06:04.610> the

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
we would look at the structure of the

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.110 
we would look at the structure of the
agreement<00:06:05.300> based<00:06:05.930> upon<00:06:06.380> what<00:06:07.280> their<00:06:07.669> presumed

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
agreement based upon what their presumed

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.110 
agreement based upon what their presumed
growth<00:06:08.599> rates<00:06:08.900> were<00:06:09.260> and<00:06:09.590> see<00:06:10.460> if<00:06:10.580> on<00:06:10.789> that

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
growth rates were and see if on that

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.750 
growth rates were and see if on that
basis<00:06:11.659> we<00:06:11.900> were<00:06:12.620> close<00:06:12.889> enough<00:06:12.919> together<00:06:13.400> to

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
basis we were close enough together to

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.210 
basis we were close enough together to
be<00:06:14.060> in<00:06:14.289> was<00:06:15.289> about<00:06:15.470> saying<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.830> same<00:06:16.010> ballpark

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
be in was about saying the same ballpark

in<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.639> same<00:06:16.820> arena<00:06:17.060> and<00:06:18.070> we<00:06:19.070> would<00:06:19.280> then<00:06:19.550> deal

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
in the same arena and we would then deal

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.939 
in the same arena and we would then deal
with<00:06:19.909> the<00:06:20.120> lockout<00:06:20.599> issues<00:06:20.990> afterwards<00:06:21.620> and

with the lockout issues afterwards and
