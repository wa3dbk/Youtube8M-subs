00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.679
 yes you sports him I look forward to you 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.889
 Sincerely greet one 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.039
 he was already very rainy 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.690
 if I look out the window now very rainy sunday evening 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.960
 those with the short form 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.419
 you can go to bed again shortly her 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.849
 a little child decided 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.979
 and although I end up five minutes or so 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.859
 and percent 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.700
 yes, we are on the way 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.200
 yes with a class victory wanted to try 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.770
 of course they have 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.789
 Copied 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.709
 which you have to try because we play today with the aka 7 40 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.870
 with which he waits for magazine 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.360
 and as 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.670
 Petkus have plunderers 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 posed 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.360
 Hacker Pronold the cash register and I had ever been able to recognize her 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.600
 the twelve siblings proud of Vegas 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.300
 a sure one and I'm over a daughter and Thomas from four percent ob 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.540
 she likes and i always have on draft and car 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.300
 and processes so ne pixel 3 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.260
 they are not 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.630
 "I'll die a few times too, and then I think I can read that anyway 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.140
 from Dr 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.400
 there is no question left 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.670
 to man on the us series yet 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.930
 as said 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 because rumors at the end of April on 500 others to the head then here the small one 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.530
 on the seven and then here 52 of the 8 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.370
 and percent 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.310
 yes that is actually quite good 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.440
 I actually just got you all out the door 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 Kentenich Neuss is on them 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 controlled behavior 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 he brings the duo to his neighbors 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 and who pull the water to the GBC 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.090
 I would've met in a couple of times I've met 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.050
 and the CARTES more like I do not know 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.230
 And not only facts about the gentlemen, there are also ads so disturbing 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.430
 no further 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.079
 And speaking of gameplay, I do not want to advertise again 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.769
 Thank you very much 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.119
 for the support of nine percent 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.099
 quite funny mw2 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.929
 five Uli on site 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.909
 he did not think there is probably good to think about whether the duo post 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:21.749
 should 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.689
 the process should be until 18 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.689
 What he did not listen to Mr. Kahl's comment 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.209
 that looks more young 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.989
 I do not know all that 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.169
 and then in retrospect says Signals Agreement 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.449
 You just do not have the boys 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.389
 and percent the thick that does not matter 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.979
 round 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.109
 since we also rest 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.819
 yes good for you joy so now now now calls 50 thumbs up 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:47.709
 down 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.519
 that's cream, of course 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.259
 I am very happy about that 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:53.429
 and 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.489
 I still have it I believe 2 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.489
 there it is still in the 2, of course, come too 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.599
 Klawitter does not get baked because that's almost 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.009
 Friends so for a game like me here 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.979
 is that good player we are expecting 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.709
 So almost nothing works 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.439
 and percent 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.959
 as I said this a whole about it 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.129
 Mido me too 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.909
 Hofmann's longed for level 70 can not come but complete 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.109
 and that is partly still to come 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.749
 the next the NPD becomes then per cent 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.689
 be moving again 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.269
 around that is a country and 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.939
 Host marriage 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.420
 I would not have any introduction or anything to do with that, and I'll just do it like that 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.429
 died 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.099
 that's where this show plays 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.089
 Lexus is that he's still not so fluid at the moment. " 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.069
 and I reminded myself 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.629
 he had to pull up 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.519
 in the net that shipyard 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.159
 after majorities 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.259
 Jan selected candidates 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.339
 can 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.679
 It has become quite good for nothing gameplay and I definitely want that 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:57.639
 penetration 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.799
 Road construction so mid-week or 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.280
 yes, but in the middle of the week, I want to do that again shortly then 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.499
 probably announce 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:06.320
 around 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.029
 and then 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.059
 is all this his regular as I continue 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:11.959
 yes, that's something to say 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.059
 So Rooney has 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.159
 the trailer of the percent of the medtech of third 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.879
 so that all commitments become total 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.400
 in my opinion 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.460
 Of course, that will be so stupid again loses her anyway Kaufmanns 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.129
 beautiful 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.029
 solely because of the app's sixes 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.509
 Obama what was there to see 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.460
 I'm so disappointing a bit 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.770
 that is certainly the kill zone 2 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.039
 Bogocz always looks the same 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.469
 the cards are not because they are 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.469
 One to one always hear the same jokes again 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.919
 I already coha as the second Mappack Roskam or the first I think 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:48.939
 have said that before 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.000
 only Italian chef Fox still something 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.810
 our shit friends age 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.729
 we do not want tickets for Slater 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.729
 we just need to do what it stands out for, what we need 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.569
 so in the tumor Mauro is not 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.750
 Here's a size the CeMAT this optimal series in unison Sheikh's big 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.749
 Carpendale in Roxel and no human 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.520
 St "I've looked the only sensible Kate quite well 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.229
 and also routinely probably she has to 11 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.460
 everything else is chop ton 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.659
 So tests are not 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.569
 After-work is enough for today 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.569
 I want a little bit of rain too 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.330
 and then when I fly very low 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.729
 in my bed 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.669
 and the corps knife 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.930
 I do not have to read my own markup 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.370
 even close 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.490
 By default for me and I will log out 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.240
 Have a nice week with you at HIS
