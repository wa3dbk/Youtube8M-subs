00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
could they could be but they have to get

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.000 
could they could be but they have to get
that<00:03:51.879> offensive<00:03:52.299> line<00:03:52.540> figure<00:03:53.169> it<00:03:53.260> out<00:03:53.409> to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
that offensive line figure it out to

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.979 
that offensive line figure it out to
getting<00:03:54.370> Jay<00:03:54.669> Cutler<00:03:55.030> protection<00:03:55.569> as<00:03:55.689> he<00:03:55.720> was

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
getting Jay Cutler protection as he was

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.649 
getting Jay Cutler protection as he was
sacked<00:03:56.290> six<00:03:56.859> times<00:03:57.250> on<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:58.060> offensive<00:03:58.479> side

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
sacked six times on the offensive side

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.490 
sacked six times on the offensive side
of<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.989> ball<00:03:59.049> in<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.439> first<00:03:59.829> half<00:04:01.500> it's

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
of the ball in the first half it's

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.849 
of the ball in the first half it's
question<00:04:02.919> number<00:04:03.250> two<00:04:03.689> can<00:04:04.689> the<00:04:04.930> Bears<00:04:05.169> win

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
question number two can the Bears win

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.149 
question number two can the Bears win
again<00:04:06.220> without<00:04:07.060> their<00:04:07.689> defense<00:04:08.169> I<00:04:08.409> think<00:04:08.889> so

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
again without their defense I think so

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.220 
again without their defense I think so
you<00:04:09.519> know<00:04:09.699> it<00:04:09.939> depends<00:04:10.659> it<00:04:10.900> has

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
you know it depends it has

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.720 
you know it depends it has
to<00:04:11.290> me<00:04:11.409> the<00:04:11.620> right<00:04:11.800> matchup<00:04:12.310> which

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
to me the right matchup which

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.539 
to me the right matchup which
coincidentally<00:04:13.200> could<00:04:14.200> be<00:04:14.409> this<00:04:14.739> weekend<00:04:15.340> I

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
coincidentally could be this weekend I

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.520 
coincidentally could be this weekend I
think<00:04:16.359> Jay<00:04:16.630> Cutler<00:04:16.989> could<00:04:17.229> get<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.500> ball

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
think Jay Cutler could get the ball

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.039 
think Jay Cutler could get the ball

do though they could win this football
game<00:05:59.800> I<00:06:00.220> really<00:06:00.760> think<00:06:00.910> this<00:06:01.060> game<00:06:01.240> would<00:06:01.389> be

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
game I really think this game would be

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.029 
game I really think this game would be
very<00:06:01.780> close<00:06:03.419> but<00:06:04.419> if<00:06:04.630> the<00:06:04.960> Bears<00:06:05.200> execute<00:06:05.860> on

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
very close but if the Bears execute on

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.210 
very close but if the Bears execute on
these<00:06:06.729> three<00:06:07.150> big<00:06:07.660> major<00:06:08.139> critical<00:06:08.800> points

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
these three big major critical points

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.210 
these three big major critical points
one<00:06:09.910> again<00:06:10.750> establish<00:06:11.470> that<00:06:11.650> ground<00:06:11.979> game

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
one again establish that ground game

one again establish that ground game

the chicago bears winning this one 13 to
10<00:06:59.150> I<00:06:59.360> think<00:07:00.080> it<00:07:00.140> will<00:07:00.200> be<00:07:00.380> a<00:07:00.410> very<00:07:00.530> ugly

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
10 I think it will be a very ugly

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.970 
10 I think it will be a very ugly
football<00:07:02.060> game<00:07:02.330> I<00:07:02.600> think<00:07:03.140> it'll<00:07:03.380> be<00:07:03.500> close

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
football game I think it'll be close

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.880 
football game I think it'll be close
with<00:07:04.280> the<00:07:04.730> Titans<00:07:05.120> desperation<00:07:06.050> in<00:07:06.200> air<00:07:06.380> they

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
with the Titans desperation in air they

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.830 
with the Titans desperation in air they
still<00:07:07.190> have<00:07:07.310> a<00:07:07.370> shot<00:07:07.400> in<00:07:07.730> the<00:07:07.820> AFC<00:07:08.090> at<00:07:08.450> three

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
still have a shot in the AFC at three

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.780 
still have a shot in the AFC at three
and<00:07:08.930> five<00:07:09.170> that<00:07:09.800> they<00:07:09.980> need<00:07:10.220> to<00:07:10.250> get<00:07:10.400> back<00:07:10.580> on

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
and five that they need to get back on

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.940 
and five that they need to get back on
track<00:07:11.000> this<00:07:11.240> week<00:07:11.480> and<00:07:11.690> this<00:07:11.720> game<00:07:12.320> could<00:07:12.800> be

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:12.950 
track this week and this game could be

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.350 
track this week and this game could be
just<00:07:13.130> like<00:07:13.340> the<00:07:13.460> pittsburgh<00:07:13.880> game<00:07:13.910> but<00:07:14.240> could

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
just like the pittsburgh game but could

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.240 
just like the pittsburgh game but could
get<00:07:14.510> them<00:07:14.660> propelled<00:07:15.080> to<00:07:15.290> do<00:07:15.680> better<00:07:15.950> things

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
get them propelled to do better things

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.810 
get them propelled to do better things
so<00:07:17.210> i<00:07:17.540> think<00:07:18.530> the<00:07:18.770> bears<00:07:18.980> won<00:07:19.250> this<00:07:19.400> one<00:07:19.580> in<00:07:19.730> a

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
so i think the bears won this one in a

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.230 
so i think the bears won this one in a
squeaker<00:07:20.240> I<00:07:20.600> think<00:07:21.410> Matt<00:07:22.190> Forte<00:07:22.580> has<00:07:22.790> to<00:07:23.000> it's

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
squeaker I think Matt Forte has to it's

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.610 
squeaker I think Matt Forte has to it's
going<00:07:23.390> to<00:07:23.540> be<00:07:23.600> mad<00:07:23.780> for<00:07:23.990> Taylor's<00:07:24.380> Chris
