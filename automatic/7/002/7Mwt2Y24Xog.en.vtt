00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 today I'm going to present you a new 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.819
 video game for android phones in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.389
 this game is called faithful the matters 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.340
 those paintball games or good 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.650
 speaking in Spanish would be the best thing to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.410
 word I think good pistols of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.110
 paint something like that where good I do not know if 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.820
 you know but 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.630
 in some parts you can play 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.019
 not in videogames but in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789
 in certain places shots with your 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.759
 own guns your own 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.610
 machine guns but they are paint 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.500
 then that game that kind of sport 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.570
 has now gone to the video game 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.140
 where we can download it for free 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.720
 of the projector shop 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.710
 it's a very interesting game to play 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.170
 online at the best 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 there is enough way to play we can see it 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.660
 also in team mode and good too 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.060
 winning we will be able to buy enough 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 either 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.270
 clothes for our character other weapons 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.160
 We can in different parts of the planet 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 whether in Europe like losing here where 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.150
 there are the little red dots and in the usa 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 also for war the good is very easy 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.130
 Now I'm going to show you a little about 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.700
 tutorial more or less how is how 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700
 let's play 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.050
 here we are going to wait for him to load 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.870
 and as you can see then here we are 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 in the image and here you can see I have my 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.020
 team I am the blue team and there it is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.150
 our enemy that is the red team 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.870
 so good here you can see then 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.940
 I have my shotgun 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.730
 there we go, we get closer, we hide and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.350
 clicking here on this button or on this 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.020
 red line that can see right cattle 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.570
 in our player shoots also 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.700
 when the weapons that we have 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.430
 to load that now right where it has 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.270
 come out and we also have some 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.580
 grenades 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.340
 let's get closer let's see let's 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 wait to be here good he shot me 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.030
 same but you can and as I killed 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.030
 one supposedly 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.910
 and we also have some time to 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.970
 eliminate possible rivals 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.640
 when we are eliminated then we are going to 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.440
 need about 3 to 4 seconds to 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 re-enter the game 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.060
 and how can you see then here I am 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.760
 and we also have the mode look there as 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.760
 can see 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.720
 at the beginning it's a bit difficult and 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.550
 you can also configure the controls 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.500
 to have it 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.280
 and choose our best way how 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.280
 to play 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.820
 because we waited three seconds and here 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.210
 as you can see in the air squeezing this 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.210
 we can sit and lift 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.740
 this game for me is very fun for 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.550
 the matter where we can play it between 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.030
 team 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.030
 Y 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.190
 it's online where good that's the best 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.440
 here I would understand explaining my gun ok 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.900
 let's stop our grenade as well 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.900
 we are eliminating the grenade 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.210
 to play online is also so 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.490
 we will need some time 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.560
 he has his schedule where they play it in 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.200
 certain parts then you have to be 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.170
 Attentive to that schedule to be able to enter 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.470
 and be able to be part of one of one of the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.100
 teams 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.100
 okay 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.500
 all right 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.539
 so as I say this is the 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.969
 philosopher battle is a very game 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.469
 interesting I like it a lot and I think that 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.380
 of the best we can play online 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:53.140
 where good we can enjoy it 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.770
 have enough options for how they can 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.640
 see here as I tell you to play in 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.440
 certain equipment you have to wait there 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.770
 you have to be more or less attentive to a 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.300
 schedule to enter and good 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.000
 we can also obviously create our 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.230
 own group to play is very 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.920
 interesting minds are already so 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.350
 I recommend 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.240
 we can download it for free and 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.570
 nothing that has been all this has been the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.680
 game that I wanted to present him to 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.680
 I am one of the best playing
