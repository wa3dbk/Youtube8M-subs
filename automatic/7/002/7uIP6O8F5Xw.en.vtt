00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
for dot 4 out of the box so we will be

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
for dot 4 out of the box so we will be
doing<00:00:36.660> antutu<00:00:37.320> benchmark<00:00:37.469> king<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.399> quadrant

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.720 
doing antutu benchmark king and quadrant
standard<00:00:38.940> tests<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.320> we'll<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.190> values

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
standard tests and we'll see what values

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
standard tests and we'll see what values
the<00:00:42.059> new<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.420> sea<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.690> cell<00:00:42.870> phone<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.440> 4.5<00:00:44.070> inch

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the new a sea of cell phone the 4.5 inch

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060 
the new a sea of cell phone the 4.5 inch
model<00:00:44.760> gives<00:00:45.059> us<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.170> let's<00:00:46.469> start<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
model gives us so let's start with the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:02:00.150 
model gives us so let's start with the
end<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> benchmarking

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.499 

so<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.310> answer<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.700> benchmarking<00:02:02.360> is

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
so the answer to benchmarking is

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.260 
so the answer to benchmarking is
completed<00:02:03.110> we'll<00:02:03.410> see<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.770> values<00:02:04.190> now<00:02:04.460> so

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
completed we'll see the values now so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.210 
completed we'll see the values now so
the<00:02:05.390> device<00:02:05.690> has<00:02:05.720> come<00:02:06.140> up<00:02:06.289> with<00:02:06.440> an<00:02:06.649> amazing

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
the device has come up with an amazing

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.090 
the device has come up with an amazing
value<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.670> 18<00:02:08.239> 382<00:02:08.929> which<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> pretty<00:02:09.709> good

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
value of 18 382 which is a pretty good

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.250 
value of 18 382 which is a pretty good
score<00:02:10.459> for<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.759> phone<00:02:11.120> price<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:11.959> range

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
score for a phone price that this range

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.400 
score for a phone price that this range
which<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:12.860> around<00:02:13.310> rupees<00:02:13.730> six<00:02:14.030> triple<00:02:14.540> 9<00:02:14.720> so

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
which is around rupees six triple 9 so

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.860 
which is around rupees six triple 9 so
we'll<00:02:15.739> compare<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.280> value<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.790> D<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.239> using

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
we'll compare the value of D is using

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.160 
we'll compare the value of D is using
phone<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.440> 4.5<00:02:19.160> inch<00:02:19.280> model<00:02:19.760> with<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.690> values

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
phone for 4.5 inch model with the values

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.540 
phone for 4.5 inch model with the values
of<00:02:21.200> other<00:02:21.680> similarly<00:02:22.220> spec<00:02:22.610> devices

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
moving on to record junt so the quadrant

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.289 
moving on to record junt so the quadrant
test<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:53.000> completed<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.549> device<00:02:58.879> has<00:02:58.910> come

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
test is completed so the device has come

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.720 
test is completed so the device has come
up<00:02:59.510> again<00:02:59.959> with<00:03:00.170> an<00:03:00.290> amazing<00:03:00.620> value<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.310> seven

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
values of similarly spec devices when we

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:39.000 
values of similarly spec devices when we
did<00:03:29.959> quadrant<00:03:30.470> test<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:30.829> those<00:03:31.069> devices

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.699 

so<00:03:39.580> both<00:03:39.909> am<00:03:40.150> 22<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.689> quadrant<00:03:41.140> else<00:03:41.319> has<00:03:41.500> come

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
so both am 22 and quadrant else has come

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.830
