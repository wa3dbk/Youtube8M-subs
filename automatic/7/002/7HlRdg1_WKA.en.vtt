00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:36.660
 coupe for outdoor activities 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 premium class despite strict 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
 bavarian design in bmx salon there 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.700
 quite cozy place behind the wheel of more than 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 enough at the heap electronic chairs 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.280
 settings and adjustments about which 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 you can talk for a very long time 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.360
 not enough time a bunch of different boxes 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.489
 adaptations naturally 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.739
 special attention should be paid to the onboard 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.390
 computer that seems to be the first 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.579
 step to create an artificial mind 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 show here tell me what's up with the car 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.969
 2-zone climate control is controlled 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.969
 also on this display 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.840
 comfortable bmw x6 not only in the cabin that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.480
 Naturally luxury car but also on 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.430
 go behind the air suspension and 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.770
 besides paternal sports activity 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.530
 coupe and therefore the argument here radiates everything 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.490
 for example already in the basic configuration 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.380
 leather roles paddles 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.120
 gear shift 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.580
 and transmissions should be told separately 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.040
 she is so smart that the medicine 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.170
 switching does not occur at all but other than 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.290
 that foresees every wish 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 the driver as to specifically this 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.960
 instances of bmw x6 it was assembled in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.940
 Germany for Italy there and was acquired 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.520
 and came to Russia just a year ago 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.250
 in Arkhangelsk is even less 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.920
 mileage at the moment a little less than 76 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.400
 thousands of kilometers of 3-liter engine 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.460
 x-drive under the hood 235 horsepower 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.900
 which of course allows this typewriter 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.100
 accelerate quite dynamically for 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.440
 so two tons of colossus to get out of the BMW 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.170
 x6 just don't feel like wanting here 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 to live still would cost such 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.890
 new car is comparable to 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.170
 dvushki cost in the center of Arkhangelsk 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.240
 three and a half million rubles 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.510
 this particular instance may become 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.430
 your for 1 million 960 thousand rubles 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.770
 so much against the owner and for that money 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.320
 you're not just a steep wheelbarrow well 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.390
 cool status after all bmw x6 for fun 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.850
 call victory and firstly because 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.890
 she looks like the legendary 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.320
 car win secondly because 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.060
 if you already have such a car here and 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.060
 exactly the winner in life
