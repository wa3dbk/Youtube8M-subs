all<00:04:12.459> these<00:04:12.609> lipsticks<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.239> they<00:04:13.329> are<00:04:13.479> or

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
all these lipsticks that they are or

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.110 
all these lipsticks that they are or
very<00:04:14.260> similar<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.889> you<00:04:15.040> can<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.400> this<00:04:15.849> one's

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
very similar as you can see this one's

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.000 
very similar as you can see this one's
really<00:04:16.470> moisturizing<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.590> glossy

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
really moisturizing and glossy

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.589 
really moisturizing and glossy
definitely<00:04:18.579> don't<00:04:18.760> need<00:04:18.849> a<00:04:18.909> mirror<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.239> apply

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
definitely don't need a mirror to apply

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:20.819 
definitely don't need a mirror to apply
it<00:04:19.659> this<00:04:20.019> is<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:20.229> one<00:04:20.349> I'm<00:04:20.440> wearing<00:04:20.470> now

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
it this is the one I'm wearing now

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.830 
it this is the one I'm wearing now
actually<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:21.729> can<00:04:21.880> be<00:04:22.030> quite<00:04:22.270> pink<00:04:22.570> if<00:04:22.750> you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
actually so it can be quite pink if you

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.770 
actually so it can be quite pink if you
wear<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.050> quite

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
wear it quite

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.240 
wear it quite
I<00:04:23.960> have<00:04:24.110> involved<00:04:24.410> with<00:04:24.530> this<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.830> on<00:04:24.950> my<00:04:25.040> lips

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
I have involved with this in on my lips

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.800 
I have involved with this in on my lips
but<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.640> bit<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.060> lip<00:04:26.210> butters<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.660> can

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
but a bit like the lip butters you can

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.780 
but a bit like the lip butters you can
really<00:04:27.050> work<00:04:27.530> into<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.950> lips<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.460> wear<00:04:28.760> it

really work into the lips and wear it
quite<00:04:29.150> sheer<00:04:29.570> doubt<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:30.230> say<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.920> most

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
quite sheer doubt I say this is the most

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.910 
quite sheer doubt I say this is the most
similar<00:04:31.670> in<00:04:32.090> tone<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.870> patisserie<00:04:33.560> because<00:04:33.830> it

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
similar in tone to patisserie because it

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.530 
similar in tone to patisserie because it
has<00:04:34.070> slight<00:04:34.370> peachy<00:04:34.640> shades<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.240> there<00:04:35.420> as

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
has slight peachy shades in there as

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.900 
has slight peachy shades in there as
well<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.990> really<00:04:36.110> love<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.250> formula<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.730> these

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
well I really love the formula of these

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.760 
well I really love the formula of these
three<00:04:38.090> lipsticks<00:04:38.660> they're<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.110> easy<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.590> wear

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
I wouldn't get like a bright red or a

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.150 
I wouldn't get like a bright red or a
bold<00:04:41.870> color<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.320> this<00:04:42.410> formula<00:04:42.860> because<00:04:43.010> it's

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
bold color in this formula because it's

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160 
bold color in this formula because it's
a<00:04:43.220> little<00:04:43.400> bit<00:04:43.550> kind<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.790> slippy<00:04:44.240> before<00:04:44.900> nudes
