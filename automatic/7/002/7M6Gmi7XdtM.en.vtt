 history appeared in the thirties 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.280
 of sifontes very close to pacarÃ¡n and 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.940
 gives for lost after the looting of 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.470
 natural museum of the year 2003 that is 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.210
 a curious detail that is always spoken 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.070
 of the pile when there are several there is an area 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.920
 there are several besides here this is the only 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.570
 that was kept integrated because it is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.570
 clay jars of about 20 centimeters 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.270
 of metal this strange copper data that 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.150
 we do not know supposedly I was going all point 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.860
 or point of effect and say the experts 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.050
 which is very interesting that was caused 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.460
 the one that a kind of electric power 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.680
 to cause electrolysis in some 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.640
 I work maybe to fuck and get 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.790
 that golden patina that was from the time 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.010
 as it happens at the beginning all 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.470
 cases object booty photo motive 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.710
 but it matches no sense because 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.110
 Nor it has parallel and yet 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.940
 hong kong and william long and then when 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.490
 they discovered it interprets it russia 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.010
 precisely already as as a kind of 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.780
 product battery but all battery 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.220
 curiously not many in the world do not 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.560
 cells lambda can be 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.710
 hole practically a thing object 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.630
 out of time that the pile give it the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.430
 last detail of the card is that with 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.650
 the revolts as it happens so many times 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.390
 misfortune with archeology a hand 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.460
 hidden from time to time as an object 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.990
 interesting and now where will it be in 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.159
 some safe of some field 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.679
 very important 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.210
 chest of a collector but it was the 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.039
 Obviously desired object during 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.780
 generations when in certain celebrated 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.520
 for many mystery books because yes 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.069
