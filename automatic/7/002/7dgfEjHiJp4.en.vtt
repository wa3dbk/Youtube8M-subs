00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
right now it's printing with a PLA

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.890 
right now it's printing with a PLA
plastic<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.759> biodegradable<00:00:15.450> plastic

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
plastic it's a biodegradable plastic

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.560 
plastic it's a biodegradable plastic
made<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> corn<00:00:16.850> and<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.270> here

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
made out of corn and you can see here

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
made out of corn and you can see here
this<00:00:18.810> print<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.949> printing<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> hundred

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
this print here is printing at a hundred

this print here is printing at a hundred
micron<00:00:21.359> resolution<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.289> means<00:00:22.529> is

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
micron resolution what that means is

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
micron resolution what that means is
that<00:00:23.100> every<00:00:23.550> layer<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.300> 100<00:00:24.720> microns

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that every layer here is 100 microns

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
that every layer here is 100 microns
thick<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:26.010> about<00:00:26.130> four<00:00:26.430> thousand<00:00:26.880> seven

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
thick it's about four thousand seven

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.450 
thick it's about four thousand seven
inch<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.250> about

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
inch so you can see here it's about

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.070 
inch so you can see here it's about
halfway<00:00:29.730> through<00:00:29.970> its<00:00:30.300> print<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.720> this

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
halfway through its print this this

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.600 
halfway through its print this this
print<00:00:31.349> will<00:00:31.470> take<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:31.980> under<00:00:32.099> three<00:00:32.489> hours

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
print will take just under three hours

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.060 
print will take just under three hours
because<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> high<00:00:33.450> resolution<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
because of the high resolution and you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.700 
because of the high resolution and you
can<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> detail<00:00:36.450> here

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
can really see all the detail here

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
can really see all the detail here
because<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.829> additive<00:00:38.399> manufacturing<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
because it's additive manufacturing you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
because it's additive manufacturing you
don't<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.719> any<00:00:39.870> strap<00:00:40.379> from<00:00:41.040> say<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
don't have any strap from say if you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000 
don't have any strap from say if you
were<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> cut<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.840> away<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> big

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
were going to cut this away from a big

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.970 
were going to cut this away from a big
billet<00:00:44.309> piece<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.610> plastic<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.829> one<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
billet piece of plastic and one of the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
billet piece of plastic and one of the
great<00:00:47.129> things<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.789> machine<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.450> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
great things about this machine is that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
great things about this machine is that
you<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.200> let's<00:00:49.379> cut<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.649> nice<00:00:49.890> open<00:00:50.190> design

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you see let's cut this nice open design

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.819 
you see let's cut this nice open design
it<00:00:51.210> lets<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.750> interact<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it lets you really interact with it and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.189 
it lets you really interact with it and
watch<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> bill<00:00:53.730> take<00:00:54.000> place<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
watch the bill take place as it's

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.400 
watch the bill take place as it's
happening<00:00:55.640> anybody<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.879> create<00:00:57.030> anything

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
happening anybody can create anything

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.670 
happening anybody can create anything
and<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.859> need<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.850> computer<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.620> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and all you need is a computer so that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
and all you need is a computer so that
you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.010> run<00:01:02.219> maker<00:01:02.520> where<00:01:02.820> what<00:01:03.359> maker<00:01:03.539> where

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you can run maker where what maker where

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410 
you can run maker where what maker where
does<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.290> take<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.650> 3d<00:01:05.129> object<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
does it take some 3d object and it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.030 
does it take some 3d object and it
breaks<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.930> into<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.380> these<00:01:07.680> little

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
breaks it up into all these little

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
breaks it up into all these little
layers<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.420> tell<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> whether<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
layers here you can tell it whether you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.810 
layers here you can tell it whether you
want<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.010> done<00:01:11.189> off<00:01:11.280> our<00:01:11.430> standard

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
want this is just done off our standard

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
want this is just done off our standard
high<00:01:11.939> setting<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.900> there's<00:01:13.080> also<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> medium

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
high setting but there's also a medium

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.320 
high setting but there's also a medium
setting<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> low<00:01:14.460> setting<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.210> want

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
setting at a low setting you want

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
setting at a low setting you want
something<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> print<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:16.110> quickly<00:01:16.380> you've

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
something to print very quickly you've

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.230 
something to print very quickly you've
set<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> low<00:01:17.280> setting<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
set it to a low setting and then the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.340 
set it to a low setting and then the
layer<00:01:18.390> height<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.229> bit

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
layer height would be a little bit

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.710 
layer height would be a little bit
thicker<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:20.009> less<00:01:20.310> layers<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.570> it's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
thicker and have less layers so it's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
thicker and have less layers so it's
resolution<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> printer<00:01:23.040> yes<00:01:23.580> sir

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
resolution just like a printer yes sir

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
resolution just like a printer yes sir
really<00:01:24.060> goes<00:01:24.210> flat<00:01:24.869> printer<00:01:25.200> already<00:01:26.009> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
really goes flat printer already is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.810 
really goes flat printer already is
already<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.390> are

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
already there are

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
going to different museums and scanning

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.540 
going to different museums and scanning
the<00:01:42.100> artwork<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.030> then<00:01:43.390> printing<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.930> up

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
the artwork and then printing it up

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.010 
the artwork and then printing it up
full-scale<00:01:45.550> now<00:01:46.300> how<00:01:46.420> did<00:01:46.540> you<00:01:46.630> get<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.840> big

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
full-scale now how did you get this big

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.810 
full-scale now how did you get this big
statue<00:01:47.290> up<00:01:47.530> here<00:01:47.680> behind<00:01:47.830> us<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> way<00:01:48.670> we

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
statue up here behind us so the way we

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.440 
statue up here behind us so the way we
did<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.610> part

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
did this is get the part

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.080 
did this is get the part
scanned<00:01:53.170> right<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.400> gentleman<00:01:54.970> who

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
scanned right so the gentleman who

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.640 
scanned right so the gentleman who
scanned<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.750> think<00:01:56.290> he<00:01:56.350> may<00:01:56.500> have<00:01:56.560> even

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
scanned this I think he may have even

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.859 
scanned this I think he may have even
gone<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.190> lead<00:01:57.369> or<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.670> met<00:01:57.910> scanned<00:01:58.690> it

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
gone to the lead or the met scanned it

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.320 
gone to the lead or the met scanned it
obtained<00:01:59.410> a<00:01:59.500> 3d<00:01:59.800> model<00:02:00.280> brought<00:02:00.729> into<00:02:01.060> either

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
obtained a 3d model brought into either

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.300

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
modeling software and then he cut it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.320 
modeling software and then he cut it
into<00:02:05.200> pieces<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:05.950> would<00:02:06.280> fit<00:02:06.640> within<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330

build<00:02:07.539> volume<00:02:07.750> okay<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.739> then<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.100> printed

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
build volume okay and then you printed

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.979 
build volume okay and then you printed
them<00:02:09.700> separately<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.270> just<00:02:10.450> crazy<00:02:10.720> glued

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.390 
different than PLA PLA is very hard and
it's<00:03:30.450> very<00:03:30.480> stiff<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.470> static<00:03:31.739> objects<00:03:32.280> it

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
it's very stiff so static objects it

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.059 
it's very stiff so static objects it
does<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:33.030> makes<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.540> very<00:03:33.840> nice<00:03:34.170> high<00:03:34.530> accurate

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
does it makes a very nice high accurate

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.849 
does it makes a very nice high accurate
iron<00:03:35.400> printer<00:03:35.819> abs<00:03:36.750> has<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.379> very<00:03:37.680> high

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
iron printer abs has a very high

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.220 
iron printer abs has a very high
flexural<00:03:38.400> modulus<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.049> actually

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
flexural modulus so you can actually

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.559 
flexural modulus so you can actually
create<00:03:40.799> gears<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.849> can<00:03:42.000> create<00:03:42.209> snap

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
create gears and you can create snap

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.059 
create gears and you can create snap
features<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.439> create<00:03:43.709> things<00:03:43.950> that

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
features you can create things that

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.250 
features you can create things that
impact<00:03:44.519> each<00:03:44.700> other<00:03:44.909> are<00:03:45.450> there<00:03:45.690> shapes<00:03:45.959> that

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
impact each other are there shapes that

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.199 
impact each other are there shapes that
are<00:03:46.319> doable<00:03:47.069> with<00:03:47.340> 3d<00:03:47.609> printing<00:03:47.909> that<00:03:48.030> just

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
are doable with 3d printing that just

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.479 
are doable with 3d printing that just
aren't<00:03:48.359> doable<00:03:48.599> with<00:03:49.010> standard<00:03:50.010> procedures

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
aren't doable with standard procedures

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.819 
aren't doable with standard procedures
absolutely<00:03:51.269> so<00:03:51.480> because<00:03:52.049> we<00:03:52.230> have<00:03:52.260> additive

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
absolutely so because we have additive

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.059 
absolutely so because we have additive
manufacturing<00:03:53.209> right<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:55.799> can<00:03:55.950> actually

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
manufacturing right and you can actually

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.429 
manufacturing right and you can actually
create<00:03:56.549> things<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.180> have<00:03:57.599> undercuts<00:03:58.230> in

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
create things that have undercuts in

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.410 
create things that have undercuts in
them<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.799> undercuts<00:03:59.670> are<00:03:59.819> very<00:03:59.939> difficult

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
them and undercuts are very difficult

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.869 
them and undercuts are very difficult
especially<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:00.930> machining<00:04:01.519> your<00:04:02.519> machining

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
especially in machining your machining

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.670 
especially in machining your machining
apart<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.359> can't<00:04:03.569> create<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.930> hollow<00:04:04.170> object

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
apart you can't create a hollow object

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.440 
apart you can't create a hollow object
but<00:04:05.069> I<00:04:05.099> can<00:04:05.310> create<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.609> hollow<00:04:05.849> object<00:04:06.329> with

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
but I can create a hollow object with

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.589 
but I can create a hollow object with
features<00:04:06.810> inside<00:04:07.349> that<00:04:07.920> are<00:04:08.010> not<00:04:08.129> exposed

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
features inside that are not exposed

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.580 
features inside that are not exposed
very<00:04:09.599> good<00:04:09.780> little<00:04:09.959> really<00:04:10.139> printer<00:04:10.409> work
