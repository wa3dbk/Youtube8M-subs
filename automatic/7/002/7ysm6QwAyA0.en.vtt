00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.600
 in today's lesson I will tell you how 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.560
 correctly paint the car in principle 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.529
 nothing complicated machine we are already 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.710
 prepared zamyli soil 1 on the ground 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.520
 it is necessary to glue the car glue everything 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.210
 places that we do not want for 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:36.030
 beauty midpoint all the problems here 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.710
 such a special film it is sold 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.270
 those stores where materials are sold 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.260
 paint any different here is not pasted 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.450
 forgot to close 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.450
 wheels all offense 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.010
 or after we pasted over the car 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:01:01.220
 we need to degrease it degreased 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:04.370
 and he runs himself even if you will 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.030
 offer in store 646 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.820
 society now 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.670
 we never mean reliable 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.430
 and a man here 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.690
 you 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.690
 and since 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.760
 anti silicone no such 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.800
 here's the promise we start painting over need 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.570
 at first 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.260
 paint over those places in thin layers 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.680
 which we have 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.660
 translucent there are such places 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.550
 Here are the transitions to a thin layer 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:48.360
 impose its own beautiful and such places 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.610
 so we have no transitions all this 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.560
 first appearance 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.340
 then give 15 minutes to dry and we 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.470
 then we can take before painting 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 such a napkin she is a little turn I 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.730
 fat anti-static worn and 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.490
 dust off 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.840
 so here so how and whether run because 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.270
 what else can we get to the street 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.030
 machines and now such movements in one 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.030
 we look aside 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.000
 we clamp 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.000
 adjust the pistol 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.599
 will be 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.020
 about 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.890
 us 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:29.970
 we shifted the car varnish after each 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:35.820
 varnish layers need to let the car dry 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:41.580
 flowers for about 15 minutes that is not lozhili 15 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:44.990
 We wait for the minutes and cover another layer of varnish 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.990
 that's all 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.140
 here so that something like this 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.550
 next lesson I'll show you how 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:09.280
 display restore folders 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.280
 other facts of our solder install it
