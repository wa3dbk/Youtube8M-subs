want<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> say<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> boss<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:53.870> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
want to say a boss that's not really and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.500 
want to say a boss that's not really and
yes<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.579> very<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> drivers<00:00:57.360> they'll

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
yes so they are very the drivers they'll

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.200 
yes so they are very the drivers they'll
take<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> lines<00:00:58.320> perfect<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> tend<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
take all the lines perfect so I tend to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
take all the lines perfect so I tend to
keep<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.390> braking<00:01:00.750> line<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.219> go

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
keep my braking line on because I go

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
keep my braking line on because I go
into<00:01:02.910> corners<00:01:03.329> pretty<00:01:03.539> hard<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> depending

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
into corners pretty hard and depending

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
into corners pretty hard and depending
on<00:01:04.619> classes<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> car<00:01:05.489> might<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
on classes the car might not have the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330 
on classes the car might not have the
good<00:01:06.119> braking<00:01:06.930> capacity<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.070> able<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.250> do

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
good braking capacity to be able to do

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.990 
good braking capacity to be able to do
it<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.590> could<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> know

it but this one I could because I know

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.560 
it but this one I could because I know
most<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> tracks<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:14.100> go<00:01:14.850> swim<00:01:15.090> faster

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
most of the tracks I can go swim faster

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
most of the tracks I can go swim faster
because<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
couple thousand reps it's when you drop

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.760 
couple thousand reps it's when you drop
a<00:01:36.720> couple<00:01:36.840> thousand<00:01:37.259> dress<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.680> know

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
a couple thousand dress because you know

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.140 
a couple thousand dress because you know
high<00:01:37.920> gear<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.310> take<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.700> faster

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
high gear you can take off faster

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
high gear you can take off faster
whereas<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:39.810> you're<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.680> you're<00:01:40.890> at<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
whereas if you're in so if you're at a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.260 
whereas if you're in so if you're at a
high<00:01:41.130> third<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.610> better<00:01:41.820> than<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:42.180> of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
high third be better than a lot of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.149 
high third be better than a lot of
fourth<00:01:42.509> because<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> low<00:01:43.619> fourth<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
fourth because a low fourth you have to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
fourth because a low fourth you have to
change<00:01:44.369> down<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> time<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> changing

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
change down with a time you changing

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.980 
change down with a time you changing
down<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> guys<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.590> under<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
down the guys just got under take you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.880 
down the guys just got under take you
just<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.200> things<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
just little things like that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.810 
just little things like that
so<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.759> braking<00:01:51.180> lines<00:01:51.890> tiny<00:01:52.890> gears<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so use your braking lines tiny gears and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
so use your braking lines tiny gears and
also<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.659> uphill<00:01:55.079> try<00:01:55.619> stay<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> higher

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
also like uphill try stay in a higher

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
also like uphill try stay in a higher
gear<00:01:56.399> than<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> lower<00:01:56.939> gear<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.930> it's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
gear than a lower gear because it's

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.410 
gear than a lower gear because it's
better<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> high<00:01:59.610> D<00:01:59.820> lineup<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.329> then

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
better to be in a high D lineup and then

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.910 
better to be in a high D lineup and then
changing<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.899> top<00:02:01.170> instead<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.500> being<00:02:01.710> low

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
changing your top instead of being low

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
changing your top instead of being low
and<00:02:02.130> slugging<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.509> hope<00:02:03.630> these<00:02:03.719> couple

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and slugging up so I hope these couple

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.799 
and slugging up so I hope these couple
tips<00:02:04.110> are<00:02:04.229> helped<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.469> guys<00:02:04.560> out
