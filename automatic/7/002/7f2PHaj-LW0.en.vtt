shaper<00:01:50.459> gave<00:01:50.640> us<00:01:50.789> some<00:01:51.000> opportunity<00:01:51.660> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
shaper gave us some opportunity to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.449 
shaper gave us some opportunity to
expand<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.560> were<00:01:52.619> common<00:01:53.130> carrier

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
expand because they were common carrier
