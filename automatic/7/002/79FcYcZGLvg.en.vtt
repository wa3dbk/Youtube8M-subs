00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
painting and right now I'm working on

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.780 
painting and right now I'm working on
the<00:00:31.970> acrylic<00:00:32.500> painting<00:00:33.500> which<00:00:33.980> goes<00:00:34.280> on<00:00:34.400> top<00:00:34.640> a

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
the acrylic painting which goes on top a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.970 
the acrylic painting which goes on top a
little<00:00:34.820> bit<00:00:35.059> later<00:00:35.360> on<00:00:35.480> I<00:00:35.809> will<00:00:36.350> work<00:00:36.530> on<00:00:36.650> oil

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
little bit later on I will work on oil

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.840 
little bit later on I will work on oil
on<00:00:37.309> top<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:39.379> I<00:00:40.220> thought<00:00:40.640> I'd<00:00:40.760> talk

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
on top of that and I thought I'd talk

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.299 
on top of that and I thought I'd talk
about<00:00:41.120> some<00:00:41.269> of<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.420> concepts<00:00:41.930> involved<00:00:42.589> with

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
about some of the concepts involved with

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.700 
about some of the concepts involved with
this<00:00:44.089> painting<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:44.780> some<00:00:45.110> other<00:00:45.260> paintings

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
this painting and some other paintings

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.579 
this painting and some other paintings
that<00:00:45.800> I'm<00:00:45.890> working<00:00:46.160> on<00:00:46.220> just<00:00:46.430> know<00:00:47.530> as<00:00:48.530> a

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
that I'm working on just know as a

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.009 
that I'm working on just know as a
landscape<00:00:49.160> painter<00:00:49.580> I'm<00:00:49.879> really<00:00:50.570> looking<00:00:50.960> at

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
landscape painter I'm really looking at

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.399 
landscape painter I'm really looking at
what<00:00:51.489> inspires<00:00:52.489> me<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.600> paint<00:00:53.839> landscape

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
what inspires me to to paint landscape

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.710 
what inspires me to to paint landscape
and<00:00:54.589> you<00:00:54.680> need<00:00:54.830> to<00:00:54.949> really<00:00:55.760> analyze<00:00:56.000> something

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
and you need to really analyze something

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.369 
and you need to really analyze something
to<00:00:57.019> get<00:00:57.559> an<00:00:58.040> interesting<00:00:58.580> concept<00:00:59.229> from<00:01:00.229> your

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
to get an interesting concept from your

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.399 
to get an interesting concept from your
subject<00:01:00.710> matter<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.659> the<00:01:02.659> Impressionists

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
subject matter and the Impressionists

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.520 
subject matter and the Impressionists
were<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.040> first<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.670> really<00:01:05.089> value<00:01:05.900> light

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
were the first to really value light

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.890 
were the first to really value light
within<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.729> landscape<00:01:08.320> instead<00:01:09.320> of<00:01:09.470> maybe

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
within the landscape instead of maybe

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.730 
within the landscape instead of maybe
the<00:01:11.900> book<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.200> subject<00:01:12.560> matter<00:01:12.770> or<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:13.939> kind<00:01:14.630> of

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
the book of subject matter or a kind of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.550 
the book of subject matter or a kind of
aristocratic<00:01:15.740> subject<00:01:16.580> matter<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:18.260> do<00:01:18.380> with

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
aristocratic subject matter to do with

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.560 
aristocratic subject matter to do with
people<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:21.530> rather<00:01:22.490> than<00:01:22.820> concentrate

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
people and and rather than concentrate

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.520 
people and and rather than concentrate
and<00:01:25.240> realism<00:01:26.240> they<00:01:26.630> were<00:01:26.690> interested<00:01:27.500> in

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
and realism they were interested in

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.210 
and realism they were interested in
purely<00:01:27.980> in<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.160> representation<00:01:29.120> of<00:01:29.360> light

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
purely in the representation of light

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.280 
purely in the representation of light
light<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.520> like<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.880> think<00:01:32.060> of<00:01:32.180> as<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.870> most

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
light I like to think of as the most

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.480 
light I like to think of as the most
important<00:01:33.950> thing<00:01:34.430> as<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:35.530> let<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.650> pagan<00:01:37.130> idea

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
important thing as a let that pagan idea

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.360 
important thing as a let that pagan idea
of<00:01:37.580> where<00:01:37.760> they<00:01:38.290> worship<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.530> Sun<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:40.159> think

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
of where they worship the Sun I think

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.000 
of where they worship the Sun I think
it's<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.790> thing<00:01:41.540> worth<00:01:41.960> worshipping<00:01:42.290> without

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
it's a thing worth worshipping without

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.660 
it's a thing worth worshipping without
it<00:01:43.220> we<00:01:43.400> would<00:01:43.550> have<00:01:43.580> nothing<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:46.310> light

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
it we would have nothing and the light

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.570 
it we would have nothing and the light
within<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.180> painting<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.870> see<00:01:48.470> as<00:01:48.770> coming<00:01:49.550> from

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
within the painting I see as coming from

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.020 
within the painting I see as coming from
the<00:01:50.330> sky<00:01:51.140> obviously<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.010> then<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.490> darker

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the sky obviously and then the darker

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.360 
the sky obviously and then the darker
area<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.659> earth<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:55.190> more

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
area of the earth and the the more

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.000 
area of the earth and the the more
rugged<00:01:55.729> earth<00:01:56.150> which<00:01:57.130> complements<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.450> soft

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
rugged earth which complements the soft

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.580 
rugged earth which complements the soft
softness<00:02:01.010> of<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.400> sky<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.729> -<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:06.290> like

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
softness of the sky and the the - I like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.410 
softness of the sky and the the - I like
to<00:02:06.680> think<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.310> child's<00:02:07.729> drawing<00:02:07.940> where<00:02:08.299> they

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
to think of a child's drawing where they

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.969 
to think of a child's drawing where they
would<00:02:08.539> represent<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.140> sky<00:02:09.349> with<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> stroke<00:02:09.950> of

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
would represent the sky with a stroke of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.089 
would represent the sky with a stroke of
blue<00:02:10.250> at<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.399> top<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.420> ground

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
blue at the top and then the ground

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.350 
blue at the top and then the ground
completely<00:02:13.099> detached<00:02:13.670> from<00:02:13.849> it

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
completely detached from it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.280 
completely detached from it
in<00:02:14.450> reality<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:15.230> see<00:02:15.620> or<00:02:15.890> perceive<00:02:17.110> top<00:02:18.110> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
in reality we see or perceive top and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.680 
in reality we see or perceive top and
bottom<00:02:18.830> as<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.190> very<00:02:20.230> gradual<00:02:21.230> process<00:02:21.319> and

that<00:02:23.690> all-important<00:02:24.680> horizon<00:02:25.310> line<00:02:25.489> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
that all-important horizon line that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.339 
that all-important horizon line that
cuts<00:02:25.909> right<00:02:26.180> across<00:02:26.330> your<00:02:26.690> painting<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:27.319> a

I<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.640> play<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.450> transition<00:02:31.350> of

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
I like to play with the transition of

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.400 
I like to play with the transition of
sky<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:34.069> earth<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.720> partly<00:02:37.080> why<00:02:37.380> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
sky to earth and that was partly why I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.930 
sky to earth and that was partly why I
called<00:02:37.920> my<00:02:38.069> 2012<00:02:38.990> exhibition<00:02:39.990> transition

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
called my 2012 exhibition transition

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.150 
called my 2012 exhibition transition
amongst<00:02:41.940> other<00:02:42.180> reasons<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:43.160> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
amongst other reasons and that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.730 
amongst other reasons and that
transition<00:02:44.730> from<00:02:44.880> Sky<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.900> Earth<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
transition from Sky to Earth is the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.820 
transition from Sky to Earth is the
transition<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.820> light<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.990> dark<00:02:49.320> almost

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
transition of of light to dark almost

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.660 
transition of of light to dark almost
the<00:02:50.550> way<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> see<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.920> as<00:02:52.920> an<00:02:53.130> aesthetic

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
the way I see it and as an aesthetic

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.380 
the way I see it and as an aesthetic
perspective<00:02:53.940> drops<00:02:54.870> away<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.820> we<00:02:56.820> start<00:02:57.060> to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
perspective drops away and we start to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.500 
perspective drops away and we start to
also<00:02:57.870> perceive<00:02:58.260> color<00:02:58.560> differently<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.670> my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
also perceive color differently and my

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.949 
also perceive color differently and my
application<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:01.200> pain<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:02.450> echoing<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.780> as

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
application of pain is echoing that as

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.100 
application of pain is echoing that as
well<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.790> representation<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> water

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
well and the representation of the water

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.930 
well and the representation of the water
but<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> landscapes<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.280> saw<00:03:08.430> just<00:03:08.700> acts

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
but then the landscapes I saw just acts

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.259 
but then the landscapes I saw just acts
as<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.870> M<00:03:10.230> connector<00:03:11.070> point<00:03:11.310> between<00:03:11.459> sky

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
as that M connector point between sky

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.100 
as that M connector point between sky
and<00:03:12.300> land<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.380> reflective<00:03:14.540> way<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and land that a reflective way that the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.350 
and land that a reflective way that the
water<00:03:16.500> reflects<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> colors<00:03:17.640> within<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.060> sky

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
water reflects the colors within the sky

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.290 
water reflects the colors within the sky
and<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.110> light<00:03:19.350> within<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.950> sky<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.550> allows

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
and the light within the sky it allows

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.490 
and the light within the sky it allows
to<00:03:21.720> be<00:03:21.840> eaten<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:24.600> lower<00:03:24.810> part<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.410> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
to be eaten to the the lower part of the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.920 
to be eaten to the the lower part of the
composition<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.580> accentuate<00:03:27.360> this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
composition to accentuate this

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.340 
composition to accentuate this
transition<00:03:28.920> between<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.670> sky<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.390> land<00:03:30.660> hey

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
transition between the sky and land hey

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.130 
transition between the sky and land hey
so<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:32.010> particular<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:32.780> abstracts<00:03:33.780> that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
so this particular one abstracts that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.199 
so this particular one abstracts that
idea<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> landscape<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.880> idea<00:03:36.510> of

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
idea of the landscape and that idea of

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.729 
idea of the landscape and that idea of
transition<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.739> perception<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.010> almost

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
transition and perception and almost

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.220 
transition and perception and almost
representation<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.630> peripheral

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
representation of the the peripheral

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.600 
representation of the the peripheral
vision<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:47.510> trying<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.860> get<00:03:49.860> across<00:03:50.100> an

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
vision and trying to get across an

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.280 
vision and trying to get across an
experience<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.329> being<00:03:51.690> there<00:03:51.989> by

experience of being there by

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.940 
experience of being there by
representing<00:03:53.220> horse<00:03:53.489> directly<00:03:54.060> below<00:03:54.269> you

one called diminuendo light refers to
that<00:04:13.980> musical<00:04:14.549> term<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.910> diminuendo<00:04:15.329> which<00:04:15.780> is

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
that musical term of diminuendo which is

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.219 
that musical term of diminuendo which is
gradually<00:04:16.739> softening<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.900> refers<00:04:19.200> to

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
gradually softening and that refers to

the description of the rugged Aerith on
this<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.820> sky<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.289> a<00:04:28.590> gradual

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
this of the sky this is a gradual

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.510 
this of the sky this is a gradual
transition<00:04:30.500> which<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.680> why<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:31.950> quite<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
transition which is why I quite like the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.330 
transition which is why I quite like the
