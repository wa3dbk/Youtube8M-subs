00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello and welcome 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.980
 my name is in the with vocal and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.130
 Today it's about the cost benefits 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.660
 ratio of training frequency and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.389
 a high volume as well as much 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 done this high work 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.270
 training frequency okay first of all 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 I want to say that the other one is 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.220
 probably if only I think so 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 Doing a set of squats and man 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.609
 colleagues 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.490
 he does 46 squat then he becomes 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.009
 achieve four times as many games as me 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.630
 the whole is unfortunately a bit know 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.969
 Concept of sentence 1 of workout the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 is the most effective so that a 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.090
 little to describe what we do 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.520
 of course try to reach in 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 A plant is out of food 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.480
 powerful will be our fitness 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.090
 we could also say that we could improve 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.469
 So want progress pro progress and 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.570
 Of course we want to be as effective as possible 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.730
 possible to work if I am now 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.960
 practically execute the first sentence 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 a workout and our six games 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 Six sentences would be 100% effective 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.560
 yield 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.760
 then I would already have sat 1 already 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.930
 40 percent 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.970
 exploited this potential in the second 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 sentence I would then use 25 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.549
 in the fourth 15 the last 20 percent 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.409
 would come to the 100 would 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.960
 just sentence 4 5 and 6 part 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.920
 that is, we see whole plan trading 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.070
 Diagrams that we start with the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 first sentences since occupation, for example 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.189
 already tell a lot about that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 what we want 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.340
 and with increasing sentence number report 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.290
 our performance curve a little bit too 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.950
 Of course there are the other side as well 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.250
 fatigue 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 We would know each one of you 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.640
 will bring pro account 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.710
 here it reports in contrast to 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.750
 We are practically at the beginning 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.630
 have very high and then waste 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.790
 dropping is our fatigue in the year 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.930
 that means no matter if I from sentence 1 and 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.420
 sentence 2 have fatigue or of 56 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.090
 It is the same fatigue which 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.920
 Education also means the same degree 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.830
 what is metabolic stress and up 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.750
 mechanical stress is concerned 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 Okay, that means that chart is hands 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.680
 a point on the whole 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.750
 would become counterproductive 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.459
 okay what is now, of course, it would be 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.310
 just learned we have a linear 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.570
 Increasing the most benefit provides us 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 the first set four times as much volume 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.910
 balance I expect four times as much 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.220
 but does not give us four times 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.290
 games what is natural to do now 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.780
 we look at the whole with a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.420
 Training frequency of 2 times a week 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.250
 That was practically a workout once 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.910
 rehearse 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 ok i know the the ones behind the diagram 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.329
 is a little small just i hope you 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.440
 there are six can be the whole 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.120
 explain and repeat our performance 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.690
 black the fatigue 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.560
 I got out on the first mountain I have 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.230
 a performance curve and my recovery 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.239
 Of course, it depends on me and then if 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.640
 I realize I'm doing, for example, in 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.400
 So I do not put area six 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.160
 like here, three sets make after three 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.920
 sets apps extremely inefficient now 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.299
 i practically finish the squats i 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.290
 do another exercise for example 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.959
 or so, and of course , then 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.360
 For example, two days later 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.170
 squats higher frequency us 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.720
 So the train 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.220
 they do not come once but twice 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.680
 that's what our performance was 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.480
 in the beginning this would be the diagram 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.660
 vivid to be that we practically 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.050
 null here and now we would have one 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.239
 Performance growth would have us all 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.800
 regenerated recovered from this workout 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.300
 that means we start already now 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.420
 an increased performance in one 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.680
 increased fitness curve and rise 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.599
 back up 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.700
 and it goes down again and you 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.130
 see here this point must now 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.109
 Of course, his hears as this 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.989
 logical starting point because we have to 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.560
 you can find now for the fatigue 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.160
 Biester line we have practically one 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.510
 equally strong recovery afterwards 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.700
 We have said here that you can 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.770
 at sentence 3 we are back 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.690
 regenerates that is the registration is 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.669
 did not go up in the immeasurable 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.380
 but we have the fatigue of our legs 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.020
 for example, a little bit to class 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.090
 have us now repeated the next 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.910
 worker and comes and I have restored 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.860
 how you can of course it is allowed 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.080
 curve now i start at the bottom because 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.450
 maybe we will feel a bit more 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.780
 that citizens of the two days before that 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.180
 So we are completely recovered but 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.160
 had our fatigue relatively good 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.580
 regenerated and now the curve goes 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.860
 back up and up again 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.220
 that means it is tarnished for us in toothless 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.320
 When I write to draw you can see 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.270
 that still I have now, for example 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.490
 We take these values ​​into account 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.310
 workout in six sets 6 600 percent 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.720
 reached 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.880
 in this workout bosch a frequency 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.100
 Of two times a week I have in 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:33.070
 first workout we say now 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:36.710
 For example, sometimes 40 percent have 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:41.050
 I have other examples 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:44.480
 20 percent and then I have ten 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.490
 that would result in 70 percent yes so 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.400
 less like the one card clear 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.820
 We made three sets, however 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.060
 We'll do it twice a week 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.310
 The money is then practically 140 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.920
 percent that is of the effectiveness 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:07.730
 currently stands at 100 percent largest 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.610
 140 percent so you see that through 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.170
 An increased frequency all the way 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.630
 make it more effective 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.670
 because we have a linear fatigue and 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.070
 because our performance is increasing 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.140
 number just from the effectiveness of 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.900
 will decrease 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:27.170
 So it means for us and above all 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.800
 for nature sports enthusiasts look that you yours 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.850
 training frequency must keep high 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.430
 come example are two times the 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.840
 train which course also the 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.760
 effect has as now was for what 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.640
 Do squats you two learn 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.210
 others the coordination the movement 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.130
 execution 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.410
 what does a basketball player or a 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.180
 soccer player of football, basketball, country 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.040
 wants to play ice hockey or that 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.010
 begins begins with errors forest but 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.960
 He plays football or he trains 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.230
 this discipline with which he will become good 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.390
 want 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.100
 that means we have several benefits from 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.130
 a red pushes training frequency 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.690
 not only that our performance curve 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.790
 pay sometime in the second sentence 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.190
 but also that we are infected 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.230
 Doing certain things by doing several things in 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.210
 learn better the week better 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.340
 it 's for me that's not it 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.440
 this works but we do 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.430
 have leveled by an increased frequency 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.730
 simply more advantages 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.140
 and have more done by ok me 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.360
 hope my point came across well 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.950
 hermès just ask in the 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.600
 comments on otherwise if you have more video 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.100
 want to see such likes to say also 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.510
 I'll let you know with the flipchart 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.370
 otherwise I can not say anything 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.570
 a try and see you next time 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.570
 even if the many greetings
