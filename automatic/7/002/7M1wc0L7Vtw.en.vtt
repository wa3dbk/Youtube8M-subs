00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.759
 Now everyone who is against 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.049
 meats 29 in this video that teach to 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.390
 make a kind of wire fence for 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.410
 birds and pigeons to support us in 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.960
 railing or poyete that I know they sell 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.020
 some ready-made panties but they come out 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.820
 very expensive at least seven euros per meter 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.009
 I think I was seeing myself today and other 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.200
 forms comes out very cheap and the materials 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.350
 how you need to be 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.020
 a tube of 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.050
 Rubber tube 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.800
 of plastic that is used to water 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.200
 drip this one has of exterior 1 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.620
 millimeter 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.110
 as you can see later we are going to 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.780
 need wire that we are going to cut 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 previously 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.280
 about 7 centimeters long and wide 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.270
 the one that I use the thickness of has a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.490
 millimeter 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.890
 and then we're going to need pliers 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.190
 for this to cut it wire or the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.190
 tube 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.420
 with outside pliers and flanges 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.150
 to later be able to place the ones that already 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 teach in another video how to place good 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.230
 and also a brick or punch for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.690
 make holes so let's proceed 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.710
 to do it the hole and cut the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.810
 wires 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.549
 well as you can see I have already put the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 first wire now I will explain how 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.300
 put it would be something like that 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.390
 so let's explain how to do it 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:39.360
 pick up such a brick or punch over or 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.360
 less the same thickness of wire 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.909
 once we have done the one that already 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.409
 we have made the hole the first layer 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.409
 we are so adorable 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.310
 we continue to the granda 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.940
 to completely cross the tube 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.940
 steel we take it out 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.370
 we just take it out we take one of 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.159
 the wires of these chiquititas 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.420
 of the 7 centimeters we put it through 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.430
 there we leave a little bit we leave the part 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.430
 long for the side to support the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.670
 dove and the other we bend towards 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.670
 in 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.830
 transforms that something like that and 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.170
 we will continue doing successively 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.260
 so I'm going to do some more and already 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.920
 you will see how I am doing 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.920
 all right 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.640
 hand hole 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.640
 and we do the same thing from before another wire 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.840
 for inside 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.340
 but the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.420
 or not put I think it has already been 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.480
 less clear and I would have to do it is 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.160
 successively this is depending on the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.060
 long you want to make the wire of 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.090
 these and it has already been all for today and 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.680
 I will explain how to mount it and well I hope 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.650
 that you liked the live video 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.410
 favorite bloggers I do not have down and 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.410
 twitter follow me and until another goodbye
