and<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.289> think<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.649> was<00:01:38.770> personal<00:01:39.219> frustration

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
and I think it was personal frustration

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.669 
and I think it was personal frustration
from<00:01:40.090> his<00:01:40.240> point<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.539> view<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.719> also<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.530> way

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
that the team was but maybe this there

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:44.999
