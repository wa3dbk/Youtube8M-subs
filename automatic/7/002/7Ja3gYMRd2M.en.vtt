00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the mass of a billion suns it's a little

the mass of a billion suns it's a little
hard<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> comprehend<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.520> take<00:00:59.670> into

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hard to comprehend and you take into

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
hard to comprehend and you take into
account<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.719> black<00:01:01.020> hole<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.500> 12<00:01:01.980> times

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
account that this black hole is 12 times

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.460 
account that this black hole is 12 times
bigger<00:01:02.730> than<00:01:02.879> average<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.750> comprehending

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bigger than average and comprehending

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
bigger than average and comprehending
the<00:01:04.530> size<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.760> seems<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the size of it just kind of seems like a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
the size of it just kind of seems like a
lost<00:01:06.390> cause<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.229> how<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.560> its<00:01:07.830> scientific

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
lost cause so how about its scientific

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
lost cause so how about its scientific
significance<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.720> might<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> more

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
significance well that might be a more

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
significance well that might be a more
worthwhile<00:01:10.530> venture<00:01:10.799> seeing<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.939> not

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
worthwhile venture seeing as it's not

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
worthwhile venture seeing as it's not
just<00:01:12.390> super<00:01:12.900> big<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> paper<00:01:13.830> writes<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
just super big but the paper writes it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.710 
just super big but the paper writes it

so<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.640> leaves<00:01:47.820> scientists<00:01:48.390> looking<00:01:48.960> for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so that leaves scientists looking for

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
so that leaves scientists looking for

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639
