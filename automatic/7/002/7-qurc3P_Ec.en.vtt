00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
we've mastered about an hour now what we

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.410 
we've mastered about an hour now what we
want<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:51.920> do<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:52.160> check<00:00:52.399> for<00:00:52.640> conversion<00:00:53.149> in

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
want to do is check for conversion in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.780 
want to do is check for conversion in
order<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:54.320> confirm<00:00:54.620> conversion<00:00:55.280> we<00:00:55.520> can<00:00:55.670> use

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
order to confirm conversion we can use

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.930 
order to confirm conversion we can use
iodine<00:00:56.390> iodine<00:00:57.290> in<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.250> presence<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.730> starch

iodine iodine in the presence of starch

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.750 
iodine iodine in the presence of starch
will<00:00:59.720> turn<00:00:59.899> black<00:01:00.280> iodine<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.370> presence

I'm going to take a sample of mine and
let's<00:01:07.729> see<00:01:07.850> where<00:01:08.000> we're<00:01:08.119> at

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.210 

for<00:01:19.450> your<00:01:19.570> sample<00:01:19.870> you<00:01:20.380> notice<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:21.100> we're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
for your sample you notice that we're

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.640 
for your sample you notice that we're
only<00:01:21.310> taking<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.760> very<00:01:21.970> small<00:01:22.090> amount<00:01:22.480> no<00:01:23.440> need

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.730 
small drop when it goes into your mash
it'll<00:01:30.880> either<00:01:31.000> go<00:01:31.240> away<00:01:31.540> or<00:01:31.870> stay<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.620> same

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.109 
black
you<00:01:35.500> are<00:01:35.590> not<00:01:35.830> converted<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.729> need<00:01:36.880> some<00:01:37.030> ash

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
you are not converted you need some ash

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.600 
you are not converted you need some ash
longer<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:38.200> goes<00:01:38.350> away<00:01:38.530> or<00:01:38.979> stays<00:01:39.190> clear

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
longer it goes away or stays clear

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.190 
longer it goes away or stays clear
you're<00:01:40.090> converted<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.750> you're<00:01:40.990> ready<00:01:41.140> to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
you're converted and you're ready to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:51.039 
you're converted and you're ready to
sparge<00:01:41.590> mines<00:01:42.400> clear<00:01:42.880> perfect<00:01:43.660> example

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.030 

Tylar<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> other<00:01:52.409> hand<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.799> still<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
Tylar on the other hand is still a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.999 
Tylar on the other hand is still a
rookie<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.790> he's<00:01:54.000> got<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> little<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.380> perfect

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
rookie so he's got a little but perfect

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
rookie so he's got a little but perfect
example<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.150> it's<00:01:57.299> turning

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
example you can see that it's turning

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.560 
example you can see that it's turning
black<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:59.549> reason<00:01:59.850> his<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.119> black<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
black there the reason his is black is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
black there the reason his is black is
because<00:02:00.720> starch<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.290> still<00:02:01.470> present<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.070> his

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
because starch is still present in his

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.630 
because starch is still present in his
recipe<00:02:03.210> he<00:02:03.899> did<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.320> flaked<00:02:04.680> corn<00:02:05.159> which

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
recipe he did have flaked corn which

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
recipe he did have flaked corn which
does<00:02:05.880> take<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> longer<00:02:06.570> period<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.930> time<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
does take a longer period of time to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.190 
does take a longer period of time to
convert<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.459> his<00:02:08.729> needs<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.450> time<00:02:09.600> mashing

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
convert so his needs more time mashing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.580 
convert so his needs more time mashing

that converting necessarily as you think
here<00:02:37.170> we've<00:02:37.350> got<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> $2,000<00:02:38.520> brew<00:02:38.820> system<00:02:39.060> it's

here we've got a $2,000 brew system it's

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.600 
here we've got a $2,000 brew system it's
not<00:02:39.840> converted<00:02:40.410> many<00:02:40.980> people<00:02:41.310> would<00:02:41.400> start

not converted many people would start

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.100 
not converted many people would start
sparging<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.210> unfortunately<00:02:42.750> would<00:02:42.900> end<00:02:43.050> up

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
sparging and unfortunately would end up

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.180 
sparging and unfortunately would end up

system we're converted great people
start<00:02:49.890> sparse<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.220> they'd<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.460> fine<00:02:50.490> but<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
start sparse and they'd be fine but the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.080 
start sparse and they'd be fine but the
idea<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.560> if<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:53.010> do<00:02:53.220> not<00:02:53.400> check<00:02:53.730> for

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
idea here is if you do not check for

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.050 
idea here is if you do not check for
