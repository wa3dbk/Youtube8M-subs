00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
you know you want to measure temperature

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.640 
you know you want to measure temperature
when<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.389> want<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.719> measure<00:00:09.870> temperature

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
when you want to measure temperature

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.879 
when you want to measure temperature
you're<00:00:10.950> doing<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> thermometer<00:00:11.820> right<00:00:12.889> at

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
you're doing with a thermometer right at

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.589 
you're doing with a thermometer right at
the<00:00:14.040> moment<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.700> got<00:00:14.910> something<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.540> it

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the moment so it's got something in it

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.429 
the moment so it's got something in it
called<00:00:15.990> mercury<00:00:17.090> mercury<00:00:18.109> measures<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
called mercury mercury measures the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.080 
called mercury mercury measures the
temperature<00:00:19.619> right<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.880> close<00:00:21.060> your

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
temperature right and if you close your

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.460 
temperature right and if you close your
eyes<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.330> don't<00:00:21.630> look<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:21.869> me<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.170> gonna<00:00:22.260> get

next to it a thermometer that's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.269 
next to it a thermometer that's
measuring<00:00:30.689> temperature<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that planet that's called mercury right

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.760 
that planet that's called mercury right
next<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> Sun<00:00:41.180> Mercury<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:43.320> murder<00:00:43.590> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
next to the Sun Mercury but murder is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.160 
next to the Sun Mercury but murder is
got<00:00:44.100> temperature<00:00:45.059> gauge<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.930> monitor

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
got temperature gauge on it the monitor

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.700 
got temperature gauge on it the monitor
on<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.129> any<00:00:47.309> better<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> hotter

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710
