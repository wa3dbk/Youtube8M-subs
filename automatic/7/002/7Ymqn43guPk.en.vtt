carbonation but ginger beer on the other

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.600 
carbonation but ginger beer on the other
hand<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:54.960> fermented<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.980> beer<00:00:56.309> just

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
hand was fermented just like beer just

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069

like<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> name<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.629> would<00:00:57.750> result

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
like the name and so that would result

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.220 
like the name and so that would result
in<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.520> bit<00:00:59.640> less<00:00:59.879> carbonation<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.079> was

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
in a little bit less carbonation it was

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.569 
in a little bit less carbonation it was
traditionally<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.039> bit<00:01:02.129> less<00:01:02.340> sweet

traditionally a little bit less sweet

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
traditionally a little bit less sweet

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
up to 11% I think YUM that sounds

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.179 
up to 11% I think YUM that sounds
delicious<00:01:09.380> nowadays<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.560> don't<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.830> see

really<00:04:23.740> good<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.639> lot<00:04:24.790> more<00:04:24.850> intense<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.450> my

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
really good and a lot more intense in my

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.360 
really good and a lot more intense in my
opinion<00:04:25.870> yeah<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.470> think<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.950> agree<00:04:27.070> with<00:04:27.220> you

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
opinion yeah I think I agree with you

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.640 
opinion yeah I think I agree with you
I'm<00:04:27.790> on<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.389> Gosling's<00:04:28.900> it's<00:04:29.139> definitely

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
I'm on the Gosling's it's definitely

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.170 
I'm on the Gosling's it's definitely
sweeter<00:04:29.950> which<00:04:30.250> works<00:04:30.550> for<00:04:30.790> me<00:04:30.910> because<00:04:31.090> I

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
sweeter which works for me because I

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.240 
sweeter which works for me because I
like<00:04:31.330> everything<00:04:31.510> sweeter<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.040> with

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
like everything sweeter and the with

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.250 
like everything sweeter and the with
that<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.550> get<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.760> little<00:04:34.090> bit<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.540> sort

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
that you get a little bit of that sort

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.530 
that you get a little bit of that sort
of<00:04:35.350> extra<00:04:35.680> body<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.280> mouthfeel<00:04:36.790> but<00:04:37.389> that's

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
of extra body and mouthfeel but that's

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.940 
of extra body and mouthfeel but that's
not<00:04:37.690> surprising<00:04:37.840> because<00:04:38.260> sugar<00:04:38.740> can

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
not surprising because sugar can

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.190 
not surprising because sugar can
definitely<00:04:39.400> add<00:04:39.580> that<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.479> cocktail<00:04:41.050> or<00:04:41.080> two

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
definitely add that to a cocktail or two

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.290 
definitely add that to a cocktail or two
in<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:41.680> case<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:42.310> ginger<00:04:42.610> beer<00:04:42.790> so<00:04:43.090> those

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
in this case the ginger beer so those

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.780 
in this case the ginger beer so those
two<00:04:43.540> could<00:04:43.780> definitely<00:04:43.960> be<00:04:44.410> related<00:04:44.830> on<00:04:45.580> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
two could definitely be related on the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.030 
two could definitely be related on the
ginger<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.270> get<00:04:46.450> it<00:04:46.570> really<00:04:46.750> early<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.500> it's

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
ginger I get it really early like it's

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.409 
ginger I get it really early like it's
like<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> first<00:04:48.550> thing<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:48.910> taste<00:04:49.150> is<00:04:49.389> the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
like the first thing I taste is the

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.540 
like the first thing I taste is the
ginger<00:04:49.840> but<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:50.560> does<00:04:50.710> taper<00:04:50.979> off<00:04:51.250> really

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
ginger but it does taper off really

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.240 
ginger but it does taper off really
really<00:04:51.729> quickly<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:52.900> sort<00:04:53.590> of<00:04:53.650> disappears

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
really quickly so it sort of disappears

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.830 
really quickly so it sort of disappears
pretty<00:04:54.550> quickly<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.120> it's<00:04:55.270> kind<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.720> matter

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
pretty quickly so it's kind of a matter

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.659 
pretty quickly so it's kind of a matter
of<00:04:56.050> taste<00:04:56.260> on<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.650> ginger<00:04:56.979> yep

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
of taste on the ginger yep

so at the end of the day one of the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.930 
so at the end of the day one of the
things<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.800> love<00:05:00.040> about<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.520> ginger<00:05:00.729> bread

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
this all so much better because like

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.230 
this all so much better because like
with<00:06:31.910> citric<00:06:32.330> acid<00:06:32.660> your<00:06:33.430> with<00:06:34.430> raw<00:06:34.610> sugar<00:06:34.820> or

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
with citric acid your with raw sugar or

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.760 
with citric acid your with raw sugar or
white<00:06:35.510> sugar<00:06:35.570> yeah<00:06:36.140> you<00:06:36.320> don't<00:06:36.500> have<00:06:36.620> any

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
white sugar yeah you don't have any

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.740 
white sugar yeah you don't have any
flavor<00:06:36.980> so<00:06:37.370> it<00:06:37.490> lets<00:06:37.970> everything<00:06:38.480> else<00:06:38.600> kind

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
flavor so it lets everything else kind

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.780 
flavor so it lets everything else kind
of<00:06:38.840> shine<00:06:39.200> through<00:06:39.440> yeah<00:06:39.740> but<00:06:40.100> with<00:06:40.280> Demerara

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
of shine through yeah but with Demerara

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.310 
of shine through yeah but with Demerara
you<00:06:40.850> have<00:06:41.000> that<00:06:41.120> molasses<00:06:41.600> flavor<00:06:41.780> which<00:06:42.110> will

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
you have that molasses flavor which will

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.600 
you have that molasses flavor which will
cover<00:06:42.560> up<00:06:42.740> some<00:06:42.920> of<00:06:42.950> the<00:06:43.040> intensity<00:06:43.430> of<00:06:43.550> the

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
cover up some of the intensity of the

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.150 
cover up some of the intensity of the
ginger<00:06:43.910> that's<00:06:44.150> Jeremy<00:06:44.900> javanese<00:06:45.380> well<00:06:45.590> right

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
ginger that's Jeremy javanese well right

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.880 
ginger that's Jeremy javanese well right
so<00:06:46.610> I<00:06:46.910> think<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.690> agave<00:06:47.990> plus<00:06:48.290> Demerara<00:06:48.680> would

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
so I think the agave plus Demerara would

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.610 
so I think the agave plus Demerara would
be<00:06:49.010> coming<00:06:49.280> soon
