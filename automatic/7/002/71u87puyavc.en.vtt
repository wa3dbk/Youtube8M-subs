00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello all and welcome to a new one 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.120
 video 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.430
 ipl and I am a lot of goodies 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 croquettes i'm here today with joost 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.309
 haha 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.780
 and we are going a new format today 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.250
 from the video out this was an idea 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.950
 for my road views each other trail 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.990
 namely it is a whole new idea for that 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.760
 one of a movie, and it's something 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.320
 I would like to test if you like this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.960
 you may seem to be let down and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.590
 feedback is always welcome in the comments 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.430
 but reef 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.230
 I suggest we just go 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.080
 I think that is a very good start 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.370
 plan ok i go i have to pass you over 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 be prepared is you go in made 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 to become 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.049
 well the peter clover simple all the way 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.909
 ready ready but I don't dare 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:50.729
 ok also succeeded is start 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.940
 ok this is possible i am also a f oh no 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:57.299
 oh i also feel myself is a is a number 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 stitches people and yes 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:03.780
 does not have his toes with someone 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.130
 fun is also equally funny first I missed 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 checkpoint I just drank some and the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.930
 boy oh boy oh boy oh boy jumps over it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.930
 just got spiga 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.250
 a premature and appears at the beginning 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.250
 which is better of course a cache 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.400
 oh my god somewhere this just doesn't come on 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.900
 as bright red is still what this is really 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.480
 focus jelle 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.230
 no indirect is very competitive this is possible 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.570
 to handle 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.640
 is that under so much pressure they correct it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.050
 can i oh god i don't know for the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.050
 more of a kind o no o no o no 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 the timing is difficult at the 22nd oh 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.000
 no already 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.580
 jelle now she 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 I have to support moral support 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.330
 believe in you i actually believe one 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.700
 bit not help me when i help 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 silent and yo, I also go the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.630
 less serious about actually making it worse 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.490
 that I fail because I had it small 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.380
 I had already begun to go their way 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.459
 it went fine but not a whole right 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.709
 in one go 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.830
 oh I'm on the second ever 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.410

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.740
 was to complete what I really suffocate steel 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.790
 not too busy I 'm going to find busy 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.440
 I can commute it 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.450
 I get completely aggressive then 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.580

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.560

 Well okay so we only 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.410
