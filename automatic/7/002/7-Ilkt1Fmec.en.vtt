00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello is so welcome in this 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.980
 new video I praise your eternal name 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.240
 so we will learn this song 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.199
 which will be played in G major 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 them that it will be the basic chords one 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.200
 will not go further in the agreements 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.710
 for this video we will make agreements 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.170
 basic 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.670
 the goal is really to learn the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.940
 basis of the agreements here so I believe 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.350
 to have everything said ok well it's gone so 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.010
 start of course as I said 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.010
 by a single major 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.030
 I the time not eternal D major 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.290
 C major 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.600
 only major lord I celebrate late 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.550
 D major 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.440
 two major salvages then had 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.240
 we will take it as I play it 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.450
 in my church in my church 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 we play it this way in a year 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.140
 and 1 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.460
 here 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.500
 so that's the rhythm we're doing in 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.810
 my church here we are so you know 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.900
 already the three agreements for the couple and 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.850
 so it's really not complicated 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.799
 major but major damage hours 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.869
 this is the major now for the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.590
 chorus it will be the same three chords 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.250
 except that there is a transition agreement 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.270
 6 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.270
 followed two minor 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.200
 so here you come from heaven on earth 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:03.310
 makes major show C major voice 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.860
 C major for me 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.240

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.090
