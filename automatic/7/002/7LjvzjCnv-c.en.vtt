00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
the Masonic you've been trying to build

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.820 
the Masonic you've been trying to build
over<00:00:06.990> here<00:00:07.170> or<00:00:07.500> not<00:00:09.019> personally<00:00:10.019> north<00:00:10.590> south

over here or not personally north south
east<00:00:11.070> west<00:00:11.219> oaks<00:00:11.940> recognize<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.719> each<00:00:12.900> one

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
east west oaks recognize that each one

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.950 
east west oaks recognize that each one
of<00:00:13.139> these<00:00:13.259> days<00:00:13.500> represents<00:00:14.099> an<00:00:14.309> RC<00:00:14.790> value<00:00:15.059> of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
of these days represents an RC value of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.120 
of these days represents an RC value of
that<00:00:16.289> particular<00:00:16.500> neuron<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.779> okay<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.590> we

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
that particular neuron and okay so we

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
that particular neuron and okay so we
have<00:00:20.510> connections<00:00:21.510> who<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.689> say<00:00:21.900> okay<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.320> is

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
have connections who I say okay what is

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.590 
have connections who I say okay what is
the<00:00:22.500> process<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> have<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.330> into

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the process to have this what is into

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.980 
the process to have this what is into
one<00:00:24.840> right<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.099> either<00:00:26.250> 11<00:00:26.849> okay<00:00:27.510> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
one right or it is either 11 okay so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.210 
one right or it is either 11 okay so
what<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.439> absolutely<00:00:28.590> hearing

a mess that's a big complex but this

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.570 
a mess that's a big complex but this
actually<00:01:07.290> allows<00:01:07.500> us<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> start<00:01:08.220> work<00:01:08.369> for

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
actually allows us to start work for

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
actually allows us to start work for
things<00:01:08.850> such<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.650> only<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> six

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
things such as this we only have six

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.090 
things such as this we only have six
neurons<00:01:11.610> okay<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.510> case<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.530> could<00:01:13.740> assume

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
neurons okay the case we could assume

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
neurons okay the case we could assume
that<00:01:14.939> there's<00:01:15.119> an<00:01:15.210> individual<00:01:15.659> process<00:01:16.110> state

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that there's an individual process state

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
that there's an individual process state
so<00:01:16.560> there's<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> sickness<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:17.400> definitely<00:01:17.759> find

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so there's a sickness or definitely find

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
so there's a sickness or definitely find
possible<00:01:18.450> states<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.110> six<00:01:19.380> neuron

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680

system could have by all the brake noise
is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.189> misfire<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.330> eight<00:01:24.570> neurons

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
is a misfire if you have eight neurons

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
is a misfire if you have eight neurons
you<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.409> gates<00:01:25.740> distinct<00:01:26.310> process<00:01:26.820> patterns

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you have gates distinct process patterns

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.140 
you have gates distinct process patterns
and<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.400> interesting<00:01:29.400> thing<00:01:29.430> without<00:01:29.790> movies

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
and the interesting thing without movies
w<00:01:30.600> n<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.380> upside<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.799> start<00:01:32.040> getting<00:01:32.159> 16

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
w n all upside you start getting 16

w n all upside you start getting 16
process<00:01:33.119> patterns<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> break<00:01:34.470> even<00:01:34.829> is

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630

of your tenuously left kick with from
their<00:02:20.840> two<00:02:21.140> Maury's<00:02:21.530> now<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.220> have

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
their two Maury's now you have

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.350 
their two Maury's now you have
some<00:02:22.610> ID<00:02:22.790> which<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:25.340> variation<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.209> a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
some ID which is get variation in a

some ID which is get variation in a
nitro<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.799> famous<00:02:27.829> action

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489
