power off no power I make sure the power
back<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:57.090> no<00:00:57.239> power<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.690> any<00:00:58.170> power<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
back I would no power now any power I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.060 
back I would no power now any power I
mean<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.219> are<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.640> see<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:02.010> push<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.370> push

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
mean how are you can see it push it push

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.490 
mean how are you can see it push it push
it<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:06.990> no<00:01:07.200> charge

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it then we can see there are no charge

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.039 
it then we can see there are no charge

and we see they are summed it up the
connect<00:02:18.550> will<00:02:19.450> charge<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.110> part

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.710 

like<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.730> see

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720

then<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:34.050> see<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.580> guitar<00:02:37.640> yes<00:02:38.750> special

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
then we see the guitar yes special

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:49.510 
then we see the guitar yes special
device

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.600 

first

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.060 

we<00:02:54.180> see<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> voltage<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.950> always<00:02:56.580> sees<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
we see the voltage and always sees the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.800 
we see the voltage and always sees the
child<00:02:59.070> watch<00:02:59.340> the<00:03:00.240> time<00:03:01.400> tap<00:03:02.400> time<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.810> pro

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
child watch the time tap time is a pro

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:21.640 
child watch the time tap time is a pro
it's<00:03:08.870> 2<00:03:09.870> 0<00:03:10.220> 14<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:14.570> 15<00:03:16.700> o'clock<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:19.830> second<00:03:20.630> 37

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
it's 2 0 14 and 15 o'clock to second 37

it's 2 0 14 and 15 o'clock to second 37
second<00:03:22.650> two<00:03:23.070> minutes

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
second two minutes

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.550 
second two minutes
so<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.470> 41<00:03:25.470> minutes<00:03:25.910> second<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:28.080> can<00:03:28.110> see

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
so this 41 minutes second so we can see

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
so this 41 minutes second so we can see
the<00:03:29.000> current<00:03:34.610> account<00:03:36.020> is<00:03:37.020> for<00:03:37.650> their<00:03:38.250> pod

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
the current account is for their pod

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.070 
the current account is for their pod
four<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:41.490> we<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:41.700> see<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> what<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.720> four

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
four and we can see the what it is four

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.900 
four and we can see the what it is four
point<00:03:44.000> seven<00:03:45.000> one<00:03:45.360> wattage<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:46.950> we<00:03:47.220> can<00:03:47.550> see

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
point seven one wattage and we can see

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.470 
point seven one wattage and we can see
that<00:03:48.510> I'm<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:49.110> age<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:53.430> number<00:03:53.850> it's

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
that I'm a age this one this number it's

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.610 
that I'm a age this one this number it's
number<00:03:54.660> you'd<00:03:54.959> increased<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:56.760> means<00:03:57.060> zero<00:03:57.750> to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
number you'd increased it means zero to

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.680 
number you'd increased it means zero to
its<00:03:59.459> increased<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.480> increasing<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.800> see

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
its increased is increasing you can see

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.300 
its increased is increasing you can see
firstly<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:03.930> zero<00:04:04.230> now<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:06.680> mah<00:04:07.680> power

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
firstly it is zero now it is mah power

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.120 
firstly it is zero now it is mah power
now<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.680> we<00:04:10.680> can<00:04:11.070> see<00:04:11.570> after<00:04:12.570> power<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.320> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
now so we can see after power of the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.090 
now so we can see after power of the
charge<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:14.820> which<00:04:15.030> we<00:04:15.510> check<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.410> data<00:04:16.650> again

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
charge for which we check the data again

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.830 
charge for which we check the data again
this<00:04:17.640> Rita<00:04:18.620> there<00:04:19.620> point<00:04:20.600> zero<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:22.109> each<00:04:23.840> other

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
this Rita there point zero to each other

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.070 
this Rita there point zero to each other
wattage<00:04:25.290> is<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:26.480> little<00:04:28.910> weak<00:04:29.910> link<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.570> with

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
wattage is a little weak link not with

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.780 
wattage is a little weak link not with
just<00:04:31.350> test<00:04:32.510> seeds

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:52.820 

Kalas<00:04:36.830> t-this<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:38.070> capacity

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:04.409 

so<00:04:53.430> on<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:54.300> increase<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:54.900> can<00:04:55.440> see<00:04:55.650> two<00:04:56.580> crazy
