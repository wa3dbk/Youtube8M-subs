00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.560
 madam sir hello the day 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.150
 still looks disturbed today 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.770
 since a new disturbance is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.449
 entered his outfit by brittany 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.400
 so this afternoon we find no 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.779
 rain of the VendÃ©e and Aquitaine in 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 going back to the north of the country 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.289
 at the back it's a trolling sky with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.570
 showers of the wind that reaches up to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.280
 70 km ridge near the coast 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
 and then up front our disruption of 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.640
 pyrenees going to the northeast and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 a milder time still voting 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.090
 sell up to 100 km / h on the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.230
 ridges of the Pyrenees and then in 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.090
 mediterranean we always have this 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.430
 marine food with wind that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.140
 reaches up to 80 90 km peak hour 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.150
 and that brings a lot of clouds and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.710
 humidity in these areas, especially on 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.329
 the Cevennes where the accumulations of rains 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.250
 may be important temperatures 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.960
 this afternoon they are up for 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.550
 everyone mainly from the south 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.540
 west going north-east under a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.910
 heaven more clement 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.220
 it is 16 to 20 degrees on the regions 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.989
 from the north and 20 to 25 over the regions of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.390
 South 25 for the South West 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 the day of Thursday the sweetness will be 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.630
 continue in the temperatures 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.879
 continue their rise with an average 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.329
 from 19 degrees north is 23 degrees to 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.610
 South 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.049
 and then on the sky side it's still 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.700
 change the days follow each other and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.859
 look like we find 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 our disturbances on the northwest of the 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.560
 country 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.149
 Unlike elsewhere on a Kingdom 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.819
 lighter heaven with thoune a little 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.929
 risk of showers from the center by going 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.310
 south west 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.439
 and since we are going to monitor it is this 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.209
 maritime arguments which persist 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.100
 lion's gulf to the Cevennes with 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.639
 a lot of a lot of rain on the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.709
 relief 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:30.959
 and then wind up to 90 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.219
 km children and even 100 km / hour on 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.409
 ridges of the central massif 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.819
 the day of Friday we will find 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.099
 more rains on the regions 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.659
 Mediterranean rains that will 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.310
 take on an unstable character that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.539
 will be added to the rains fell 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.009
 Wednesday and Thursday 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.200
 and so in places we can wait 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.759
 a rainy month and then it's not 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.319
 finished since the rain should be invited 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.740
 on these regions until the end of 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.099
 week 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.749
 elsewhere it's a time more plus more 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.419
 clement but with a lot of clouds 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.990
 any very few showers here or on the 

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:00.450
 Britain 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.279
 and then this disturbance that continues 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.919
 in milk on the western regions 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.389
 temperature side little evolution of 

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:08.280
 temperatures that stay mild in the morning 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.539
 like the afternoon here I am you 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.750
 wish a very pleasant day to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.750
 soon
