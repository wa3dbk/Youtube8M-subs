leisure time leads us very close to

leisure time leads us very close to

experiencing implantation maybe not us

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.910 
experiencing implantation maybe not us
males<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.219> our<00:00:53.370> female<00:00:53.760> counterparts<00:00:54.920> now

let's<00:00:56.129> step<00:00:56.399> forward<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.030> discuss<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
let's step forward and discuss the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.680 
let's step forward and discuss the
biological<00:00:58.949> aspects<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.969> implantation<00:01:01.489> first

biological aspects of implantation first

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.990 
biological aspects of implantation first
implantation<00:01:03.690> occurs<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> uterus<00:01:05.000> here

implantation occurs in the uterus here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.200 
implantation occurs in the uterus here
we<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.810> visual<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> uterus<00:01:08.210> along

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
we can see a visual of the uterus along

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.440 
we can see a visual of the uterus along

muscle tissue helps implantation to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.950 
muscle tissue helps implantation to
occur<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.689> helps<00:01:16.650> modal<00:01:17.189> spurn<00:01:18.000> enter<00:01:18.689> its
