00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
my facebook when I shared it there but

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
my facebook when I shared it there but
it<00:01:20.939> wasn't<00:01:21.330> bad<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> quality<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> pretty

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it wasn't bad and the quality is pretty

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
it wasn't bad and the quality is pretty
good<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:22.950> tried<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:24.000> twitch<00:01:24.210> TV

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
good I even tried the the twitch TV

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.899 
good I even tried the the twitch TV
streaming<00:01:24.960> feature<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.549> had<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
streaming feature and I had like a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
streaming feature and I had like a
thousand<00:01:27.390> people<00:01:27.509> watching<00:01:28.020> me<00:01:28.049> play<00:01:28.290> well<00:01:28.530> as

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
thousand people watching me play well as

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
thousand people watching me play well as
streaming<00:01:28.979> from<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> PlayStation<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.090> was

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
streaming from the PlayStation which was

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
streaming from the PlayStation which was
a<00:01:30.270> kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> crazy<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> quality<00:01:31.920> wasn't<00:01:32.100> very

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
a kind of crazy the quality wasn't very

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.800 
a kind of crazy the quality wasn't very
good<00:01:32.400> because<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.000> lock<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.450> bitrate<00:01:33.750> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
good because they lock your bitrate I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
good because they lock your bitrate I
think<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.350> 1300<00:01:35.130> which<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> very<00:01:36.000> low

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
think it's like 1300 which is very low

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.850 
think it's like 1300 which is very low
so<00:01:36.329> when<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> there's<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> lot<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> movement

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
so when you there's a lot of movement

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.410 
so when you there's a lot of movement
there's<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.189> pixilation<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.000> stuff<00:01:39.150> but

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
there's like pixilation and stuff but

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
there's like pixilation and stuff but
overall<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.009> fantastic<00:01:41.159> because

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
overall I think it's fantastic because

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
overall I think it's fantastic because
people<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.240> able<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.689> share<00:01:42.899> their<00:01:43.110> content

people are able to share their content

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.910 
people are able to share their content
in<00:01:43.710> their<00:01:43.799> gameplay<00:01:44.250> much<00:01:45.060> easier<00:01:45.509> now<00:01:45.920> but

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
in their gameplay much easier now but

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100
