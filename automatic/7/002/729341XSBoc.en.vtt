 we start with your chronicle either at 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.420
 beginning of the adventurous he was subscribed the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.969
 top of the standings but the week 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.650
 last and dell picked up then 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.020
 will they take their revenge 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.650
 This week the nuts and mergers 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.650
 I'm waiting for you 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 Yes 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060
 little pouch 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.750
 philon hole thank you gentlemen 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.590
 little small little little boy come near 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.590
 from me then laurent malika and bruce 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.590
 it's up to you to play as usual 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.590
 note 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.130
 that's how this Russian plan insists 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.940
 also for malika is a very good 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.710
 fast for the rat anti how is going 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.760
 I think it's one of the best 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.490
 crust this second session 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.010
 it's really they're constant the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.630
 last week it was a little bit 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.580
 draft there you are well find 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.710
 except that you offer figures that 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.170
 are really remarkable me I see 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.750
 there I put you 8 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.060
 thank you laurent malika why this note 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.390
 please tell me my dear friend 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.640
 laurent goes off it's a group that is 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 which is constant so now 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.020
 I would like to see them in some 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.360
 thing maybe another universe 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.130
 be careful there are a lot of 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.600
 transition that you deliver to each 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.580
 times the transition from the punch and 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.110
 so be careful and it's about you 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.590
 vary a bit to show again 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.330
 other facets of your group 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.310
 thank you allocated even so it Portois 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.450
 brussels the conclusion yes bah I 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.890
 find that even when we stop I 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.830
 agree pretty much with my 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.930
 colleagues 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.940
 the only thing is that there is still 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.530
 a real real effort of fact compared 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.870
 thomass the thomas is the figure 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.680
 that they have synchronized these two young 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.570
 good men and I find that despite everything 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
 it sounds easy but it's still 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.010
 a lot worked for that I put 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.770
 6 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.090
 there are small sync problems of 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.710
 time to time transition but I 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.140
 stay indulgent on this crew there 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.430
 because just physically it's 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.790
 very difficult what they do so well done 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.920
 guys 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.330
 so here's for the comments of 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.340
 our jury gentlemen it makes him a 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.320
 average of 6.6 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.330
 it's not bad at all it's not bad 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.680
 go back behind the scenes 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.560
 rest, we 'll see later 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.670
 that's enough we should not have 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.670
 of luck to finish 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.550
 gold
