this<00:02:09.460> is<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.030> piece<00:02:10.240> bomb<00:02:10.680> instead<00:02:11.680> of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
this is the piece bomb instead of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.670 
this is the piece bomb instead of
destroying<00:02:12.190> things<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.940> makes<00:02:13.210> them<00:02:13.420> better

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
it was invented in the year 24 11 thanks

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.930 
it was invented in the year 24 11 thanks
to<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.780> antimatter<00:02:17.380> chip<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:18.820> see

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
to the antimatter chip so you can see

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.090 
to the antimatter chip so you can see
this<00:02:19.090> video<00:02:19.360> plus<00:02:19.630> point<00:02:19.930> really<00:02:20.620> really<00:02:20.890> miss

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100

double yo wrong you six so just give it
a<00:02:24.130> sec<00:02:24.310> under<00:02:24.580> by<00:02:24.730> teleportation<00:02:25.350> which<00:02:26.350> will

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
a sec under by teleportation which will

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.860 
a sec under by teleportation which will
place<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.950> space<00:02:27.190> elevator<00:02:27.450> which<00:02:28.450> was<00:02:28.630> built

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
place the space elevator which was built

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.780 
place the space elevator which was built
by<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.110> electric<00:02:29.530> spacecraft<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.490> as<00:02:30.670> you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
by the electric spacecraft and as you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.580 
by the electric spacecraft and as you
can<00:02:30.910> see<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.120> can<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:31.630> happen<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:32.140> go<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.410> the
