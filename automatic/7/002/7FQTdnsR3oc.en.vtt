 told the Deputy Minister of Economics 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.930
 Donetsk People's Republic propose 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.510
 listen it will not do as we 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.460
 issued before it is a pension like this 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.070

 According to the decree, we give out round timber 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 pay attention that everyone understands that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.990
 we want to go back to normal 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.909
 that is, we want our residents to pay 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.130
 pension as we agreed 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.830
 how are they used to receive it in Ukraine 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.610
 we will pay up to the fact that they 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.990
 used to getting 4 will get 4 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990
 and so on and on 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.090
 but as the deputy minister said 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 economy pension is paid in 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.260
 Russian rubles in the ratio 1 2 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.670

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.950
 back almost all shops 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.690
 gas stations switched to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.180
 multicurrency settlement system such 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.050
 way pensioners who received pensions in 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.720
 Russian rubles 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.570
 It will be convenient to pay for their 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.580
 purchases bypassing currency exchange offices we 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.440
 talked the same way with retirees about 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.360

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.720

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:20.890
 write a statement there 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.080

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.690

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.550
 closed question about the payment of pensions for all 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.230

 this question can be addressed 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.530
 exclusively operating Kiev 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.240
 authorities because all pensioners 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.040

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.340
 People's Republic all his labor 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.680
 seniority pays from making these contributions 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.440
 it is in the pension fund of Ukraine 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.540
