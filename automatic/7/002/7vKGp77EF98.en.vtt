printer it is in shambles but it was
pretty<00:00:12.130> easy<00:00:12.310> to<00:00:12.460> get<00:00:12.670> it<00:00:12.790> here<00:00:13.090> just<00:00:13.720> pull

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
pretty easy to get it here just pull

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.900 
pretty easy to get it here just pull
side<00:00:14.320> panel<00:00:14.680> that<00:00:14.830> just<00:00:15.010> pop<00:00:15.220> off<00:00:15.460> and<00:00:15.760> same

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
side panel that just pop off and same

side panel that just pop off and same
with<00:00:16.059> the<00:00:16.180> roof<00:00:16.359> there's<00:00:16.660> not<00:00:16.779> even<00:00:16.840> any

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
with the roof there's not even any

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.300 
with the roof there's not even any
screws<00:00:18.780> the<00:00:19.780> bars<00:00:20.140> of<00:00:20.500> death

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
screws the bars of death

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.790 
screws the bars of death
this<00:00:22.120> is<00:00:22.480> bricked<00:00:22.960> or<00:00:23.260> something<00:00:23.619> like<00:00:23.740> that

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
this is bricked or something like that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.510 
this is bricked or something like that
something<00:00:24.610> along<00:00:24.910> those<00:00:25.030> lines<00:00:25.150> so<00:00:26.100> i<00:00:27.100> already

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
something along those lines so i already

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.890 
something along those lines so i already
check<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:27.789> cable<00:00:28.180> because<00:00:28.420> that<00:00:28.539> might<00:00:28.720> be<00:00:28.869> a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
check the cable because that might be a

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.510 
check the cable because that might be a
problem<00:00:29.199> if<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:29.530> got<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.830> cut<00:00:29.980> in<00:00:30.070> your<00:00:30.160> cable

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
problem if you got to cut in your cable

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.079 
problem if you got to cut in your cable
mine's<00:00:30.910> fine<00:00:31.330> it<00:00:31.630> is<00:00:32.519> only<00:00:33.519> displaying<00:00:33.879> two

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
mine's fine it is only displaying two

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.619 
mine's fine it is only displaying two
black<00:00:34.300> bars<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:35.199> is<00:00:35.319> running<00:00:35.530> firmware<00:00:36.629> 0.91

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
black bars it is running firmware 0.91

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.290 
black bars it is running firmware 0.91
if<00:00:38.289> you<00:00:38.379> want<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.589> see<00:00:38.679> that<00:00:38.800> video<00:00:39.120> check<00:00:40.120> out

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
if you want to see that video check out

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.899 
if you want to see that video check out
the<00:00:40.420> links<00:00:41.249> so<00:00:42.249> what<00:00:42.339> I'm<00:00:42.429> going<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.579> do<00:00:42.699> is<00:00:42.819> I

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
the links so what I'm going to do is I

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.469 
the links so what I'm going to do is I
might<00:00:43.059> actually<00:00:43.300> flash<00:00:43.839> it<00:00:44.079> to<00:00:45.179> 0.92<00:00:46.530> repetier

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
might actually flash it to 0.92 repetier

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.660 
might actually flash it to 0.92 repetier
firmware<00:00:49.479> so<00:00:49.899> let's<00:00:50.199> do<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:51.159> do<00:00:51.489> this

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
firmware so let's do that to do this

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.739 
firmware so let's do that to do this
you're<00:00:51.909> going<00:00:51.999> to<00:00:52.059> need<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.269> access<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.690> your

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
you're going to need to access to your

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:56.639 
you're going to need to access to your
back<00:00:52.989> panel<00:00:54.629> look<00:00:55.629> at<00:00:55.749> that<00:00:55.870> pretty<00:00:56.260> pretty<00:00:56.559> I

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
back panel look at that pretty pretty I

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.139 
back panel look at that pretty pretty I
think<00:00:56.829> it's<00:00:57.010> only<00:00:57.069> two<00:00:57.309> screws<00:00:57.639> to<00:00:57.670> get<00:00:57.999> back

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
think it's only two screws to get back

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.789 
think it's only two screws to get back
here<00:00:58.589> pretty<00:00:59.589> easy<00:00:59.799> stuff<00:01:00.129> this<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.479> a<00:01:01.510> chip<00:01:01.899> or

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
here pretty easy stuff this is a chip or

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.530 
here pretty easy stuff this is a chip or
something<00:01:02.859> like<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.370> chip<00:01:03.699> that's<00:01:04.210> on<00:01:04.420> an

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
something like a chip that's on an

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.609 
something like a chip that's on an
Arduino<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.250> yeah<00:01:07.149> naturally<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:08.320> can<00:01:08.439> hack

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
Arduino so yeah naturally you can hack

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.310 
Arduino so yeah naturally you can hack
the<00:01:08.770> crap<00:01:08.979> out<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.219> this<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:11.170> most

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
the crap out of this so the most

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.149 
the crap out of this so the most
important<00:01:11.770> thing<00:01:11.920> right<00:01:11.950> now<00:01:12.130> is<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.640> JP<00:01:13.060> one

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
important thing right now is this JP one

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.429 
important thing right now is this JP one
dropper<00:01:15.159> wotton<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:16.600> there<00:01:16.899> mine<00:01:17.259> doesn't

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
dropper wotton right there mine doesn't

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.279 
dropper wotton right there mine doesn't
actually<00:01:17.680> have<00:01:18.039> any<00:01:18.280> M<00:01:18.719> what<00:01:19.719> you<00:01:19.810> call<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.109> any

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
actually have any M what you call it any

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.200 
actually have any M what you call it any
jumper<00:01:20.680> pins<00:01:20.859> on<00:01:21.039> it<00:01:21.070> but<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.609> still<00:01:21.880> got

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
jumper pins on it but it still got

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.690 
jumper pins on it but it still got
solder<00:01:22.539> points<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.049> you<00:01:23.109> can<00:01:23.259> jump<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.680> JP<00:01:24.460> one

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
solder points and you can jump it JP one

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.980 
solder points and you can jump it JP one
is<00:01:25.030> so<00:01:25.899> you<00:01:25.960> can<00:01:26.200> erase<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:27.310> firmware<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.930> you

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
is so you can erase the firmware so you

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.289 
is so you can erase the firmware so you
love<00:01:29.109> JP<00:01:29.500> one<00:01:29.710> with<00:01:30.130> pins<00:01:30.850> in<00:01:31.000> it

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
love JP one with pins in it

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.399 
love JP one with pins in it
JP<00:01:31.810> one<00:01:31.990> without<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.679> then<00:01:33.310> you'll<00:01:33.429> have<00:01:33.549> J<00:01:34.450> 37

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
JP one without and then you'll have J 37

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.709 
JP one without and then you'll have J 37
and<00:01:35.649> then<00:01:35.829> J<00:01:36.460> something<00:01:37.030> something<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.630> the

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
and then J something something in the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.139 
and then J something something in the
future<00:01:37.869> when<00:01:38.200> they<00:01:38.320> do<00:01:38.380> this<00:01:38.590> again<00:01:39.149> again

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
future when they do this again again

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.889 
future when they do this again again
again<00:01:40.479> so<00:01:41.079> that<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.780> erase<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
again so that is just to erase the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.029 
again so that is just to erase the
firmware<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:45.520> use<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:45.999> you<00:01:46.810> short<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.469> turn

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
firmware and to use it you short it turn

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.609 
firmware and to use it you short it turn
on<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.429> system<00:01:48.820> for<00:01:48.999> five<00:01:49.359> seconds<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:49.990> then

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
on the system for five seconds and then

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.739 
on the system for five seconds and then
you<00:01:50.740> turn<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:50.950> back<00:01:51.070> off<00:01:51.399> okay<00:01:52.179> so<00:01:52.240> now<00:01:52.659> I'm

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
you turn it back off okay so now I'm

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.690 
you turn it back off okay so now I'm
going<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.469> my<00:01:53.649> flash<00:01:54.009> before<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.759> upload<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
going to do my flash before I upload and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.099 
going to do my flash before I upload and
I'm<00:01:57.700> gonna<00:01:57.969> use<00:01:58.119> these<00:01:58.270> trusty<00:01:58.659> pure<00:01:58.810> pliers

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
I'm gonna use these trusty pure pliers

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.649 
I'm gonna use these trusty pure pliers
okay<00:02:00.039> so<00:02:00.759> that's<00:02:00.969> holding<00:02:01.359> there<00:02:01.450> I'm<00:02:01.569> gonna

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
okay so that's holding there I'm gonna

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.530 
okay so that's holding there I'm gonna
flick<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:03.270> one<00:02:04.270> two<00:02:04.749> three<00:02:05.499> four<00:02:06.280> five<00:02:07.259> off

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
flick it on one two three four five off

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.640 
flick it on one two three four five off
now<00:02:10.540> when<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:10.720> flick<00:02:10.930> it<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.110> again<00:02:11.380> the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
now when I flick it on again the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.200 
now when I flick it on again the
computer<00:02:12.160> should<00:02:12.370> tell<00:02:12.850> me<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.060> something

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
computer should tell me it's something

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.240 
computer should tell me it's something

yes<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:16.470> reading<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.920> as<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.510> dosa

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
yes so now it's reading it as a dosa

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.110 
yes so now it's reading it as a dosa

arduino<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:35.480> put<00:03:36.480> them<00:03:36.570> in<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.720> right<00:03:36.870> spot<00:03:37.140> by

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
arduino to put them in the right spot by

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.210 
arduino to put them in the right spot by
myself<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.510> hardware<00:03:39.959> folder<00:03:40.320> is<00:03:40.500> all<00:03:41.010> we

myself so this hardware folder is all we

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.190 
myself so this hardware folder is all we
need<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.400> copy<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.510> we're<00:03:42.660> going<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.810> go<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> the

to<00:06:45.530> do<00:06:45.590> that<00:06:45.880> went<00:06:46.880> to<00:06:46.970> the<00:06:47.060> G<00:06:47.240> code<00:06:47.480> editor

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
to do that went to the G code editor

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.480 
to do that went to the G code editor
here<00:06:48.170> and<00:06:48.380> just<00:06:48.560> added<00:06:49.210> Phi<00:06:50.210> 0<00:06:50.510> to<00:06:50.690> n<00:06:50.960> M<00:06:51.310> 500<00:06:52.310> and

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
here and just added Phi 0 to n M 500 and

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.140 
here and just added Phi 0 to n M 500 and
then<00:06:53.120> we're<00:06:53.270> going<00:06:53.390> to<00:06:53.450> hit<00:06:53.630> print<00:06:55.150> start

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
then we're going to hit print start

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.930 
then we're going to hit print start
print<00:06:56.480> and<00:06:56.720> this<00:06:57.050> is<00:06:58.010> going<00:06:58.490> to<00:06:58.580> take<00:06:58.730> it<00:06:58.850> out

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
print and this is going to take it out

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.040 
print and this is going to take it out
of<00:06:58.970> safe<00:06:59.810> mode<00:07:00.080> there<00:07:00.920> you<00:07:01.040> go<00:07:02.050> now

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
of safe mode there you go now

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.160 
of safe mode there you go now
unfortunately<00:07:03.410> I<00:07:03.770> think<00:07:03.920> my<00:07:04.220> problems<00:07:04.790> go

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.170 
unfortunately I think my problems go

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.780 
unfortunately I think my problems go
further<00:07:06.170> than<00:07:06.410> this<00:07:06.560> because<00:07:06.980> my<00:07:07.160> screen<00:07:07.490> is

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
further than this because my screen is

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.790 
further than this because my screen is
still<00:07:07.910> got<00:07:08.180> two<00:07:08.390> bars<00:07:08.660> in<00:07:08.930> it<00:07:09.020> but<00:07:09.530> you<00:07:09.650> should

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800
