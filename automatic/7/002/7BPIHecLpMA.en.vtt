00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.290

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.189
 hello welcome to release fast point 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 is my name is oscar and today I'm going to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.739
 teach them how to flash a Nokia Lumia 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.559
 520 The first thing we are going to need is 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.180
 go to our support website 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.400
 here you have the support point address 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 free fast point is and in the subsection 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.390
 of tools we have the application 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.130
 that we are going to use today that is the nokia 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.380
 care suite 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.000
 once downloaded that I already have already 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.220
 downloaded before proceeding with this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.910
 video tutorial we will need 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.130
 install these three things first 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 these two are bookstores of l that 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.020
 you need the one you need to work 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.270
 and the karl suite itself 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.610
 once installed that are super processes 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 simple next next next 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.330
 until the installation is finished 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.820
 we will need to install the drivers 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.250
 connection of our terminal 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.300
 care suite in your installation folder 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.979
 we were able to she has a her folder 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.310
 that contains all the drivers that we are going 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.170
 to have to use 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.360
 the installation is also super simple 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.990
 It is always following next 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.710
 without any complication once 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.539
 installed the next step is to proceed 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.090
 to the firmware download that we want 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.990
 install for which the nokia card is 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.530
 suite once we open it 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 in this application that brings 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.830
 we select sternal so that we do not 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.830
 ask for username and password 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.910
 and we wait a little while and once it's released 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.990
 let's establish a virtual connection 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.880
 with our terminal 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.540
 what are you going to see that is super super 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.540
 simple 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.320
 there we have loaded the application 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.250
 let's resize so it looks 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:18.210
 correct then in this option 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:24.310
 will ask us for the rm of our product 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:27.040
 lrm of the lumia 520 is the 900 14 as 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.720
 we know this if we go to the part of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.270
 behind our terminal behind the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.680
 battery there is going to put us 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.450
 rm 914 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.900
 then once done that we give to 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.610
 open 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.650
 and we already have a virtual connection 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.220
 established 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.930
 7 step the firmware download 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.090
 As you see, he asks us for the code of 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.370
 product as we know the code of 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.640
 product in the same way behind the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.580
 drums 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:02.209
 from our terminal there we have it in 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.209
 this case on 0 59 s 3 j 4 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.580
 other car products that you can use 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.470
 Well look at the case of Spain 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.120
 This is the one that we are going to use 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 Today is the global without any 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.110
 customization of any operator 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.840
 we have the vodafone we have the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.080
 movistar and if you do a search by 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.370
 There you will find some more secure 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.940
 let's copy this which is the one we 're going 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.940
 to use we paste it and check 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.470
 as you see now we would give to download 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.800
 as it is a process that I have done no 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.650
 I'm going to do it again but as you can see 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.470
 it's about a gigabyte with 23 with which 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.250
 this 2 can carry calmly according to 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.470
 the quality of your connection 2030 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.080
 and I've even seen cases of an hour 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.840
 hour and half 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.940
 we would download the good of this 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.670
 process if for some reason you fall 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.010
 the connection returning to this screen 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.200
 the process would continue from the point in 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.360
 the one that fell the connection with which 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.030
 we would not have to start over from 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.230
 zero if we had connection problems 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.919
 for not having a good connection 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.019
 once this download is done if you want 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.740
 see where you will download the program to 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:28.010
 your your firmware here 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.560
 here you have the address 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.950
 all right 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.530
 as we already had done this 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.660
 next is to start with the flash events 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.750
 and with which here in this option of 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.910
 here 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.620
 as you see me and I get because the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.180
 I have downloaded 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.740
 selection we would do if we had more 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.590
 selection we would do those that were in 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.660
 this case I have only downloaded this 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.660
 the next important step is 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.680
 work without line because work without 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.340
 line because if not him 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.280
 the nokia car sweet would download again 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.700
 the losing application losing a lot 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.150
 time in a lot of data 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.420
 Once all this is done, remember 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.130
 offline we give you to start now going to 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.340
 start a verification that can 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.050
 take a few seconds or minutes we will 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.740
 wait for the end of the 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.740
 check 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.210
 once finished verification 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.070
 the program itself is going to ask us to 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.250
 proceed to the connection with our 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.520
 important terminal the phone has 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:43.900
 to be off and let's see you see 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.660
 ask us to press volume down and 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.640
 the power and once free we give it to 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.640
 retract let's proceed 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.260
 we give it to retract 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.450
 and there begins to recognize as you see 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.490
 now he will proceed to make a new 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.190
 series of computer restarts and 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.250
 will start with flashing this is a 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.550
 process that can take you between five 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.190
 or six minutes easy 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.100
 has already recognized the phone and what is it 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.040
 who is telling us in my case is 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.740
 warning that 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.190
 the product code that I'm using 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.560
 It is not the same as it was originally 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.010
 the phone like I am sure of what 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.280
 what do I want to do we proceed to give it to ok 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.580
 and starts 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.529
 with the process of flash eo as I said 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.199
 this 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:45.629
 can easily carry between 5 or 10 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.359
 minutes what I'm going to do is I'm going to 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:53.479
 pause the recording and as soon as the 

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:53.479
 process finish I turn it on again 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.470
 in the process it is almost finished 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:05.650
 as you see without any kind of problem 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:08.070
 and it has taken me about 4 minutes in my 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.070
 computer 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.890
 and once it is over it restarts 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:18.289
 and important full recovery of 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:20.089
 remember this bending process 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.949
 as long as flash is a 

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:25.699
 terminal as they are lost absolutely 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:27.229
 all the data and nothing else I hope 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.749
 that you liked this video tutorial 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:33.189
 that I take advantage of them and see you in 

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:33.189
 the next thank you very much
