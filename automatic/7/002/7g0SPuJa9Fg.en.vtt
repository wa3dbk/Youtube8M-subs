00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
tactics maybe not for the best but he

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.399

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
had a really good game today and because

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370 
had a really good game today and because
all<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> was<00:01:51.420> another<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.840> played<00:01:52.110> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
all I was another one that played really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.109 
all I was another one that played really
well<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.579> wasn't<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
well so now that wasn't there was a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
well so now that wasn't there was a
slight<00:01:54.509> positive<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.079> take<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.740> then

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
slight positive we can take but then

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.030 
slight positive we can take but then
again<00:01:56.600> we<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.840> looked<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> second<00:01:58.890> best

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
again we just looked kind of second best

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
again we just looked kind of second best
chelsea<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.729> first<00:01:59.969> half<00:02:00.119> obviously

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
chelsea in that first half obviously

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.209 
chelsea in that first half obviously
you've<00:02:01.110> got<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> expend<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.829> chance<00:02:02.070> we're

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you've got to expend that chance we're

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.160 
you've got to expend that chance we're
going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> got<00:02:02.520> bombard<00:02:03.299> us<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:03.990> the

first minute that's exactly what they
did<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.299> did<00:02:06.329> defend<00:02:06.750> very<00:02:07.049> very<00:02:07.409> well

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710

for Chelsea in recent weeks and he was

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.580 
for Chelsea in recent weeks and he was
so<00:02:18.209> difficult<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.690> human<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.019> his<00:02:19.200> game<00:02:19.319> going

today she'll see how to play the command
of<00:02:25.110> difference<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.830> big<00:02:26.069> impact<00:02:26.099> on

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
of difference I can have a big impact on

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.250 
of difference I can have a big impact on
the<00:02:26.700> game<00:02:26.849> I'm<00:02:27.239> not<00:02:27.480> saying<00:02:27.659> we<00:02:27.810> haven't<00:02:28.080> got<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the game I'm not saying we haven't got a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.920 
the game I'm not saying we haven't got a

didn't<00:02:36.450> but<00:02:36.900> they<00:02:37.349> just<00:02:37.799> went<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.099> little<00:02:38.400> bit

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700

away a penalty was quite lucky not to
see<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.760> read<00:02:50.970> by<00:02:51.450> was<00:02:51.629> a<00:02:51.690> great<00:02:51.900> penalty<00:02:52.290> by

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
see you read by was a great penalty by

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.619 
see you read by was a great penalty by
him<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.829> we<00:02:53.400> could<00:02:53.579> see<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:53.940> knew<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.239> was<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
him and we could see one knew it was a

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.930 
him and we could see one knew it was a
bit<00:02:54.870> harsh<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.290> us<00:02:55.410> because<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:56.099> defended<00:02:56.640> so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
bit harsh on us because we defended so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.610 
bit harsh on us because we defended so
well<00:02:57.209> with<00:02:57.359> like<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.870> said<00:02:58.019> if<00:02:58.109> it<00:02:58.230> wasn't<00:02:58.260> that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
well with like I said if it wasn't that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.990 
well with like I said if it wasn't that
little<00:02:58.829> bit<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> brilliance<00:02:59.489> then<00:02:59.879> it

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
little bit of brilliance then it

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.920 
little bit of brilliance then it
probably<00:03:00.180> would<00:03:00.359> have<00:03:00.420> been<00:03:00.480> Neil<00:03:00.750> Neil

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
probably would have been Neil Neil

probably would have been Neil Neil

guards a hard time we were incredibly
unfortunate<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.090> concede<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:03.659> we<00:03:04.170> weren't

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
unfortunate to concede but we weren't

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.289 
unfortunate to concede but we weren't
really<00:03:04.650> crazy<00:03:05.069> much<00:03:05.340> at<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.879> other<00:03:06.000> end<00:03:06.180> I

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
really crazy much at the other end I

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.580 
really crazy much at the other end I
don't<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.629> we've<00:03:06.720> registered<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.170> shot<00:03:07.409> on

don't think we've registered a shot on

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
that much that I mean we had a really

that much that I mean we had a really
really<00:03:23.459> good<00:03:23.730> child<00:03:24.030> straight<00:03:24.329> up<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.630> we

was too heavy and that was one of very

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
throughout a whole 45 minutes we

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.690 
throughout a whole 45 minutes we
certainly<00:03:37.590> looks<00:03:37.769> rejuvenated<00:03:37.919> we<00:03:38.549> looked

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
certainly looks rejuvenated we looked

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.699 
certainly looks rejuvenated we looked
really<00:03:38.849> up<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.139> one<00:03:40.290> new<00:03:40.410> damn<00:03:40.620> we

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
really up for it and and one new damn we

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.960 
really up for it and and one new damn we
might<00:03:40.859> as<00:03:40.949> well<00:03:40.980> have<00:03:41.160> gone<00:03:41.280> all<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:41.819> air

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
might as well have gone all out for air

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.430 
might as well have gone all out for air
because<00:03:42.329> we<00:03:42.480> kind<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.720> had<00:03:42.840> nothing<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.260> lose

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
because we kind of had nothing to lose

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.229 
because we kind of had nothing to lose
and<00:03:43.919> even<00:03:44.220> then<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.459> continue<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:44.940> defend

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
and even then we continue to defend

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.140 
and even then we continue to defend
really<00:03:45.900> well<00:03:46.079> one<00:03:46.799> player<00:03:47.099> arguably<00:03:47.879> could

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
really well one player arguably could

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.059 
really well one player arguably could
have<00:03:48.540> got<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> red<00:03:48.930> card<00:03:48.959> was<00:03:49.410> certainly<00:03:49.799> Gary

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
have got a red card was certainly Gary

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.129 
have got a red card was certainly Gary
Cahill<00:03:50.430> for<00:03:50.639> a<00:03:50.669> very<00:03:50.970> reckless<00:03:51.449> challenge<00:03:51.480> on

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
Cahill for a very reckless challenge on

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.930 
Cahill for a very reckless challenge on
Alexei<00:03:52.680> Sanchez<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.129> think<00:03:53.310> he<00:03:53.400> was<00:03:53.489> very<00:03:53.549> lucky

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
Alexei Sanchez I think he was very lucky

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.150 
Alexei Sanchez I think he was very lucky
dr.<00:03:54.840> C<00:03:54.989> read<00:03:55.199> the<00:03:55.290> choice<00:03:55.500> was<00:03:55.650> reckless

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
dr. C read the choice was reckless

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.039 
dr. C read the choice was reckless
dangerous<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.329> could<00:03:57.810> have<00:03:57.900> caused

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
dangerous and it could have caused

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.080 
dangerous and it could have caused
serious<00:03:58.319> damage<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.799> Alexis<00:03:59.400> Sanchez<00:03:59.819> but

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
serious damage to Alexis Sanchez but

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.879 
serious damage to Alexis Sanchez but
then<00:04:00.569> again<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.049> referee<00:04:01.230> probably<00:04:01.769> knows

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
then again the referee probably knows

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.589 
then again the referee probably knows
more<00:04:01.919> about<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:02.340> than<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.639> do<00:04:02.699> regarding<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
more about it than I do regarding the
