00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
on the diamond sword in my hotbar right

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.920 
on the diamond sword in my hotbar right
now<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> glows<00:01:54.090> which<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.600> very

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
now you can see it glows which is very

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.569 
now you can see it glows which is very
nice<00:01:55.079> because<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> bottom

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
nice because like right at the bottom

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.780 
nice because like right at the bottom
right<00:01:56.729> where<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> durability<00:01:58.079> bar<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.790> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
right where the durability bar is you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.520 
right where the durability bar is you
can<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> faint<00:02:00.390> blue<00:02:00.689> glow<00:02:00.990> which<00:02:01.200> really

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
can see a faint blue glow which really

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.660 
can see a faint blue glow which really
does<00:02:01.710> help<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:02.219> when<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.490> scrolling

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
does help because when you're scrolling

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.370 
does help because when you're scrolling
through<00:02:03.060> you'd<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.509> know<00:02:03.600> exactly<00:02:03.810> what

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
it is you're scrolling for and why so if

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.730 
it is you're scrolling for and why so if
you're<00:02:06.899> scrolling<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.439> you're<00:02:07.590> fighting

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you're scrolling and you're fighting

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.020 
you're scrolling and you're fighting
someone<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.250> need<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.489> go<00:02:08.610> switch<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
someone and you need to go switch to I

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.969 
someone and you need to go switch to I
don't<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.569> bow<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:10.379> something<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> can

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
don't know your bow or something you can

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.680 
don't know your bow or something you can
easily<00:02:11.220> switch<00:02:11.610> over

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
easily switch over

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600 
easily switch over
and<00:02:12.870> you'll<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.160> your<00:02:14.340> bow<00:02:14.430> not

maybe even a blackish color i'm not

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.430 
maybe even a blackish color i'm not
completely<00:03:08.250> positive<00:03:08.520> on<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.000> tins<00:03:09.270> but<00:03:09.600> it's

completely positive on the tins but it's
definitely<00:03:10.890> not<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.810> best<00:03:12.840> for<00:03:13.530> pvp<00:03:14.340> so

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
definitely not the the best for pvp so

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.210 
definitely not the the best for pvp so
this<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:16.110> does<00:03:16.380> come<00:03:16.560> into<00:03:16.739> play<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.950> mean
