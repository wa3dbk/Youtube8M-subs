00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.309

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.499
 different because one the peak cited and 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.510
 another is sweet but the two are super 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.429
 Rich and easy to make 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.530
 for the first one we are going to make some 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.449
 ice pops but a are not any 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.739
 palette are from gangs 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.910
 next they will see the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.560
 ingredients 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.480
 for these delicious palettes 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.790
 we need gummies panditas chamoy 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.860
 lemons chili powder for this recipe 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.410
 I used tajima and now that we have 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.870
 all the Czech ingredients of the first 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.729
 step the first thing you have to do is 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.010
 in a jar place a little water and 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.450
 make a lemonade I preferred to make it 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.400
 natural but you can buy 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.790
 artificial sweetener and prepare the 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.790
 lemonade 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.590
 then they fill the molds with chamoy and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.760
 try to place just a little bit because 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.760
 the other ingredients are missing 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.590
 also puts a little more chili in 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.590
 powder to each mole of the pallets 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.250
 then place the bandit gummies 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 in the molds 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.270
 and finally put the lemon water in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.780
 each mold and leave them in the recall 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.780
 two hours 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.849
 and we have some delicious palettes 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.849
 of palmito ice 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.630
 and for the second idea I bring you some 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.630
 types of cookies 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.720
 for these delicious cake pops 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.320
 we need cookies oreo cheese 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.270
 philadelphia chocolate bars since 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.030
 we have the ingredients for the second 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.740
 dessert the first step the first thing that 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.110
 you have to do is put the cookies 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.130
 I oreo in a container and then split 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.130
 in little pieces 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.950
 after crushing them very well for 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.530
 this you can support with a bulldozer 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.840
 to grind is very good guys 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.370
 since we have them ground we add the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.209
 philadelphia cheese and we mix it 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.209
 perfectly 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.490
 when you cook, I prefer to do it with 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.490
 the bad 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.180
 for the next step we are going to do 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.070
 balls with the mixture a tip that I give you 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.230
 is to put butter in your hands to 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.500
 that does not stick and you start doing your 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.500
 bowling 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.540
 in a container you need to remove the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.099
 chocolate bars and go mixing for 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.099
 that the consistency remains without lumps 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.850
 if it hits you put some light 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.250
 since you have made your balls submerge 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.250
 the in a chocolate 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.200
 I am placing it in a little dish and 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.650
 then take them to the king, leave him there 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.650
 one hour 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.970

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.510
