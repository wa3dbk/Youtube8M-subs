I think it's really important you walk

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.530 
I think it's really important you walk
down<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.550> street<00:04:05.580> knowing<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.420> you're

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
down the street knowing that you're

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
you're you're doing that just by

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:26.430 
you're you're doing that just by

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
I think the biggest challenge and it's

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.930 
I think the biggest challenge and it's
an<00:04:35.860> ongoing<00:04:36.010> challenge<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:37.590> overall<00:04:38.640> grasp<00:04:39.640> of

an ongoing challenge is overall grasp of
