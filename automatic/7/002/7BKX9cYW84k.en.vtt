00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello and welcome in a new delivery 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
 of dice time this time we're going 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.660
 to talk about what is for many 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.320
 considered the first role play 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.410
 Spanish that is colar de ricard 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.420
 ibáñez aquelarre is set in what 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.930
 that would be the time of the middle ages 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 Spanish Spanish currency virtually 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.599
 all the Iberian Peninsula what would be 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.059
 the kingdoms of castilla aragón navarra 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.530
 Basque country galicia and obviously to the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.420
 andalus 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.090
 that is the first edition that came out of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.610
 coven the original edition 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.950
 Amman from the hands of Jacques International 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.680
 and good in coven mainly what 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.680
 that we have spread in a certain way 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.300
 the tube flame is to carry a group of 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.960
 adventurers but a group of adventurers 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.670
 quite mundane that is not a kind of 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.559
 adventurous or missionary roll that what 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.120
 he does everything and he can do everything but he 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.010
 comes adventurous as they would be 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.750
 adventurers considered from the point 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.930
 of view of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.900
 what would a person be of age 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.229
 average bone can be a warrior can be 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.680
 a peasant can be a shepherd can 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.710
 be an alchemist or can you even if 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.369
 to become a little wizard a rogue 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.750
 that kind of thing and good what we 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.460
 we find in which to give normally 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.270
 it is an environment in which obviously 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.280
 magic abounds because it's a middle age 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.380
 a middle age just like the people of the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.790
 era considered that it was full of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.720
 goblins demons creatures of the forest 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.580
 scary you can not practically 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.000
 travel because the evil one lurks in 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.009
 any corner and good point 3 in 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.770
 coven is quite documentation 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.320
 historical or what I know is a place in 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 which 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.950
 you can turn your 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.979
 imagination and you can realize 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.540
 that the little things in the people of the past or 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.020
 they invent pretty stories 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.870
 interesting this is the first edition 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.970
 from international as explained before 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.380
 it's quite complete because in addition to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 system gaming system is quite 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.790
 simple fact is based in part 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.010
 we could say the percentage system of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.660
 chaos a more than adjusted logo 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 certain ways the perks 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.380
 they are the same but good the system of 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.780
 skills 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.740
 the truth is that it looks pretty 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.120
 percentage with which we have for 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.540
 below our ability and if we take out 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.670
 below we have passed it to the runs 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.090
 that what magic is is pretty 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.530
 dark within what fits because the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.160
 imagine most of the magic more 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.950
 potent the demons offer and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.510
 before the supernaturals and one of the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.040
 things that makes you give it a little 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.850
 different from other games in the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.110
 which is some magic is the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.360
 existence of the rationality of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.420
 irrationality rationality is the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.310
 belief in magical creatures in things 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.110
 that can not be explained by anything else 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.900
 that is not in magic how much more 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.610
 irrationality you have are values 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.770
 opposite the rational and rationality go 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.170
 of a 100 more rationality 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.390
 you have easier is to cast spells 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.440
 because it is the base on which you throw 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.000
 the spells and in turn the more 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.620
 rationality you have the most confidence 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.950
 in the physical world in less than in the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.930
 world in the supernatural world have 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.760
 - of influence , which is why 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.180
 resistant to magic and its effects 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.739
 corrupters 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.750
 the truth is that this is a system 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.829
 pretty simple and that the truth is 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.390
 pretty much adjusts what is 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.990
 ambience 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 and the setting is brutal when it comes to 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.270
 to lead a medieval world I think it's 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.540
 the best medieval setting that 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.480
 I know with the exception of it's magic and 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.410
 you wait more and I 'm in another division 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.740
 completely different and besides that 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.560
 magic is much more fantasy 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.700
 to clarify several issues myself 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.260
 I mainly have 3 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.940
 is this the edition is what 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.680
 international then there is this which is the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.720
 Pandora's box edition that was the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.730
 that had seasons very little is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.310
 an edition that is much more 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.920
 expanded than that of gyor is more 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.230
 or less almost twice as many pages 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.060
 enough more things about bestiary 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.979
 especially things like demon angels 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.330
 that others are natural things of the 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.370
 folklore of the Iberian Peninsula and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.560
 also add little things from the old 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.850
 expansions of self such as the 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.920
 villa expansion and court that allows 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.540
 to play 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.849
 in what would be the century gave within 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.460
 17 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:40.160
 rooms until the 17th century 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.660
 what this bread is now quite complete 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.400
 in fact it's pretty cheap to get 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.880
 then what happens is that you will find 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.930
 that in terms of illustrations and 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.220
 tone comes out a bit or the text 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.819
 the illustrations are very good if the 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.979
 no longer so much is not so 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.380
 attractive and so close to what it would be 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.729
 the atmosphere and then for the third and 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.620
 then the third edition there is more 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.259
 editions of license weapons that 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.630
 dams we are universities is the 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.849
 edition of not only role this is the 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.369
 complete edition 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.860
 luxury edition as you can see the 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:21.559
 interior is made as if it were a 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.509
 kind of medieval manuscript even 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:26.869
 It has to be worn all brands 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.459
 this edition the only thing he does not have with 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:30.229
 respect to the previous one are the rules of 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.319
 life of the cut other than that is 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.809
 absolutely expanded in all 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.939
 senses from the fiction of the character 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.459
 in which the classic coven was 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.659
 quite quite random in certain 

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.399
 senses because for example there is a 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.869
 features thorium tablet in which yes 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:47.539
 you want to throw you could leave 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:49.550
 only also atrocious things besides this 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.949
 game has an equation system of 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.629
 points expands practically all the 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.110
 dress expands everything that is the 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:58.070
 ambience 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.249
 and detailing a lot more what would be 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.520
 information regarding 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:07.520
 the 'historical spain of that era 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.270
 and good is a technique to read or I 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.190
 I recommend now that you not only break 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.110
 re-edit these books that had 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.930
 come out in limited edition that or if 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.810
 you want with one because it's a 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.930
 unique opportunity to have one of the 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.520
 best games Spanish is one of the 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.080
 best editions I've seen many 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.080
 thanks for following me and until next time
