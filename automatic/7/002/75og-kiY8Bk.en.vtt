 a month ago she grafted this place 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:54.210
 vaccinations right here we shoved two 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:01.910
 sticks as you can see already 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 leaves and already begins to bloom plum 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.270
 we planted because of the fact that the fruit 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.010
 bad that is, it was originally bought 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.010
