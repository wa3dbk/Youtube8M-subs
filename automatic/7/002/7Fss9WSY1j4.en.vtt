camel and crank sensor as well we're

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200 
camel and crank sensor as well we're
looking<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.500> fuel<00:00:13.740> pump<00:00:13.769> now<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:15.000> let's

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
looking at the fuel pump now so let's

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300 
looking at the fuel pump now so let's
look<00:00:15.360> at<00:00:15.509> how<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.960> set<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> scope<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.830> take

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
look at how we can set the scope up take

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.040 
look at how we can set the scope up take
an<00:00:17.460> advantage<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.180> already<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.840> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
an advantage what we already have and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320 
an advantage what we already have and
just<00:00:19.529> add<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.859> cam<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.369> crank<00:00:20.609> sensor<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.180> it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.309 
the carbon that I had off of the red
figure<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.539> back<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.989> there<00:02:11.110> as<00:02:11.260> well<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:13.319> now

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
figure that back in there as well so now

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.540 
figure that back in there as well so now
it<00:02:14.500> should<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.709> able<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> look<00:02:15.130> at<00:02:15.310> yellow

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
it should be able to look at yellow

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.910 
it should be able to look at yellow
green<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.120> red<00:02:16.330> I'll<00:02:16.690> remember<00:02:16.989> red<00:02:17.380> was<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
green and red I'll remember red was the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.449 
green and red I'll remember red was the
fuel<00:02:18.340> pump<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:20.680> you're<00:02:20.830> gonna<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.100> four

manage all three individual traces

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.789 
manage all three individual traces
separately<00:03:33.850> in<00:03:34.150> other<00:03:34.569> words<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.930> can<00:03:35.109> pick<00:03:35.350> to

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
separately in other words I can pick to

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.370 
separately in other words I can pick to
four<00:03:36.370> volts<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.970> one<00:03:37.510> four<00:03:37.780> amps<00:03:38.079> for<00:03:38.319> the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
four volts and one four amps for the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.099 
four volts and one four amps for the
fuel<00:03:38.650> pump<00:03:38.889> if<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:39.819> was<00:03:39.970> only<00:03:40.209> looking<00:03:40.389> at<00:03:40.780> one

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
fuel pump if I was only looking at one

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.650 
fuel pump if I was only looking at one
Windell<00:03:41.560> all<00:03:42.069> three<00:03:42.760> would<00:03:42.970> have<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.359> have<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
Windell all three would have to have the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.120 
Windell all three would have to have the
same<00:03:43.900> they<00:03:44.139> would<00:03:44.290> all<00:03:44.470> have<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.859> be<00:03:44.980> either

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
same they would all have to be either

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.150 
same they would all have to be either
set<00:03:45.489> four<00:03:45.819> volts<00:03:46.209> or<00:03:46.450> amps<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.079> by<00:03:47.980> choosing

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
set four volts or amps so by choosing

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.430 
set four volts or amps so by choosing

so<00:04:01.670> we're<00:04:01.850> going<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.000> go<00:04:02.150> over<00:04:02.360> here<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.840> go<00:04:03.050> to

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
so we're going to go over here and go to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.770 
so we're going to go over here and go to

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
this and I want to go down here to read

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:46.420 
this and I want to go down here to read
low<00:04:38.930> ants<00:04:41.950> ten<00:04:42.950> ants<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:45.260> now<00:04:45.440> I've<00:04:45.650> got<00:04:45.919> the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
low ants ten ants so now I've got the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.530 
low ants ten ants so now I've got the
red<00:04:46.700> trace<00:04:47.030> set<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.810> read<00:04:48.020> ants<00:04:49.150> now<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
red trace set to read ants now the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.380 
red trace set to read ants now the
vehicle<00:04:50.720> is<00:04:51.050> off<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.860> key<00:04:52.100> is<00:04:52.310> off<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.210> you

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
vehicle is off the key is off and you

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.760 
vehicle is off the key is off and you
can<00:04:53.570> still<00:04:53.840> see<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.230> we're<00:04:54.380> reading<00:04:54.590> the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
can still see that we're reading the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.909 
can still see that we're reading the
fuel<00:04:55.010> pump<00:04:55.280> now<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:55.940> reason<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.390> is<00:04:56.919> because

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
fuel pump now the reason that is because

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.890 
fuel pump now the reason that is because
when<00:04:58.070> we<00:04:58.250> pulled<00:04:58.520> out<00:04:58.730> this<00:04:58.940> relay<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.720> put

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
when we pulled out this relay and put

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.600 
when we pulled out this relay and put
our<00:05:00.020> substitute<00:05:00.530> relay<00:05:00.919> in<00:05:01.100> there<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.580> put

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
our substitute relay in there and I put

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.030 
our substitute relay in there and I put
my<00:05:01.940> pins<00:05:02.240> in<00:05:02.540> to<00:05:02.750> duplicate<00:05:03.230> these<00:05:03.440> wires<00:05:03.740> when

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
my pins in to duplicate these wires when

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.310 
my pins in to duplicate these wires when
I<00:05:04.070> was<00:05:04.250> basically<00:05:04.700> doing<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.150> just<00:05:05.419> jump<00:05:06.140> ring

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
I was basically doing is just jump ring

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.830 
I was basically doing is just jump ring
this<00:05:06.470> relay<00:05:06.979> so<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.030> fuel<00:05:08.240> pump<00:05:08.479> is<00:05:08.600> actually

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
this relay so the fuel pump is actually

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.460 
this relay so the fuel pump is actually
running<00:05:09.410> because<00:05:09.560> I've<00:05:09.860> got<00:05:10.070> a<00:05:10.100> jumper<00:05:11.470> you

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
running because I've got a jumper you

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.560 
running because I've got a jumper you
don't<00:05:12.620> see<00:05:12.830> anything<00:05:12.979> on<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.520> crank<00:05:14.210> or<00:05:14.360> can

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
don't see anything on the crank or can

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.320 
don't see anything on the crank or can
because<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.260> vehicle<00:05:15.680> is<00:05:15.740> not<00:05:15.860> running<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:16.430> so

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
because the vehicle is not running in so

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:26.159 
because the vehicle is not running in so
now<00:05:17.450> let's<00:05:17.690> start<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.110> car

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.659 

now<00:05:27.169> you<00:05:27.230> can<00:05:27.440> see<00:05:27.620> we're<00:05:27.770> reading<00:05:28.130> all<00:05:28.310> three

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
now you can see we're reading all three

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.879 
now you can see we're reading all three
we're<00:05:29.270> reading<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.720> fuel<00:05:29.990> pump<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:30.800> if

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
we're reading the fuel pump and if

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.650 
we're reading the fuel pump and if
you're<00:05:31.070> familiar<00:05:31.280> with<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.730> fuel<00:05:32.000> pump<00:05:32.270> it<00:05:32.510> is

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
you're familiar with the fuel pump it is

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.659 
you're familiar with the fuel pump it is
a<00:05:32.780> good-looking<00:05:33.020> electrical<00:05:33.949> diagram<00:05:34.430> on<00:05:34.639> a

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
a good-looking electrical diagram on a

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.500 
a good-looking electrical diagram on a
fuel<00:05:34.970> pump

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
fuel pump

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.719 
fuel pump
now<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:36.260> crank<00:05:36.650> in<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.860> camp<00:05:37.160> sensor<00:05:37.550> should

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
now the crank in the camp sensor should

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.570 
now the crank in the camp sensor should
be<00:05:37.910> square<00:05:38.240> waves<00:05:38.540> you<00:05:39.290> can<00:05:39.350> see<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.830> crank

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
be square waves you can see the crank

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.719 
be square waves you can see the crank
sensor<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:41.120> is<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.360> square<00:05:41.660> wave<00:05:41.900> now<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:42.949> green

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
sensor it is a square wave now the green

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.460 
sensor it is a square wave now the green
one<00:05:43.970> which<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.449> cam<00:05:44.690> all<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:45.110> can<00:05:45.260> see<00:05:45.440> is

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
one which is the cam all you can see is

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.090 
one which is the cam all you can see is
going

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
going

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.690 
going
damn<00:05:46.400> because<00:05:47.270> of<00:05:47.420> the<00:05:47.540> sweet<00:05:47.840> patter<00:05:48.700> now

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
damn because of the sweet patter now

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.090 
damn because of the sweet patter now
that<00:05:49.940> this<00:05:50.120> set<00:05:50.360> on<00:05:50.510> 10<00:05:50.810> milliseconds<00:05:51.590> because

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
that this set on 10 milliseconds because

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.530 
that this set on 10 milliseconds because
that's<00:05:52.520> what<00:05:52.700> I<00:05:52.730> want<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.060> look<00:05:53.210> forward<00:05:53.420> to

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
that's what I want to look forward to

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.530 
that's what I want to look forward to
peel<00:05:54.100> but<00:05:55.100> 10<00:05:55.310> milliseconds<00:05:56.120> does<00:05:56.330> not

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
peel but 10 milliseconds does not

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.750 
peel but 10 milliseconds does not
give<00:05:56.780> me<00:05:56.960> enough<00:05:57.290> from<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.620> sweet<00:05:57.860> pattern<00:05:58.340> to

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
give me enough from the sweet pattern to

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.790 
give me enough from the sweet pattern to
be<00:05:58.880> able<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.120> look<00:05:59.270> at<00:05:59.450> this<00:05:59.540> cam<00:05:59.840> sister<00:06:00.320> you

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
be able to look at this cam sister you

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.470 
be able to look at this cam sister you
can<00:06:00.950> see<00:06:01.130> it<00:06:01.220> going<00:06:01.370> up<00:06:01.610> and<00:06:01.760> down<00:06:01.970> but<00:06:02.180> I<00:06:02.240> can't

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
can see it going up and down but I can't

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.390 
can see it going up and down but I can't
see<00:06:02.720> it<00:06:02.870> so<00:06:03.110> I'm<00:06:03.710> going<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:03.890> go<00:06:04.010> back<00:06:04.190> up<00:06:04.220> here

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
see it so I'm going to go back up here

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.460 
see it so I'm going to go back up here
to<00:06:04.670> set<00:06:04.910> up<00:06:05.410> and<00:06:06.410> I'm<00:06:06.560> gonna<00:06:06.710> tame<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.250> sweet

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
to set up and I'm gonna tame the sweet

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.020 
to set up and I'm gonna tame the sweet
from<00:06:09.470> the<00:06:09.530> 10<00:06:09.860> milliseconds<00:06:10.550> where<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:10.760> had<00:06:11.000> it

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
from the 10 milliseconds where I had it

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.360 
from the 10 milliseconds where I had it
for<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.360> fuel<00:06:11.570> pump<00:06:11.840> I'm<00:06:12.350> gonna<00:06:12.620> go<00:06:12.830> up<00:06:12.890> 200

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
for the fuel pump I'm gonna go up 200

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.270 
for the fuel pump I'm gonna go up 200
milliseconds

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.890 

you<00:06:18.520> can<00:06:18.700> see<00:06:18.850> what<00:06:19.000> fuel<00:06:19.240> pump<00:06:19.480> is<00:06:19.660> still

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
you can see what fuel pump is still

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.900 
you can see what fuel pump is still
there<00:06:20.260> but<00:06:20.889> I'm<00:06:21.040> looking<00:06:21.400> at<00:06:21.550> a<00:06:21.580> hundred

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
there but I'm looking at a hundred

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.760 
there but I'm looking at a hundred
milliseconds<00:06:22.780> worth<00:06:22.990> of<00:06:23.170> it<00:06:23.320> rather<00:06:23.530> than

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
milliseconds worth of it rather than

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.070 
milliseconds worth of it rather than
just<00:06:23.830> ten<00:06:24.250> milliseconds<00:06:24.940> but<00:06:25.570> I've<00:06:25.720> already

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
just ten milliseconds but I've already

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.830 
just ten milliseconds but I've already
confirmed<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.950> it<00:06:27.250> looks<00:06:27.490> good<00:06:27.760> now<00:06:28.090> this

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
confirmed that it looks good now this

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.240 
confirmed that it looks good now this
way<00:06:29.050> I'm<00:06:29.200> just<00:06:29.230> gonna<00:06:29.530> see<00:06:29.800> if<00:06:29.830> there's<00:06:30.100> any

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
way I'm just gonna see if there's any

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.120 
way I'm just gonna see if there's any
dropouts<00:06:30.790> and<00:06:31.230> now<00:06:32.230> you<00:06:32.290> can<00:06:32.560> see<00:06:32.710> the<00:06:32.860> camp

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
dropouts and now you can see the camp

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.350 
dropouts and now you can see the camp
rate<00:06:33.430> sensor<00:06:33.960> located<00:06:34.960> on<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:35.350> yellow<00:06:35.560> trace

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
rate sensor located on the yellow trace

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.210 
rate sensor located on the yellow trace
and<00:06:37.360> you<00:06:37.480> can<00:06:37.660> see<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:37.900> camp<00:06:38.169> system<00:06:38.440> they

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
and you can see the camp system they

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.640 
and you can see the camp system they
still<00:06:39.550> can't<00:06:39.790> see<00:06:40.060> the<00:06:40.090> pull<00:06:40.419> cam<00:06:40.810> sensor<00:06:41.200> and

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
still can't see the pull cam sensor and

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.250 
still can't see the pull cam sensor and
idle<00:06:42.060> so<00:06:43.060> this<00:06:43.270> will<00:06:43.419> take<00:06:43.570> a<00:06:43.630> better<00:06:43.900> look<00:06:43.990> at

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
idle so this will take a better look at

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.710 
idle so this will take a better look at
that<00:06:44.700> I'm<00:06:45.700> going<00:06:45.910> to<00:06:46.000> go<00:06:46.090> through<00:06:46.330> my<00:06:46.419> sweep

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
that I'm going to go through my sweep

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.480 
that I'm going to go through my sweep
again

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.430 

and<00:06:53.940> now<00:06:54.060> you<00:06:54.120> can<00:06:54.360> see<00:06:54.539> the<00:06:54.690> square<00:06:54.990> wave<00:06:55.199> now

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
and now you can see the square wave now

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.840 
and now you can see the square wave now
if<00:06:55.590> I<00:06:55.710> stop<00:06:56.039> this<00:06:58.220> now<00:06:59.220> if<00:06:59.340> you<00:06:59.430> look<00:06:59.610> at<00:06:59.729> the

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
if I stop this now if you look at the

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.270 
if I stop this now if you look at the
cam<00:07:00.060> sensor<00:07:00.360> signal<00:07:00.930> you<00:07:01.800> can<00:07:01.949> see<00:07:02.069> it<00:07:02.130> right

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
cam sensor signal you can see it right

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.640 
cam sensor signal you can see it right
over<00:07:02.550> here<00:07:02.759> it's<00:07:02.910> on<00:07:03.060> we<00:07:03.330> have<00:07:03.449> a<00:07:03.479> clean<00:07:03.780> off<00:07:04.110> it

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
over here it's on we have a clean off it

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.770 
over here it's on we have a clean off it
stays<00:07:04.949> off<00:07:05.220> they've<00:07:06.030> done<00:07:06.240> this<00:07:06.330> back<00:07:06.539> long

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
stays off they've done this back long

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.529 
stays off they've done this back long
that<00:07:07.560> is<00:07:07.680> good<00:07:07.830> square<00:07:08.190> wave<00:07:08.460> now<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.270> same

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
that is good square wave now the same

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.439 
that is good square wave now the same
thing<00:07:09.840> with<00:07:10.080> our<00:07:10.259> cranks<00:07:11.160> at<00:07:11.520> four<00:07:11.759> four<00:07:12.120> four

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:12.449 
thing with our cranks at four four four

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:17.990 
thing with our cranks at four four four
four<00:07:12.810> four<00:07:12.990> it<00:07:13.590> looks<00:07:13.620> good<00:07:14.900> in<00:07:15.900> there<00:07:17.000> so

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
four four it looks good in there so

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.120 
four four it looks good in there so
using<00:07:18.479> a<00:07:18.569> lab<00:07:18.780> scope<00:07:19.139> can<00:07:19.380> really<00:07:19.740> tell<00:07:19.949> you<00:07:19.979> a

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
using a lab scope can really tell you a

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.309 
using a lab scope can really tell you a
lot<00:07:20.280> they're<00:07:20.970> tremendously<00:07:21.539> valuable<00:07:21.840> and

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 
lot they're tremendously valuable and

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.469

variable but you do have to know how to

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.779 
variable but you do have to know how to
set<00:07:24.810> it<00:07:24.840> up<00:07:25.080> so<00:07:25.440> that<00:07:25.470> will<00:07:25.919> tell<00:07:26.130> you<00:07:26.370> what<00:07:26.610> you
