00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 the spelling checker of the cell phone I do not 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.120
 I know nobody knows no one who 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.919
 I already told you what I like best 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.620
 broker on iphone is who does not fix 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.150
 only buried soon all the words 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.160
 It's really fun, it 's cool, you are. 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 arriving makes me super series are 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.609
 changing all 70's time from who 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
 changes again is pretty cool this broker 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.449
 It's very good, man. Help me out there. Not this. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.150
 nobody says everybody hates this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.500
 broker but because it has a certain date and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.130
 substitute another have nothing 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 subject matter 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:38.399
 this to the direction of the holy house also 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 I think this broker is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.329
 it may be their mistake to have this 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.829
 is a situation I do not know if the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.850
 next I do not know if the donation of who made 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 the program is not thinking about what it is 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.170
 self correcting swapping speak only word 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.910
 so absurd then just the dirty talk 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.379
 internally making the battery ends up being 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 in an hour it ends on tv 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 s directory all the time every hour 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:11.729
 the whole state is over thousands is a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:13.320
 situation of your cell phone to understand this 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.909
 story of stressing with the broker 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.030
 the next you can take 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.880
 he pick up the cell phone you will not 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.320
 if you stress more then it is on 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.820
 that problem solved 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.439

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 funny story about it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.740

 apple that go to change รณ that in adjustments 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:47.340
 in the fits you go in general 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.459

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.069
