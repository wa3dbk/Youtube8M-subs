hi<00:00:00.989> I'm<00:00:01.319> Kendall<00:00:01.680> Roberg<00:00:01.740> and<00:00:02.129> today<00:00:02.220> we're

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hi I'm Kendall Roberg and today we're

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.170 
hi I'm Kendall Roberg and today we're
going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.090> apply<00:00:03.380> complex<00:00:04.380> numbers<00:00:04.859> now<00:00:05.790> this

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
going to apply complex numbers now this

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.080 
going to apply complex numbers now this
may<00:00:06.420> look<00:00:06.450> like<00:00:06.720> an<00:00:07.140> ordinary<00:00:08.090> coordinate

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
may look like an ordinary coordinate

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.320 
may look like an ordinary coordinate
plane<00:00:09.420> but<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.200> not<00:00:10.590> let<00:00:11.309> me<00:00:11.400> label<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.880> axes

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
plane but it's not let me label the axes

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.629 
plane but it's not let me label the axes
and<00:00:12.630> you'll<00:00:12.809> see<00:00:12.990> why<00:00:13.259> we're<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> label

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and you'll see why we're going to label

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.279 
and you'll see why we're going to label
this<00:00:14.880> one<00:00:15.179> which<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.690> normally<00:00:15.839> call<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this one which we normally call the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.500 
this one which we normally call the
x-axis<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.699> real<00:00:18.240> axis<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.890> up<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.390> we

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
x-axis the real axis and up here what we

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390 
x-axis the real axis and up here what we
normally<00:00:21.630> call<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.260> y-axis<00:00:22.949> we're<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
normally call the y-axis we're going to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.830 
normally call the y-axis we're going to
label<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.199> imaginary<00:00:25.199> axis<00:00:29.539> now<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.720> we

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
label it the imaginary axis now when we

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.690 
label it the imaginary axis now when we
encounter<00:00:31.320> complex<00:00:31.500> numbers<00:00:32.309> they're

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
encounter complex numbers they're

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.180 
encounter complex numbers they're
usually<00:00:33.149> written<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.510> standard<00:00:33.809> form<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
usually written in standard form that is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.619 
usually written in standard form that is
a<00:00:35.460> plus<00:00:36.210> bi<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.710> call<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.790> real<00:00:39.090> part<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
a plus bi and we call a the real part of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.610 
a plus bi and we call a the real part of
the<00:00:39.840> complex<00:00:40.079> number<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.260> we<00:00:43.260> call<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the complex number and we call the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.000 
the complex number and we call the
coefficient<00:00:43.829> B<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.149> imaginary<00:00:45.960> part<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
coefficient B the imaginary part of the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.330 
coefficient B the imaginary part of the
complex<00:00:47.039> number

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.730 

now<00:00:54.940> we're<00:00:55.180> ready<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.540> plot<00:00:55.810> some<00:00:56.200> complex

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
now we're ready to plot some complex

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.480 
now we're ready to plot some complex
numbers<00:00:57.160> we'll<00:00:57.880> start<00:00:58.150> with<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.330> pink<00:00:58.900> one

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
numbers we'll start with a pink one

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.450 
numbers we'll start with a pink one
we're<00:01:00.490> gonna<00:01:00.580> apply<00:01:00.850> 2<00:01:01.770> plus<00:01:03.090> 3i<00:01:05.040> now<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.100> real

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
we're gonna apply 2 plus 3i now the real

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.110 
we're gonna apply 2 plus 3i now the real
part<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:07.090> 2<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.440> imaginary<00:01:09.100> part<00:01:09.490> is<00:01:09.700> 3

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
part is 2 and the imaginary part is 3

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.440 
part is 2 and the imaginary part is 3
that<00:01:10.750> means<00:01:11.080> we<00:01:11.470> plot<00:01:11.830> this<00:01:12.130> complex<00:01:12.970> number

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
that means we plot this complex number

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.400 
that means we plot this complex number
by<00:01:13.870> going<00:01:14.230> over<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:15.220> on<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.760> real<00:01:15.970> axis<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.810> up

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
by going over to on the real axis and up

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.090 
by going over to on the real axis and up
3<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.790> imaginary<00:01:19.360> axis<00:01:19.510> so<00:01:20.290> this<00:01:20.620> complex

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
3 on the imaginary axis so this complex

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.810 
3 on the imaginary axis so this complex
number<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.850> right<00:01:22.210> there<00:01:23.460> let's<00:01:24.460> try<00:01:24.610> another

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
number is right there let's try another

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.840 
number is right there let's try another
one<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.330> do<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.200> in<00:01:26.320> green<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.800> time<00:01:27.100> how

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
one and do it in green this time how

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.870 
one and do it in green this time how
about<00:01:28.030> negative<00:01:28.840> 3<00:01:29.790> plus<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.490> real

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
about negative 3 plus I now the real

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.320 
about negative 3 plus I now the real
part<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.510> negative<00:01:34.540> 3<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:36.550> imaginary

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
part is negative 3 and the imaginary

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.520 
part is negative 3 and the imaginary
part<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.890> coefficient<00:01:39.640> 1<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:41.170> let's<00:01:41.380> go

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
part is the coefficient 1 so let's go

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.780 
part is the coefficient 1 so let's go
over<00:01:42.070> 3<00:01:42.369> on<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.670> real<00:01:42.820> axis<00:01:43.090> 1<00:01:43.660> 2<00:01:44.050> 3<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.830> up<00:01:45.460> 1

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
over 3 on the real axis 1 2 3 and up 1

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.900 
over 3 on the real axis 1 2 3 and up 1
on<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.270> imaginary<00:01:46.780> axis<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.860> this<00:01:48.190> complex

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
on the imaginary axis so this complex

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.010 
on the imaginary axis so this complex
number<00:01:49.330> is<00:01:49.720> right<00:01:50.080> there<00:01:51.570> let's<00:01:52.570> do<00:01:52.750> one<00:01:52.990> more

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
number is right there let's do one more

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:02.340 
number is right there let's do one more
in<00:01:53.500> orange<00:01:54.369> how<00:01:55.240> about<00:01:57.750> 3i<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.170> one

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
in orange how about 3i now this one

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.320 
in orange how about 3i now this one
looks<00:02:02.380> like<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:03.039> doesn't<00:02:03.250> have<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.610> real<00:02:03.970> part

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
looks like it doesn't have a real part

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.900 
looks like it doesn't have a real part
but<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.810> does<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:05.830> zero<00:02:06.160> because<00:02:06.729> we

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
but it does it's just zero because we

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.200 
but it does it's just zero because we
could<00:02:07.090> write<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.539> as<00:02:07.600> zero<00:02:08.440> plus<00:02:09.310> 3i<00:02:09.729> and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
could write this as zero plus 3i and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.300 
could write this as zero plus 3i and
then<00:02:10.660> we<00:02:10.780> would<00:02:10.960> see<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.440> real<00:02:11.680> part<00:02:11.980> is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
then we would see that the real part is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.770 
then we would see that the real part is
0<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.420> imaginary<00:02:13.510> part<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.620> 3<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:16.210> we<00:02:16.600> go

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
0 and the imaginary part is 3 so we go

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.190 
0 and the imaginary part is 3 so we go
over<00:02:17.260> 0<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.040> real<00:02:18.220> axis<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.540> 3<00:02:19.900> on

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
over 0 on the real axis and up to 3 on

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.220 
over 0 on the real axis and up to 3 on
the<00:02:20.770> imaginary<00:02:21.340> axis<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.690> complex

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
the imaginary axis so this complex

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.180 
the imaginary axis so this complex
number<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.920> plied<00:02:24.250> right<00:02:24.819> there
