00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
the stadium there's a how many quirks I

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.830 
the stadium there's a how many quirks I
because<00:01:18.010> it's<00:01:18.190> it's<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:18.970> calm<00:01:19.240> today<00:01:19.479> it's<00:01:19.690> not

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
because it's it's so calm today it's not

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.630 
because it's it's so calm today it's not
it's<00:01:19.990> not<00:01:20.080> sure<00:01:20.229> not<00:01:20.440> yeah<00:01:20.710> not<00:01:20.950> as<00:01:21.100> not<00:01:21.460> sure

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
it's not sure not yeah not as not sure

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.610 
it's not sure not yeah not as not sure
an<00:01:21.729> update<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.120> probably<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.540> one<00:01:23.409> of<00:01:23.470> the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
an update it's probably the one of the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.620 
an update it's probably the one of the
hardest<00:01:23.979> things<00:01:24.130> it's<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.580> it's<00:01:25.450> pretty

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
hardest things it's is it's pretty

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.180 
hardest things it's is it's pretty
narrow<00:01:25.900> but<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.260> doesn't<00:01:26.590> seem<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.770> not<00:01:27.040> all

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
narrow but it doesn't seem that not all

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.980 
narrow but it doesn't seem that not all
because<00:01:27.340> obviously<00:01:27.580> you've<00:01:27.880> got<00:01:27.909> this<00:01:28.180> long<00:01:28.930> a

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
because obviously you've got this long a

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.200 
because obviously you've got this long a
run<00:01:29.350> away<00:01:29.469> and<00:01:29.799> so<00:01:30.490> that's<00:01:30.700> probably<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.119> most

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
run away and so that's probably the most

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.719 
run away and so that's probably the most
difficult<00:01:32.110> but<00:01:32.259> hopefully<00:01:33.189> match<00:01:33.460> there

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
difficult but hopefully match there

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.149 
difficult but hopefully match there
there'll<00:01:34.090> be<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.240> subs<00:01:35.079> in<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.439> technical<00:01:36.070> yo

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
there'll be a subs in the technical yo

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.160 
there'll be a subs in the technical yo
and<00:01:36.430> stuff<00:01:36.610> like<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.180> could<00:01:37.930> give<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.140> a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
and stuff like that in could give you a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.770 
and stuff like that in could give you a
bit<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.530> gain<00:01:38.799> ins<00:01:38.979> but<00:01:39.189> no<00:01:39.790> it's<00:01:40.060> it's<00:01:40.600> quite

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
bit of gain ins but no it's it's quite

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.920 
bit of gain ins but no it's it's quite
narrow<00:01:40.990> but<00:01:41.320> there's<00:01:41.500> about<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.909> 30<00:01:43.360> meter<00:01:43.539> run

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
narrow but there's about a 30 meter run

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.170 
narrow but there's about a 30 meter run
away<00:01:44.140> either<00:01:44.530> side<00:01:44.829> so<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.820> would<00:01:45.969> be<00:01:46.090> the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
away either side so it that would be the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.090 
away either side so it that would be the
only<00:01:46.299> difficult<00:01:46.810> thing<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.990> judge<00:01:47.259> so<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.009> you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
only difficult thing a judge so if you

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.590 
only difficult thing a judge so if you
are<00:01:48.189> kicking<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.670> touch<00:01:48.850> them<00:01:49.090> what<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.360> doing
