00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.000
 this cute little guy is here 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 one of many around three 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.920
 million rabbits live in german 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.690
 Households often pampered and spoiled 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.820
 but see you at her happy 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.560
 land owners, they often have a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.560
 agonizing odyssey behind 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 to report to mainz of trade with 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.469
 so-called small animals so with 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.399
 rabbits but also with hamsters and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.770
 Guinea pig 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.530
 this is our first topic for many of you 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.079
 A pet is our heart's desire 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.210
 and also who does not have a dog or 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.160
 a cat wants to grow or can 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 he thinks so fast about one 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 contemporaries to monika differently and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 edgar bewyen have one in common 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.250
 Colleagues from the mirror in the world of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.379
 small animal trade researched and in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.460
 This world is anything but 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.000
 cute to secretly shot recordings 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.520
 animal rights organization peta animals im 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 zoofachhandel presents in cultivated 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.650
 look at cages of the trade promises 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.540
 highest standards of animal welfare yet that is 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.640
 actually like that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.710
 Animal rights activists have about three-quarters 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.330
 year breeding and trade of small animals 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 under the microscope 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.510
 concealed countless sales talks 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.580
 filmed at the market leader fodder house 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.980
 fressnapf and the question where the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.880
 animals come here explaining saleswomen 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.140
 they are from germany 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.280
 They are from a recognized breeder 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 von fressnapf that's because I give it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.640
 give them info in several markets 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.259
 the animal rights activists get this flyer 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 The animals actually all come from 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.350
 this one little breeder how is that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.350
 possible 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 that is the operation he lies south of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.869
 bremen last fall, the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.880
 Animal rights activists filmed here at night 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.400
 Recordings show hamster and above all 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.220
 some birds in confined spaces 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.700
 penned in crammed crates 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 they can hardly straighten up 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 we confront the breeder with the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.350
 Pictures from his company 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.350
 he admits mistakes 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.230
 You can do that but what can it do? 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.269
 then they are themselves say that it is 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.670
 ok if you are your own her 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.370
 their own criticize their own 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.689
 attitude, so to speak a bit now 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.920
 because I know that the animals and those 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.349
 that's why they protect you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.700
 for a maximum of 23 days 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.469
 the animals the two to three days here 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.239
 they stay from somewhere else 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.519
 you want to get that right from one 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.180
 Origin traders have a lot out 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.030
 abroad 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.190
 If you 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.850
 have a certain operating size and 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.950
 since they can not even necessary that amounts 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.520
 because it is only breeding in the small 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.330
 style 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.740
 He is primarily a wholesaler, the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.760
 Documents also show the editorial staff 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.650
 be present 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.310
 in it also hints where the animals 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.750
 actually come here 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.950
 some come from breeders nearby 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.450
 among other things from this old barn 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.950
 when the animal rights activists enter the barn 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.170
 discover hundreds of 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.440
 guinea pig hamster and others 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.570
 rodents decaying in old vats 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.900
 Carcasses lie next to living 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.050
 Creatures are fed rotten 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.940
 bread despite multiple demand were 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.970
 the owners for an opinion not 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.040
 to reach 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.720
 But the documents also show many 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.150
 Animals do not come from Germany at all 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.370
 but from the Netherlands to 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.680
 example from this plant south of 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.120
 amsterdam 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.380
 an animal rights activist not recognized 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.320
 the location wants to be there 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:00.620
 documented later, he tells us his 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:03.230
 impressions we have experienced that there dead 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.930
 animals in the cages with other animals 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.860
 were the ones eaten by the animals 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.019
 were 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.030
 the water supply was not 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.730
 ensured when we get the water 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.440
 you have filled up the animals too 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.700
 overthrown 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.459
 we drive to the Dutch 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.680
 breeder he is even ready and his 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.740
 stall show 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.180
 we also see filthy cages later 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.340
 Let us show you the pictures 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.169
 he wants to remain unrecognized and not 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.479
 to take all allegations 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.760
 Without a camera he is a statement 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.210
 ready and explains he does pro once 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.630
 week clean on the water supply 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.630
 he says 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.780
 how do you have the states in the 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.780
 arrange small animal breeding 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.280
 We ask the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.259
 state commissioner dr cornelia hunter um 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.169
 an appraisal of the extensive 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.580
 pictorial material even your assessment 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.469
 Feel a bit with the 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.150
 Animals can have such relationships 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.889
 not worn one day 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.740
 I would assume that there the 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.120
 the limit of criminal liability is reached and 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.159
 probably in many cases too 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.190
 is exceeded for the veterinary 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.780
 a case for the prosecutor 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.759
 how does that fit into animal welfare 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.449
 standards of dehner fressnapf and 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:26.120
 fodderhouse we ask for dena and 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.430
 fressnapf announce consequences to the 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.560
 requires a complete education and 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.479
 want the further business relations 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.580
 dependent on the suppliers 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.469
 do 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.460
 no small animals more about the 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.460
 refer suppliers 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:45.229
 a spokeswoman for the fodder house is 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:49.339
 commented on an interview ready 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.139
 the research results for us 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.089
 That means, of course, that we from 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.849
 Of course , none of these dealers 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.439
 buy more and generally us 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.809
 really try to be on dealer 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:02.239
 easy to do without and generally only 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:05.360
 limit ourselves to local breeders 

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:08.089
 but animal rights is not enough 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.749
 call for an intervention of politics and 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:10.399
 authorities 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.839
 we clearly demand that 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:13.309
 prosecutors we now 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.589
 have turned on and the bitter 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:17.779
 take finally hear these plants and 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:19.699
 breeders to be closed or 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.839
 in fact, to ensure the animals 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.669
 I think we need 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.529
 Overall, animal welfare is urgently needed 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.659
 pet order then of course 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.330
 this breed would also include where 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:31.159
 minimum standards are set 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.319
 special regulation for the protection of 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.719
 so keep that small 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.879
 Federal government currently not necessary 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.889
 Fact is however the trade with 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.729
 pining is still a gray one 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.729
 Market largely uncontrolled and 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.729
 irregular
