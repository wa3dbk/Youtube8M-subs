and see if I can pull up a fix for this
now<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.380> guys<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.400> iphone

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
now as you guys know if you're on iphone

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.550 
now as you guys know if you're on iphone
3g<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.930> phone<00:01:19.259> mobile<00:01:19.920> phone<00:01:20.280> app<00:01:20.909> just

3g your phone mobile phone app just
deletes<00:01:22.640> now<00:01:23.640> i<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.630> may<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
deletes now i think this may be like a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.899 
deletes now i think this may be like a
problem<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.540> renaming<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.640> names<00:01:29.640> or

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
problem with like renaming of names or

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.179 
problem with like renaming of names or
something<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.720> whatever<00:01:31.560> happened

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
something like that or whatever happened

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.520 
something like that or whatever happened
I<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.400> something<00:01:32.939> over<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> did<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
I think something over I did it and it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.370 
I think something over I did it and it
may<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.220> gotten<00:01:35.310> overrated<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.900> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
may have just gotten overrated now that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.969 
may have just gotten overrated now that
is<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> big<00:01:37.950> issue<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.689> again<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> beta

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
is a big issue but this again is a beta

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.260 
is a big issue but this again is a beta
jailbreak<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.850> mostly<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.450> developers

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
jailbreak and it's mostly for developers

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.510 
jailbreak and it's mostly for developers
over<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:46.020> open<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.350> cydia<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:47.280> does

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
over here if we open up cydia it does

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.359 
over here if we open up cydia it does
open<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.780> gives<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.590> server

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
open up but it gives you like a server

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.780 
open up but it gives you like a server
problem<00:01:50.490> could<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.210> open<00:01:51.420> blah<00:01:52.140> blah<00:01:52.380> blah

problem could not open blah blah blah

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.880 
problem could not open blah blah blah
yeah<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> issues<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
yeah that's one of the issues so it

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.510 
yeah that's one of the issues so it
doesn't<00:01:59.430> exactly<00:01:59.759> load<00:02:00.649> you'll<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.950> much<00:02:02.189> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
doesn't exactly load you'll have much in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.510 
doesn't exactly load you'll have much in
