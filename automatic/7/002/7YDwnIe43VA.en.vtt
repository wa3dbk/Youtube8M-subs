00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello everyone decided shorter today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.069
 soak the knife handles for that to me 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.280
 will need such a jar 700 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.500
 gram 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 see she is full 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.949
 natural varnish means it will be 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.320
 stand on here is such a cloth that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.240
 will be at the bottom of the pan in 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.820
 the pan will be fine but I think everyone 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.219
 understandable it will be a water bath no one 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 secret let's say this also for me 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.450
 need for impregnation 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.120
 me here is the members of the wax which I 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.559
 knowingly soaked the jar still hot 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:49.680
 didn't even read sorry melted was 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.250
 I have it here in such a state good 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.750
 My grandfather is a beekeeper, so I have no 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.750
 labor was not to find 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 bridge in general now I will fill 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.310
 pan with water to include blades at 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.130
 I'm in the freezer now 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.270
 Remained an answer for an hour in general 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.380
 principle 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.560
 doing this in order to air in the pores 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.950
 the tree shrank when cooled and when 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.360
 ingested in warm oil with this oil 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:36.700
 substituted sugar providing deeper 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.720
 that was soaked well, so I read the camera 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.070
 in technology 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.840
 impregnation of wooden products therefore 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.090
 Now I will put this whole thing on 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.550
 fire well fill natural growth 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.380
 add guilt 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:00.039
 the composition of the oil well, and when heated perch 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.590
 where blades so here so let's 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.409
 connect try this thing well 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.740
 I'll show you later what's next for me 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.740
 will turn out 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.460
 in short, that's how it looks 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.290
 generally got knives here they 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.880
 still 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.170
 residues freeze well and principle 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.140
 brain flooded there 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.410
 I will add that I think they must 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.410
 It was 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.090
 it was possible to dissolve the wax separately 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.200
 make and straight 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.610
 in oil in general dipping 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.610
 there your handle 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.000
 1 and 2 it is also a frozen one 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.960
 mou pereborchivy still oil 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.170
 for now I will disconnect 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.090
 in general on 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.490
 pour a little 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.300
 Well 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.980
 I 'll turn on already 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.110
 I'll show you what I would do next 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.550
 pours and stream 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.770
 excess oil 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.770
 I do not continue the process in general 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:27.780
 impregnation as you can see is plentiful 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.960
 air release of wood or 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.150
 wooden part of the handle 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.190
 so I will continue on a small fire 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.080
 even without fire in order not to harm 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.900
 wood in principle epoxy also like 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.720
 known doesn't like high temperatures 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.189
 so I can maybe even clean st 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.129
 fire for this whole thing 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:57.489
 gradually cooled 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.650
 Well, and then again, in general, throw 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.200
 temperature well and stuff like that 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.700
 for two or three hours I will 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.860
 that's it 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.450
 and do try again 3 not 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.450
 raise the temperature of the oil 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.150
 the most normal optimum temperature 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.920
 for these procedures it is 60 70 degrees 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.290
 maximum 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.870
 so here so here in general that while 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.580
 will continue 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.820
 people will not continue to leave everything 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.820
 until 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.250
 soak on later already think through 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.520
 two hours 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.810
 I'll hide I'll show you my principle 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.530
 turns out and drank it turned out 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.530
 so here so here 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.569
 More than two hours have passed 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:01.159
 not even two and a half 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.909
 did not turn off after all the fire left 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.539
 burns slowly 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:09.529
 Well, under my strict supervision of all this 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:16.059
 the matter was kept at the temperature I needed 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:18.679
 Oil, in general, I have not yet taken out 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:23.080
 now I will take out the first time therefore 

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:26.080
 let us see that in principle, and so 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 happened 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.090
 I tell you the shaft 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:41.700
 That is now not what happens this 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:47.180
 saturated color 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:54.230
 Yes, I think the result is normal for good reason I 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.230
 spent time and 2 blades 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.600
 yes not bad not bad not bad 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.440
 chic 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:14.910
 so well, in general, in short, I turn off all 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:18.270
 this business and leave until the morning to all 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.880
 it was cooling right down in a jar 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.230
 this is half past nine now 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.750
 in the morning I have it all already 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:28.700
 well , I'll leave it in the sun to dry 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.420
 dry out 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:36.590
 so something like that in general again 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.590
 show really 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.680
 honestly in my very not even bad 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:53.160
 impregnation in gives deep once more 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:58.700
 I repeat the saturated color well, in general, as 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:01.700
 so well everyone thanks for watching everyone 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.700
 until
