00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
turns out

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.600 
turns out
alright<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.550> base<00:00:50.730> number<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.329> got<00:00:51.360> ckf

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
alright so base number one we got ckf

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
alright so base number one we got ckf
1972<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.480> looks<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.020> his<00:00:55.230> base<00:00:55.440> most

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
1972 and it looks like on his base most
of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> air<00:00:56.219> defense<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.910> outside<00:00:57.449> so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to drop my balloons and once I knew that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.749 
to drop my balloons and once I knew that
was<00:01:52.350> happening<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:52.890> pretty<00:01:53.189> much<00:01:53.340> good<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
was happening it was pretty much good to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.370 
was happening it was pretty much good to
go<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> rest<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> raid<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.780> that's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
go for the rest of the raid so that's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.870 
go for the rest of the raid so that's
gonna<00:01:55.500> wrap<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.890> he's<00:01:56.040> outta<00:01:56.189> defenses<00:01:56.700> no

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
gonna wrap it up he's outta defenses no

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
gonna wrap it up he's outta defenses no
no<00:01:57.270> builder<00:01:57.719> sets<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> top<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.560> left<00:01:58.740> her

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
no builder sets on the top or left her

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.950 
no builder sets on the top or left her
bottom<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.909> overall<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.270> pretty<00:02:00.420> simple<00:02:00.750> raid

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
bottom so overall a pretty simple raid

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920 
bottom so overall a pretty simple raid
and<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.290> were<00:02:01.380> able<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.649> steal<00:02:01.890> 26<00:02:02.399> trophies<00:02:02.930> so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and we were able to steal 26 trophies so

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.179 
and we were able to steal 26 trophies so
let's<00:02:04.110> go<00:02:04.200> ahead<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.530> another<00:02:04.770> raid<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
let's go ahead and do another raid I

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.440 
let's go ahead and do another raid I
think<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.520> gonna<00:02:05.610> use<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.939> same<00:02:06.119> exact

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
think I'm gonna use the same exact

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.809 
think I'm gonna use the same exact
strategy<00:02:06.899> as<00:02:07.049> last<00:02:07.350> time<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.860> looking<00:02:08.670> at

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
strategy as last time and looking at

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.880 
strategy as last time and looking at
this<00:02:09.030> guy's<00:02:09.270> base<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.929> looks<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.289> he<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.679> his

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
this guy's base it looks like he has his

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.920 
this guy's base it looks like he has his
air<00:02:11.039> defense<00:02:11.340> pretty<00:02:11.640> much<00:02:11.790> exposed<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.510> then

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
air defense pretty much exposed and then

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.880 
air defense pretty much exposed and then
the<00:02:12.989> Archer<00:02:13.290> tower<00:02:13.319> shouldn't

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the Archer tower shouldn't

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.950 
the Archer tower shouldn't
too<00:02:14.040> bad<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.610> my<00:02:14.940> first<00:02:15.240> goal<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:15.660> gonna<00:02:15.810> drop

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
too bad so my first goal I'm gonna drop

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.360 
too bad so my first goal I'm gonna drop
my<00:02:16.020> archers<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.620> take<00:02:16.770> care<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:16.980> these<00:02:17.130> free

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370

my archers to take care of these free
buildings<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.940> then<00:02:18.630> after<00:02:18.990> I've<00:02:19.080> done<00:02:19.319> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

so<00:03:18.690> pretty<00:03:18.959> easy<00:03:19.110> raid<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.709> after<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.040> was

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
so pretty easy raid and after that was

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.430 
so pretty easy raid and after that was
done<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.549> got<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.090> hundred<00:03:21.360> percent<00:03:21.630> ice

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
done we got that hundred percent ice

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.050 
done we got that hundred percent ice
wrapping<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.860> up<00:03:22.920> we<00:03:23.040> got<00:03:23.070> 23<00:03:23.579> trophies<00:03:23.880> not

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
wrapping it up we got 23 trophies not

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.520 
wrapping it up we got 23 trophies not
too<00:03:24.209> bad<00:03:24.360> I'm<00:03:24.570> not<00:03:24.600> really<00:03:24.810> looking<00:03:25.049> at<00:03:25.290> loot

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
too bad I'm not really looking at loot

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.620 
too bad I'm not really looking at loot
but<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.799> guess<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.220> got<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.549> 45,000<00:03:27.540> and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
but I guess I got like 45,000 and

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.539 
but I guess I got like 45,000 and
resources<00:03:28.590> there<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.040> guess<00:03:29.280> that's<00:03:29.400> not

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
resources there so I guess that's not

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.890 
resources there so I guess that's not
too<00:03:29.730> shabby<00:03:29.760> let's<00:03:30.239> go<00:03:30.329> ahead<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.570> move<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
too shabby let's go ahead and move on to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.960 
too shabby let's go ahead and move on to
the<00:03:30.989> next<00:03:31.140> raid<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.489> final<00:03:32.820> raid<00:03:32.940> I

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the next raid so for the final raid I

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.640 
the next raid so for the final raid I
thought<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.329> would<00:03:33.540> do<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.810> old<00:03:34.019> barbarian

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
thought I would do the old barbarian

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.500 
thought I would do the old barbarian
Archer<00:03:34.829> strategy<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:35.940> honest<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.329> can

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
Archer strategy and to be honest you can

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.840 
Archer strategy and to be honest you can
use<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:36.810> at<00:03:36.989> almost<00:03:37.260> any<00:03:37.470> level<00:03:37.850> whenever

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
use this at almost any level whenever

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.310 
use this at almost any level whenever
someone<00:03:39.150> has<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.450> their<00:03:39.570> mines<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.019> pumps

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
someone has like their mines and pumps

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.870 
someone has like their mines and pumps
that<00:03:40.440> are<00:03:40.500> full<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:41.040> can<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.489> drop<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.670> bunch

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
that are full you can just drop a bunch

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.430
