 why 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:56.000
 I would like to introduce what is called the Problem Solving and is Well for the time being in this I do When you have 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.610
 Well then how to hold 8 like this 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.720

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.910
 I already have this kind of feeling It 's all right in my own easy way 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.910
 First of all 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.710
 1 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.310
 2 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.329
 The 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.119
 A little 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.109
 What 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.190
 2 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.960
 But yes a little Film 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.810
 Well, 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:48.390
 And I'll out this way to hold here 9 block mouse at the time of this front is 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.220
 I'm turning it with my finger 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.420
 I will return to the present form 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.420
 This com day 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.900
 What 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.900
 Four 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.730
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.000
 I think I think it's about how to beat it 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.000
 Yes 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:20.790
 How to make shape now 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.020
 You can go back if you follow the reverse procedure, but it 's true no matter how you turn it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.280
 It's Back In 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:33.060
 The reverse procedure is the procedure to be done next time 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.660
 So please watch the following part 6 videos because I think the videos will be up at the same time 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.790
 How to turn you're doing in there 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:45.850
 If it is done in this state, it will become the present form, so how to turn it next time 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:50.260
 I'm going to do it in the state of the issue and I'll tell you more about it next time 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:54.650
 This is now in the fact that I would like to explain this to make way 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.110
 Story the way only will the end to do with Yes how to hold claudication 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.960
 You may ask me to do whatever you like but yes 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.200
 1 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.200
 2 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.849
 What do 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:26.740
 8 yes the same 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:29.100
 Oh, and this is the knack to learn how to turn it and still look at the color of this uniform noodles after all 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.940
 That little one by one 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.310
 Once you have this first it looks like I aligned here 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.230
 Go down 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.970
 We three are aligned in the home at the time before this who say that doing this is not it there to here 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.569
 you know 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.959
 When I did it four times, I said I'd bring this up 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:56.110
 Is not it do what its Once you this yellow 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:04:00.440
 I'll bring it down below, I 'll tell you it's here now and it's here now 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.930
 I like chasing Well solo chest and glove with it to the top 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.989
 If you pay attention to the color 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:13.440
 Is it easy to squeeze ? 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:17.010
 When the rest is still can how to turn the sounds rhythm another rhythm four child 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.320
 It arbitrarily hand will move Yes movement 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:27.840
 Any of the procedures are the same, but I really do not really do it once 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:31.139
 It is strange to move, but it is better not to try to learn in that day 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.110
 That knack and Neyamaa 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:41.150
 I remember I say it will be difficult to forget 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.950
 Well together with study Rubik's cube for yes 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:50.790
 It is cross-shaped part 5 of Oe rail way 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:57.240
 And next time I want to do the shape of this child here 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:00.620
 Well at this time I would like to explain how to make it again. 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.620
 Let's do a rule cube
