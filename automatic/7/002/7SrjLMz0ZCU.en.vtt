00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
and it just was too gold and yellow

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.560

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and not put toner in it since so it was

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.260

over<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.060> got<00:02:29.600> an<00:02:29.960> extra<00:02:30.320> small<00:02:30.710> as<00:02:30.920> well

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
over it and I got an extra small as well

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.180 
over it and I got an extra small as well
just<00:02:31.460> because<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.810> pictures<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.770> was<00:02:34.130> a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
just because in the pictures it was a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.270 
just because in the pictures it was a
lot<00:02:34.640> more<00:02:34.670> boxy<00:02:35.450> looking<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:36.770> that's<00:02:37.130> why

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
lot more boxy looking and so that's why

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.860 
lot more boxy looking and so that's why
I've<00:02:37.370> got<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.640> extra<00:02:38.000> small<00:02:38.120> thinking<00:02:38.690> that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
I've got the extra small thinking that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.320 
I've got the extra small thinking that
it<00:02:38.990> would<00:02:39.080> be<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.500> looser<00:02:40.310> type<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.820> fit<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:41.210> it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
it would be a looser type of fit but it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.660 
it would be a looser type of fit but it
actually<00:02:41.480> ended<00:02:41.930> up<00:02:42.050> being<00:02:42.110> quite<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.130> tight

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
actually ended up being quite a tight

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.420 
actually ended up being quite a tight
fit<00:02:44.000> especially<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.200> haka<00:02:45.380> area<00:02:45.890> it

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
fit especially like in the haka area it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.480 
fit especially like in the haka area it
does<00:02:46.730> um<00:02:47.470> put<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> flare<00:02:48.830> out<00:02:48.860> at<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.310> bottom

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
does um put a flare out at the bottom

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.640 
does um put a flare out at the bottom
and<00:02:49.730> get<00:02:49.850> looser<00:02:50.270> but<00:02:50.510> some<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.050> would<00:02:51.560> have

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
and get looser but some I would have

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.850 
and get looser but some I would have
liked<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.280> be<00:02:52.370> more<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.880> boxy<00:02:53.480> or<00:02:53.510> cut

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
liked this to be more of a boxy or cut

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.470 
liked this to be more of a boxy or cut
but<00:02:54.860> what<00:02:55.070> I'm<00:02:55.250> going<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.640> how<00:02:56.150> I'm<00:02:56.210> going<00:02:56.360> to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
but what I'm going to how I'm going to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.280 
but what I'm going to how I'm going to
style<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.850> wearing<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.660> sort<00:03:00.200> of

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.710 
I can't even model it for you guys it is
really<00:03:45.890> really<00:03:46.010> small<00:03:46.400> particularly<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.390> the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
really really small particularly in the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.230 
really really small particularly in the
sort<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.200> boob<00:03:48.620> area<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.580> don't<00:03:49.820> usually<00:03:49.940> have<00:03:50.120> a

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
sort of boob area I don't usually have a

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.510 
sort of boob area I don't usually have a
problem<00:03:50.690> with<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:50.990> but<00:03:51.260> oh<00:03:51.500> my<00:03:52.070> gosh<00:03:52.250> this

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
problem with that but oh my gosh this

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.370 
problem with that but oh my gosh this
was<00:03:52.760> just<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.360> tight<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.990> got<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.320> a

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
was just so tight and I got this in a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.550 
was just so tight and I got this in a
small<00:03:54.590> not<00:03:55.100> an<00:03:55.220> extra<00:03:55.520> small<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.080> if<00:03:57.080> you<00:03:57.230> are

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
small not an extra small so if you are

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.140 
small not an extra small so if you are
planning<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.100> get<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.430> then<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.730> really<00:03:59.000> do

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
planning to get this then I really do

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.449 
planning to get this then I really do
like<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.480> top<00:03:59.690> it's<00:03:59.930> got<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.290> back<00:04:01.070> there

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
like the top it's got that back there

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.270 
like the top it's got that back there
and<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.150> would<00:04:02.600> suggest<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.990> you<00:04:03.080> go<00:04:03.260> up<00:04:03.530> two

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
and I would suggest that you go up two

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.270 
and I would suggest that you go up two
or<00:04:04.550> three<00:04:04.580> sizes<00:04:05.209> because<00:04:06.140> it's<00:04:06.920> just<00:04:07.190> a

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
or three sizes because it's just a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.640 
or three sizes because it's just a
really<00:04:07.880> tight<00:04:08.270> fitting<00:04:08.750> but<00:04:09.110> this<00:04:09.410> would<00:04:09.620> have

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
really tight fitting but this would have

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.040 
really tight fitting but this would have
been<00:04:09.890> really<00:04:10.250> cute<00:04:10.610> if<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:11.090> did<00:04:11.270> fit<00:04:11.540> now<00:04:11.990> the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
been really cute if it did fit now the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.560 
been really cute if it did fit now the
final<00:04:12.470> item<00:04:12.800> is<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.250> white<00:04:13.640> blouse<00:04:14.090> here

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
final item is this white blouse here
