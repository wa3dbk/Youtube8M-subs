ripple effect take place instantaneously
versus<00:01:41.130> old-school<00:01:41.759> days<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.150> used<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> have

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
versus old-school days we used to have

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.240 
versus old-school days we used to have
to<00:01:42.659> code<00:01:42.869> every<00:01:43.259> single<00:01:43.649> page<00:01:43.860> by<00:01:44.220> itself

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to code every single page by itself

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.789 
to code every single page by itself
right<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.750> wanted<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> change<00:01:46.470> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
right so if we wanted to change this
