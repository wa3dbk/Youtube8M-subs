then<00:02:37.430> hisses<00:02:37.879> this<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.209> also<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.510> carrying

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
then hisses this is also the carrying

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.880 
then hisses this is also the carrying
case<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.269> cloth<00:02:41.569> material<00:02:41.900> now

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
case and now it is a cloth material now

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.039 
case and now it is a cloth material now
I<00:02:42.920> don't<00:02:43.190> see<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.569> point<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.870> them

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
I don't see was the point of them

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.240 
I don't see was the point of them
actually<00:02:45.230> making<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.880> thin<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.630> mean

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
actually making this so thin I mean

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.410 
actually making this so thin I mean
honestly<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.610> will<00:02:49.730> only<00:02:49.849> protect<00:02:50.090> from

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
honestly this will only protect from

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.089 
honestly this will only protect from
dust<00:02:50.690> it's<00:02:51.049> not<00:02:51.200> gonna<00:02:51.319> actually<00:02:51.709> protect

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
dust it's not gonna actually protect

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.069 
dust it's not gonna actually protect
your<00:02:52.280> headphones<00:02:52.940> when<00:02:53.209> you<00:02:53.360> drop<00:02:53.660> them<00:02:53.870> I

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
your headphones when you drop them I

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.720 
your headphones when you drop them I
mean<00:02:54.530> they<00:02:54.650> will<00:02:54.739> protect<00:02:55.010> from<00:02:55.160> scratches

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
mean they will protect from scratches

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.960 
mean they will protect from scratches
but<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.000> mean<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:57.079> know<00:02:57.280> everywhere<00:02:58.280> damages

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
but I mean you know everywhere damages

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.369 
but I mean you know everywhere damages
and<00:02:59.090> stuff<00:02:59.239> like<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.569> it's<00:02:59.959> not<00:03:00.049> gonna<00:03:00.200> do

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
and stuff like that it's not gonna do

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.170 
and stuff like that it's not gonna do
much<00:03:00.560> for<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.310> then<00:03:04.489> also<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.940> comes<00:03:05.120> with

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
much for you and then also it comes with

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.410 
much for you and then also it comes with
