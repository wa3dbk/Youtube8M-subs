00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
my kitchen that I could use to start

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.819 
my kitchen that I could use to start
ripping<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.430> hair<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.290> here<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.799> couple

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.819 
ripping on my hair and here are a couple
of<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.360> very<00:01:36.630> first<00:01:36.960> thing<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.200> olive

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
of them the very first thing is olive

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.800 
of them the very first thing is olive
oil<00:01:38.009> olive<00:01:38.820> oil<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> great<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.659> hair

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
oil olive oil is great for your hair

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.289 
oil olive oil is great for your hair

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
because even if you're just moisturizing

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.149 
because even if you're just moisturizing
and<00:01:42.420> sealing<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.470> seals<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.070> moisture

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and sealing this seals in the moisture

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
and sealing this seals in the moisture
in<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.700> hair<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.600> also<00:01:45.649> stimulates<00:01:46.649> growth

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
in your hair but also stimulates growth

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.370 
in your hair but also stimulates growth
and<00:01:47.479> when<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.630> coupled<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:51.380> cayenne

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and when it's coupled with cayenne

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.249 
and when it's coupled with cayenne
pepper<00:01:52.860> which<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> great<00:01:54.360> stimulant

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
pepper which is a great stimulant

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.920 
pepper which is a great stimulant
because<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.979> causes<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.090> brunt<00:01:57.360> blood<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
because it causes the brunt blood to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.429 
because it causes the brunt blood to
circulate<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:58.890> head<00:01:59.750> where<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> ball

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
circulate to your head where the ball

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.830
