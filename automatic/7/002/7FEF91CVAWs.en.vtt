00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
to be safe as of now this is a couple

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.509 
to be safe as of now this is a couple
hours<00:03:33.870> after<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.319> finished<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.859> manicure<00:03:35.310> and

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
hours after I finished a manicure and

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.179 
hours after I finished a manicure and
I've<00:03:35.879> already<00:03:36.150> put<00:03:37.079> my<00:03:37.290> nails<00:03:37.500> through<00:03:38.040> an

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
obstacle course it's still chip free I

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.280 
obstacle course it's still chip free I
think<00:03:41.549> this<00:03:41.849> will<00:03:41.969> last<00:03:42.239> at<00:03:42.480> least<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.900> week<00:03:43.109> or

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
think this will last at least a week or

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.009 
think this will last at least a week or
two<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:44.010> haven't<00:03:44.879> seen<00:03:45.030> any<00:03:45.150> signs<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.659> peeling

most importantly and it seems very chip

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.360

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
proof I have a pretty good feeling about

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.349

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
nail and what I've seen the website say

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.039

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
foil until it soaks off I may do a

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.070 
foil until it soaks off I may do a
shorter<00:04:21.930> video<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.220> removal<00:04:23.729> process<00:04:24.080> but
