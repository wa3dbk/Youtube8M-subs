00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.410
 and the highest grade of the soul for 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.830

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.779

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.169
 from spices we take 25 grams of salt on 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.529
 kilogram of meat further means somewhere 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.920
 one and a half gram of black pepper nutmeg 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.750
 walnut 1 gram and 1 gram sugar from 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.800
 technology will be meat grinders with 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.690
 special nozzle for sausage stuffing 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.300
 Of course sausage casing I use 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.790
 collagen cotton twine for 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.280
 ligation and need a blender in order 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.950
 to make minced meat you need 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.580
 pass through the lattice well somewhere 2 3 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.930
 millimeter through measures 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.720
 the meat is twisted and we start doing 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.460
 minced add salt add spices and 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.080
 now we will with the help of the spoon started 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 mix and then using a blender 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 will turn into such and such 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.720
 monotonous mush for this to us 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.320
 will need some water and more or 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.320
 broth 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.160
 the amount of water is determined simply by 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.170
 So I took the fact of 120 milliliters will 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.360
 watch me change you take because 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.370
 that the meat is different 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.820
 this one takes me some meat 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.970
 the best is worse, so here it is necessary 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.970
 watch 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.400
 slightly added women 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.030
 as a result, we got this 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.600
 here 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.180
 monotonous mass and now it needs to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.460
 an hour at least put in 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.000
 refrigerator so that it is ripe and after 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.489
 This will already form sausage stuffing 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.640
 matured collagen sheath needed 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.950
 head down and lay a few 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.660
 minutes immediately galactic after that 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.660
 will stuff their stuffing 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.500
 Here are these 5 loaves of sausage Yushin me 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.230
 turned out while I was humming water sausages 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.340
 heated to 95 degrees and now 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.610
 start cooking 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.680
 gently lower the loaf and look to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.770
 water is controlled by a thermometer to water 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.560
 not boiling cooking goes at a temperature of 85 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.560
 87 degrees for 30 minutes
