00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.750
 from the release of paper mario nintendo 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.700
 64 we learned a new facet of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 plumber in a paper world that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.809
 brought applause from everyone then 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 of a couple of sequels 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.090
 we have baker mario sticker star the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.789
 first game of the series to reach a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 portable console tells us the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 history of the stamp festival 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.570
 everything was happiness until the time comes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.120
 evil boxer who wants to steal the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.010
 actual prints but at that time a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 great swirl leaves the whole kingdom 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.110
 become a disaster upon awakening 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.480
 Mario has the new task of recovering 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.510
 all the actual prints and stop a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.579
 more time to the evil king koopa in this 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 occasion we travel a map in style 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.750
 classic of the series although we can 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.149
 complete the worlds in the order that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 we wish when we reach the end of each 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 level we open way to be able to advance 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.960
 and in some cases the levels count 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 with more than one output that unlocks 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.980
 alternate routes so to know the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.810
 full game 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.080
 we will have to play most of the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.450
 levels more than once 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.730
 the most important feature of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.620
 game is the use of stamps 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.930
 which we collect throughout the game 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.090
 these pictures help us solve 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.790
 some riddles with a level of 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.860
 very acceptable difficulty at the time 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.050
 that we face an enemy we will be 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.030
 transported to another screen where 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.280
 the battles take place in turns 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.440
 where each of the prints that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.960
 Let's collect represents an attack 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.820
 different besides that it follows 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.980
 retaining the action of pressing a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 button just at the time of attacking or 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.179
 defend to increase the effect 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 The biggest problem with the game is that 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.320
 the battles we do not receive points of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.840
 experience so it does not matter to fight 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.640
 a million times or just once what 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.799
 causes that except for the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.600
 clashes with bosses the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.149
 battles sit completely 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 useless and having to return to a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.219
 area full of enemies turns out to be quite 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.649
 annoying the graphic section is 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.840
 wonderful all the details are 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.360
 plausible and make us enjoy the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.489
 game of exceedingly adding one of the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.700
 better jobs that have been done with the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.860
 3d effect of the console the paragraph 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.110
 sound is not left behind during the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.819
 game we will hear great melodies very 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.400
 well worked whose main 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.620
 instrument are the trumpets a great 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.160
 soundtrack to accompany us along 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.650
 of the adventure paper mario biker star is 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.329
 a wonderful game has a quantity 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.000
 immense details that make us 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.310
 enjoy it from start to finish a 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.349
 alternative facet of the plumber that we 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.700
 makes you see that all the fun of your 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.989
 games fit in one picture 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.989
 final grade 90
