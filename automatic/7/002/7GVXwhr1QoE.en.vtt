mod<00:00:02.460> on<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.790> KLR<00:00:03.720> 650<00:00:05.779> PVC<00:00:06.779> mod<00:00:07.099> is<00:00:08.099> basically

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
mod on a KLR 650 PVC mod is basically

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.690 
mod on a KLR 650 PVC mod is basically
putting<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:10.110> one-way<00:00:10.590> valve<00:00:10.670> into<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
putting a one-way valve into the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.959 
putting a one-way valve into the
breather<00:00:12.269> hose<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:13.139> from<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:14.490> engine

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
breather hose going from the engine

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.820

under<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> flashlight<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:18.650> part<00:00:19.650> right<00:00:19.770> in

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
under the flashlight that part right in

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.910 
under the flashlight that part right in
there<00:00:20.070> comes<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:20.820> along<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.740> goes<00:00:22.740> up

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
there comes up along here and goes up

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.480 
there comes up along here and goes up
into<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.580> air<00:00:23.760> box<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:25.130> pull<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.279> off

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
into the air box so pull that off

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.790 
into the air box so pull that off
there's<00:00:29.150> there's<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.240> crimper<00:00:30.660> thing<00:00:31.019> right

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
there's there's a crimper thing right

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.270 
there's there's a crimper thing right
there<00:00:32.130> use<00:00:32.940> pliers<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.980> there's<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
there use pliers on that and there's a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.190 
there use pliers on that and there's a
rubber<00:00:36.110> type<00:00:37.110> thing<00:00:37.500> pull<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.200> pull

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
rubber type thing pull that out and pull

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.360 
rubber type thing pull that out and pull
the<00:00:40.290> hose<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:40.950> make<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> whole<00:00:41.340> lot

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the hose out it will make it a whole lot

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.600 
the hose out it will make it a whole lot
easier<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> mod<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> actual<00:00:43.710> valve

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
easier to do the mod on the actual valve

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.470 
easier to do the mod on the actual valve
there's<00:00:45.649> two<00:00:46.649> two<00:00:46.829> seven<00:00:47.129> two<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> put

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
there's two two seven two when you put

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.080 
there's two two seven two when you put
that<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.530> should<00:00:49.800> sit<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that in it should sit like this with the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.290 
that in it should sit like this with the
threaded<00:00:51.420> part<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> top<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:54.000> numbers

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
threaded part to the top and the numbers

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.099 
threaded part to the top and the numbers
should<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.539> right<00:00:55.020> side<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:56.149> okay<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
should be right side up okay so it's it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.529 
should be right side up okay so it's it
something<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.500> valve<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.820> put<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
something like that valve if you put it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.840 
something like that valve if you put it
right<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:01.079> against<00:01:01.410> there<00:01:01.559> should<00:01:02.430> come<00:01:02.640> down

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
right up against there should come down

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
right up against there should come down
to<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.480> yellow<00:01:03.719> mark<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.049> put<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.470> which

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to this yellow mark I put in there which

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.120 
to this yellow mark I put in there which
is<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.820> beginning<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> turn<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> valve

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
is the beginning of the turn the valve

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.380 
is the beginning of the turn the valve
should<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.460> vertical<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> work

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
should be vertical for it to work

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.530 
should be vertical for it to work
correctly<00:01:10.310> what<00:01:11.310> I've<00:01:11.400> done<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.939> two

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
correctly what I've done is make two

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
correctly what I've done is make two
more<00:01:12.659> marks<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> hose<00:01:13.820> that's<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
more marks on the hose that's so that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
more marks on the hose that's so that
when<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.170> put<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> same<00:01:18.840> overall

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
when I put it in it's the same overall

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.770 
when I put it in it's the same overall
length<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.630> part<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.780> looks

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
length because the part here that looks

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
length because the part here that looks
like<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.470> could<00:01:25.590> fit<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> wrench<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
like you could fit a wrench over it or a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.050 
like you could fit a wrench over it or a
socket<00:01:27.829> that's<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.369> inside<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
socket that's not going to be inside the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.770 
socket that's not going to be inside the
hose<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.710> see<00:01:31.890> I've<00:01:32.450> cut<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> part

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
hose as you can see I've cut this part

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
hose as you can see I've cut this part
this<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.290> part<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> tube

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
this little part of the out of the tube

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.670 
this little part of the out of the tube
and<00:01:35.869> replaced<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.979> PVC<00:01:38.759> valve

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
and replaced it with the PVC valve

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
and replaced it with the PVC valve
extends<00:01:40.680> about<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.979> far<00:01:41.220> into<00:01:41.400> each<00:01:41.520> tube<00:01:41.549> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
extends about that far into each tube I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.789 
extends about that far into each tube I
have<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> brought<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:43.979> against<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
have it brought up right against the

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.609 
have it brought up right against the
wrench<00:01:46.799> part<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.460> lack<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.729> better<00:01:47.820> term

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
wrench part for lack of a better term

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.039 
wrench part for lack of a better term
it's<00:01:49.619> still<00:01:50.310> lined<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.700> there's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:51.899> tab
