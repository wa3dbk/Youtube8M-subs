and<00:00:01.199> what<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.410> want<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.740> point<00:00:01.920> out<00:00:02.040> here<00:00:02.310> is

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
and what I want to point out here is

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.640 
and what I want to point out here is
that<00:00:02.429> we<00:00:03.270> have<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.449> misconception<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:04.500> our

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
that we have a misconception in our

that we have a misconception in our
present<00:00:05.100> mindset<00:00:06.089> because<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.660> fact<00:00:06.930> that

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:07.099 
present mindset because of the fact that

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.350 
present mindset because of the fact that

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.849 
this could go on and on problems there
but<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.800> we're<00:00:56.010> talking<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.579> comparing

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
but when we're talking about comparing

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.729 
but when we're talking about comparing
eating<00:00:58.859> an<00:00:59.329> animal<00:01:00.329> product<00:01:00.539> from<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.350> animal

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
eating an animal product from an animal

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
eating an animal product from an animal
their<00:01:02.100> forages<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.910> things<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> humans

their forages on things that humans
cannot<00:01:04.229> eat<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.810> different

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
cannot eat this is a very different

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.039 
cannot eat this is a very different
formula<00:01:08.360> because<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.540> we're<00:01:09.630> talking<00:01:09.810> about

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
formula because when we're talking about

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.270 
formula because when we're talking about
comparing<00:01:10.860> being<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> vegetarian<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.619> eating

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
comparing being a vegetarian to eating

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
comparing being a vegetarian to eating
animal<00:01:14.610> products<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:15.659> assuming<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
animal products and we're assuming that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.460 
animal products and we're assuming that
all<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:17.159> animal<00:01:17.549> products<00:01:18.350> could<00:01:19.350> have

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
all these animal products could have

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
all these animal products could have
been<00:01:19.590> created<00:01:19.799> by<00:01:20.189> those<00:01:20.340> animals<00:01:20.880> eating

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
been created by those animals eating

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
been created by those animals eating
stuff<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> weakening<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> becomes<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
stuff and weakening then it becomes a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
stuff and weakening then it becomes a
viable<00:01:23.460> argument<00:01:23.729> yeah<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.659> should<00:01:24.810> eat<00:01:24.930> lower

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
viable argument yeah we should eat lower

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.899 
viable argument yeah we should eat lower
on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> food<00:01:25.560> chain<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:26.189> determines<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
on the food chain that determines in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.719 
on the food chain that determines in
terms<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.710> supporting<00:01:28.710> something<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
terms of supporting something that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
terms of supporting something that
doesn't<00:01:30.060> even<00:01:30.150> make<00:01:30.360> energy<00:01:30.570> excess<00:01:31.200> much

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
doesn't even make energy excess much

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.440 
doesn't even make energy excess much
less<00:01:32.070> ethical<00:01:32.520> sense<00:01:32.729> right<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.329> don't

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
less ethical sense right so we don't

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.179 
less ethical sense right so we don't
want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> support<00:01:33.900> vector<00:01:34.439> farming<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.040> many

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
want to support vector farming for many

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.310 
want to support vector farming for many
reasons<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.450> I'm<00:01:36.570> pointing<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
reasons but what I'm pointing at it's

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
reasons but what I'm pointing at it's
not<00:01:37.380> saying<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.250> some<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> scientific

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
not saying that some of the scientific

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.350 
not saying that some of the scientific
underpinning<00:01:39.990> does

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
underpinning does

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.620 
underpinning does
for<00:01:40.840> why<00:01:41.020> vegetarianism<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.910> nursin<00:01:43.360> that

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
for why vegetarianism is the nursin that

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.500 
for why vegetarianism is the nursin that
we're<00:01:44.110> making<00:01:44.260> you<00:01:44.710> sell<00:01:45.040> food<00:01:45.430> that<00:01:46.210> could

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
we're making you sell food that could

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.180 
we're making you sell food that could
refit<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.320> animals

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
refit to animals

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.460 
refit to animals
if<00:01:48.760> we<00:01:49.090> eat<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.390> instead<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.990> feeding<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.440> to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
if we eat it instead of feeding it to

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.350 
if we eat it instead of feeding it to
animals<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.160> get<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> better<00:01:51.580> energy<00:01:51.790> return

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
animals you get a better energy return

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.570 
animals you get a better energy return
because<00:01:52.900> your<00:01:53.200> energy<00:01:53.320> loss<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:53.980> upwards<00:01:54.370> of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
because your energy loss is upwards of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.730 
because your energy loss is upwards of
ten<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.240> thirty<00:01:55.480> to<00:01:55.660> one<00:01:55.690> so<00:01:56.410> you're<00:01:56.530> eating

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
ten to thirty to one so you're eating

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.340 
ten to thirty to one so you're eating
like<00:01:57.010> thirty<00:01:57.340> pounds<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.940> grain<00:01:58.180> of<00:01:58.479> path<00:01:58.720> to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
like thirty pounds of grain of path to

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.120 
like thirty pounds of grain of path to
get<00:01:59.500> like<00:01:59.680> one<00:01:59.920> pound<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.430> meat<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.950> they'll

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
get like one pound of meat then they'll

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.880 
get like one pound of meat then they'll
be<00:02:03.310> fat<00:02:03.970> but<00:02:04.240> all<00:02:04.570> factory<00:02:04.990> farm<00:02:05.290> cows<00:02:05.560> are<00:02:05.860> fed

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
be fat but all factory farm cows are fed

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.199 
be fat but all factory farm cows are fed
great<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:08.770> it's<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.009> viable<00:02:09.310> formula<00:02:10.000> when

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
great so so it's a viable formula when

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.940 
great so so it's a viable formula when
we're<00:02:10.390> talking<00:02:10.509> about<00:02:10.780> animal<00:02:11.320> products<00:02:11.680> come

you<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:44.140> melt<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.530> animal<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.640> now<00:02:46.030> you've

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
you can melt that animal and now you've

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.930 
you can melt that animal and now you've
got<00:02:46.360> now<00:02:46.600> you've<00:02:47.320> got<00:02:47.500> milk<00:02:47.830> from<00:02:48.400> an<00:02:48.549> animal

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940

permaculture is of animals a part of
