wondering i'm on the dokucraft texture

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.350 
wondering i'm on the dokucraft texture
pack<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.620> i'd<00:00:58.860> recommend<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> anyone<00:01:00.000> who

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
wants to use wooden materials okay so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.050 
wants to use wooden materials okay so
you<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> knock<00:01:05.129> out<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> corners<00:01:05.880> on

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you want to knock out the corners on

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.219 
you want to knock out the corners on
both<00:01:06.240> ends<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:08.000> basically<00:01:09.229> repeat

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
both ends like that and basically repeat

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.880 
both ends like that and basically repeat
that<00:01:10.380> process<00:01:10.970> around<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> outside

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that process around the outside

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.240 
that process around the outside
so

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.850 

and<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:22.450> like<00:01:22.630> before<00:01:23.050> we'll<00:01:23.410> have<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.680> knock

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.090 
and just like before we'll have to knock
out<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.100> corners<00:01:24.400> again<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.880> in<00:01:25.630> case<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.100> go

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
out the corners again and in case you go

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
out the corners again and in case you go
I<00:01:27.130> don't

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I don't

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710 
I don't
Colin's<00:01:29.000> because<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> will<00:01:30.509> look<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
Colin's because I think it will look the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.590 
Colin's because I think it will look the
same<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.110> doesn't<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> looks<00:01:31.890> retarded<00:01:32.600> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
same at doesn't that looks retarded so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
same at doesn't that looks retarded so
just<00:01:34.500> come<00:01:34.710> around<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> walk<00:01:35.310> out<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.670> these

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
just come around and walk out all these

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.390 
just come around and walk out all these
corner<00:01:36.180> blocks

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
corner blocks

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.500 
corner blocks
that<00:01:38.610> don't

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.870

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
build up one on this level so just

00:01:46.220 --> 00:02:01.740 
build up one on this level so just
repeat<00:01:47.210> exactly<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:48.050> same

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
like that and start building up your

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.899 
like that and start building up your
circuit<00:03:07.489> that's<00:03:08.420> basically<00:03:08.599> get<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:10.790> this

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
part of the ship up to the cockpit area

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.290 
part of the ship up to the cockpit area
it's<00:03:14.030> not<00:03:14.150> really<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.450> competition

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300

to start building the actual coin so I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.490 
to start building the actual coin so I
put<00:03:55.050> two<00:03:55.230> blocks<00:03:55.500> down<00:03:55.620> like<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:57.500> I

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
put two blocks down like that and I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.880 
put two blocks down like that and I
fence<00:03:58.830> off<00:03:59.100> like<00:03:59.280> that

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
fence off like that

now<00:05:32.470> I'm<00:05:32.560> just<00:05:32.680> awesome<00:05:33.040> shape<00:05:33.340> recording

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
now I'm just awesome shape recording

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.660 
now I'm just awesome shape recording
software<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:34.690> I'm<00:05:35.440> really<00:05:35.740> gonna<00:05:36.190> be<00:05:36.340> bothered

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
software so I'm really gonna be bothered

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.790 
software so I'm really gonna be bothered
to<00:05:36.700> crop<00:05:37.000> her<00:05:37.120> out<00:05:37.150> of<00:05:37.390> this<00:05:37.540> just<00:05:38.500> gonna<00:05:38.650> have

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
to crop her out of this just gonna have

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.500 
to crop her out of this just gonna have
to<00:05:38.890> put<00:05:39.070> up<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.310> rebuilding<00:05:39.880> this<00:05:40.060> it's

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
to put up the rebuilding this it's

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.410 
to put up the rebuilding this it's
probably<00:05:40.750> good<00:05:40.960> thing<00:05:41.170> though

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
probably good thing though

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.220 
probably good thing though
I'm<00:05:42.510> do<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:42.990> correctly

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
I'm do it correctly

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.710 
I'm do it correctly
that's<00:05:45.890> the<00:05:46.070> build<00:05:46.280> on<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.580> inside<00:05:47.030> well<00:05:47.690> I

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
that's the build on the inside well I

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.110 
that's the build on the inside well I
guess<00:05:47.900> you<00:05:48.020> have<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.260> really<00:05:48.970> part<00:05:49.970> of<00:05:50.060> the

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
guess you have to really part of the

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:57.519 
guess you have to really part of the
board

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.569 

now<00:05:58.099> if<00:05:58.249> you're<00:05:58.399> going<00:05:58.519> to<00:05:58.609> do<00:05:58.759> this<00:05:58.909> on

now if you're going to do this on

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:03.549 
now if you're going to do this on
survival<00:06:01.579> you're<00:06:02.569> going<00:06:02.809> to<00:06:02.899> be<00:06:03.019> spending<00:06:03.199> a

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:03.559 
survival you're going to be spending a

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:08.250 
survival you're going to be spending a
lot<00:06:04.009> of<00:06:04.039> time<00:06:04.159> looking<00:06:04.699> for<00:06:05.029> shapes<00:06:05.379> sheep

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
lot of time looking for shapes sheep

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.420 
lot of time looking for shapes sheep
and<00:06:09.330> shape<00:06:10.330> you're<00:06:10.480> going<00:06:10.630> to<00:06:10.690> go<00:06:10.780> cold<00:06:11.430> so
