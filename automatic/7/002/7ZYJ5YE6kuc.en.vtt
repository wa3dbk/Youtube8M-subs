00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this it really helped so it's important

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860

to<00:00:56.309> ask<00:00:56.370> yourself<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.000> question<00:00:57.149> because

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
to ask yourself that question because

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
to ask yourself that question because

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
what happens a lot of the time is that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.689 
what happens a lot of the time is that
when<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.690> new<00:01:00.989> instructor<00:01:01.379> starts<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
when a new instructor starts out you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.910 
when a new instructor starts out you
find<00:01:02.969> yourself<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.629> front<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.290> large<00:01:04.530> crowd

of<00:01:05.040> people<00:01:05.309> several<00:01:06.180> times<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.630> week<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.140> there

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
of people several times a week and there

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
of people several times a week and there
can<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> default<00:01:09.119> mechanism

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
can be this kind of default mechanism

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.539 
can be this kind of default mechanism
that<00:01:10.020> kicks<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.560> where<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.369> be

that kicks in where you want to just be

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
that kicks in where you want to just be
like<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> big<00:01:12.090> star<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.740> live<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:13.920> a

challenge<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> look<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:46.049> your<00:01:46.320> classes

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
challenge you to look at your classes

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.920 
challenge you to look at your classes
and<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.180> applies<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.840> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and see how this applies because you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.660 
and see how this applies because you
might<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.409> well<00:01:49.560> I'm<00:01:49.710> I'm<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.579> be

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
might think well I'm I'm there to be

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.630 
might think well I'm I'm there to be
teaching<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.750> sometimes<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.040> might<00:01:53.250> think

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
teaching but sometimes you might think

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
teaching but sometimes you might think
you're<00:01:53.790> doing<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.360> actually<00:01:54.869> you're

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you're doing that but actually you're

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.950 
you're doing that but actually you're
really<00:01:55.700> performing<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> way<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.570> tell

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
really performing so the way to tell

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
really performing so the way to tell
about<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.590> doing<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.369> think

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
about if you're doing that is to think

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.500 
about if you're doing that is to think
about<00:02:00.299> how<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.960> learn

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
about how you learn

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.570 
about how you learn
a<00:02:01.540> new<00:02:01.870> choreography<00:02:02.470> when<00:02:03.160> you're<00:02:03.340> learning

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
a new choreography when you're learning

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.760 
a new choreography when you're learning
do<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.510> think<00:02:04.780> about<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.110> cues<00:02:05.440> you're<00:02:05.620> going

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
do you think about the cues you're going

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.110 
do you think about the cues you're going
to<00:02:05.860> be<00:02:05.950> doing<00:02:06.250> as<00:02:06.340> you're<00:02:06.760> learning<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
to be doing as you're learning the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.580 
to be doing as you're learning the
confit<00:02:07.630> do<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.870> learn<00:02:07.990> where<00:02:08.320> you're<00:02:08.440> going

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
confit do you learn where you're going

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.950 
confit do you learn where you're going
to<00:02:08.680> insert<00:02:09.100> them<00:02:09.310> into<00:02:09.580> your<00:02:09.729> moves<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.390> that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
to insert them into your moves is that

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.140 
to insert them into your moves is that
like<00:02:11.110> one<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.740> first<00:02:11.980> things<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.430> do<00:02:12.610> or

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
like one of the first things you do or

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.940 
like one of the first things you do or
is<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.480> something<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:14.110> more<00:02:14.440> kind<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.770> on

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
is it something you do more kind of on

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.640 
is it something you do more kind of on
the<00:02:15.250> job<00:02:15.490> if<00:02:16.420> you're<00:02:16.570> doing<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.960> on<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.200> job<00:02:17.410> I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
the job if you're doing it on the job I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.010 
the job if you're doing it on the job I
would<00:02:18.250> say<00:02:18.490> your<00:02:18.670> priority<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.180> not<00:02:19.330> your

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
would say your priority is not your

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.260 
would say your priority is not your
students<00:02:20.470> because<00:02:20.830> there's<00:02:21.550> just<00:02:21.760> no<00:02:21.940> way<00:02:22.210> to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
students because there's just no way to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.530 
students because there's just no way to
clearly<00:02:23.170> cue<00:02:23.710> if<00:02:23.950> you're<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.520> making<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.390> up

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
clearly cue if you're just making it up

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420 
clearly cue if you're just making it up
and<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.900> not<00:02:26.080> consistent<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:26.980> changes

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
and it's not consistent and it changes

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.580 
and it's not consistent and it changes
each<00:02:27.640> time<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:28.210> know<00:02:28.510> because<00:02:28.960> I've<00:02:29.080> been<00:02:29.110> there

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
each time I know because I've been there

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.100 
each time I know because I've been there
when<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.770> first<00:02:30.100> started<00:02:30.490> out<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.940> didn't<00:02:31.630> really

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
when I first started out I didn't really

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.380 
when I first started out I didn't really
understand<00:02:32.560> cueing<00:02:32.890> very<00:02:33.130> well<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:34.360> was

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
understand cueing very well and it was

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.180 
understand cueing very well and it was
actually<00:02:34.840> from<00:02:35.170> my<00:02:35.500> colleagues<00:02:35.980> from

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
actually from my colleagues from

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.010 
actually from my colleagues from
watching<00:02:36.640> our<00:02:36.760> instructors<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.570> realized

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
watching our instructors that I realized

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.040 
watching our instructors that I realized
that<00:02:38.140> cueing<00:02:38.800> as<00:02:38.950> part<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.790> your<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.630> way<00:02:40.840> that

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
that cueing as part of your the way that

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.350 
that cueing as part of your the way that
you<00:02:41.110> put<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.350> cog<00:02:41.680> Rafi<00:02:41.920> together<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.490> massively

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you put a cog Rafi together is massively

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.990 
you put a cog Rafi together is massively
important<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.200> makes<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.500> huge<00:02:44.860> difference

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
important it makes a huge difference

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.070 
important it makes a huge difference
it'll<00:02:46.000> also<00:02:46.270> give<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.630> more<00:02:46.810> confidence

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
it'll also give you more confidence

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.170 
it'll also give you more confidence
because<00:02:47.650> what<00:02:48.220> happens<00:02:48.550> when<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.850> start<00:02:49.060> to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
because what happens when you start to

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.540 
because what happens when you start to
really<00:02:49.420> cue<00:02:49.810> well<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.100> students

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
really cue well is that your students

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.640 
really cue well is that your students
follow<00:02:51.940> better<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.990> notice<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.380> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
follow better and you notice that the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.610 
follow better and you notice that the
oval<00:02:53.980> level<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.520> class<00:02:54.730> improves

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
oval level of your class improves

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.840 
oval level of your class improves
otherwise<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.920> they're<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.400> trying<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.670> keep

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
otherwise if they're just trying to keep

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.980 
otherwise if they're just trying to keep
up<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:58.510> you're<00:02:58.780> just

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
up with you because you're just

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.160 
up with you because you're just
performing<00:02:59.740> they<00:03:00.430> won't<00:03:00.940> get<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.420> as<00:03:01.570> fast<00:03:01.900> and

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
performing they won't get it as fast and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.380 
performing they won't get it as fast and
you'll<00:03:02.350> see<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.860> difference<00:03:03.310> it's<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.180> little

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
you'll see the difference it's a little

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.420 
you'll see the difference it's a little
bit<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.870> you're<00:03:05.050> driving<00:03:05.500> somewhere<00:03:05.770> if

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
bit like if you're driving somewhere if

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.210 
bit like if you're driving somewhere if
you<00:03:06.489> just<00:03:06.760> follow<00:03:06.970> someone<00:03:07.570> in<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.870> car<00:03:08.220> then

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
you just follow someone in a car then

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.860 
you just follow someone in a car then
it's<00:03:09.610> going<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.880> be<00:03:10.000> probably<00:03:10.360> quite<00:03:10.510> hard<00:03:10.780> for

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
it's going to be probably quite hard for

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.540 
it's going to be probably quite hard for
you<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.200> find<00:03:11.410> your<00:03:11.590> way<00:03:11.709> back<00:03:11.739> unless<00:03:12.370> you've

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
you to find your way back unless you've

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.240 
you to find your way back unless you've
got<00:03:12.640> an<00:03:12.760> amazing<00:03:13.060> visual<00:03:13.600> memory<00:03:13.930> if<00:03:14.250> someone

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
got an amazing visual memory if someone

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.550 
got an amazing visual memory if someone
explains<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.239> like<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> main<00:03:16.750> landmarks<00:03:17.350> on

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
explains you like the main landmarks on

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.770 
explains you like the main landmarks on
the<00:03:17.739> way<00:03:17.860> there<00:03:18.130> then<00:03:19.030> you're<00:03:19.390> probably<00:03:19.510> going

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
the way there then you're probably going

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.600 
the way there then you're probably going
to<00:03:19.870> remember<00:03:20.110> how<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.410> get<00:03:20.709> there<00:03:20.769> again<00:03:21.070> even

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
to remember how to get there again even

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.979

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
whether they're turning around whether

whether they're turning around whether
to<00:03:44.170> stay<00:03:44.380> in<00:03:44.500> one<00:03:44.680> place<00:03:44.830> you'll<00:03:45.610> find<00:03:45.670> your

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
to stay in one place you'll find your

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.660 
to stay in one place you'll find your
own<00:03:46.660> way<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.050> doing<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:48.310> isn't<00:03:48.580> really

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
own way of doing this this isn't really

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.520 
own way of doing this this isn't really
about<00:03:48.760> how<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.209> get<00:03:49.540> us<00:03:49.660> more<00:03:49.900> about<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.320> fact

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
about how to get us more about the fact

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.340 
about how to get us more about the fact
that<00:03:50.650> cueing<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.310> important<00:03:52.180> okay<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.810> the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
that cueing is important okay and the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.400 
that cueing is important okay and the
second<00:03:53.830> part<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.880> eye<00:03:55.510> contact<00:03:55.780> if

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
second part of this is eye contact if

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.009 
second part of this is eye contact if
you're<00:03:57.070> teaching<00:03:57.340> with<00:03:57.880> your<00:03:58.090> class<00:03:58.300> you'll

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
you're teaching with your class you'll

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.350 
you're teaching with your class you'll
notice<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.739> you<00:03:59.940> constantly<00:04:00.940> have<00:04:01.090> a

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
notice that you constantly have a

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.570 
notice that you constantly have a
contact<00:04:01.780> with<00:04:01.900> them<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.410> not<00:04:02.920> just<00:04:03.250> kind<00:04:03.459> of

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
contact with them and not just kind of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.000 
contact with them and not just kind of
in<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.790> random<00:04:04.239> way<00:04:04.420> I've<00:04:05.350> really<00:04:05.620> noticed<00:04:05.769> a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
in a random way I've really noticed a

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.920 
in a random way I've really noticed a
difference<00:04:06.040> in<00:04:06.430> my<00:04:06.580> own

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
difference in my own

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.990 
difference in my own
Ching's<00:04:07.260> when<00:04:07.560> i<00:04:07.590> first<00:04:07.859> started<00:04:08.069> out<00:04:08.670> i'd

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
Ching's when i first started out i'd

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.970 
Ching's when i first started out i'd
have<00:04:09.239> random<00:04:09.689> eye<00:04:09.840> contact<00:04:10.379> but<00:04:10.500> quite<00:04:10.769> often

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
have random eye contact but quite often

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.160 
have random eye contact but quite often
the<00:04:11.670> whole<00:04:11.909> class<00:04:12.209> would<00:04:12.420> blow<00:04:12.629> into<00:04:12.810> one

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
the whole class would blow into one

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.289 
the whole class would blow into one
because<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:14.010> was<00:04:14.129> still<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:14.400> performer<00:04:15.090> mode

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
because I was still in performer mode

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.330 
because I was still in performer mode

you're doing that and it really just

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.170 
you're doing that and it really just
adds<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.530> magic<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:53.070> your<00:04:53.280> class<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:53.849> it's<00:04:54.000> so

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
simple to do and even if at first it's a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.390 
simple to do and even if at first it's a
bit<00:04:57.150> tricky<00:04:57.419> keep<00:04:58.110> going<00:04:58.410> with<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.650> because<00:04:58.830> it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
bit tricky keep going with it because it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.249 
bit tricky keep going with it because it
does<00:04:59.639> become<00:04:59.820> easier<00:05:00.419> and<00:05:00.509> it<00:05:00.870> really

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
does become easier and it really

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.430 
does become easier and it really
increases<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.979> quality<00:05:02.970> of<00:05:03.479> your<00:05:03.840> class<00:05:04.080> and

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
increases the quality of your class and

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.260 
increases the quality of your class and
you'll<00:05:04.620> find<00:05:04.979> that<00:05:05.160> not<00:05:05.669> only<00:05:05.729> do<00:05:06.150> your

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
you'll find that not only do your

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.089 
you'll find that not only do your
students<00:05:06.780> enjoy<00:05:07.139> more<00:05:07.349> because<00:05:07.650> they<00:05:07.800> feel

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
students enjoy more because they feel

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.180 
students enjoy more because they feel
more<00:05:08.820> connected<00:05:09.180> with<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.780> but<00:05:10.410> you'll<00:05:10.770> enjoy

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
more connected with you but you'll enjoy

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.260 
more connected with you but you'll enjoy
it<00:05:11.220> more<00:05:11.370> because<00:05:11.789> you've<00:05:11.940> got<00:05:12.090> that

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
it more because you've got that

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.600 
it more because you've got that
connection<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:13.080> one<00:05:13.560> last<00:05:13.860> little<00:05:14.039> tip<00:05:14.400> is

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
connection and one last little tip is

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.909 
connection and one last little tip is
that<00:05:14.880> sometimes<00:05:15.389> and<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:16.110> bet<00:05:16.349> this<00:05:16.440> happens<00:05:16.620> to

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
that sometimes and I bet this happens to
