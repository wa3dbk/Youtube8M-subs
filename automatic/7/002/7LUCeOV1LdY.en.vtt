could be a problem okay now this is a

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.070 
could be a problem okay now this is a
converter<00:05:45.090> they<00:05:45.270> had<00:05:45.450> a<00:05:45.479> peel<00:05:46.100> 741<00:05:47.100> and<00:05:48.080> rob2

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
converter they had a peel 741 and rob2

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.560 
converter they had a peel 741 and rob2
valve<00:05:49.289> butters<00:05:49.590> were<00:05:49.710> replaced<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.610> pump

valve butters were replaced and pump
bushings<00:05:52.020> were<00:05:52.200> replaced<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:53.539> the<00:05:54.539> only

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
bushings were replaced and the only

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.330 
bushings were replaced and the only
reason<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.200> only<00:05:55.380> thing<00:05:55.530> to<00:05:55.650> cure<00:05:55.860> this<00:05:56.010> was

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
reason the only thing to cure this was

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.250 
reason the only thing to cure this was
replacing<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.060> converter<00:05:57.390> so<00:05:57.750> let's<00:05:58.110> say<00:05:58.200> you

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
replacing the converter so let's say you

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.150 
replacing the converter so let's say you
could<00:05:58.440> test<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.830> go<00:05:59.550> ahead<00:05:59.669> and<00:05:59.789> plug<00:06:00.450> the

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
could test it go ahead and plug the

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.690 
could test it go ahead and plug the
radiator<00:06:02.160> cooler<00:06:03.890> rear<00:06:04.890> section<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.460> front

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
radiator cooler rear section the front

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.920 
radiator cooler rear section the front
section<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.090> now<00:06:06.270> we're<00:06:06.389> going<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.539> do<00:06:06.720> the

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
section and now we're going to do the

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.120 
section and now we're going to do the
eat<00:06:08.870> and<00:06:09.870> no<00:06:09.990> matter<00:06:10.169> how<00:06:10.380> much<00:06:10.500> air<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:10.770> put<00:06:11.039> in

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
there as you can see okay will not stop

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.640 
there as you can see okay will not stop
turning<00:06:14.810> let's<00:06:15.810> do<00:06:16.289> it<00:06:16.410> again

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
turning let's do it again

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.189 
turning let's do it again
put<00:06:17.460> more<00:06:17.639> air
