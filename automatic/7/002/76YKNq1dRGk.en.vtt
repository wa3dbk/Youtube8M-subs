00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

pickguard<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.280> typical<00:00:38.730> layout<00:00:38.910> didn't

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
pickguard and the typical layout didn't

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.250

have<00:00:39.960> much<00:00:40.850> attitude<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.000> personality<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.230> I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
have much attitude or personality so I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.380

it<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.860> give<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.309> its<00:00:47.579> own<00:00:48.289> signature

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it to really give it its own signature
