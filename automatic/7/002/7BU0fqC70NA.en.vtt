00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.170
 greetings guardians welcome again 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.760
 to another sting universe video and today 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.400
 we're going good, we're going to teach you a 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.200
 trick to get lumens what we are 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.640
 older in the place because I already 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.320
 we know but in many guardians that 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.420
 new are being incorporated the 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.120
 play now and they are running out 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.620
 lumen quickly then we're going to 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.350
 teach a little trick to get 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.420
 lumens very fast and that will take us 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.550
 a lot of effort we have to go to 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:39.239
 marte to the mission of exclusion zones 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.610
 and we're going to choose level 22 ok there's a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.879
 zone at the beginning where enemies leave 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.320
 cabal and a loose ship 88 ultras 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 then those are the ones that are going to give us 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.280
 the lumen 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.820
 with a little trick that we're going to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.820
 do now 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.990
 now we are going to advance the mission up 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.800
 the first checkpoint that is this 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.270
 from here we're going to activate it once 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.590
 let's activate that gate will open 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.290
 here we have there going to start to appear 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.630
 the enemies are going to activate it 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 the replenishment code is worth 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 is what is going to give us what is going to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.590
 give extra lumen 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.330
 then more or less for each batch of 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.060
 enemies can be each one I think 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.850
 it was about 500 about 500 lumen with what 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.230
 as if you are giving in a little bit because 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.070
 I believe that in one hour 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.610
 you can easily take out the 20,000 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.610
 even a little less 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 as you see in the video 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.040
 It's worth first one round 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.360
 you do not have to be careful with the ship 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.890
 that the ship will be given because a 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.470
 little bit of ass but good to the bottom 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.700
 already the ultras begin to appear that is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.650
 What will Lumen give us? 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.320
 you have to be careful not to kill 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.930
 all always leave an enemy of 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.989
 Reserve in case you do not bring 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.569
 heavy rocket launcher ammunition because 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.859
 we have to restart the point you can not 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.840
 pass but to exit the point of 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.940
 saved and it will not do anything what 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.010
 you have done previously 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.280
 raising the group you see how it is going 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.280
 going up 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.610
 we have for example in this case I have 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.610
 seen 103 of lumen 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.600
 we already have 48 extras per enemy 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.310
 everything is always attentive to the radar it is worth 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.200
 not going to be that look for example the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.739
 we can let kill for that phalanx that 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.739
 has shields 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.030
 on the way they released on blue grass 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.740
 we can even let ourselves be killed by this 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.510
 yes in the event that maybe 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.590
 give him an enemy that did not have much 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.030
 power 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.300
 you can let kill with the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.300
 rocket launcher 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.959
 for example now 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.120
 I have two thousand three hundred and seventy 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.750
 and finish this session and you'll see how much 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.750
 finished lumen 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:03.230
 Give me give me and strong strong flow 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.380
 and those two thousand 916 we have not done six 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.320
 almost 600 of lumen so good I think 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.910
 now you know why you are newbies 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.680
 this and you can not get it I stopped 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.810
 throw what is the game you can 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 come that the Tuesday broadcast to 0 the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.090
 Lumen theme and nothing because I hope that 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.960
 liked the video like and share and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.140
 see you at the border bastards 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.140
 by me
