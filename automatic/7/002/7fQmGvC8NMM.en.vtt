00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 load loc 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.599
 hey people you look at spooky 1611 and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.370
 welcome to your new fifa ultimate team 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 we have a thousand on the previous video 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.120
 likes achieved hence again today 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.109
 a new video can be german again 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.270
 likes 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.520
 let's go with are you still with 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.100
 ronnie rocket theme with ronnie of course 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.830
 like comb and now i have side like and ramos 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.109
 for in because yes this is really everything 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.050
 literally everything in the onenote game 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.969
 the game so I had and some more PC 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 player we play against the lord 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.079
 welbeck but they entire team consists of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.030
 Dutch and I don't know what I had 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.250
 this was literally the first day that i 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.930
 fifa played me all his got 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 done with him here i also use the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.149
 tendame from aubameyang to come by 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.840
 and there we have ramon's that scores one 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.550
 zero 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.110
 where she started in the defense 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 we have to defend every time 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 they now have the deployed such 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.989
 animation that that boulder high cem 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.420
 And yes that works very well of course 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.969
 to lord welbeck who wants in the 83rd 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.619
 minute and equalize and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.420
 I learned that this is a big mistake 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.939
 to let your chicken come out because like you 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.189
 almost looks completely wrong but 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.409
 luckily my iphone was 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.570
 smart to buy it off the line 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.770
 if you look closely you can see the total 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.080
 nothing happened 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 yet it is a violation of me 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.430
 those violations are really the lottery 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.330
 but ultimately one about us 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.920
 then we play against this team and are hfc 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.170
 defense doesn't look so good one 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.720
 attack what pumbaa vidal he already has 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.310
 here ramos with the first attack 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.310
 the fifth minute but it is missing and full 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.479
 eye could i want to forget that what 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.280
 thicker range good that hard I hit him 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.630
 not and suddenly you have we slide i 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.759
 watched that animation he just cuts 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.350
 totally dart on the nothing at all 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.479
 then here as usual the l one 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.320
 triangle ball and fifa and yours 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.320
 house short 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.090
 I could not touch it with rÃ¼diger than 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.549
 I naturally want to equalize very quickly 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.979
 and yes that does not always work because that is 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.750
 russian along with valero and like you 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.579
 sees my defender who pounds against 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.229
 his teammates just love him 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.429
 hope I have got no more good 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 and then it is also whole 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.180
 easy because all the defenders that you 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.400
 do n't be don't 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.109
 actually nothing at all this year at 208 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.840
 of course that's not possible at all 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.969
 this is right from the kick-off 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.549
 that is ramos good assumption high-rise 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.219
 Charlie and the Full let him in 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.719
 so i know you again ronnie here what is 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.139
 a lot is going to happen in the high 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:32.120
 divisions is this would have good p's and 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.579
 yes everyone walks forward or viewed 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.599
 it is very unbalanced you can 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.069
 defend it 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.840
 but this is not how it should be guys 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.639
 I use here the tendon s line I 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.870
 lay it down and thank you god like just 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.799
 but he didn't score that was in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.780
 the 33rd minute 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.909
 this is also in the 33rd minute katwijk 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.849
 gets the ball with his p he shoots mine 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.260
 goal and so suddenly 2 2 and again 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.659
 then of course we immediately go for more 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.450
 because this is already the 38th minute with 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.260
 ronnie and ronnie are shooting in and out 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.939
 then you think hey 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.150
 but he shot right in the middle but 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.620
 sometimes or ubach district we had clear 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.079
 experienced so often we go naturally 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.700
 right away for more here is ramos than and 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.560
 he wants to entertain him but this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.120
 times and to keep it but holy shit 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.620
 no one had the meaning where the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.659
 bal was another nice shot 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.889
 of ramos but that just goes wrong and then 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.359
 do you think the game under control 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.209
 I have tried him very badly here 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.310
 to eliminate and then this penalty happens 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.419
 and as you see reina grab the build he 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.669
 then kicks 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.220
 and flick it over me and that is 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.049
 100 percent no penalty but penalties 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.669
 are really given for everything and he 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.290
 that arrow scores so what do we have 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.109
 many arrow holes in these few episodes 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.569
 I am naturally extremely annoyed 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.909
 I really try everything to make it a goal 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.959
 to squeeze out and every now and then he gets 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.819
 therefore a chance 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.959
 you see him just dribbling here again 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.139
 run run run 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.909
 oh and he only gets it with me and then 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.269
 head tip against the bar and to end up 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.699
 on the bottom gave all the fun of growth 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.650
 then here in the 70th minute audience still 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.239
 from the king boulder shot from Piet 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.430
 he goes in check 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.229
 no you go just wide and then we go 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.359
 push more and push and push in it 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:10.099
 ramos die in the last fifteen minutes 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.109
 in dokkum to catholic one on one and 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.669
 he misses him when I look back now 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.299
 for it can easily out 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.709
 play 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.329
 because now I know what the keepers fail 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.340
 and on what shots they fail 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.920
 another chance for this in the 85th minute 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.540
 amos none at 1 on the keeper 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.160
 pour and yes so much too 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.500
 easier to play than was 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.330
 even 100% goal otherwise the third 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.670
 match we play against night 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.380
 breasts and night dress i was hoping that 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.340
 women who was but unfortunately in the beginning 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.750
 of the match 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.520
 I immediately make a mistake and then I see 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.320
 at Danny Welbeck how to make a keeper out 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.850
 must play and that is earlier 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.190
 happened this app person but now have it 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.690
 So even then the keeper learned 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.560
 So apparently does next if you just do it 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.120
 to walk by 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.190
 so yes I immediately follow the facts and 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.900
 who needs to go presse and presse 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.910
 that is then ramos with a shot but he 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.920
 Quran misses over the super dangerous here 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.330
 a corner of rodrigues on santana here 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.400
 do you therefore have active an you where 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.930
 total is not necessary because it was thick 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.670
 next but we like them they come balls 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.130
 always in between 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.810
 so I work that tendon very much so me 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.790
 go along more and more young and 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.590
 dribbling with aeswijn and I notice that too 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.120
 defending is simply very difficult if 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.790
 you have a drop out you will yes 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.530
 we walk the gods as easily as possible 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.780
 there are also uses for the 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.760
 tendon and then have santana here but that 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.800
 he just misses and yet the weather is yellow 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.790
 crested and why is the yellow 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.010
 given card 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.110
 simply because santana with his head 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.910
 against the dick of the defender to go 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.650
 I head they do not cut or 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.630
 so it was still the times that this kind 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.940
 shots and that saves the keeper 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.530
 very active scrub you this kind of simple 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.360
 shots with feline that something of 70 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.710
 shooting have no interest keeper 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.390
 two one 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.000
 so then we stand for we learn it 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.770
 know game for set of ronny and 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.210
 this kind of simple shots with a tasty cat 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.010
 and not to keep at all 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.040
 I mean but this shot is not at all 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.420
 hard but that keeper yes how he reacts 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.520
 abnormal and we have another chance here 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.140
 of ramos but windows then fall short 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.930
 good so he hits the bar more often 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.970
 but then you still have the beauty 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.380
 own goal as you see in this 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.390
 images I use a lot more the 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.190
 flank a lot more the fast players 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.870
 Aeswijn still here with a great one 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.670
 place god who turned so nice and but 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.560
 we missed that in the second half 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.990
 just nice by here window is like weather 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.700
 just take a little bit and obama with 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.710
 the five one I think is a speed 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.480
 make steam and go to Division 1 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.400
 fetch boys we go ff nice people 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.910
 irritate with the new team type 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.380
 ironic 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.600
 well as you see I use again 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.640
 albania to grow fat and then here 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.200
 another shot but it just goes wrong with it 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.270
 if he then presses, more will arise 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.490
 space here nice ball to feline 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.030
 of ramos and that is how he accomplished it 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.460
 makes 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.020
 work in feline just made rick ronnie 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.670
 appear in one piece because that is 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.890
 just too slow and assault you have one 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.240
 much less in this game he has there 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.400
 still a great shot but he 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.190
 fog then another 90th minute returned 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.860
