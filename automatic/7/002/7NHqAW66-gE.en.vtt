me a text but to teach us it have a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.099 
me a text but to teach us it have a
treat<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:18.060> you're<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.359> really<00:00:18.869> interested

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
treat that you're not really interested

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.630 
treat that you're not really interested
in<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.619> they're<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:19.980> you're<00:00:20.100> holding<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.460> oddly

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
in if they're if you're holding it oddly

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.439 
in if they're if you're holding it oddly
they<00:00:21.539> wander<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.140> obviously<00:00:22.859> that's<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
they wander off obviously that's not a

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.089 
they wander off obviously that's not a
reinforcement<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.960> really<00:00:25.199> tiny<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.769> mean<00:00:25.949> this

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
reinforcement so really tiny I mean this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
reinforcement so really tiny I mean this
is<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.369> almost<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> size<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.539> head<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
is like almost the size of the head of a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.779 
is like almost the size of the head of a
pin<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.320> my<00:00:28.439> dog<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:29.310> pieces<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
pin for my dog just pieces of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.849 
pin for my dog just pieces of
information<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.289> still<00:00:31.500> rang<00:00:31.740> them

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
information so get you still rang them

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.389 
information so get you still rang them
around<00:00:32.360> pull<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.450> head<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.780> over<00:00:33.960> there<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.399> if

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
around pull my head up over there but if

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.790 
around pull my head up over there but if
you<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.700> too<00:00:35.880> high<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.840> get<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> hand<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you do it too high you get a hand you

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.250 
you do it too high you get a hand you
get<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.180> standing<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.420> back<00:00:39.600> legs<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> do

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
get a standing up on back legs if you do

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.319 
get a standing up on back legs if you do
it<00:00:40.350> too<00:00:40.500> low<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.820> some<00:00:42.180> other

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
it too low you get it down or some other

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.299 
it too low you get it down or some other
weird<00:00:42.660> behavior<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> human

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
weird behavior so it's really the human

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
weird behavior so it's really the human
getting<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> behavior<00:00:47.820> practice<00:00:48.510> lifting

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
getting the behavior practice lifting

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
getting the behavior practice lifting

the<00:01:22.630> pretend<00:01:23.020> treat<00:01:23.429> more<00:01:24.429> than<00:01:24.459> into<00:01:24.939> the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
the pretend treat more than into the

down from a stand you just push the tree

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.169 
down from a stand you just push the tree
to<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.689> diagonal<00:01:38.049> yes<00:01:39.240> yes<00:01:40.500> yes<00:01:41.700> yes<00:01:42.700> if<00:01:43.030> they

to the diagonal yes yes yes yes if they

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.539 
to the diagonal yes yes yes yes if they
get<00:01:43.360> up<00:01:43.479> oh<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:44.259> know<00:01:44.379> they<00:01:45.099> work<00:01:45.250> together

oh all done no more treats so the next

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.949 
oh all done no more treats so the next
step<00:01:48.489> is<00:01:48.729> hand<00:01:49.659> signal<00:01:50.079> equals<00:01:50.439> sit<00:01:50.770> yes<00:01:52.679> yes

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
step is hand signal equals sit yes yes

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
yes treat so they never know whether

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.789 
yes treat so they never know whether
it's<00:04:12.489> gonna<00:04:12.670> get<00:04:12.880> harder<00:04:13.269> or<00:04:13.510> easier<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:14.620> way

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
it's gonna get harder or easier that way

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.500 
it's gonna get harder or easier that way
they<00:04:15.010> stay<00:04:15.250> excited<00:04:15.579> and<00:04:15.970> interested<00:04:16.239> in

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
they stay excited and interested in

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.849 
they stay excited and interested in
having<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.169> great<00:04:17.350> time

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
having a great time

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.759 
having a great time
so<00:04:18.459> it's<00:04:18.609> flash<00:04:18.820> I've<00:04:19.030> worked<00:04:19.269> on<00:04:19.500> moving<00:04:20.500> at

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
so it's flash I've worked on moving at

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.040 
so it's flash I've worked on moving at
different<00:04:20.829> speeds<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:22.000> know<00:04:22.120> try<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.450> move<00:04:22.870> as

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
different speeds you know try to move as

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.810 
different speeds you know try to move as
organically<00:04:23.740> as<00:04:23.860> possible<00:04:24.400> don't<00:04:24.610> do<00:04:24.789> a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
organically as possible don't do a

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.390 
organically as possible don't do a
robotic<00:04:25.479> one<00:04:25.990> two<00:04:26.289> three<00:04:26.560> steps<00:04:26.830> away<00:04:27.010> turn

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
robotic one two three steps away turn

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.050 
robotic one two three steps away turn
around

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
around

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.909 
around
otherwise<00:04:28.539> your<00:04:28.840> dog<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.169> gonna<00:04:29.320> get<00:04:29.530> up<00:04:29.710> if

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
you move normally or maybe you're

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.529 
you move normally or maybe you're
carrying<00:04:32.080> groceries<00:04:32.800> or<00:04:33.090> if<00:04:34.090> you're<00:04:34.270> carrying

carrying groceries or if you're carrying
their<00:04:34.780> ball<00:04:34.990> maybe<00:04:35.530> they're<00:04:35.740> not<00:04:35.860> gonna<00:04:36.039> stay

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
their ball maybe they're not gonna stay

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
not gonna apply at the park so you need

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.670 
not gonna apply at the park so you need
