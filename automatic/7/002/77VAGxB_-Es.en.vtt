my experience with cyber learning
started<00:00:06.660> pretty<00:00:07.660> much<00:00:07.870> as<00:00:08.050> a<00:00:08.080> result<00:00:08.290> of<00:00:08.710> being

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
started pretty much as a result of being

Kenny Jonah from Northwestern speak and
he<00:00:17.230> talked<00:00:17.500> about<00:00:17.849> using<00:00:18.849> remote<00:00:19.000> labs<00:00:19.420> and<00:00:19.810> to

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
he talked about using remote labs and to

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.769 
he talked about using remote labs and to
me<00:00:20.289> that<00:00:20.499> was<00:00:20.529> fascinating<00:00:21.249> because<00:00:21.699> a<00:00:22.539> huge

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
me that was fascinating because a huge

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.339 
me that was fascinating because a huge
interest<00:00:23.079> of<00:00:23.289> mine<00:00:23.560> is<00:00:24.480> bringing<00:00:25.480> real<00:00:25.839> life

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
interest of mine is bringing real life

interest of mine is bringing real life
instruments<00:00:27.130> into<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.579> classroom<00:00:28.179> I<00:00:28.359> look

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
instruments into the classroom I look

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.450 
instruments into the classroom I look
around<00:00:28.749> my<00:00:29.079> classroom<00:00:29.679> and<00:00:29.800> I<00:00:29.919> see<00:00:30.099> my<00:00:30.220> kids

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
cylinders and in the real world they're

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.069 
cylinders and in the real world they're
working<00:00:34.180> with<00:00:34.210> instruments<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:34.930> are<00:00:34.989> a

them off to college I think they're not

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.490 
them off to college I think they're not
really<00:00:40.360> getting<00:00:40.630> what<00:00:41.020> they're<00:00:41.140> supposed<00:00:41.410> to

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
really getting what they're supposed to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.170 
really getting what they're supposed to
be<00:00:41.650> getting<00:00:41.770> out<00:00:42.130> of<00:00:42.160> their<00:00:42.580> public<00:00:42.910> school

be getting out of their public school
education<00:00:43.360> I<00:00:44.080> want<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.410> give<00:00:44.560> them<00:00:44.770> access<00:00:45.100> to

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
education I want to give them access to

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.880 
education I want to give them access to
instruments<00:00:46.900> that<00:00:47.020> I'll<00:00:47.170> never<00:00:47.410> be<00:00:47.620> able<00:00:47.740> to

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
instruments that I'll never be able to

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.940 
instruments that I'll never be able to
afford<00:00:48.010> in<00:00:48.430> my<00:00:48.550> classroom

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
afford in my classroom

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
afford in my classroom
the<00:00:50.550> idea<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.940> remote<00:00:51.270> labs<00:00:51.630> the<00:00:52.020> concept

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the idea of remote labs the concept

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.190 
the idea of remote labs the concept
behind<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.950> is<00:00:53.780> students<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:54.870> anywhere

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
behind it is students from anywhere

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.410 
behind it is students from anywhere
around<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.620> world<00:00:55.650> could<00:00:56.310> go<00:00:56.550> online<00:00:56.700> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
around the world could go online and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.840 
around the world could go online and
they<00:00:58.140> could<00:00:58.290> access<00:00:58.470> an<00:00:58.800> instrument<00:00:59.340> remotely

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
they could access an instrument remotely

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.990 
they could access an instrument remotely
so<00:01:00.570> they're<00:01:01.050> able<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.710> pick<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.310> variables

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so they're able to pick the variables

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.610 
so they're able to pick the variables
that<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.630> change<00:01:03.870> they're<00:01:04.320> able<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
that they want to change they're able to

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.740 
that they want to change they're able to
set<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> parameters<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> experiment<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
set the parameters of the experiment and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.020 
set the parameters of the experiment and
go<00:01:07.590> through<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> process<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> scientific

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
go through the process of scientific

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.440 
go through the process of scientific
design<00:01:10.250> by<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.790> accessing<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
design by really accessing the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
design by really accessing the
instrument<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> virtual<00:01:14.040> lab<00:01:14.250> it's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
instrument it's not a virtual lab it's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120 
instrument it's not a virtual lab it's
not<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.390> lab<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> simulation<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
not a can lab it's not a simulation you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.700 
not a can lab it's not a simulation you
can<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.150> instrument<00:01:18.630> moving<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.500> can

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
can see the instrument moving you can

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
can see the instrument moving you can
watch<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.220> experiment<00:01:20.760> running<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
watch your experiment running and the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.400 
watch your experiment running and the
kids<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.200> fascinated<00:01:22.410> by<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.960> my<00:01:24.960> students

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
kids are fascinated by it so my students

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.310 
kids are fascinated by it so my students
right<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:25.770> are<00:01:26.009> working<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.450> radioactivity

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
right now are working on a radioactivity

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960 
right now are working on a radioactivity
lab<00:01:28.680> where<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.100> access<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.550> Geiger<00:01:29.940> counter

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
lab where they access a Geiger counter

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.080 
lab where they access a Geiger counter
in<00:01:30.509> Queensland<00:01:31.080> Australia<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.910> they're

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
in Queensland Australia and what they're

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.840 
in Queensland Australia and what they're
studying<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.930> actually<00:01:34.920> nuclear<00:01:35.250> chemistry

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
studying is actually nuclear chemistry

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.080 
studying is actually nuclear chemistry
and<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.990> effects<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.530> gamma<00:01:38.190> rays<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.820> beta

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and the effects of gamma rays and beta

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.060 
and the effects of gamma rays and beta
particles<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.720> alpha<00:01:39.990> particles<00:01:40.440> but<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.830> do

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
particles and alpha particles but we do

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.320 
particles and alpha particles but we do
it<00:01:41.250> under<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> subtext<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.160> your<00:01:44.820> cell

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
it under the subtext of is your cell

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.450 
it under the subtext of is your cell
phone<00:01:45.570> cell<00:01:45.990> phone<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> fry<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:46.710> brain

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
phone cell phone going to fry your brain

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.480 
phone cell phone going to fry your brain
now<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.420> cell<00:01:49.900> phone<00:01:50.110> doesn't<00:01:50.320> release<00:01:50.799> gamma

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
now a cell phone doesn't release gamma

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.190 
now a cell phone doesn't release gamma
radiation<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.360> actually<00:01:52.720> works<00:01:52.930> using

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
radiation it actually works using

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.340 
radiation it actually works using
microwave<00:01:53.950> radiation<00:01:54.790> but<00:01:55.330> what<00:01:55.930> they<00:01:56.080> learn

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
microwave radiation but what they learn

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.120 
microwave radiation but what they learn
is<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:56.979> all<00:01:57.159> electromagnetic<00:01:57.659> radiation

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is is that all electromagnetic radiation

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.090 
is is that all electromagnetic radiation
acts<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.729> similar<00:02:01.150> way<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:02.200> intensity<00:02:02.920> is

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
acts in a similar way that intensity is

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.010 
acts in a similar way that intensity is
proportional<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.820> one<00:02:04.360> over<00:02:04.390> distance

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
proportional to one over distance

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.390

squared<00:02:05.380> which<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> very<00:02:06.040> fancy

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
squared which is a very fancy

you step away from the source of

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.660 
you step away from the source of
radiation<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.739> less<00:02:11.920> intensity<00:02:12.459> you're

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
radiation the less intensity you're

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.180 
radiation the less intensity you're
going<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.060> receive<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.470> start<00:02:14.770> off<00:02:14.950> by

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
going to receive so we start off by

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.030 
going to receive so we start off by
asking<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.790> kids<00:02:16.260> how<00:02:17.260> many<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.800> sleep

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
asking the kids how many of you sleep

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.290 
asking the kids how many of you sleep
with<00:02:18.160> your<00:02:18.280> cell<00:02:18.520> phone<00:02:18.760> under<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:19.120> pillow

with your cell phone under your pillow

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.140 
with your cell phone under your pillow
and<00:02:19.630> all<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.860> kids<00:02:21.100> raise<00:02:21.370> their<00:02:21.640> hands

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
and all of the kids raise their hands

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.100 
and all of the kids raise their hands
and<00:02:22.660> as<00:02:23.820> our<00:02:24.820> lessons<00:02:25.239> go<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.840> we<00:02:25.930> learn

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and as our lessons go on and we learn

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.460 
and as our lessons go on and we learn
about<00:02:26.760> half<00:02:27.760> lives<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.660> different<00:02:29.050> types<00:02:29.200> of

eventually<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.970> they<00:02:37.120> run<00:02:37.420> an<00:02:37.540> experiment

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
eventually and they run an experiment

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.170 
eventually and they run an experiment
they<00:02:38.380> set<00:02:38.709> up<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.130> scientific<00:02:39.610> design<00:02:39.910> by

they set up the scientific design by

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.900 
they set up the scientific design by

to and come back the next day we do peer
review<00:02:55.360> which<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.720> something<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.200> you

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
review which is something that you

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.080 
review which is something that you
rarely<00:02:56.620> ever<00:02:56.829> get<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.940> high<00:02:58.030> school

collaborate and talk about their results

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.130 
collaborate and talk about their results
and<00:03:02.350> decide<00:03:02.970> was<00:03:03.970> your<00:03:04.180> data<00:03:04.450> better<00:03:04.930> than

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
and decide was your data better than

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.699 
and decide was your data better than
mine<00:03:05.410> what<00:03:05.860> did<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.190> try<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.959> work<00:03:08.380> with<00:03:08.590> what

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
mine what did you try to work with what

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.039 
mine what did you try to work with what
were<00:03:08.829> your<00:03:08.980> variables<00:03:09.579> how<00:03:10.360> many<00:03:10.510> distances

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
were your variables how many distances

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.840 
were your variables how many distances
did<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.350> select<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.010> maybe<00:03:12.190> why<00:03:12.430> was<00:03:12.610> yours

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
did you select and maybe why was yours

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.509 
did you select and maybe why was yours
better<00:03:13.120> than<00:03:13.329> mine<00:03:13.540> there's<00:03:14.440> not<00:03:14.680> one<00:03:15.010> right

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
better than mine there's not one right

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.120 
better than mine there's not one right
answer<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:17.079> students<00:03:17.500> really<00:03:17.769> get<00:03:18.070> a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
answer but the students really get a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.680 
answer but the students really get a
chance<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.640> talk<00:03:18.790> about<00:03:19.000> maybe<00:03:19.360> where<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
chance to talk about maybe where the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.900 
chance to talk about maybe where the
weaknesses<00:03:19.870> were<00:03:20.380> in<00:03:20.620> their<00:03:20.910> experimental

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
weaknesses were in their experimental

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.449 
weaknesses were in their experimental

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
setup then they go back home again they

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.670 
setup then they go back home again they
work<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:25.209> second<00:03:25.630> run<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.110> experiment

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
work on a second run of the experiment

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.890 
work on a second run of the experiment
and<00:03:26.769> what<00:03:26.920> we're<00:03:27.070> seeing<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.900> their

and what we're seeing is their

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.080 
and what we're seeing is their
scientific<00:03:29.680> design<00:03:30.100> dramatically<00:03:30.700> improves

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
scientific design dramatically improves

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.720 
scientific design dramatically improves
the<00:03:31.660> fact<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:31.959> they<00:03:32.109> got<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.650> do<00:03:33.010> peer<00:03:33.340> review

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
the fact that they got to do peer review

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.860 
the fact that they got to do peer review
and<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.030> fact<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.329> they<00:03:34.480> have<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.630> lot<00:03:34.840> of

of<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:26.380> for<00:04:26.770> now<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.610> safer<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.360> get<00:04:28.840> the

cell phone away from your brain and

that's going to work wireless and be

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.250 
that's going to work wireless and be
very<00:04:35.800> very<00:04:36.100> close<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.640> their<00:04:36.850> brain<00:04:37.660> in<00:04:37.960> their

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
very very close to their brain in their

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.790 
very very close to their brain in their
ear<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.490> think<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.960> was<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.140> topic<00:04:41.470> that

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
ear so I think that it was a topic that

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.040 
ear so I think that it was a topic that
caught<00:04:42.100> their<00:04:42.250> interest<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:42.940> they<00:04:43.720> really

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
caught their interest and they really

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.399 
caught their interest and they really
seemed<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.350> enjoy<00:04:44.440> what<00:04:44.800> they<00:04:44.890> were<00:04:44.950> learning
