00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
hooked end is quite elaborate you can

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
hooked end is quite elaborate you can
see<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> patterns<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.939> need

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
see all the patterns around it we need

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
see all the patterns around it we need
to<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.780> sure<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.350> nothing<00:01:25.830> sticks

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to make really sure that nothing sticks

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
to make really sure that nothing sticks
to<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.820> otherwise<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> be

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to it because otherwise it's going to be

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.960 
to it because otherwise it's going to be
really<00:01:27.840> difficult<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.500> take<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:29.850> I'm

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
