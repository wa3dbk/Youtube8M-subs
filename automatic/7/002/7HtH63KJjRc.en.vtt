which<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.700> expect<00:00:39.000> any<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.390> them

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
which I don't really expect any of them

which I don't really expect any of them
to<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.379> 90<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.100> higher<00:00:41.129> besides<00:00:41.670> Chris

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to be at a 90 or higher besides Chris

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
to be at a 90 or higher besides Chris
Paul<00:00:42.210> because<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> screen<00:00:43.829> Tony

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
Paul because you can see the screen Tony

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.119 
Paul because you can see the screen Tony
Parker<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:44.969> 88<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> Chris<00:00:46.230> Paul<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.469> better

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
Parker is at 88 and Chris Paul is better

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400

than<00:00:47.280> Tony<00:00:47.460> Parker<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.270> say<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.230> i'm

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
than Tony Parker I would say so i'm

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.979 
than Tony Parker I would say so i'm
thinking<00:00:49.440> Chris<00:00:49.980> Paul<00:00:50.190> could<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> last<00:00:50.989> 90

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
thinking Chris Paul could be the last 90

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.930 
thinking Chris Paul could be the last 90
overall<00:00:52.440> player<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.980> every<00:00:53.100> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.520> shocking

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
overall player in every kind of shocking

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
overall player in every kind of shocking
design<00:00:54.149> ever<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.230> been

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
design ever just think about it has been

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
design ever just think about it has been
the<00:00:55.530> fourth<00:00:55.829> best<00:00:56.160> player<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> game<00:00:56.960> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the fourth best player in the game but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900 
the fourth best player in the game but
either<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.559> Tim<00:00:58.800> Duncan<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.579> guess<00:00:59.730> Tim

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
either is Tim Duncan but I guess Tim

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
either is Tim Duncan but I guess Tim
Duncan<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.270> had<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> great<00:01:00.629> season<00:01:00.960> last<00:01:01.140> year

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
Duncan just had a great season last year

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.250 
Duncan just had a great season last year
