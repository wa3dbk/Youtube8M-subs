 really dedicated to the villages 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 very strange that we find online 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.010
 Well today I will show you some of these 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.710
 villages that I myself have some gods 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.109
 my friends have found online and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.600
 i'm really very very very much 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.699
 weird before this video starts 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.099
 I wanted to ask if we enrolled me 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.070
 could do a little animation between 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.469
 each clip like a big big one 2 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.540
 oh well you understand 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.059
 using 4d cinema another 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 3d animation program has if 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.550
 possible the winner or the one who gives it to me 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.100
 will do will have advertising from me for 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 his channel will sponsor him in one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.140
 of my videos guys if one of you 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.829

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.970
 I'll give them the coordinates for skype stuff 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.550
 varies for all those who are me 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.920
 xbox requests on skype on xbox or 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.640
 so on the wan you can follow me like 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.750
 followers do n't need 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.460
 respond to your request 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.190
 friendship for those who are on three 60s 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.520
 I 'm sorry I can't do anything yet 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.530
 for skype it remains a private thing between me 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.750
 and who I want to put therefore leave 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.630
 then I still don't tell you the name 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.390
 let's start with a first clip of a villa 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.970
 dumb bizarre way as you see here the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.229
 mou is really protected by a 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:39.200
 a billion walls more or less the wire is 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:44.720
 also very heavy as you see in more than 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.369
 400,000 in each that between elixir and gold a 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.860
 really nice village ad 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.390
 attack that found a friend of mine 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.539
 by chance 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.970
 let's move on to village number two a 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.869
 village that I caught during one 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.740
 war 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.290
 Well, as you can see nothing strange here 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.659
 if not for the barracks on level 1 and the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.220
 home so even at level 1 that 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.060
 this really shows that this 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.530
 gem person but really gem 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.780
 many of you tell me that I groan too 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.610
 but I already today on a regular basis and then the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.829
 I moan only with points up bouncing cells 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.739
 the cards of a daddy discharge is the only one 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:27.290
 what if not I do n't do not eat in a 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.690
 such a level is really as absurd as 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 you see here really has it all to the max 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.060
 apart from the barracks that really one 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.709
 a ridiculous thing for such a high level 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.180
 we pass the village number 3 a new one 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.860
 village of another person that yes 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.530
 he sees that it is really very bad 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.630
 because as you see at immune level 10 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.360
 which is a really useless thing seen at 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.170
 level of defense because the for 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.980
 pass of next mounir there is a 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.570
 in short, a certain logic if one passes by 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.820
 olive tree level to say that all 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.330
 defenses are at maximum including also 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.160
 the extracts 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.440
 Well here we really have for example 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.120
 otherwise you see that the guy did it 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.920
 hell bearer narco hicks why 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.230
 they looked beautiful and then the rest 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.110
 he really did leave the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.670
 gold extractors and those of ellis in 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.780
 sorry gold mines 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.760
 we pass to the village number 4 a 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.300
 very bizarre village they understood 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.670
 what the guy wanted to do in short is a 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.870
 village that really the wall up 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.010
 placed at the very end of the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.610
 village of the world if we can say 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.740
 so I don't really know what was on his mind 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.330
 but it's very strange 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.300
 we pass the number 5 in the village 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.459
 village that looks a bit like it though 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.459
 he didn't know he wanted to put in 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.560
 isolation the mines over there without 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.260
 no defense is enough to pay even a 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.740
 ace the fall does the work itself is 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.650
 really another village where the 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.820
 bud person with no without none 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.850
 sense 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.060
 we pass to the village number 6 if not 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.730
 like a crap sis you are another 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.160
 village still bizarre as you see 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.560
 here the guy really wants to protect 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.330
 his municipality and its resources 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.590
 really makes it to the maximum 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.840
 inside the walls the rest 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.609
 really cares also leaves 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.910
 defended more or less on almost all of them 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.380
 defended outside and 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.690
 and here is truly a village 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.060
 strange we pass by the village number 7 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.470
 an even more absurd mirage like 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.470
 see the guy mentioned but here 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.380
 really at astronomical astro levels has 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.950
 ice cream really really upgraded 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.720
 all the defenses he could that he could 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.520
 do as you see here at the level mortar 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.850
 7 the tower dos trigona level 8 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.190
 really strange and really things 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.200
 look also there now there are many 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.620
 walls and level 1 really a village 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:01.480
 horrible and without any sense 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.530
 let's move on to the village number 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:09.250
 7 8 9 9 an even stranger village 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:14.810
 as you can see I have really sinned a 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.790
 village I know it was some kind of 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.660
 written on purpose because one of the 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.160
 the clan is called mfg so I know that 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.660
 they certainly did it on purpose though 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.850
 truly a web village by the fire 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.889
 when you look for a village to attack 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.490
 and you do not expect it we just move on to 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.630
 village number 10 a village still 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.389
 comes ripe if we can that forward 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.320
 as you see here he has made a double 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:41.480
 layer of mules and a bit funny and has 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.660
 truly reader of influential strings x20 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.419
 placed in cabbage and some defenses 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.240
 really at a very very low level 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.860
 let's move on to village number 11 and this one 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.180
 no one really expected this 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.310
 is a small bonus that I propose to you 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.380
 why not find so many of villages 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.180
 when it attacks then I propose it for you 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.410
 the animations don't worry it lowers 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.330
 up to 10 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.880
 this one here still a very village 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.160
 very strange as you see wanted to do 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.740
 of a cool defense but in short it is not 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.680
 really successful with the walls you see 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.630
 really 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.979
 a horrible aesthetic within the walls level 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.669
 2 level 4 level 5 level 6 level 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.350
 3 really a crappy thing because 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.600
 meaningless, let's move on to the last one 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.100
 village as close as was proposed 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.380
 from a friend of mine who really did 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.449
 affixed to the village as you see it is 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.130
 a good I do not tell you I think that more or 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.460
 minus all you have understood 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.870
 and okay i think it's not really the 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.800
 kind of village you can 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.210
 meet online because I don't think that 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.009
 then how do I do such a thing though 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.860
 he wanted it to do so just for 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.110
 laughing so much will have changed it well 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.550
 guys i hope this top 10 web there 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.880
 both liked it left a like is a 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:58.930
 comment and in the future I'll explain a little 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.900
 as we will do in the next top 10 for per 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.280
 immune so so, more or less perhaps all 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.789
 you will participate 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.910
 it will be a way to show yours 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:11.169
 video more or less to my community well 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:15.210
 guys i hope this video is 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.210
 liked but still does everything is beautiful
