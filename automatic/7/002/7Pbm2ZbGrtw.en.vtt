00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 to the people who are ready and I hope that 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.040
 well I am from micheletti that we are in 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.600
 a new trick of gta 5 online this time 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.830
 a trick to fly or to stick to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.540
 jump with the car as you want 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 Call it emotional before commenting 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.690
 tell you that of all the tricks I 've 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.370
 uploaded from pasting mega jumps with the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.049
 cars I think this is the most billet or 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.250
 be this the car arrives doing this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.869
 trick reaches a few distances 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.880
 Harsh high bone is 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.710
 awesome some guys that we have 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.939
 what to do then very easy the only thing 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 only drawback of this trick is that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.150
 we have to get a tank worth 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.070
 so then we get caught 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.630
 tank and if possible we put in 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.189
 an area that is clear as I do 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.510
 I made a voucher so that the traffic did not 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.250
 interrupt when doing the trick 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.210
 It's worth it because if you put a car 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.739
 someone ahead of us can 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 interrupt so good we have 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 what to do then we put the tank that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.840
 this trick can do it ahead or 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 from the front or from the part 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 back of the tank is good then 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.879
 because we take a car it is possible a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.170
 car that is short is worth a sports car and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.700
 anything because we have to do we 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 we put in front or behind the tank and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.719
 before hitting us against the tank that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.340
 what the trick is about, we have to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.410
 changing character is worth maikel to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.149
 trevor or franklin here you want and when 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.379
 go to change the character you give him and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.359
 a screen will appear on the screen 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.920
 that will make you want to leave gta 5 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.690
 online and go to the story mode because 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.370
 obviously if you change character 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.630
 story and then you have to give it 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.400
 it stayed and as soon as you give it to him 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.230
 accelerate forward and I'll crash 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.850
 against the tank is worth and then it would come out 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.300
 flying at a distance from hulking 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.710
 high and very young because why is it 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.420
 produces this trick not because it is 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.180
 flying when you do that because 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.160
 when you do when you think of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.050
 character and you give that you do not want 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.150
 change for two three four or five 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.490
 seconds you are totally invincible in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.690
 the game is worth then then if you are 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 invincible and you crash into a tank 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.840
 Well, it's assumed that if you were not 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 invincible you would have to explode but 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.930
 and those are invincible second is 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.550
 produces a kind of bus in which 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.410
 you hit the ground and the tank to the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.970
 time and then then you shoot for 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.110
 I do not understand why, but it's like that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.220
 so nothing guys, this has been 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.650

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.790
