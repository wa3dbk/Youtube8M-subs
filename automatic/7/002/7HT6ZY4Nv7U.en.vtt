00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.850
 two and a half years after a second 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.280
 successful episode the motorstorm license 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.740
 comes back with a third episode yet 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.080
 more ambitious over the palms the 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.939
 sunset setting the pretty scenery spot 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.619
 to the large-scale apocalypse a 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.880
 background that can be bad taste 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.579
 right now considering the current times 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.470
 but it seems like it's fashionable case 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.060
 impossible not to think just 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.100
 sale price of disney released the year 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.470
 last and who had assured the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.180
 show in this third installment of 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.780
 motorstorm and imagine that the end of 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.340
 world is close 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.170
 buildings collapse 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.120
 refineries explodes the boats sink 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.980
 and people scream hive antenna 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.420
 but while some are trying to 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.789
 to flee to try to 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.859
 survive from prefers to take advantage of this chaos 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.230
 total to organize in band and in 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.820
 China and extreme races that's 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.370
 one of the novelties of the game to know 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 tell us a semblance of scenario 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.850
 unpublished in the series it is true 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.770
 this one is also quite clumsy 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.810
 not to say to your fault with 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.650
 rocky dubious design and barely 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.490
 animated on this aircraft carrier ya all 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.200
 vehicles 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.730
 however we will follow three pilots 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 each corresponding to a level of 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.690
 difficulty that's how starts the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.150
 famous fashion festival has also experienced under 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.220
 the designation of career otherwise 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.900
 motorstorm apocalypse can count on 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.640
 its frantic races that allow for 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.830
 to drive different types of cars 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.890
 so we pass from one case glowing a 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.350
 4/4 imposing going through the jeep on 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.710
 pick up the buggy the quad or even 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.030
 the motorbike 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.130
 each vehicle has its own 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.900
 piloting it will have to adapt very 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.930
 quickly to not finish planted in 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.000
 the decor as the old shutters 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.380
 motorstorm apocalypse offers its lot 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.300
 of different branches which 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.690
 ensures a certain variety of a turn to 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.130
 the other 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.900
 be careful though 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.000
 catastrophes dramatically changes the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.680
 route and some paths are no longer 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.790
 accessible after a landslide while 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.450
 that other new ones are doing their 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.890
 appearance 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.080
 to tell you that you have to be 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 continually on the lookout for the slightest 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.460
 gap and that's the fall in the ravine where 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.840
 the recess against a wall must 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.399
 also keep an eye on its engine 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.040
 in responsive to different temperatures 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.380
 and which allows the use of a boost 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.480
 for the less useful like the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860
 motorstorm pacific rift the idea of 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.660
 find the water points on the road 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.580
 to cool its engine 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.160
 while the flames are to be avoided 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.900
 not to blow it up 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.700
 if motorstorm 3 ensures the show 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.200
 thanks to the fluidity of all 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.820
 moments and races where we take 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.670
 it's not totally 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.050
 the case when it comes to graphics 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.910
 without being unpleasant to the eye 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.860
 the evolution title studios start 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.630
 all nam showed his limits with a 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.400
 because design not really attractive and 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.420
 textures that sometimes lack 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.190
 fineness 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.260
 but fans of the series and running 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.750
 Frenzy will forgive this default menu 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.900
 because the show is well and truly 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.900
 you 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.530
 I kill 15 of 20
