hi<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.380> thought<00:00:01.589> surely<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.070> four-way<00:00:02.550> surge

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hi I thought surely this four-way surge

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.599 
hi I thought surely this four-way surge

I had this year and I was going to
repair<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> because<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.839> know<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.320> these

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
repair it because I know one of these

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800 
repair it because I know one of these
sockets<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.250> faulty<00:00:17.640> than<00:00:17.850> neutral<00:00:18.270> pin<00:00:18.449> isn't

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810

exactly a good model where one of these

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.900 
exactly a good model where one of these
was<00:01:30.000> actually<00:01:30.390> shorting<00:01:30.900> out<00:01:31.700> because<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
was actually shorting out because of the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.180 
was actually shorting out because of the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
the legs of these surge arresters is

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.480 
the legs of these surge arresters is

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
in apparently was a loud bang and all

Leger Center plunged into darkness so he

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.240 
Leger Center plunged into darkness so he
doesn't<00:01:47.460> look<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.150> a<00:01:48.210> one-off<00:01:49.250> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
doesn't look like this is a one-off so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.440 
doesn't look like this is a one-off so
if<00:01:50.730> you've<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.360> these<00:01:53.180> do<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.210> suffer

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
if you've got one of these do you suffer
