00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
score I look at it as if it would have

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.809 
score I look at it as if it would have
been<00:01:44.869> written<00:01:45.080> by<00:01:45.259> somebody<00:01:45.530> else<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.610> just

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
been written by somebody else and I just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.240 
been written by somebody else and I just
analyze<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:47.959> realize<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.739> sometimes<00:01:49.160> I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
analyze it I realize it sometimes I

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.279 
analyze it I realize it sometimes I
forgot<00:01:49.550> what<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.729> did<00:01:49.970> how<00:01:50.569> I<00:01:50.599> came<00:01:50.780> up<00:01:51.080> with

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
forgot what I did how I came up with

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.130 
forgot what I did how I came up with
that<00:01:51.679> idea<00:01:52.420> sometimes<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.509> discover<00:01:53.899> things

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
that idea sometimes I discover things

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.020 
that idea sometimes I discover things
because<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.619> know<00:01:54.739> the<00:01:54.920> unconsciousness<00:01:55.729> of

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
because you know the unconsciousness of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.169 
because you know the unconsciousness of
a<00:01:56.119> composer<00:01:56.479> somebody<00:01:57.459> if<00:01:58.459> it's<00:01:58.729> another<00:01:58.940> for

example if another conductor looks at my
score<00:02:01.429> he<00:02:01.550> will<00:02:01.670> see<00:02:01.819> things<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.239> I<00:02:02.269> have<00:02:02.539> not

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
score he will see things that I have not

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.949 
score he will see things that I have not
even<00:02:02.959> seen<00:02:03.550> so<00:02:04.550> if<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:04.970> wrote<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.209> piece<00:02:05.479> five

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
even seen so if I wrote a piece five

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.570 
even seen so if I wrote a piece five
years<00:02:06.170> ago<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.619> look<00:02:06.800> at<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.039> now<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.399> will

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
years ago and I look at it now I will

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.630 
years ago and I look at it now I will
also<00:02:07.819> be<00:02:08.330> able<00:02:08.509> probably<00:02:09.170> or<00:02:09.410> hopefully<00:02:10.340> to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
also be able probably or hopefully to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.280 
also be able probably or hopefully to
see<00:02:10.789> things<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.180> didn't<00:02:11.629> see<00:02:11.840> while

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
see things that I didn't see while

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:22.540 
see things that I didn't see while
writing<00:02:12.590> it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.830 

it<00:02:23.550> was<00:02:23.760> very<00:02:23.820> interesting<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
it was very interesting because in that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.340 
it was very interesting because in that
piece<00:02:25.140> there<00:02:25.460> more<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:27.510> me<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:27.990> when<00:02:28.170> I'm<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
piece there more with me so when I'm a

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.650 
piece there more with me so when I'm a
from<00:02:28.980> they<00:02:29.220> play<00:02:29.430> more<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.150> beat<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
from they play more on the beat but the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.050 
from they play more on the beat but the
other<00:02:30.840> piece<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.440> did<00:02:31.650> gamma<00:02:32.400> concert<00:02:32.850> I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
other piece I just did gamma concert I

other piece I just did gamma concert I
make<00:02:33.440> poor<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:37.200> because<00:02:37.650> of

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.910 
where the ideas come while working on
them<00:02:52.980> then<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.670> write<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.560> then<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.800> try

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
them then I write it down and then I try

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.000 
them then I write it down and then I try
to<00:02:56.130> reduce<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.850> its<00:02:57.240> minimal<00:02:58.020> expression

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to reduce it to its minimal expression

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.950 
to reduce it to its minimal expression
what<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.910> essence<00:03:00.210> of<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.480> idea<00:03:00.660> and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
what is the essence of that idea and

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.510 
what is the essence of that idea and
then<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.440> might<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:01.980> idea<00:03:02.340> for<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
then that might be the idea for the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:19.280 
then that might be the idea for the
piece<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.840> beginning

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.899 

I<00:03:21.230> really<00:03:22.230> don't<00:03:22.439> enjoy<00:03:22.739> experiments<00:03:23.700> in

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
I really don't enjoy experiments in

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.500 
I really don't enjoy experiments in
music<00:03:24.719> or<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:25.650> art<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.040> general<00:03:26.390> experiment<00:03:27.390> is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
music or in art in general experiment is

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.330 
music or in art in general experiment is
something<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.109> believe<00:03:28.829> should<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.069> done

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
something I believe should be done

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.300 
something I believe should be done
privately<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.469> not<00:03:31.469> to<00:03:31.590> impose<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.219> an

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
privately and not to impose it to an

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.640 
privately and not to impose it to an
audience<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.959> believe<00:03:33.959> an<00:03:34.079> audience<00:03:34.409> should

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
audience I believe an audience should

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.160 
audience I believe an audience should
have<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.549> right<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> see<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.480> finished<00:03:36.810> product

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
have the right to see a finished product

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.229 
have the right to see a finished product
that<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.650> absolutely<00:03:38.159> that<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.819> artist<00:03:39.150> is

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
that is absolutely that the artist is

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.229 
that is absolutely that the artist is
absolutely<00:03:39.569> convinced<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.230> works<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:42.030> might

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
absolutely convinced it works it might

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.849 
absolutely convinced it works it might
not<00:03:42.390> work<00:03:42.450> that's<00:03:43.019> that's<00:03:43.349> another<00:03:43.590> question

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
not work that's that's another question

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.080 
not work that's that's another question
but<00:03:44.220> i<00:03:44.250> think<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.609> artist<00:03:44.909> should<00:03:44.970> be

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
but i think the artist should be

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.410 
but i think the artist should be
convinced<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.159> the<00:03:47.670> best<00:03:47.849> i<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.030> do<00:03:48.269> with

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
convinced this is the best i can do with

00:03:48.420 --> 00:04:09.160 
convinced this is the best i can do with
that<00:03:48.450> idea
