00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:11.360
 hello this is my unboxing video of 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.519
 new hp envy x2 13 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.100
 so I have the slightly larger variant 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.240
 bought with 256 gb ssd and 8 gb ram and 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.289
 Now let's have a look like that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.810
 Turn off so I have the carton 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:42.690
 open 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:51.620
 let's times looks looks first to the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:55.579
 The right device must have this leaflet 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.579
 and a power supply 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.100
 equipped with one of the newer hp 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.950
 compounds from does not exist in my 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:16.780
 and last screw is very small 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:33.479
 also very light very good now continue 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:38.110
 the actual tablet is the device 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.720
 Full size HDMI port USB 2.0 micro 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.080
 USB connection 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.710
 The device is relatively heavy but 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.110
 It is made entirely of aluminum feels 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.679
 very valuable to jump connection one more 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:02:01.420
 USB 3.0 and a headphone jack there 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:06.729
 it still builds strength to a rocker 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:11.650
 off switch and of course the kick 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.200
 stood and it is an intel core im 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.959
 plaster that one of the first devices what 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.220
 the islands kho im has and what also 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.070
 I am completely fanless 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.390
 can not see anything here now 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.120
 suggesting a fan here is this 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.049
 keyboard body what shipped directly 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.370
 which is very good with the standard 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:43.420
 layout of hp what i like a lot already 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.920
 very nice with keyboard illumination 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.480
 and via bluetooth what i personally 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.640
 very well find 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.760
 much better than the keyboard always 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.780
 once infected on the device 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.049
 already a device that can 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.350
 what yes to protect I know 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.730
 practically all this looks now 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.730
 built up 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:16.340
 directly on so must vibrate 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.950
 ever turn on not bad 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.930
 Operation feedback so i just got it 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.670
 the keyboard successfully connected 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.250
 of course they should be here with the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.410
 turn on a switch three seconds 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:37.810
 bluetooth button press pin enter 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.810
 it already works in German 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.770
 as long as the pcs is set up then 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.980
 is still a couple of times 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.040
 the data to tell so I have 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.240
 a total of just over 900 euros for it 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.810
 paid that at 256 gigabytes and 8 gb 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.270
 R.A.M 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.270
 the service per 3 will be in the same 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.150
 equipment costs just under 500 euros more 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.080
 which is pretty much and I think 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.010
 For the price , the device is really good 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.720
 it happens the battery becomes relative 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.980
 they probably last a long time 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.880
 as with the service pro 3 the weight of the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.410
 higher 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.109
 There is clearly more than the service 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.300
 per 3 but on the advantage that everything 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.450
 made entirely of aluminum, I am very 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.310
 valent feel chic design is what 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.560
 I really like it 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:35.720
 the screen now has 13 3 inches something 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.240
 bigger what i like well i think it has two 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.430
 full hd resolution which definitely benefits 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.510
 you do not have anything tiny in the world 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.520
 desktop mode 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.270
 I actually use only right 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.270
 the desktop mode
