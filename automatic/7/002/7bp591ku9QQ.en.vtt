shut<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.750> rev<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.790> at<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.510> bottom<00:03:13.840> here<00:03:13.989> you

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
shut up rev up so at the bottom here you

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.900 
shut up rev up so at the bottom here you
have<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.319> little<00:03:14.530> trigger<00:03:14.769> switch<00:03:15.130> when<00:03:15.880> you

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
you're leaning this remote the try bot

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.460 
you're leaning this remote the try bot
is<00:03:22.180> going<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.420> try<00:03:22.630> moving<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:23.050> direction<00:03:23.170> so

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
is going to try moving that direction so

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.660 
is going to try moving that direction so
you<00:03:23.680> can<00:03:23.830> tilt<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.130> right

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
you can tilt it right

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.759 
you can tilt it right
tilt<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.120> left<00:03:25.390> tilt<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.959> forward<00:03:25.989> or<00:03:26.410> tilt<00:03:26.620> it

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
tilt it left tilt it forward or tilt it

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.220 
tilt it left tilt it forward or tilt it
back<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.459> make<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.640> move<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.239> little<00:03:28.989> back<00:03:29.200> a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
back to make it move a little back a

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.320 
back to make it move a little back a
little<00:03:29.500> bit<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:31.360> we<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:31.870> test<00:03:32.080> him<00:03:32.290> out

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
little bit and we can just test him out

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.620 
little bit and we can just test him out
so<00:03:34.330> right<00:03:34.959> now<00:03:35.080> I'm<00:03:35.200> holding<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.560> pretty<00:03:35.799> level

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
so right now I'm holding it pretty level

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.820 
so right now I'm holding it pretty level
and<00:03:37.630> I'm<00:03:37.750> holding<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.080> trigger<00:03:38.319> down<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.680> can

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
and I'm holding the trigger down you can

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.300 
and I'm holding the trigger down you can
see<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.100> light<00:03:39.250> going<00:03:39.610> if<00:03:39.850> I<00:03:40.120> go<00:03:40.299> back<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:41.310> move

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
see the light going if I go back to move

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.690 
see the light going if I go back to move
back<00:03:44.430> I'm<00:03:45.430> moving<00:03:45.760> forward<00:03:47.549> takes<00:03:48.549> a<00:03:48.610> little

back I'm moving forward takes a little

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
back I'm moving forward takes a little
getting<00:03:48.790> used<00:03:49.269> to

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.900 

all<00:03:55.720> right<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.200> take<00:03:57.129> some<00:03:57.340> getting<00:03:57.580> used<00:03:57.610> to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
all right so take some getting used to

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.910 
all right so take some getting used to
but<00:03:58.030> with<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.780> little<00:03:58.930> practice<00:03:59.170> I'm<00:03:59.650> sure<00:03:59.680> you

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
but with a little practice I'm sure you

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.290 
but with a little practice I'm sure you
can<00:04:00.069> figure<00:04:00.280> out<00:04:00.400> how<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.760> get<00:04:00.940> this<00:04:01.090> guy

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
can figure out how to get this guy

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.229 
can figure out how to get this guy
moving<00:04:01.629> in<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.840> right<00:04:01.989> direction<00:04:06.239> okay

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
moving in the right direction okay

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.640 
moving in the right direction okay
something<00:04:07.780> else<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:08.080> thought<00:04:08.260> was<00:04:08.410> kind<00:04:08.620> of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
something else I thought was kind of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.460 
something else I thought was kind of
cool<00:04:08.830> here<00:04:09.069> is<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.849> on<00:04:10.030> this<00:04:10.300> remote<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:11.230> have

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
cool here is it on this remote you have

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.219 
cool here is it on this remote you have
a<00:04:11.769> program<00:04:12.459> button<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:16.180> then<00:04:16.870> over<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.079> you

a program button and then over here you

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.699 
a program button and then over here you
have<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> play<00:04:17.709> button<00:04:19.260> what<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.380> do<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.590> you

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709
