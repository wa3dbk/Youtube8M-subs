00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.370 
Australia and its surrounding islands
are<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.650> remaining<00:02:26.070> home<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.700> marsupials<00:02:30.380> do

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
are the remaining home of marsupials do

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.229 
are the remaining home of marsupials do
you<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:31.830> how<00:02:32.010> broadly<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.640> Pacific<00:02:33.090> is

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
you see how broadly the Pacific is

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.960 
you see how broadly the Pacific is
opening<00:02:33.780> compared<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> Atlantic<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.760> is

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
opening compared to the Atlantic this is

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.750 
opening compared to the Atlantic this is
exactly<00:02:36.570> why<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.989> knee-jerk<00:02:37.739> Pangaea<00:02:38.459> theory

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
exactly why the knee-jerk Pangaea theory

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.380 
exactly why the knee-jerk Pangaea theory
exists<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.380> Pacific<00:02:40.950> spread<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.820> too

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
exists the Pacific spread is too

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.170 
exists the Pacific spread is too
difficult<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.200> easily<00:02:43.739> visualize<00:02:44.459> because

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
difficult to easily visualize because

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.539 
difficult to easily visualize because
it's<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.049> big<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:49.320> Atlantic<00:02:49.860> spread<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.370> so

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
it's so big the Atlantic spread is so

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.060 
it's so big the Atlantic spread is so
obvious<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.630> child<00:02:52.049> would<00:02:52.290> recognize<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
obvious that a child would recognize it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:07.890 
obvious that a child would recognize it
but<00:02:53.880> they<00:02:54.120> are<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:55.290> same
