00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of this plane and y2 don't fly it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.650 
of this plane and y2 don't fly it
because<00:00:57.480> Francis<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.380> also<00:00:59.330> radio<00:01:00.330> control

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
because Francis is also radio control

pilot on board or so he said okay we
will<00:01:03.540> try<00:01:03.720> to<00:01:03.750> fly<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:04.830> detail<00:01:05.580> on

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
will try to fly it now the detail on

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
will try to fly it now the detail on
this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.270> amazing<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:07.110> ended<00:01:07.650> it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this is just amazing it ended it's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.859 
this is just amazing it ended it's
actually<00:01:08.160> an<00:01:08.610> aircraft<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> model

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
actually an aircraft to it's not a model

actually an aircraft to it's not a model
many<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.320> us<00:01:10.410> in<00:01:10.830> America<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.550> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
many of us in America make all these

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.609 
many of us in America make all these
models<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.450> we're<00:01:12.840> familiar<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> small

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
models and we're familiar with the small

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
models and we're familiar with the small
ones<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> buzz<00:01:14.280> around<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.060> an

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
ones that buzz around but this is an

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.540 
ones that buzz around but this is an
actual<00:01:15.420> aircraft<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.229> yeah<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> exactly

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
actual aircraft it's yeah it is exactly

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.920 
actual aircraft it's yeah it is exactly
scale<00:01:18.080> 17<00:01:19.080> scale<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> real<00:01:19.920> plane<00:01:20.280> we

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
scale 17 scale of the real plane we

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.999 
scale 17 scale of the real plane we
Francis<00:01:21.930> has<00:01:22.110> done<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.410> with<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.800> catcher

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
Francis has done it with the catcher

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.400 
Francis has done it with the catcher
drawing<00:01:23.550> so<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> full-size<00:01:24.840> drawing<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> the

drawing so the full-size drawing of the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.070 
drawing so the full-size drawing of the
airplane<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.759> exactly<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.570> same<00:01:27.750> the

because<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.440> airplane<00:02:10.950> use<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:12.350> critical

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
because the airplane use a critical

landing speed and takeoff speed will be
to<00:02:21.360> higher<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.709> decide<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> use<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> more

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
to higher so we decide to use a more

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.170 
to higher so we decide to use a more
conventional<00:02:24.299> airfoil<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:26.489> also<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.940> wing

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
conventional airfoil so also the wing

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.860 
conventional airfoil so also the wing
area<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.680> bit<00:02:29.040> increase<00:02:29.600> because<00:02:30.600> it

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
area is a little bit increase because it

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
area is a little bit increase because it
well<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.230> looks<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.709> little<00:02:32.100> too<00:02:32.400> small<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.060> fly

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
well it looks a little too small to fly

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.140 
well it looks a little too small to fly
it<00:02:33.630> saving<00:02:33.930> yeah<00:02:34.440> now<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.250> flying<00:02:35.579> part<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.970> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
it saving yeah now the flying part is so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.420 
it saving yeah now the flying part is so
far<00:02:36.420> you're<00:02:36.540> holding<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.380> controller<00:02:38.100> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
the controller it is it is a difficult

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.910 
the controller it is it is a difficult
aircraft<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.269> fly<00:02:42.450> exactly<00:02:43.320> like

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
momo duraflame it's a little more

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.910

in<00:02:53.780> our<00:02:54.320> involve<00:02:54.740> worldwide<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:56.210> it<00:02:56.300> flies

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
in our involve worldwide so it flies

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.530 
in our involve worldwide so it flies
exactly<00:02:57.050> like<00:02:57.260> jet<00:02:58.070> like<00:02:58.460> a<00:02:58.490> Raphael<00:02:59.000> or<00:02:59.270> mere

sees<00:03:29.510> me<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> very<00:03:29.989> similar<00:03:30.320> i<00:03:30.350> am<00:03:30.709> also<00:03:30.890> a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
sees me to a very similar i am also a

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.760 
sees me to a very similar i am also a
private<00:03:31.550> pilot<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.810> it's<00:03:33.020> very<00:03:33.380> similar<00:03:33.739> you

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
private pilot and it's very similar you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.640 
private pilot and it's very similar you
have<00:03:34.040> some<00:03:34.250> same<00:03:35.150> feeling<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:36.020> like<00:03:36.440> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
have some same feeling like like the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.890 
have some same feeling like like the
real<00:03:37.130> one<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:37.910> one<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.180> not<00:03:38.450> exactly<00:03:38.810> the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
real one this one is not exactly the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.690 
real one this one is not exactly the
same<00:03:39.170> as<00:03:39.290> i<00:03:39.410> said<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.680> which<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.340> some<00:03:40.550> wing

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
same as i said we which and some wing

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.150 
same as i said we which and some wing
section<00:03:41.120> or<00:03:41.330> so<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.930> inertia<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
section or so the inertia of the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.740 
section or so the inertia of the
airplane<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.550> not<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.790> same<00:03:43.970> as<00:03:44.030> or<00:03:44.300> airplane

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
airplane is not the same as or airplane

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.870 
airplane is not the same as or airplane
so<00:03:45.470> it's<00:03:45.590> not<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:46.250> have<00:03:46.400> not<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.670> same

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
so it's not you have not the same

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.449 
so it's not you have not the same
sensation<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.600> real<00:03:48.350> one<00:03:48.530> also<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.280> wrong

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
sensation of the real one also the wrong

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.030 
sensation of the real one also the wrong
one<00:03:49.640> is<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:50.440> controlled<00:03:51.440> by<00:03:51.560> computer

i ordain dynamic low than or your

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.640 
i ordain dynamic low than or your
airplane<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.780> was<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.989> same<00:04:15.140> sensation

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
airplane so it was the same sensation

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.409 
airplane so it was the same sensation
just<00:04:15.920> small<00:04:16.160> stalling<00:04:16.729> like<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.940> real<00:04:17.299> airplane

just small stalling like a real airplane

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.469 
just small stalling like a real airplane
and<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.590> exactly<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.220> same<00:04:19.400> as<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:20.090> full-size

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
and it's exactly the same as a full-size

to afford a real full size 7 x so how

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.890 
to afford a real full size 7 x so how
much<00:04:25.340> would<00:04:25.550> one<00:04:25.729> of<00:04:25.880> these<00:04:26.330> models<00:04:26.720> cause

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
much would one of these models cause
