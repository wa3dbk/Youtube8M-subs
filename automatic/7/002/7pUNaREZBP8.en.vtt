okay somebody here again with the
Lawrence<00:00:02.070> Elite<00:00:02.340> five<00:00:02.550> chirp<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.360> little

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
Lawrence Elite five chirp in a little

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.590 
Lawrence Elite five chirp in a little
bit<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.810> deeper<00:00:04.049> water<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.529> time<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:05.299> 98<00:00:06.299> feet

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
bit of deeper water this time a 98 feet

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.879 
bit of deeper water this time a 98 feet
here<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:08.450> found<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.690> chirp<00:00:10.080> didn't<00:00:10.469> work<00:00:10.620> as

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
here and found the chirp didn't work as

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.780 
here and found the chirp didn't work as
well<00:00:10.920> as<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.400> had<00:00:11.519> hoped<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.330> step<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
well as I had hoped out in this step I

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
well as I had hoped out in this step I
just<00:00:14.790> got<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.000> running<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.330> 200<00:00:15.809> kilohertz<00:00:16.080> now

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
just got it running on 200 kilohertz now

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.279 
just got it running on 200 kilohertz now
I<00:00:16.440> feel<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.279> that's<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> best<00:00:17.990> got<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.080> set

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
I feel like that's the best got it set

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.310 
I feel like that's the best got it set
up<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.619> split<00:00:19.949> zoom<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:21.750> zooming<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.080> four

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
up to split zoom so I'm zooming in four

200<00:00:25.529> kilohertz<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> right-hand<00:00:26.580> side

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
200 kilohertz is on the right-hand side

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.839 
200 kilohertz is on the right-hand side
there<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:29.220> I'll<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.490> show<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
there and I'll just show you the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.990 
there and I'll just show you the
difference<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:31.279> I'll<00:00:32.279> first<00:00:32.669> show<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> how

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
difference here I'll first show you how

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.580 
difference here I'll first show you how
I<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.270> set<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.600> because<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> found<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I have it set up because I found this to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.810 
I have it set up because I found this to
be<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> best<00:00:34.950> setting<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.149> 200<00:00:36.660> kilohertz

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
be the best setting so 200 kilohertz

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.720 
be the best setting so 200 kilohertz

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I should say sonar options a few guys

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.400 
I should say sonar options a few guys
around<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> put<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> noise<00:00:45.780> rejection<00:00:45.930> on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
around so I put the noise rejection on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.920 
around so I put the noise rejection on

you can see I can go fairly high with
that<00:01:25.049> chirp<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.549> I've<00:01:26.640> had<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:26.970> as

closest best was high chirp I'm gonna

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.560 
closest best was high chirp I'm gonna
put<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> show<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.540> that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
put that on just to show you what that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.760 
put that on just to show you what that
was<00:01:54.869> like

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and as you can see you really get a lot

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.840 
and as you can see you really get a lot
more<00:02:02.909> interference<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> screen<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.850> so

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
more interference on the screen there so

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:14.449 
more interference on the screen there so
my<00:02:05.970> set<00:02:06.149> sensitivity<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.140> 81<00:02:13.340> really<00:02:14.340> got

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
my set sensitivity is at 81 really got

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.750 
my set sensitivity is at 81 really got

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
to turn that down I'm you know to about

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.390 
to turn that down I'm you know to about
70s<00:02:17.760> about<00:02:17.880> where<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.150> could<00:02:18.360> handle<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:19.400> even

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
70s about where I could handle it even

70s about where I could handle it even
if<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.550> turn<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> color<00:02:21.060> line<00:02:21.330> up<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.290> echo<00:02:22.590> is

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
if I turn the color line up the echo is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.710 
if I turn the color line up the echo is
pretty<00:02:22.980> pretty<00:02:23.730> weak<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:30.030> definitely<00:02:30.569> get

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
pretty pretty weak you definitely get

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.190 
pretty pretty weak you definitely get
better<00:02:31.470> detail<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.750> not<00:02:36.959> as

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
better detail but it's just it's not as

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
amazing for that but I I definitely

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.479 
amazing for that but I I definitely
prefer<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.610> 200<00:02:57.090> kilohertz<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:58.130> this<00:02:59.130> deeper

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
prefer the 200 kilohertz in this deeper

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.789 
prefer the 200 kilohertz in this deeper
water<00:03:01.430> it's<00:03:02.430> definitely<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.239> best<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:04.049> to

mark<00:03:05.070> your<00:03:05.220> lure<00:03:05.400> from<00:03:06.359> what<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.600> found<00:03:09.410> right

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
mark your lure from what I found right

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.610 
mark your lure from what I found right
around<00:03:10.560> 80<00:03:10.920> percent<00:03:11.329> sensitivity<00:03:12.329> I'm<00:03:12.840> just

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
around 80 percent sensitivity I'm just

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.440 
around 80 percent sensitivity I'm just
using<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.920> small<00:03:14.070> little<00:03:14.489> two-inch<00:03:14.880> spoon<00:03:17.450> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
using a small little two-inch spoon so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.990 
using a small little two-inch spoon so
that's<00:03:18.570> basically<00:03:18.959> how<00:03:19.049> I'd<00:03:19.290> set<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.620> up<00:03:19.829> for

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
that's basically how I'd set this up for

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.360 
that's basically how I'd set this up for
the<00:03:21.000> deeper<00:03:21.840> water<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.530> elite<00:03:22.769> 5<00:03:23.010> chirp

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the deeper water on this elite 5 chirp

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.360 
the deeper water on this elite 5 chirp
and<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.140> say<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.350> think<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.769> 200<00:03:26.130> kilohertz

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and like I say I think the 200 kilohertz

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.180 
and like I say I think the 200 kilohertz
is<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.760> best<00:03:26.940> option
