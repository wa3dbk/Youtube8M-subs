 sure good dividends and lots 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.060
 nature in what they value the 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.540
 foreigners who buy to live are 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.670
 establish or not definitely 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.939
 with that goal many prefer 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.980
 then surf one 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.109
 they can not generate foreigners who have 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.930
 come here to the port varas and their 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.840
 surroundings fruit and all the water that 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.720
 old to live because it really is 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.790
 something quite nice and here too 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.859
 there are good good supermarkets 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.310
 medical services is with the techniques or 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:28.400
 the main hospitals are the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.329
 Americans with fortune have come to 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.790
 make inquiry that is for field 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:38.110
 exclusive properties in places 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.560
 pretty or a lot of nature 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:47.050
 and also Germans in second place 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.050
 in the third place I would say that they are French 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:55.110
 we live here five months per year here and 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.200
 seven months in germany changing from 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.340
 summer to summer of summer german to 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.960
 Chilean summer I like people here to 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:12.470
 times a little impute but with a lot 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.470
 darling and that is more important 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.370
 the greatest demand however is in 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.870
 santiago and the vineyard of the sea although for this 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.440
 sector the client is of one more profile 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.100
 young man from 35 to 55 years old professional 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.050
 executive and of neighboring countries in the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.540
 let's say investment level in Chile's 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.530
 foreigners increased notorious 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.080
 notoriously from 2012 2012 2013 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.150
 on the rise a very important rise 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.480
 almost 20 percent 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.600
 of the previous year in 2014 and we're 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.300
 starting the year with a good influx 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.270
 of public of these characteristics 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.030
 residing here you have an airport hub 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.460
 very good where you have direct connection 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.450
 with all the countries because I have very 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.040
 comfortable 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.110
 blasco a lot but I'm very comfortable 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.680
 because I have the airport I have all 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.380
 a fast infrastructure to access in 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.050
 a principle was also beneficial property 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.670
 who whenever you see or that is 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.060
 is watching in syfy cano 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.450
 I see that I do see almost your environment and 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:25.640
 breath certainly a hammock is the 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.560
 graphic that calm this tendency of the 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.150
 real estate market came about 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.190
 pages a few weeks ago in the 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.320
 prestigious new york times' that he stressed 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.450
 the offer of luxurious plots in the 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.580
 periphery of the capital with excellent 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.570
 connectivity thanks to the motorways 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.960
 urban areas and the good services that 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.110
 they do a pretty thorough study before 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.540
 to buy a property then 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.370
 they want everything to be well regulated but 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.930
 the price also is fair not 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.070
 they want to feel that people take advantage 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.860
 of them by the mere fact of being 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.630
 The newspaper's foreigners also observe 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.940
 that the purchase process is simple 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.590
 paying a credit in cash 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.330
 mortgage can be difficult to 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.040
 get to lose if the buyer 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.440
 foreigner does not have a contract 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.450
 permanent and a good salary 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.250
 most banks require that 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.470
 have been living here for at least a year 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.690
 in chile before giving them a credit 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.700
 so a foreigner who comes fresh 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.820
 coming to the country you need to attract your 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.220
 own resources 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.650
 another aspect that buyers and 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.750
 customers is the seriousness in business 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.260
 and the good educational level that 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:35.590
 find in chile let's say you do not 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:39.570
 I want to educate my children nation and I 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:44.020
 I think that today as a country it is much better 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:47.070
 Chile in Latin America is much better 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.070
 that Argentina in particular 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.319
 and nice people an ordered country of 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.389
 extraordinary natural settings 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:58.639
 they draw attention especially from 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.639
 foreigners who have traveled the world 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:06.069
 we know the rest of the world, Chile is a 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:09.539
 very nice country especially the south with 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:11.830
 many options for adventure sports 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.060
 here for example there is cloud and it is 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.150
 insuperable 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:20.860
 there are really very few places in 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:23.349
 the world where there is so much to fill the 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:27.310
 eyes of the spirit as you have 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:31.600
 here but one is born here 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:33.960
 it's a national thing you do not know what 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.960
 have 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.889
 in real estate our country has in 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:42.840
 these attractive moments offers and 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.939
 above all, good prices for 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.339
 foreign customers and that augurs that 

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:51.439
 the less you keep moving the 

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:51.439
 depressed real estate market chiles
