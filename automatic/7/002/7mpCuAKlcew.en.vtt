see<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> left<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.500> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.770> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
see to the left and this is what it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
see to the left and this is what it
looks<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.160> from<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> outside<00:00:22.010> it's<00:00:23.779> pretty

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
looks like from the outside it's pretty

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.630 
looks like from the outside it's pretty
hidden<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.350> guess<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.070> mean<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.369> doesn't<00:00:26.490> look

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
hidden I guess I mean it doesn't look

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.210 
hidden I guess I mean it doesn't look
like<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.660> hard<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> find

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
like it but it's kind of hard to find

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
like it but it's kind of hard to find
