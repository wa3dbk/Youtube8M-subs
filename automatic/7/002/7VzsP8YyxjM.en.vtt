00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello how I'm hero thunder the leader and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.850
 founder of the clan chris maxcy good I've 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.890
 returned to continue to make these videos 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.440
 of civilizations and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 talk about the Chinese they asked me a lot 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 this video because there are many good 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.970
 fans of the Chinese thing that I 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.369
 surprising but good let's start 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 the Chinese are the typical civilization 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.169
 hated by the novices because although their 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.599
 start is with more villagers 6 villagers 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.520
 to be exact although this confuses 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.680
 many newbies and even those who do not 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.140
 they play very often with this civilization 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.660
 although this beginning may be fine 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.720
 used if you are quick and clever clear 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.449
 It takes a lot of practice to start with 3 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.519
 other villagers but you have 150 left 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.140
 food which is the same as if you 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.320
 you would create it with the others 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.330
 civilizations these also subtract you 50 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.570
 of wood I do not know why but you 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.909
 subtract in version 1.0 begin in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.799
 total with 50 of food which you 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.869
 lets create a more villager and 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.030
 develop loom between already together 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:06.299
 50 food to follow production 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.409
 in version 1.0 they start with zero 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.299
 of food 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 in my initial opinion with Chinese is what 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 same as starting with sara breasts by 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.479
 example because the time you take in 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.610
 look for sheep kill them and put their 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.530
 food takes almost two minutes to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.370
 like creating three villagers with other 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.290
 civilizations 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.840
 but good the Chinese are a 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.090
 civilization of archers I compare 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.830
 much the Chinese with the English though 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.200
 the Chinese are more technologically 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.140
 better equipped although they have almost the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.640
 same units the good thing about the Chinese 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.790
 is that they have discounts on their 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.420
 technologies cost less 10% in feudal 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.000
 less 15% in castles and less 20% in 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.770
 imperial age so if you feel like 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.090
 wait you can wait at age 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.520
 imperial to develop the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.290
 technologies that will cost you less 20 per 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.100
 a hundred that in feudal they cost you 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.500
 minus 10% hahaha ok not your centers 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.720
 urban areas increase 10 population which 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.910
 when you create an urban center, it 's like 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.550
 create a common urban center of another 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.619
 civilization and a house and a 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.530
 bonus when playing as a team 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.710
 the Chinese have more than 45 of food in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.410
 their farms plus their villagers are created 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.570
 a little faster as I said before are 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.790
 a civilization of archers and like all 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.590
 Asian civilization has an excellent 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.510
 siege although of the four 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.430
 Asian civilizations the Chinese 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.090
 They have a lot to be desired if we talk about 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.099
 the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.080
 actions that he has in his siege that his 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.180
 scorpions and heavy scorpions 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.209
 they shoot faster than another scorpion 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.160
 heavy of another civilization to use 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.650
 Chinese I think you really have to 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.690
 like are a difficult civilization of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.879
 use in the background and in my opinion they are 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.970
 pretty fart so if you use Chinese 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.530
 it's because you really like them and good 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.959
 now I will talk about the good of this 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.660
 civilization in my opinion of course 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.060
 the Chinese have an excellent smithy 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.920
 the truth that no one can fault the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.560
 they have complete in their armors and 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.810
 attacks your units are almost 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.790
 complete quite passable let's say 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.590
 although he always left me a lot 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 wish because they could have the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.220
 less use but do not have but good 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.319
 the Asians are cheats in cavalry 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.629
 they have yeoman champions have 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.790
 all the archers complete except 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.430
 Manual gunners are not good at 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.560
 gunpowder so they do not have cannons either 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.750
 they have only light cavalry 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.000
 gentlemen and camels 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.640
 to win with Chinese you must use your 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.260
 archers and siege although the ideal would be 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.360
 develop everything because one is going to 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.790
 end up winning with halberdiers and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.490
 elite guerrillas can also 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.860
 use their champions are a civilization 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.230
 excellent for a rush because it is 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.959
 an economic civilization their farms 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.000
 as a team they have 45 more of their food 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.830
 urban centers admit more 5 of 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.560
 population in total 10 talking about 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.660
 places and their villagers are created a little 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.940
 faster and as they start with more 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.550
 villagers are excellent for a map 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.620
 nomadic nomadic holland in black 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.750
 forest can become good if not 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.850
 they face a good civilization 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.380
 technology like the Koreans and the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.110
 mongoles 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.510
 and as I mentioned before using Chinese is not 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.670
 nothing for novices are difficult to 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.070
 already use when attacking you have to have 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.720
 as much patience as any civilization 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.760
 of archers 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.340
 another good thing about the Chinese is that 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.170
 since they are cheap and do not have as many 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.450
 good units of gold like 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.460
 paladins allow you to survive if you 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.590
 you run out of gold, even if the enemy 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.990
 you have a lot of siege you will be in trouble 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.760
 luckily they have an eros to stop 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.870
 a touch to the enemy although they are not 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.060
 miraculous 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.700
 and well now I'll start talking about what 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.470
 negative of this civilization hahahaha 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.970
 I know that many watch my videos for 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.100
 know which are the best 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.110
 civilizations or looking for me in gamer yesterday 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.720
 to ask me but I will not tell them 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.300
 ha ha ha ha ha ha good the bad of the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.370
 Chinese in my opinion of course is that 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.500
 they have a pedorra preparation by 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.050
 one way to say it they have units of 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.300
 castle they are archers called their 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.070
 elite cone and in turn are equipped 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.380
 so that his heavy scorpions 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.820
 shoot faster which speaks to you that 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.280
 all the best you have is for 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.290
 face infantry but now if the 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.570
 enemy has a siege gross and 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.390
 cannons like you do to stop that guy 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.330
 of attack so the answer is to go to 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.160
 run it with at least 70 halberdiers I 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.080
 I think the halberdiers of the Chinese 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.240
 they are much better than any other 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.130
 their units hahahahahaha and they are the most 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.960
 disposable and cheap to use if the 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.180
 enemy is of good civilization 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.340
 and it is clear that the only alternative 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.740
 the Chinese give you because their cavalry 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.930
 is terrible not have used the same if 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.060
 I would be throwing 80 food 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.340
 so being so expensive to use in 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.380
 food will make you have less army 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.410
 to have more farmers the 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.150
 Beefeaters are much cheaper 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.400
 another bad thing about the Chinese and all 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.319
 the Asian civilizations is that 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.599
 they consume a lot of wood so 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.240
 you'll have to have at least 50 woodcutters 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.400
 working your archers cost wood and 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.410
 gold and its halberdiers cost food and 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.660
 wood and finally his siege is worth 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.630
 wood and gold everything is worth more wood than 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.570
 Luckily food are cheap gold 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.389
 develop your elite cone costs 760 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.949
 of food and 760 gold and develop 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.110
 rocketry which is what makes courses 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.570
 Castle archers shoot faster 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.840
 as also his scorpions 600 of 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.940
 wood and 600 gold 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.430
 so the Chinese look a lot like 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.870
 the English are both civilizations of 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.389
 archers although the Chinese have 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.310
 date for their archers what they do 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.740
 that when they attack the enemy their 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.050
 arrows have 100% chance of 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.230
 hurt him something that the English do not 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.450
 They have in their galleries archery 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.280
 and ends up going back to the Chinese 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.500
 they have camels but what the fuck 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.660
 I want camels if they only serve 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.700
 against enemy cavalry when I can 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.950
 use halberdiers who face others 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.290
 halberdiers and fuck the cavalry 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.740
 instead of having camels they could 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.780
 put it to use but good 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.460
 and well there is not much to talk about 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.560
 Chinese in my opinion are a 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.630
 civilization of the least equipped of the 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.270
 age of empires because they do not have 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.520
 cannons do not have manual gunners and 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.639
 it requires knowing how to use them they are not so 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.259
 easy to use as are the Byzantines 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.419
 but good in green arabia can 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:29.979
 be quite good and in nomadic they are 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.979
 the devil ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.789
 although the surprising thing about the Chinese is 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.009
 that have bombed towers 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:39.469
 It's weird because they do not have trucks but 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:42.529
 if those towers are the only civilization 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:45.379
 that does not have cannons if they have towers 

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:47.239
 bombed are useful to defend your 

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:49.749
 city ​​to use in cities 

00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:49.749
 enemies 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:58.449
 and well that was all greetings to the
