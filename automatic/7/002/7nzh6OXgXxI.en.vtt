again<00:03:56.880> I'm<00:03:56.970> learning<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:58.820> joinery<00:03:59.820> technique

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
again I'm learning so joinery technique

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.040 
again I'm learning so joinery technique
these<00:04:00.900> shelves<00:04:01.320> are<00:04:01.709> on<00:04:01.950> blind<00:04:02.490> date<00:04:02.760> o's<00:04:03.050> and

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
these shelves are on blind date o's and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.670 
these shelves are on blind date o's and
so<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.730> ring<00:04:05.970> holder<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:07.470> that's<00:04:07.620> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
so is the the ring holder so that's a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.440 
so is the the ring holder so that's a
new<00:04:07.770> joinery<00:04:08.130> technique<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.700> got<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.300> use

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
new joinery technique that I got to use

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.540 
new joinery technique that I got to use
on<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.870> project<00:04:10.620> with<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.190> handheld

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
on this a project with the handheld

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.699 
on this a project with the handheld
router<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.209> yeah<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.170> worked<00:04:13.320> out<00:04:13.410> pretty<00:04:13.590> well

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
router so yeah it worked out pretty well

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039 
router so yeah it worked out pretty well
and<00:04:14.070> then<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.850> picked<00:04:15.060> up<00:04:15.180> these<00:04:15.390> off<00:04:15.600> eBay

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
and then I just picked up these off eBay

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.500 
and then I just picked up these off eBay

those are Morrison tenon so that was
another<00:05:02.150> joinery<00:05:02.510> technique<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:02.990> I've

another joinery technique that I've

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.200 
another joinery technique that I've

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
never done before so yeah we've got the

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.690 
never done before so yeah we've got the
half<00:05:05.420> blind<00:05:05.750> dovetails<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.680> blind<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.490> toes

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
half blind dovetails the blind a toes

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.000 
half blind dovetails the blind a toes
and<00:05:08.770> oh<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.880> tongue<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.360> groove<00:05:11.420> and<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
mortise and tenon are all we're all

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
mortise and tenon are all we're all
techniques<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.120> I've<00:05:17.210> never<00:05:17.300> done<00:05:17.510> before
