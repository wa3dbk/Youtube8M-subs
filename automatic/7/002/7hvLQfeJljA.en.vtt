00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.139
 welcome to another 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.840
 follow the samsung video tutorial for the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 galaxy series already set the standards 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.140
 the two devices have set the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.180
 get to know the last episode together 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.590
 now we are twelve together 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.210
 to look at the distinction between 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.849
 both models be with me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 looking forward to the next few minutes 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.079
 which differences both devices 305 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 own that is obvious that it 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.960
 First of all, the size of mum three 4,5 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.219
 inch and at the a5 and worth saying and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
 write 15 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.620
 want to know for everything 12.63 lfk 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.700
 four centimeters you can see very clearly 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.329
 0 5 inches that you are a bigger picture 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.309
 nonetheless, both of you 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.379
 I have a lot here opposite 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.090
 very slim design under seven 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.710
 millimeter exactly to 69 25 67 mm 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.989
 nonetheless, the most important argument 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.820
 For 7 sell the customer is the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 Camera on the back 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.630
 both have five megapixel front camera 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.680
 wonderful for cell to shoot 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.060
 meanwhile stated 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.430
 on the back of course the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.439
 front camera for the main attack in the evening 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.549
 swimming in the skull just the eggs 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.680
 to be allowed to take pictures 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.630
 8 megapixels is enough if 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 normal use with the a3 and the a5 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.830
 even 13 megapixel technology 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.810
 so I can really great pictures 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.040
 shoot through that despite I have 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.880
 for example, same processor 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.110
 installed 1 2 ghz processor which has a3 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.750
 15 and from 512 gb Ram RAM 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.400
 I have a bit of battery life 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 2300 milliamps extend one 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.570
 talk on the phone to talk 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.240
 yes I'll be right and of course 19 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.180
 or 1900 milliamps almost as well 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.649
 at the a3 and what both have in common 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.630
 they are beautiful have a great 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.549
 design and are scary and easy 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.770
 So little recklessness you can 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.969
 also hide completely relaxed because they 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.350
 you can be two so small 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.719
 member a special highlight 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.090
 of course the galaxy series is new 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.009
 created user interface that listens 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.170
 But it is very complicated 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.970
 very easy we have the possibility 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.099
 the feelings and mood 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.569
 the user interface speaks that 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.739
 background of her personal 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.000
 smartphones meet their needs 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.040
 align 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.420
 When I go to the setting I come 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.099
 directly on the user interface and 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.590
 have the possibilities here too 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.000
 go and just subject me to one 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.220
 to look out for other background 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 Can be over classic gel or too 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.269
 playful of the further I have the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.800
 possibility of new ringtones and sounds 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.800
 to adapt 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.450
 Furthermore, I have the possibilities 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.950
 also the notification as well as the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.700
 lock screen 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.080
 also the city led the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.180
 I have the notification fields 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.569
 possibility to enter directly here and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.550
 certain woman x 10 often used 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.080
 information directly rom retrieve 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.700
 can 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.400
 these possibilities arise the new 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.140
 created use 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.019
 you see we are putting in the galaxy 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.030
 series is completely new standards thus 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.269
 something for every trend-conscious user 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.269
 there
