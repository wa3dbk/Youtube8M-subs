thoughts<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.709> spider<00:02:15.040> wire<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:17.440> you're

on<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> real<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.640> recommend<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.510> twenty<00:02:22.750> pound

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
on a real I recommend the twenty pound

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.390 
on a real I recommend the twenty pound
test<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.380> said<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.830> perfect<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.220> all

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
test like I said it's perfect for all

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.820 
test like I said it's perfect for all
conditions<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> right<00:02:26.620> size

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
conditions and it's just the right size

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.370 
conditions and it's just the right size
so<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:28.240> can<00:02:28.360> go<00:02:28.480> higher<00:02:28.660> if<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.930> wanted<00:02:29.260> for

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
so you can go higher if you wanted for

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.440 
so you can go higher if you wanted for
frog<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.830> or<00:02:29.920> whatever<00:02:30.190> but

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
frog and or whatever but

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.420 
frog and or whatever but
this<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:30.989> for<00:02:31.110> general<00:02:31.530> purpose<00:02:31.920> fishing

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
this is just for general purpose fishing

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.740 
this is just for general purpose fishing
so<00:02:33.590> that's<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.769> think<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.599> have
