which<00:02:16.230> looks<00:02:16.440> really<00:02:16.680> cool<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.010> glossy

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
which looks really cool and it's glossy

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.230 
which looks really cool and it's glossy
then

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
then

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.550 
then
is<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> little<00:02:18.540> bump<00:02:18.870> because<00:02:19.080> that's<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
is the little bump because that's the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.710 
is the little bump because that's the
shape<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> phone<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.820> these<00:02:21.060> hole<00:02:21.510> for

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
shape of the phone with these hole for

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.090 
shape of the phone with these hole for
the<00:02:21.750> speaker<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.380> then<00:02:22.860> at<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> bottom

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
the speaker and then at the bottom

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.160 
the speaker and then at the bottom
another<00:02:23.670> small<00:02:24.060> hole<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> microphone

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
another small hole for the microphone

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.790 
another small hole for the microphone
and<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.150> charging<00:02:27.150> port<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.350> has<00:02:28.380> all<00:02:28.740> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
and the charging port so it has all the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.330 
and the charging port so it has all the
holes<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.460> everything<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> cutouts<00:02:31.340> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
holes for everything all the cutouts and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.270 
holes for everything all the cutouts and
it<00:02:32.640> looks<00:02:32.850> very<00:02:32.970> nice<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.540> now<00:02:33.690> I'll<00:02:34.160> put<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.220> on

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it looks very nice so now I'll put it on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.390 
it looks very nice so now I'll put it on
the<00:02:35.370> phone<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:36.780> basically<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:37.320> put<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.310> in

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the phone you basically just put it in

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.890 
the phone you basically just put it in
and<00:02:38.610> snap<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.300> sides<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.420> does

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and snap the sides on and it is does

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.270 
and snap the sides on and it is does
work<00:02:43.080> with<00:02:43.230> screen<00:02:43.470> protector<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.160> may

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
work with screen protector so you may

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.550 
work with screen protector so you may
not<00:02:44.400> be<00:02:44.550> able<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.730> tell<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.290> there<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.410> can

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
not be able to tell but there you can

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.600 
not be able to tell but there you can
see<00:02:46.590> probably<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> screen<00:02:47.490> protector

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
see probably I have a screen protector

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.590 
see probably I have a screen protector
on<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.930> I've<00:02:49.380> never<00:02:49.680> had<00:02:49.920> problems

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
on and it I've never had problems

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.280 
on and it I've never had problems
peeling<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.720> off<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.740> does<00:02:53.640> since<00:02:54.150> its<00:02:54.360> TPU<00:02:54.870> so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
peeling it off it does since its TPU so

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.500 
peeling it off it does since its TPU so
it's<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.160> between<00:02:56.250> silicon<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.180> hard

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
it's a it's in between silicon and hard

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.700 
it's a it's in between silicon and hard
plastic<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.250> gives<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.710> shock

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
plastic so it gives you the shock

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.610 
plastic so it gives you the shock
absorption<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.520> silicone<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.620> basically

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
absorption of silicone but basically

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.380 
absorption of silicone but basically
it's<00:03:07.620> also<00:03:08.010> protective<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> hard<00:03:09.150> case

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
it's also protective like a hard case

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.450 
it's also protective like a hard case
and<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.800> got<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> lay<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.430> table

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
and so it's got the lay on the table

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.300 
and so it's got the lay on the table
design<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.720> if<00:03:12.870> i<00:03:12.960> put<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.410> my

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
design so if i put it like this my

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.460 
design so if i put it like this my
screen<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.790> not<00:03:15.270> affected<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:15.840> any<00:03:15.960> way<00:03:16.200> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
screen is not affected in any way and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.000 
screen is not affected in any way and
it's<00:03:17.430> also<00:03:17.640> got<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:19.020> covers<00:03:19.890> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it's also got a little it covers the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.230 
it's also got a little it covers the
camera<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:20.490> when<00:03:20.640> i<00:03:20.670> lay<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.210> table

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
camera so when i lay it on the table

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.560 
camera so when i lay it on the table
this<00:03:21.630> way<00:03:21.840> there<00:03:22.740> is<00:03:22.980> no<00:03:23.550> damage<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.330> the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
this way there is no damage to the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.010 
this way there is no damage to the
camera<00:03:25.020> at<00:03:25.200> all<00:03:26.330> now<00:03:27.330> one<00:03:27.570> problem<00:03:27.810> I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
camera at all now one problem I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.110 
camera at all now one problem I
experienced<00:03:28.770> was<00:03:28.920> when<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:29.550> pull<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.880> on<00:03:29.970> my

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
experienced was when I pull it on my

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.590 
experienced was when I pull it on my
pocket<00:03:30.500> down<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.160> piece<00:03:32.430> will<00:03:33.030> lift<00:03:33.270> up

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
pocket down here this piece will lift up

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.680 
pocket down here this piece will lift up
a<00:03:34.050> bit<00:03:34.230> kind<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:34.980> pull<00:03:35.160> out<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:36.120> I

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
that and then it goes back to normal now

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.320 
that and then it goes back to normal now
I<00:03:52.110> like<00:03:52.710> the<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.570> front<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.710> is

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
I like the that the the front here is

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.550 
I like the that the the front here is
glossy<00:03:57.330> but<00:03:57.720> i'm<00:03:57.810> not<00:03:57.930> sure<00:03:58.110> if<00:03:58.200> everyone

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
glossy but i'm not sure if everyone

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.350 
glossy but i'm not sure if everyone
would<00:03:58.710> because<00:03:59.070> on<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.790> website<00:04:00.180> they<00:04:00.300> do

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
would because on the website they do

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.090 
would because on the website they do
advertise<00:04:00.960> it<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.260> be<00:04:01.410> matte<00:04:01.620> black<00:04:01.860> they

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
advertise it to be matte black they

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.620 
advertise it to be matte black they
don't<00:04:02.280> mention<00:04:02.460> anything<00:04:02.760> about<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.450> being

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
don't mention anything about it being

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.900 
don't mention anything about it being
glossy<00:04:04.110> in<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> front<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.280> definitely<00:04:05.580> do

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
glossy in the front but I definitely do

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.600 
glossy in the front but I definitely do
like<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.330> think<00:04:06.360> it's<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.930> nice<00:04:07.140> touch<00:04:07.610> but

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
like it I think it's a nice touch but

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.790 
like it I think it's a nice touch but
then<00:04:08.940> again<00:04:08.970> some<00:04:09.570> people<00:04:09.600> may<00:04:10.410> not<00:04:10.560> like<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
then again some people may not like it

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.670
