of<00:04:12.670> this<00:04:12.760> machine-like<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.830> like<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.190> and

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
of this machine-like I like that and

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.370 
of this machine-like I like that and
it's<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.880> than<00:04:16.090> one<00:04:16.209> hundred<00:04:16.480> and<00:04:16.510> fifty-nine<00:04:17.020> K

it's a than one hundred and fifty-nine K
which<00:04:18.070> believe<00:04:18.520> me<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:19.410> incredibly<00:04:20.410> low<00:04:20.709> and<00:04:21.040> I

which believe me is incredibly low and I
mean<00:04:21.760> could<00:04:21.970> we've<00:04:22.120> had<00:04:22.330> an<00:04:22.450> out<00:04:22.570> there<00:04:22.780> with

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
mean could we've had an out there with

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.080 
mean could we've had an out there with
over<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.140> million<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.650> no<00:04:23.950> problem<00:04:24.220> at<00:04:24.370> all<00:04:24.520> so

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
over a million on a no problem at all so

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.760 
over a million on a no problem at all so
it's<00:04:25.240> got<00:04:25.390> actually<00:04:25.720> nothing<00:04:26.050> on<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.350> that<00:04:26.530> is

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
it's got actually nothing on it that is

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.340 
it's got actually nothing on it that is
the<00:04:26.800> actual<00:04:27.160> genuine<00:04:27.520> shame<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.870> genuine

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
the actual genuine shame the genuine

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.390 
the actual genuine shame the genuine
serial<00:04:29.710> number<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:29.980> goes<00:04:30.130> through<00:04:30.310> this

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
serial number that goes through this

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.940 
serial number that goes through this
particular<00:04:30.610> machine

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
particular machine

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.980 
particular machine
so<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.100> three<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:34.120> four<00:04:34.510> black-and-whites

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
so a three is a four black-and-whites

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.060 
so a three is a four black-and-whites
Zhu<00:04:35.710> Pets<00:04:36.070> Network<00:04:36.790> fax<00:04:37.270> stare<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:38.740> it's<00:04:38.890> also

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
Zhu Pets Network fax stare and it's also

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.160 
Zhu Pets Network fax stare and it's also
got<00:04:39.400> doctor<00:04:39.760> that<00:04:39.880> serve<00:04:40.120> as<00:04:40.360> well<00:04:40.570> what's
