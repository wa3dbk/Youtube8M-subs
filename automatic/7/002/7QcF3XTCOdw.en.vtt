00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.030
 yes it is brilliant study it will be 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.940
 the only thing the driver does 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 not really in a lot more 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.719
 space really a lot of space 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.580
 kenny that first generation driver 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.109
 maybe still ordered and that whole 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.910
 looks very much like the patient but then longer 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.070
 and was literally so that was just 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
 made longer than a pot of coke 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.529
 logo here on a night can also skoda 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.529
 logo 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 then came the second generation super that 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.510
 like a hedge 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.829
 place also available as a tation later 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.770
 do not worry 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.899
 and that was not so very beautiful it is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.770
 nicely refreshed and yes still just 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.450
 ingenious amount of space from the rear seat 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.210
 I can just sit behind myself and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.489
 that can send this test that you can do 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 you with me if I want to go out with myself 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.120
 it succeeds then a little to the concerns 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.590
 my hair trunk space really to me 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.850
 so how much I do not even look up 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.960
 for you but follow me is not 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.030
 relevant clean 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.050
 gigantic can just do a lot 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.050
 mess take me 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.310
 bye 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.719
 news by mail also built on it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.530
 mqb platform of the volkswagen concern 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:21.189
 arms ban waves waves leon 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.189
 audio entrance is messy well that shot 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.869
 so again something light hearing and 75 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.000
 kilo lighter is the super but it is one 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.220
 hefty boy he is almost 5 meters tall 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.289
 so english but not very light 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.970
 couldn't look it up that fast 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.679
 become a czech license plate 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.640
 as my czech didn't put me in the 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.799
 abandon 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.450
 this car fifteen hundred kilos and that 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.119
 feel you know 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.479
 in particular in the performance of the engines 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.429
 and hammer tube slip-on brilliant for 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.470
 the Dutch market single system 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.630
 and we had the 2 liter tdi and i thought 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.450
 and first ainsi 150 hp but this is the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.780
 strongest twins danny with 190 hp and 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.270
 400 mm torque and to be honest I think 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.549
 that really doesn't drain 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.009
 it just never feels really fast 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.689
 In fact we are doing the wrong thing 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.060
 acceleration have I now do here 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.799
 Remember to five at 60 I should 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.810
 don't want a visit 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.940
 twelve and gives go full throttle 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.420
 their flag doesn't actually get that much 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.290
 by another school in 2000 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.290
 shoot off again 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 is not an unpleasant engine but yes 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.020
 afterwards when i heard 119 room 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.030
 there had surely expected more 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.239
 sore performance fine we paper 8 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.970
 seconds 100 237 km per hour 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.610
 top speed and not unimportant 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.220
 there are various versions with 20% outside 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 including those in a ssd but i would 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 honestly i just disagree 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.310
 drive in because I don't think that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.080
 very nice is you know better for 1 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.080
 can go out of the 2 liter tdi 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.400
 the very positive things about this 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.519
 ocean full of this it also happens positively 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.620
 explain relatively gently and 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.480
 muted is just also on us for you 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.849
 because little gardens and then we see 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.530
 actually with not so many cars 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.170
 the other thing that skoda that whole 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.879
 doing useful but a bit sporty 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.379
 to admire him but the 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.379
 patented about blogging driving style 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.049
 well it all goes around the corner 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.640
 it feels a bit like a boat 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.260
 but you run in one then he goes 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.970
 about that way 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.069
 and if you put it on the gripper and sit in it 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.959
 the board even further than before 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.090
 Piet who communicates a bit in my 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.920
 not so nice with it 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.470
 but well there it has volkswagen 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.489
 I also just concert other brands for 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.489
 to seduce you 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.420
 furthermore the student's most modern platform 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.989
 follow-up questions all 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.209
 safety systems that can 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.709
 to make sure you don't crash 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.560
 or if there are bots still enjoy 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.550
 goes all over and apple 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.390

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.390
 to go to my often 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.010

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.160
