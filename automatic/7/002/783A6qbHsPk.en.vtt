this<00:00:39.329> year<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.600> there's<00:00:39.840> new<00:00:40.020> 60<00:00:40.500> gigabyte<00:00:40.710> SDI

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
this year is there's new 60 gigabyte SDI

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
this year is there's new 60 gigabyte SDI
technology<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.420> basically<00:00:42.719> an<00:00:43.050> SDI

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
technology and this is basically an SDI

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 
technology and this is basically an SDI
it's<00:00:43.649> four<00:00:43.890> times<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.460> bandwidth<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.030> regular

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it's four times the bandwidth of regular

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 
it's four times the bandwidth of regular
SDI<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.440> capable<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.770> doing<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.219> only

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
SDI but it's capable of doing not only

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.810 
SDI but it's capable of doing not only
Ultra<00:00:47.910> HD<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.719> HD<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.379> SD<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.980> well<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.700> with

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
Ultra HD but HD and SD as well so with

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.400 
Ultra HD but HD and SD as well so with
this<00:00:50.910> new<00:00:51.090> technology<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.690> felt<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this new technology we felt like in

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
this new technology we felt like in
order<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.160> ultra<00:00:53.550> HD<00:00:54.030> production

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
order to really get ultra HD production

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
order to really get ultra HD production
going<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:55.289> wanted<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> create<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.129> new

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
going we wanted to create this new

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.279 
going we wanted to create this new
product<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> old<00:00:57.120> 8n<00:00:57.899> production

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
product which is the old 8n production

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
product which is the old 8n production
studio<00:00:58.530> 4k<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.460> unlike<00:00:59.850> some<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> other

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
studio 4k so unlike some of the other

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
studio 4k so unlike some of the other
products<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.140> were<00:01:01.260> only<00:01:01.440> HD<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
products we have which were only HD and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.799 
products we have which were only HD and
SD<00:01:02.070> obviously<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.210> an<00:01:03.390> Ultra<00:01:03.780> HD

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
SD obviously this one is an Ultra HD

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.780 
SD obviously this one is an Ultra HD
capable<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:04.860> though<00:01:05.100> obviously<00:01:05.580> still

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
capable as well though obviously still

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.359 
capable as well though obviously still
great<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.360> HD<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.869> SD<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.260> well<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> kind

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
great for HD and SD as well so it kind

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.649 
great for HD and SD as well so it kind
of<00:01:08.460> fits<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.790> between<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> our<00:01:09.510> other

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
of fits in between some of our other

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.960 
of fits in between some of our other
switches<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:10.619> 8<00:01:10.890> input<00:01:11.490> it's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
switches because it is an 8 input it's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
switches because it is an 8 input it's
got<00:01:12.090> four<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> HDMI<00:01:13.110> inputs<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.740> four<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
got four of the HDMI inputs and four of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
got four of the HDMI inputs and four of
the<00:01:14.340> SDI<00:01:14.700> inputs<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.540> 8<00:01:15.750> input

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the SDI inputs so it is an 8 input

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.010 
the SDI inputs so it is an 8 input
production<00:01:16.979> switcher<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> obviously<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
production switcher the obviously the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
production switcher the obviously the
SDI<00:01:19.259> being<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.619> new<00:01:19.740> six<00:01:19.950> guessed<00:01:20.159> 6<00:01:20.790> gig<00:01:20.939> us

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
SDI being the new six guessed 6 gig us

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
SDI being the new six guessed 6 gig us
TI<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.630> has<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.900> those<00:01:22.020> different<00:01:22.320> formats

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
TI so it has all those different formats

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
TI so it has all those different formats
but<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> still<00:01:23.250> has<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.670> downstream<00:01:24.150> peers

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
but it still has the to downstream peers

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
but it still has the to downstream peers
it's<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> functionality<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it's got all the functionality you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
it's got all the functionality you
expect<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.490> lot<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.820> our<00:01:26.909> other<00:01:27.060> ATMs<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
expect in a lot of our other ATMs it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.819 
expect in a lot of our other ATMs it
doesn't<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> encoding<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
doesn't do the encoding like the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.530 
doesn't do the encoding like the
television<00:01:29.280> studio<00:01:29.549> does<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.390> got

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
television studio does it's got

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.230 
television studio does it's got
obviously<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.259> beautiful<00:01:32.250> new<00:01:32.430> front<00:01:32.909> here

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
obviously this beautiful new front here

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
obviously this beautiful new front here
we've<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> LCD<00:01:34.500> where<00:01:34.680> we're<00:01:34.770> able<00:01:34.890> to

production more more effortlessly

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
production more more effortlessly
obviously<00:02:42.930> adding<00:02:43.200> Ultra<00:02:43.440> HD<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:44.010> other

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
obviously adding Ultra HD but other

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.680 
obviously adding Ultra HD but other
features<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.700> people<00:02:45.030> want<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.269> see<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.510> well

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
features that people want to see as well

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.050 
features that people want to see as well
ok<00:02:46.500> now<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.799> unit<00:02:46.980> does<00:02:47.340> not<00:02:47.549> replace<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
ok now this unit does not replace a

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.970 
ok now this unit does not replace a
television<00:02:48.450> studio<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:49.079> is<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.709> about

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
television studio this is this is about

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.170 
television studio this is this is about
double<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.340> price<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.819> sellers<00:02:51.060> in

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
double the price that the sellers in

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.910 
double the price that the sellers in
studio<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.049> does<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:52.440> replace<00:02:52.859> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
studio so it does not replace the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.830 
studio so it does not replace the
television<00:02:53.640> studio<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.239> addition<00:02:54.629> to

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
television studio it is in addition to

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.650 
television studio it is in addition to
and<00:02:55.140> with<00:02:55.890> some<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.250> own<00:02:56.400> own<00:02:56.879> front<00:02:57.359> panel

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and with some of the own own front panel

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.020 
and with some of the own own front panel
controls<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.340> something<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.910> would

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
controls this is something that would

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.839 
controls this is something that would
probably<00:03:00.239> add<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.470> feature<00:03:01.650> set<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
I'm gonna have three or four cameras and

I'm gonna have three or four cameras and
maybe<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.019> want<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.319> get<00:03:10.379> that<00:03:10.500> h.264<00:03:11.430> encoding

that<00:03:12.299> television<00:03:12.599> studio<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.140> really<00:03:13.379> hard<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
that television studio is really hard to

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.710 
that television studio is really hard to
beat<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:13.980> all<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:14.819> if<00:03:14.910> I'm<00:03:15.060> building<00:03:15.569> up

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
beat for all that but if I'm building up

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.629 
beat for all that but if I'm building up
to<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:16.170> more<00:03:16.530> cameras<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.220> know<00:03:17.250> six<00:03:17.579> to

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
to have more cameras you know six to

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.339 
to have more cameras you know six to
eight<00:03:17.880> cameras<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.690> I'm<00:03:18.810> looking<00:03:19.079> towards

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
eight cameras and I'm looking towards

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.990 
eight cameras and I'm looking towards
the<00:03:19.410> future<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.980> new<00:03:20.220> functionality<00:03:20.760> in

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the future with new functionality in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.430 
the future with new functionality in
there<00:03:21.180> then<00:03:21.540> I'd<00:03:21.630> probably<00:03:21.750> take<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.079> good<00:03:22.260> look

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
there then I'd probably take a good look

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.470 
there then I'd probably take a good look
