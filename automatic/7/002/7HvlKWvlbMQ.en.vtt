how to take heavy plant that's seen
better<00:00:05.490> days<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.330> turn<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:06.990> back<00:00:07.020> into<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
better days and turn it back into a

better days and turn it back into a
plant<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.040> you'd<00:00:08.280> like<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.610> keep<00:00:09.050> you<00:00:10.050> get<00:00:10.170> a

good<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> cut<00:00:41.760> too<00:00:42.480> towards<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
good and you want to cut too towards the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.709 
good and you want to cut too towards the
base<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.920> they're<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.510> they're<00:00:45.510> really

base if they're not they're really
looking<00:00:46.050> bad

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.590 

branches<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.860> may<00:00:50.520> maybe<00:00:51.329> want<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
branches like this may maybe want to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.880 
branches like this may maybe want to
save<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> bloom<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.620> ahead<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
save that bloom you can go ahead and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
save that bloom you can go ahead and
just<00:00:53.160> snip<00:00:53.550> off<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> top<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> looks

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
just snip off at the top if it looks

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:05.440 
just snip off at the top if it looks
alright

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
fresh soil usually this is indicative of

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:36.160 
fresh soil usually this is indicative of
issues<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.080> wrong<00:01:19.500> underneath<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> soil

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.510 

if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.289> have<00:01:37.409> fresh<00:01:37.679> green<00:01:37.979> growth<00:01:38.220> coming

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
out at the soil line you want to be

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.370 
out at the soil line you want to be
careful<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.800> cut<00:01:41.039> it<00:01:41.869> as<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.200> rid<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
careful not to cut it as you get rid of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:55.710 
careful not to cut it as you get rid of
some<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.710> old<00:01:43.920> stuff

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.300 

you<00:01:56.720> generally<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.070> too

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
you generally don't have to be too

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.500 
you generally don't have to be too
afraid<00:01:58.670> of<00:02:00.700> cutting<00:02:01.700> too<00:02:02.330> much<00:02:02.360> off<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
afraid of cutting too much off the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.530 
afraid of cutting too much off the
general<00:02:05.510> rule<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.990> we<00:02:06.170> cut<00:02:06.350> about<00:02:07.300> half<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
general rule is we cut about half the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.660 
general rule is we cut about half the
plant<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.990> three<00:02:09.200> quarters<00:02:09.680> but<00:02:09.979> when<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.550> in

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
plant to three quarters but when it's in

plant to three quarters but when it's in
this<00:02:10.760> kind<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.060> condition<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.750> want<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.410> just

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
this kind of condition you want to just

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.840 
this kind of condition you want to just
make<00:02:12.710> sure<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.920> get<00:02:13.070> all<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> bad<00:02:13.550> stuff<00:02:13.730> off

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
any weak branches anything discolored go

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.660 
any weak branches anything discolored go
ahead<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.040> rid<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.250> it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 

and<00:02:29.819> starting<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> already<00:02:30.990> look<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.680> lot

and starting to already look a lot

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:47.149 
and starting to already look a lot
better

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.880 

got<00:02:47.700> some<00:02:47.849> stuff<00:02:47.969> over<00:02:48.299> here<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.569> looks

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
got some stuff over here that looks

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.309 
got some stuff over here that looks
healthy<00:02:50.599> normally<00:02:51.599> since<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.989> plants

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
healthy normally since the plants

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.580 
healthy normally since the plants
lopsided<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.099> would<00:02:53.249> go<00:02:53.400> ahead<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:54.409> trim<00:02:55.409> these

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
lopsided I would go ahead and trim these

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.220 
lopsided I would go ahead and trim these
back<00:02:55.999> just<00:02:56.999> so<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.299> evens<00:02:57.780> up<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.930> plan<00:02:58.200> a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
back just so it evens up the plan a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.929 
back just so it evens up the plan a
little<00:02:58.409> bit<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.920> we've<00:02:59.069> got<00:02:59.219> a<00:02:59.249> bloom<00:02:59.549> on<00:02:59.760> this

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
little bit but we've got a bloom on this

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.580 
little bit but we've got a bloom on this
