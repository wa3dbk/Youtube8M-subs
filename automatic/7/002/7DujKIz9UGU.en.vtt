today I got a short video for you it

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.340 
today I got a short video for you it
came<00:00:05.040> from<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.310> suggestion<00:00:05.759> from<00:00:06.200> one<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.259> you

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
came from a suggestion from one of you

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.600 
came from a suggestion from one of you
out<00:00:07.379> there<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:07.830> has<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.010> do<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.460> two

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
out there it has to do with the two

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.049 
out there it has to do with the two
types<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.000> switches<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.990> standard<00:00:10.820> crl<00:00:11.820> or

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
types of switches the standard crl or

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.620 
types of switches the standard crl or
old<00:00:12.300> Grisby<00:00:12.780> type<00:00:13.049> switch<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.009> round<00:00:14.190> sucker

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
old Grisby type switch the round sucker

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
old Grisby type switch the round sucker
versus<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> import<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.920> square<00:00:17.220> bottom

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
versus the import the the square bottom

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.070 
versus the import the the square bottom
I<00:00:17.730> remember<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.180> first<00:00:18.330> time<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.630> worked<00:00:18.900> on

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
I remember the first time I worked on

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
I remember the first time I worked on
the<00:00:19.230> import<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.830> took<00:00:20.220> me<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> while<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.670> figure

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the import it took me a while to figure

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.090 
the import it took me a while to figure
out<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> lugs<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.439> thought<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.830> would<00:00:22.980> be

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
out the lugs and I thought this would be

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.859 
out the lugs and I thought this would be
a<00:00:23.130> good<00:00:23.340> video<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.150> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> demonstrate

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
a good video here to kind of demonstrate

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.900 
a good video here to kind of demonstrate
the<00:00:25.320> difference<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.099> exactly<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> would

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the difference and exactly how you would

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.570 
the difference and exactly how you would
use<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> wiring<00:00:28.500> scheme<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.519> if

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
use that in a in a wiring scheme so if

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.519 
use that in a in a wiring scheme so if
we<00:00:29.699> take<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> look<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> left<00:00:30.510> side<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.320> see

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
we take a look on the left side we see

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.590 
we take a look on the left side we see
the<00:00:31.679> standard<00:00:32.040> 5<00:00:32.309> way<00:00:32.520> switch<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> will

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the standard 5 way switch if you will

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.229 
the standard 5 way switch if you will
lugs<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> left-hand<00:00:34.950> side<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.550> numbered

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
lugs on the left-hand side and numbered

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
lugs on the left-hand side and numbered
them<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.660> time<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> know<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> some<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.469> my

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
them this time I know in some of my

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
them this time I know in some of my
videos<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.010> use<00:00:38.129> different<00:00:38.329> numberings<00:00:39.329> but

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
videos I use different numberings but

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
videos I use different numberings but
for<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.840> purpose<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.320> did<00:00:40.469> 1<00:00:40.649> 2<00:00:40.829> 3<00:00:41.010> 4<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.879> right

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
for this purpose I did 1 2 3 4 the right

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
for this purpose I did 1 2 3 4 the right
side<00:00:42.329> 5<00:00:42.629> 6<00:00:42.930> 7<00:00:43.200> 8<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.739> look<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> bottom

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
side 5 6 7 8 if you look at the bottom

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.069 
side 5 6 7 8 if you look at the bottom
of<00:00:44.460> an<00:00:44.579> import<00:00:44.910> switch<00:00:45.210> it'll<00:00:45.420> run<00:00:45.750> exactly

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
of an import switch it'll run exactly

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.639 
of an import switch it'll run exactly
like<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.039> 1<00:00:47.640> 2<00:00:47.850> 3<00:00:48.059> 4<00:00:48.329> 5<00:00:48.539> 6<00:00:48.809> 7<00:00:49.050> 8<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.350> it's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
like I have here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so it's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
like I have here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so it's
very<00:00:49.890> simple<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.420> easy<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.020> understand

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
very simple it's very easy to understand

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
very simple it's very easy to understand
in<00:00:52.910> comparison<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.480> 5<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.899> where<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
in comparison to the 5 way where you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.810 
in comparison to the 5 way where you
actually<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> two<00:00:56.039> sides<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
actually have the two sides of the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.630 
actually have the two sides of the
switch<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.020> aware<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.640> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
switch that you have to be aware of so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.939 
switch that you have to be aware of so
now<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> make<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.480> work<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.050> took<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
now to make this all work I took just a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.060 
now to make this all work I took just a
standard<00:01:02.489> strat<00:01:03.030> wiring<00:01:03.629> 3<00:01:03.870> pick<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.260> in

standard strat wiring 3 pick up in

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
standard strat wiring 3 pick up in
figuration<00:01:05.790> show<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> how<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.810> be

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
figuration show you how that would be

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
figuration show you how that would be

is going to go to the first stone pot

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
is going to go to the first stone pot
that's<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.570> basic<00:01:27.780> strap<00:01:28.350> wiring

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that's it that's your basic strap wiring

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.050 
that's it that's your basic strap wiring
again<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> very<00:01:31.049> simple<00:01:31.790> switch<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
again this is a very simple switch to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
again this is a very simple switch to
use<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.600> lot<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> times<00:01:34.110> you'll<00:01:34.259> find<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
use a lot of times you'll find it in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.590 
use a lot of times you'll find it in
guitars<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.640> cavity<00:01:36.060> itself<00:01:36.420> they

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
guitars because the cavity itself they

bit different but again looking at this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.450 
bit different but again looking at this
you<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> left<00:01:46.170> side<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.009> standard

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you get the left side of a standard
