I<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> expected<00:01:44.130> sports<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.670> evolve<00:01:44.970> into

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
I kind of expected sports to evolve into

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
I kind of expected sports to evolve into
something<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.930> looks<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.439> slurp<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.130> that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
something that looks like slurp up that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.630 
something that looks like slurp up that
we<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.780> slurpuff<00:01:48.780> being<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.290> top<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.740> again

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
we have slurpuff being the top one again

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.950 
we have slurpuff being the top one again
I<00:01:50.670> put<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> weatherman<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:51.780> things

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
I put the weatherman on your things

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.139 
I put the weatherman on your things
aren't<00:01:52.170> there

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.810 

so<00:01:56.149> we<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.920> slurpuff<00:01:57.920> has<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.159> really<00:01:58.579> good

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
so we have slurpuff has a really good

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.149 
so we have slurpuff has a really good
sense<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.630> smell<00:01:59.810> it<00:02:00.350> can<00:02:00.530> detect<00:02:00.770> even<00:02:01.009> the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
sense of smell it can detect even the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.789 
sense of smell it can detect even the
faintest<00:02:01.250> odors<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.299> million<00:02:03.229> times<00:02:03.530> better

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
faintest odors a million times better

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.830 
faintest odors a million times better
than<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.130> human<00:02:04.429> being<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.329> assumed<00:02:05.600> it

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
than the human being so I assumed it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.389 
than the human being so I assumed it
would<00:02:05.899> be<00:02:05.960> really<00:02:06.350> good<00:02:06.649> at<00:02:06.799> playing<00:02:06.920> UVO

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
would be really good at playing UVO

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.419 
would be really good at playing UVO
against<00:02:07.700> Joey<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.179> then<00:02:08.300> went<00:02:08.420> up<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.569> third

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
against Joey and then went up a third

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.500 
against Joey and then went up a third
that's<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.580> stretch<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.000> reference<00:02:11.360> by
