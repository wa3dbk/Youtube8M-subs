where<00:00:02.480> are<00:00:02.720> they

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.430 

we<00:00:09.639> had<00:00:09.820> to<00:00:09.940> build<00:00:10.059> a<00:00:10.210> set<00:00:10.420> which<00:00:10.660> was<00:00:10.840> about<00:00:10.990> 18

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
we had to build a set which was about 18

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.530 
we had to build a set which was about 18
inches<00:00:11.620> wide<00:00:12.010> I<00:00:12.040> think<00:00:12.490> six<00:00:12.820> foot<00:00:13.030> deep<00:00:13.059> and

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
inches wide I think six foot deep and

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.230 
inches wide I think six foot deep and
that<00:00:13.780> 46<00:00:14.380> feet<00:00:14.590> high<00:00:14.860> was<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.250> really<00:00:15.610> odd<00:00:15.820> shape

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
that 46 feet high was a really odd shape

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.569 
that 46 feet high was a really odd shape
set<00:00:18.240> since<00:00:19.240> it<00:00:19.390> was<00:00:19.509> dark<00:00:20.140> on<00:00:20.380> gamma<00:00:20.950> so<00:00:21.160> the

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
set since it was dark on gamma so the

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.370 
set since it was dark on gamma so the
light<00:00:21.759> had<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.060> come<00:00:22.239> through<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.630> top<00:00:23.020> and<00:00:23.259> it

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
light had to come through the top and it

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.979 
light had to come through the top and it
had<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.619> go<00:00:23.770> four<00:00:24.040> stories<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.640> still<00:00:24.989> hold

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
had to go four stories and still hold

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.679 
had to go four stories and still hold
its<00:00:26.290> intensity<00:00:27.279> about<00:00:27.700> being<00:00:27.939> super<00:00:28.509> bright

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
its intensity about being super bright

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.870 
its intensity about being super bright
at<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:28.899> time<00:00:29.110> and<00:00:29.829> being<00:00:30.040> nothing<00:00:30.189> at<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.520> fun

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.910 

as<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.899> get<00:00:38.019> lower<00:00:38.199> more<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:38.590> more<00:00:38.739> lights

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
as they get lower more and more lights

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.099 
as they get lower more and more lights
come<00:00:39.219> on<00:00:39.250> so<00:00:39.910> that<00:00:40.059> it<00:00:40.329> looks<00:00:40.629> like<00:00:40.840> it's<00:00:41.019> the

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
come on so that it looks like it's the

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.240 
come on so that it looks like it's the
same<00:00:41.140> light<00:00:41.590> but<00:00:41.829> it's<00:00:41.949> actually

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
same light but it's actually

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:50.380 
same light but it's actually
intensifying<00:00:42.850> enormous

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.330 

physical<00:00:51.080> effects<00:00:51.350> had<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.740> do<00:00:51.890> all<00:00:52.130> this

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
physical effects had to do all this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.210 
physical effects had to do all this
lathe<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.820> plaster<00:00:52.880> so<00:00:53.570> it's<00:00:53.720> breakaway<00:00:54.350> the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
lathe and plaster so it's breakaway the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.860 
lathe and plaster so it's breakaway the
stunt<00:00:55.490> guys<00:00:55.700> had<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.060> come<00:00:56.090> in<00:00:56.420> there<00:00:56.660> and

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
stunt guys had to come in there and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.710 
stunt guys had to come in there and
needed<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.770> be<00:00:57.950> able<00:00:58.040> to<00:00:58.370> control<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.270> actors

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
needed to be able to control the actors

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.560 
needed to be able to control the actors
or<00:01:00.170> at<00:01:00.350> least<00:01:00.560> their<00:01:00.770> double<00:01:01.130> ended<00:01:01.880> in<00:01:02.480> a

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
or at least their double ended in a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:13.000 
or at least their double ended in a
controlled<00:01:02.989> descent<00:01:03.230> mode<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:12.620> fight<00:01:12.830> in<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
controlled descent mode the fight in the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.070 
controlled descent mode the fight in the
bathroom<00:01:13.400> is<00:01:13.490> much<00:01:13.670> scrappier<00:01:14.390> than<00:01:14.600> any<00:01:14.930> of

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
bathroom is much scrappier than any of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.570 
bathroom is much scrappier than any of
the<00:01:15.140> other<00:01:15.260> fights<00:01:15.530> because<00:01:15.830> it's<00:01:16.280> going<00:01:16.520> to

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
the other fights because it's going to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.060 
the other fights because it's going to
confined<00:01:17.000> space<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:17.900> built<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.500> clear

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
confined space and we built a clear

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.969 
confined space and we built a clear
basic<00:01:19.610> flat<00:01:20.240> edge<00:01:20.450> set<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.440> then<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:21.740> clean

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
basic flat edge set and then we clean

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.859 
basic flat edge set and then we clean
his<00:01:22.220> team<00:01:22.460> went<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.820> there<00:01:23.060> in<00:01:23.150> rows<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.660> it

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
his team went in there in rows and it

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.680 
his team went in there in rows and it
started<00:01:24.259> off<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:24.680> side<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:26.000> eventually<00:01:26.600> it

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
started off one side and eventually it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.930 
started off one side and eventually it
was<00:01:26.810> kind<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.110> like<00:01:27.229> half<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.710> size<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.340> they

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
was kind of like half the size and they

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.310 
was kind of like half the size and they
just<00:01:29.119> reversed<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:29.750> figured<00:01:30.110> out<00:01:30.229> what

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
just reversed and it figured out what

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.160 
just reversed and it figured out what
they<00:01:30.470> wanted<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.160> was<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.340> much<00:01:31.490> more<00:01:31.550> brutal

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
they wanted so it was a much more brutal

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.950 
they wanted so it was a much more brutal
western-style<00:01:33.170> fight<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.740> your<00:01:33.890> life
