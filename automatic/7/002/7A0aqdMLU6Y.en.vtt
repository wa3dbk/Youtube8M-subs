00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.600
 Spain' 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.530
 in the end they kill the lamb 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.020
 and they have to give a share to the poor and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.530
 what's left is a week of lamb 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.230
 until they get out of your eyes because 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.549
 every day is a special dish 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.010
 and that children dress dressed 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.409
 new and leave with parents in addition to 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.330
 all the dishes also as always 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.519
 the sweets that are best known in 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.940
 Morocco is both Moroccan and with the 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.420
 tec you can not find the same 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:35.069
 way to prepare dishes in the area 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.420
 like Morocco there are many recipes 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:42.690
 they prepare each one with their own way 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.150
 that's what the Moroccan cuisine has left 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.230
 fortune of the recipes you have of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.569
 true that is very interesting and shows 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.230
 in the north we always prepare it from 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.920
 this way with garlic and parsley 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.620
 and the dive 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.590
 and other areas as I said to us 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.319
 before and ayuntamiento - mate onion but 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.459
 always always the result is the same as 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.130
 a richer dish and very good for the 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.870
 health the children also love 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.510
 but there are some who do not like 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.299
 liver of nothing but you always have to 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.690
 try to eat everything because the 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.510
 children we have to teach them to eat from 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.520
 little of everything is not only that 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.530
 as one thing from another not because 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.660
 feeding children is very important 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.380
 for your health 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.210
 and as always, how to change the way 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.470
 to prepare but they always have to 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.180
 eat everything good I'm going to cover it 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.800
 there are usually some that added a 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.210
 little bit of water to me I do not like that 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.580
 more water comes though it is this way 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.260
 as sautéed we leave it to itself 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.560
 minutes but you can also 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.880
 prepare the same dish with the liver of 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.160
 veal 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.710
 but the duration is not equal to the 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.010
 lamb itself minutes and veal 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.090
 of half an hour and good and then we go back 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.090
 until now 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.840
 to be nice to you again and to our 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.490

 here so you can see very well like this 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:34.460
 It's full of lamb liver 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.650
