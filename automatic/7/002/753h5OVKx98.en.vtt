00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
didn't cut any angles I didn't know what

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.270 
didn't cut any angles I didn't know what
it<00:01:29.430> would<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.090> now<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.680> did<00:01:31.979> was

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it would be right now so what I did was

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.170 
it would be right now so what I did was
I<00:01:32.579> took<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.150> straight<00:01:33.600> edge<00:01:33.810> across<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.180> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I took a straight edge across and you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
I took a straight edge across and you
know<00:01:36.299> basically<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.290> buttered<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
know basically just buttered it up to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.580 
know basically just buttered it up to
both<00:01:39.030> sides<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.579> then<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.670> drew<00:01:41.909> my<00:01:42.090> line

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
both sides here and then I drew my line

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.830 
both sides here and then I drew my line
that<00:01:44.219> is<00:01:45.439> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:47.090> butted<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.479> into

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
that is going to be butted right up into

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.749 
that is going to be butted right up into
here<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.479> nice<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> flat<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
here so I can get nice and flat and

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.679 
here so I can get nice and flat and
everything<00:01:53.759> should<00:01:53.969> get<00:01:54.179> welded<00:01:54.569> together

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
everything should get welded together

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.010 
everything should get welded together
nice<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> smooth<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.450> wanted<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> show

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
nice and smooth so I just wanted to show

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.719 
nice and smooth so I just wanted to show
you<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.200> make<00:01:58.920> sure<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.520> everything

here sticking out on both sides that way

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.030 
here sticking out on both sides that way
everything<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.780> nice<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:12.989> square<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:13.980> going

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to go ahead and tack this up and then

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.289 
to go ahead and tack this up and then
we'll<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.560> trailer<00:02:19.160> okay<00:02:20.160> now<00:02:20.849> I

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
we'll put this on the trailer okay now I

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.729 
we'll put this on the trailer okay now I
have<00:02:22.549> this<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:23.940> tacked<00:02:24.269> up<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.440> said<00:02:25.709> I

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
have this is all tacked up like I said I

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.319 
have this is all tacked up like I said I
double-checked<00:02:26.400> all<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.760> dimensions

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
double-checked all the dimensions

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.720 
double-checked all the dimensions
everything's<00:02:27.810> good<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.410> cut<00:02:28.950> my<00:02:29.129> straight<00:02:29.459> line

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
everything's good I cut my straight line

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.789 
everything's good I cut my straight line
here<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:30.959> would<00:02:31.170> get<00:02:31.319> voted<00:02:31.680> up

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
here so this this would get voted up

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.869 
here so this this would get voted up
along<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.519> rail<00:02:32.849> it's<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.110> welded

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
along this rail it's going to get welded

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.850 
along this rail it's going to get welded
obviously<00:02:35.879> here<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:37.079> going<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.410> get<00:02:37.500> welded

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
obviously here it's going to get welded

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.369 
obviously here it's going to get welded
to<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.489> then<00:02:38.970> when<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> put<00:02:39.510> my<00:02:39.540> floor<00:02:40.079> in

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
to here and then when I put my floor in

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.819 
to here and then when I put my floor in
now<00:02:41.360> those<00:02:42.360> two<00:02:42.690> alone<00:02:42.989> ought<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.560> enough

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
now those two alone ought to be enough

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.979 
now those two alone ought to be enough
on<00:02:44.069> how<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.610> happen<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.239> using<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.720> steel

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
on how I happen to be using a steel

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.020 
on how I happen to be using a steel
floor<00:02:46.349> so<00:02:46.709> I'm<00:02:46.829> also<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.370> wall<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.609> there

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
floor so I'm also going to wall to there

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.680 
floor so I'm also going to wall to there
if<00:02:48.389> you<00:02:48.690> were<00:02:48.810> using<00:02:49.049> wood<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.739> no<00:02:50.250> big<00:02:50.489> deal

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
if you were using wood it's no big deal

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.710 
if you were using wood it's no big deal
there<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.280> plenty<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.239> said<00:02:54.480> because

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
there this is plenty like I said because

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.819 
there this is plenty like I said because
you're<00:02:54.900> not<00:02:55.049> happening

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
you're not happening

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.490 
you're not happening
you<00:02:56.519> don't<00:02:56.910> want<00:02:57.329> all<00:02:57.569> your<00:02:57.870> weight<00:02:58.109> on<00:02:58.139> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
you don't want all your weight on the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.870 
you don't want all your weight on the
tongue<00:02:59.299> really<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:01.109> should<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.440> able<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.980> you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
tongue really you should be able to you

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.490 
tongue really you should be able to you
know<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.120> might<00:03:03.299> be<00:03:03.329> heavy<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.079> should<00:03:04.319> be

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
know it might be heavy but you should be

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.160 
know it might be heavy but you should be

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.770 
able to almost lift lift the tongue up
by<00:03:07.349> yourself<00:03:08.030> unless<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.389> know<00:03:09.510> where<00:03:09.660> your

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
by yourself unless you know where your

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.839 
by yourself unless you know where your
car<00:03:10.260> trailer<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.709> different<00:03:11.190> that's<00:03:11.400> got<00:03:11.670> two

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
car trailer is different that's got two

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.220 
car trailer is different that's got two
axles<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.840> just<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.260> doesn't<00:03:13.590> fit

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
axles and it's just it doesn't fit

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.320 
axles and it's just it doesn't fit
but<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:15.580> have<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.450> centered<00:03:18.300> basically<00:03:19.300> I

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
but I have this centered basically I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.979 
but I have this centered basically I
took<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.989> dimension<00:03:21.690> whatever<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.870> like

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
took this dimension whatever you like

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.520 
took this dimension whatever you like
him<00:03:23.319> out<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.560> be<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:25.060> took<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.930> folks<00:03:26.290> on

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
him out to be and I took the folks on

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.449 
him out to be and I took the folks on
train<00:03:26.860> dimension<00:03:27.519> I<00:03:28.560> subtracted<00:03:29.560> divided<00:03:30.250> by

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
train dimension I subtracted divided by

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.449 
train dimension I subtracted divided by
two<00:03:30.519> maybe<00:03:31.480> three<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.200> quarter<00:03:32.440> from<00:03:33.280> each

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
two maybe three and a quarter from each

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.030 
two maybe three and a quarter from each
end<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.000> frame<00:03:34.239> in<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.500> have<00:03:35.800> that

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
end of the frame in so I have that

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.920 
end of the frame in so I have that
perfectly<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.849> way<00:03:37.060> now<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.420> good<00:03:37.720> way<00:03:37.870> to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
perfectly that way now a good way to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.860 
perfectly that way now a good way to
check<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:40.030> pick<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.239> point<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.810> your

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
check this is to pick a point on your

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.160 
check this is to pick a point on your
axle<00:03:41.530> I'm<00:03:41.680> happen<00:03:42.610> -<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.030> don't<00:03:43.900> know<00:03:43.959> if<00:03:44.049> you

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
axle I'm happen - I don't know if you

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.770 
axle I'm happen - I don't know if you
can<00:03:44.319> see<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.739> or<00:03:44.950> not<00:03:45.299> I'm<00:03:46.299> going<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.569> pick

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
can see this or not I'm going to pick

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.490 
can see this or not I'm going to pick
this<00:03:47.200> axle<00:03:47.910> plate<00:03:48.910> point<00:03:49.390> you'll<00:03:50.019> see<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.349> when

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
this axle plate point you'll see it when

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.949 
this axle plate point you'll see it when
I<00:03:50.560> go<00:03:50.739> over<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.130> other<00:03:51.220> side<00:03:51.660> but<00:03:52.660> I'm

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
I go over to the other side but I'm

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.479 
I go over to the other side but I'm
going<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.380> pull<00:03:53.860> my<00:03:54.099> tape<00:03:54.370> there<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:56.489> I'm

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.120 
on this video but trust me there's a
square<00:04:19.389> plate<00:04:19.780> there<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.289> I<00:04:20.380> can<00:04:20.560> use<00:04:20.709> its

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
square plate there that I can use its

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.390 
square plate there that I can use its
close<00:04:21.549> enough<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:23.320> I've<00:04:23.590> got<00:04:24.389> nine-foot<00:04:26.400> 5/16

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
close enough and I've got nine-foot 5/16

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.379 
close enough and I've got nine-foot 5/16
so<00:04:28.060> I'm<00:04:28.270> off<00:04:28.450> by<00:04:28.750> sixteenth<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.590> an<00:04:29.740> inch<00:04:30.389> big

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
so I'm off by sixteenth of an inch big

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.930 
so I'm off by sixteenth of an inch big
deal<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.680> not<00:04:32.770> going<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.190> matter<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:33.669> thing

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
deal it's not going to matter this thing

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.700 
deal it's not going to matter this thing
this<00:04:34.479> thing<00:04:34.539> is<00:04:34.840> going<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.050> trail<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.500> like<00:04:35.680> a

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
this thing is going to trail it like a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.390 
this thing is going to trail it like a
dream<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.960> everything's<00:04:38.560> what<00:04:38.919> that's<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
dream so everything's what that's the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.550 
dream so everything's what that's the
whole<00:04:39.610> point<00:04:39.970> if<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.750> have<00:04:41.020> everything

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
whole point if you have everything

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.270 
whole point if you have everything
square<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.039> start<00:04:42.310> with<00:04:43.139> everything<00:04:44.139> just<00:04:44.350> it

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
square to start with everything just it

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.129 
square to start with everything just it
makes<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.729> so<00:04:45.940> much<00:04:46.000> smoother<00:04:46.600> on<00:04:46.780> down<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
makes it so much smoother on down the

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.770 
makes it so much smoother on down the
line<00:04:47.350> if<00:04:47.979> you<00:04:48.160> didn't<00:04:48.490> have<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:48.820> square<00:04:49.180> I've

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
line if you didn't have this square I've

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.779 
line if you didn't have this square I've
run<00:04:50.200> into<00:04:50.380> all<00:04:50.620> kinds<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:51.070> problems<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.639> we'd

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
run into all kinds of problems and we'd

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.180 
run into all kinds of problems and we'd
have<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.060> adjust<00:04:52.539> make<00:04:53.320> one<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.680> these<00:04:53.830> legs

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
have to adjust make one of these legs

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.959 
have to adjust make one of these legs
long

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
long

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.879 
long
the<00:04:55.059> other<00:04:55.239> and<00:04:56.819> it's<00:04:57.819> kind<00:04:58.089> of<00:04:58.179> a<00:04:58.269> pain

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
the other and it's kind of a pain

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.769 
the other and it's kind of a pain
you<00:04:59.889> can<00:05:00.009> also<00:05:00.189> cross-reference<00:05:01.149> you<00:05:01.629> know<00:05:01.749> I

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:01.779 
you can also cross-reference you know I

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.859 
you can also cross-reference you know I
I<00:05:02.139> measure<00:05:02.469> from<00:05:02.589> corner<00:05:03.159> or<00:05:03.279> frame<00:05:03.579> I<00:05:04.089> did<00:05:04.689> all

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:04.869 
I measure from corner or frame I did all

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:06.899 
I measure from corner or frame I did all
that<00:05:04.979> triple<00:05:05.979> check<00:05:06.249> everything

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
that triple check everything

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.249 
that triple check everything
it<00:05:07.119> all<00:05:07.439> looks<00:05:08.439> good<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.729> basically<00:05:10.259> we're

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
it all looks good so basically we're

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.649 
it all looks good so basically we're
going<00:05:11.349> to<00:05:11.439> do<00:05:11.649> some<00:05:11.829> welding<00:05:12.419> this<00:05:13.419> is

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
going to do some welding this is

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.019 
going to do some welding this is
critical<00:05:14.289> welding<00:05:14.739> too<00:05:14.919> by<00:05:15.129> the<00:05:15.159> way

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.959 

obviously<00:05:19.259> also<00:05:20.259> don't<00:05:20.860> forget<00:05:21.309> when<00:05:21.939> you

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
obviously also don't forget when you

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.899 
obviously also don't forget when you
mount<00:05:22.299> this<00:05:22.709> make<00:05:23.709> sure<00:05:23.919> this<00:05:24.129> is<00:05:24.309> up<00:05:24.489> set<00:05:24.699> down

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
mount this make sure this is up set down

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.479 
mount this make sure this is up set down
when<00:05:25.209> your<00:05:25.329> trailers<00:05:25.719> upside<00:05:26.139> down<00:05:26.489> it's

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:27.489 
when your trailers upside down it's

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:29.639 
when your trailers upside down it's
really<00:05:27.669> easy<00:05:28.059> to<00:05:28.089> forget<00:05:29.049> about<00:05:29.079> little

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:29.649 
really easy to forget about little

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:31.739 
really easy to forget about little
things<00:05:29.889> like<00:05:30.099> that<00:05:30.159> and<00:05:30.999> then<00:05:31.209> you<00:05:31.299> go<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.449> flip

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:31.749 
things like that and then you go to flip

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.449 
things like that and then you go to flip
the<00:05:31.839> trailer<00:05:32.110> over<00:05:32.379> and<00:05:32.619> your<00:05:32.739> hitch's<00:05:32.919> upside

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:33.459 
the trailer over and your hitch's upside

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:36.839 
the trailer over and your hitch's upside
down<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:33.819> got<00:05:33.939> to<00:05:34.029> cut<00:05:34.179> everything<00:05:34.449> apart<00:05:35.849> as

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
down and got to cut everything apart as

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.079 
down and got to cut everything apart as
far<00:05:37.089> as<00:05:37.209> the<00:05:37.329> hitch<00:05:37.509> goes<00:05:37.779> it's<00:05:38.229> a<00:05:38.529> I<00:05:39.039> made<00:05:39.939> it

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.089 
far as the hitch goes it's a I made it

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:44.969 
far as the hitch goes it's a I made it
for<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.419> two<00:05:40.659> inch<00:05:40.899> ball<00:05:41.399> so<00:05:43.589> I'm<00:05:44.589> basically

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
for a two inch ball so I'm basically

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.039 
for a two inch ball so I'm basically
going<00:05:45.459> to<00:05:45.519> tack<00:05:45.789> this<00:05:46.029> all<00:05:46.329> up<00:05:46.919> and<00:05:48.569> now<00:05:49.569> I'm<00:05:49.869> at

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:50.049 
going to tack this all up and now I'm at

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.139 
going to tack this all up and now I'm at
the<00:05:50.079> point<00:05:50.229> where<00:05:50.799> I'm<00:05:51.249> ready<00:05:51.519> to<00:05:51.849> weld

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:52.149 
the point where I'm ready to weld

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.149 
the point where I'm ready to weld
everything<00:05:52.929> while<00:05:53.139> this<00:05:53.379> thing<00:05:53.589> is<00:05:53.739> upside

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
everything while this thing is upside

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.569 
everything while this thing is upside
down<00:05:54.539> so<00:05:55.539> I'm<00:05:56.349> going<00:05:56.559> to<00:05:56.619> weld<00:05:56.860> everything<00:05:57.399> up

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:57.579 
down so I'm going to weld everything up

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:00.779 
down so I'm going to weld everything up
now<00:05:57.819> I<00:05:58.449> want<00:05:58.809> to<00:05:58.869> skip<00:05:59.139> around<00:05:59.289> like<00:06:00.129> a<00:06:00.279> little

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
now I want to skip around like a little

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.909 
now I want to skip around like a little
bit<00:06:01.059> here<00:06:01.389> then<00:06:01.899> I'll<00:06:02.050> start<00:06:02.289> welding<00:06:02.559> over

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
bit here then I'll start welding over

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.939 
bit here then I'll start welding over
there<00:06:03.719> jump<00:06:04.719> around<00:06:04.959> that<00:06:05.559> way<00:06:05.739> you're<00:06:05.919> not

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
there jump around that way you're not

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.179 
there jump around that way you're not
just<00:06:06.239> pouring<00:06:07.239> heat<00:06:07.509> all<00:06:07.749> into<00:06:08.319> you<00:06:08.800> know<00:06:08.919> one

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
just pouring heat all into you know one

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.519 
just pouring heat all into you know one
spot<00:06:09.610> by<00:06:10.119> the<00:06:10.179> time<00:06:10.479> I<00:06:10.629> get<00:06:10.809> back<00:06:10.989> over<00:06:11.229> to<00:06:11.409> this

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
spot by the time I get back over to this

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.040 
spot by the time I get back over to this
area<00:06:11.829> this<00:06:12.099> will<00:06:12.309> cool<00:06:12.519> down<00:06:12.550> a<00:06:12.789> little<00:06:12.969> bit<00:06:13.329> so

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
area this will cool down a little bit so

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.749 
area this will cool down a little bit so
that's<00:06:14.199> what<00:06:14.439> you<00:06:14.529> want<00:06:14.709> to<00:06:14.769> do<00:06:14.949> when<00:06:15.610> you're

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
that's what you want to do when you're

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.100 
that's what you want to do when you're
welding<00:06:15.969> and<00:06:16.269> that<00:06:16.419> way<00:06:16.569> things<00:06:16.869> aren't

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
welding and that way things aren't

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.650 
welding and that way things aren't
twisted<00:06:17.409> and<00:06:18.179> warping

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
twisted and warping

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.390 
twisted and warping
it's<00:06:21.170> going<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:21.470> move<00:06:21.590> a<00:06:21.770> little<00:06:21.920> bit<00:06:22.130> but

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
it's going to move a little bit but

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.620 
it's going to move a little bit but
that's<00:06:22.520> no<00:06:22.790> big<00:06:23.000> deal<00:06:24.280> if<00:06:25.280> you<00:06:25.430> want<00:06:25.730> if<00:06:26.420> you

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
that's no big deal if you want if you

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.570 
that's no big deal if you want if you
feel<00:06:26.930> like<00:06:27.140> you<00:06:27.290> need<00:06:27.470> more<00:06:27.680> whelming<00:06:28.100> surface

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
feel like you need more whelming surface

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.750 
feel like you need more whelming surface
you<00:06:29.450> could<00:06:29.630> put<00:06:29.870> gussets<00:06:30.380> in<00:06:30.530> here

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
you could put gussets in here

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.480 
you could put gussets in here
you<00:06:32.150> know<00:06:32.270> cut<00:06:32.510> yourself<00:06:32.900> some<00:06:32.960> plate<00:06:33.490> I've

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
you know cut yourself some plate I've

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.550 
you know cut yourself some plate I've
made<00:06:34.790> I'm<00:06:35.240> not<00:06:35.660> going<00:06:35.900> to<00:06:35.960> do<00:06:36.110> that<00:06:36.260> because

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
made I'm not going to do that because

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.260 
made I'm not going to do that because
like<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.280> said<00:06:37.520> I'm<00:06:37.670> going<00:06:37.790> to<00:06:37.880> have<00:06:38.000> sheet

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
like I said I'm going to have sheet

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.930 
like I said I'm going to have sheet
metal<00:06:38.600> on<00:06:38.720> here<00:06:39.050> and<00:06:39.400> I'm<00:06:40.400> just<00:06:40.670> going<00:06:40.850> to

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
metal on here and I'm just going to

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.640 
metal on here and I'm just going to
stitch<00:06:41.210> it<00:06:41.240> to<00:06:41.540> the<00:06:41.630> sheet<00:06:41.870> metal<00:06:42.200> so<00:06:42.380> it'll<00:06:42.530> be

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
stitch it to the sheet metal so it'll be

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.200 
stitch it to the sheet metal so it'll be
weld<00:06:42.830> it<00:06:42.950> to<00:06:43.070> the<00:06:43.130> floor<00:06:43.460> and<00:06:43.730> the<00:06:44.060> framework

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
weld it to the floor and the framework

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.540 
weld it to the floor and the framework
but<00:06:47.210> you<00:06:47.810> know<00:06:47.950> suit<00:06:48.950> yourself

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
but you know suit yourself

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.600 
but you know suit yourself
if<00:06:49.970> you're<00:06:50.600> using<00:06:50.810> wood<00:06:51.200> might<00:06:51.980> not<00:06:52.190> be<00:06:52.370> a<00:06:52.400> bad

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
if you're using wood might not be a bad

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.460 
if you're using wood might not be a bad
idea<00:06:52.670> to<00:06:53.060> put<00:06:53.330> a<00:06:53.360> little<00:06:53.420> extra<00:06:53.780> something<00:06:54.200> in

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
idea to put a little extra something in

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.740 
idea to put a little extra something in
just<00:06:55.250> from<00:06:55.460> one<00:06:55.640> welding<00:06:56.060> surface<00:06:56.420> you<00:06:56.570> don't

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
just from one welding surface you don't

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.290 
just from one welding surface you don't
need<00:06:56.990> anymore<00:06:57.260> beef<00:06:57.650> on<00:06:57.890> the<00:06:57.980> trailer

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
need anymore beef on the trailer

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.270 
need anymore beef on the trailer
the<00:06:59.660> only<00:06:59.840> reason<00:07:00.260> for<00:07:00.290> the<00:07:00.530> gussets<00:07:00.950> would<00:07:01.130> be

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
the only reason for the gussets would be

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.700 
the only reason for the gussets would be
to<00:07:01.370> get<00:07:01.550> more<00:07:01.850> well<00:07:02.210> from<00:07:02.960> the<00:07:03.110> hitch<00:07:03.320> to<00:07:03.590> the

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
to get more well from the hitch to the

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.080 
to get more well from the hitch to the
trailer<00:07:04.160> so<00:07:06.070> yeah<00:07:07.070> I'm<00:07:07.370> going<00:07:07.550> to<00:07:07.640> weld<00:07:07.820> it<00:07:07.940> up

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
trailer so yeah I'm going to weld it up

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.160 
trailer so yeah I'm going to weld it up
and<00:07:08.300> then<00:07:08.390> we're<00:07:08.540> going<00:07:08.630> to<00:07:08.690> flip<00:07:08.900> this<00:07:09.110> thing

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
and then we're going to flip this thing

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.560 
and then we're going to flip this thing
over
