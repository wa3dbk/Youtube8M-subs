the sling monitor which what is it the
same<00:01:21.990> monitor<00:01:22.320> 150<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.010> it<00:01:23.430> actually

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
same monitor 150 now it actually

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
instead of having to have another

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
instead of having to have another
computer<00:01:27.990> setup<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> sling<00:01:29.520> capture<00:01:29.909> cut

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.450 
that's connected to a TV it's an
all-in-one<00:01:31.619> device<00:01:31.830> now<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.280> that's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
all-in-one device now I think that's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
all-in-one device now I think that's
pretty<00:01:32.610> cool<00:01:32.820> ideas<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.330> general<00:01:33.720> comment

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
update or something to make it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.400 
update or something to make it
compatible<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.750> plug<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> directly<00:02:04.110> into

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
compatible you can plug it directly into

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.460 
compatible you can plug it directly into
