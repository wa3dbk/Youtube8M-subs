00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.080
 how about all the good youtube band 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.670
 in this video we are going to dismantle and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.220
 repair our shock absorbers 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.660
 front well before all I want 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.040
 clarify that this is done with the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 purpose of knowing if it is or not 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.990
 It is advisable to repair or change 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.760
 shock absorbers well let's start what 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.949
 first it will be dismantling the wheels 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.560
 front and locate our shock absorber 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.119
 and what we will do to remove it observe 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 these screws that hold the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 shock absorber to the handle of the wheel these 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.180
 they are in measurement of 18 millimeters and the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 we are going to remove and he must see us like this 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.770
 now remove these two nuts in measure 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 on average and ready you can remove the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.600
 damper ok now with this weird 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.700
 artifact that looks more like a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.550
 torture instrument we are going to compress 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.170
 the springs xp you need to acquire 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.540
 one I recommend this one that is more 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.399
 economic and does the same thing well already 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.200
 compressed remove the nut from 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.780
 center cushion and ready and 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.850
 we can decompress and disarm it is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.550
 important that you observe how it goes armed 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.489
 so that when arming we do not make mistakes 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.649
 I will put them in the order that removes them 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.810
 Now let's repair it if you only 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.180
 will replace only subtract the margin 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.220
 I 'm going to repair it, first thing will be 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 make a hole in the lower part of the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 shock absorber with an eighth drill 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.750
 because that measure because they swell me 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.149
 the eggs xd is not true it is recommended 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.340
 one of three 32s but one of an eighth 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.619
 it's almost the same and easier to get 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.689
 ok now let's fill our 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.159
 shock absorber with the new oil this what 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.840
 we do introducing our 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.000
 cushion in a container with the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.310
 oil to be used by pulling the plunger with 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.920
 the hole open and pushing covering 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 with your finger another method would be to fill it 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.909
 with a syringe and taking out all the air 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 actually these methods are somewhat 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.319
 difficult well already filled with oil we 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.709
 it remains to cover the hole this we do 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.450
 welding to cover it completely 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.700
 well you have already done this it is up to us to put together and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.470
 ride it again well we start 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.360
 putting together first we put the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.640
 shock absorber on top and what 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.649
 we fix with the half nuts 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 Now we put the handle of the wheel and 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.200
 we fix it with 18 screws 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.140
 millimeters place the wheel and you're ready 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.640
 it's all now let's comment if it is or 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 not recommendable 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.319
 the particular I do not recommend it so 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.390
 next you need a plant to 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.750
 weld since if we use another method 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.550
 there could be leaks you also need 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.610
 a compressor springs and oil 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.650
 to recharge if your old shock absorber 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.750
 already leaking even if it repairs it will continue 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.400
 founding apart from taking me almost 10 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.220
 hours repairing those and when trying them 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.640
 they were quite hard on the particular 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.230
 it was wasted time and I ended up frustrated 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.180
 good friends that's all remember the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.040
 decision is yours do not forget to leave a 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.080
