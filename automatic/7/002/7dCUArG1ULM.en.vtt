like this but when you see it on the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.480 
like this but when you see it on the
light<00:01:51.320> well<00:01:51.500> as<00:01:51.590> soon<00:01:51.710> as<00:01:51.830> i<00:01:51.920> swatched<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.250> i'm

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
in packages that look like this which

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.639 
in packages that look like this which
doesn't<00:02:07.430> matter<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.000> much<00:02:08.030> for<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.200> lighter

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
kind of grouping all over my face it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.490 
kind of grouping all over my face it
just<00:02:53.000> looks<00:02:53.300> terrible<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.110> anyway<00:02:54.320> from<00:02:54.440> what

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
just looks terrible so anyway from what

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
I understand it's the same color

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.690 
I understand it's the same color
different<00:02:56.870> formula<00:02:57.290> as<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.650> old<00:02:57.800> gash<00:02:58.070> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
different formula as the old gash the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.090 
different formula as the old gash the
formula<00:02:59.060> does<00:02:59.240> feel<00:02:59.450> different<00:02:59.650> than<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
formula does feel different than the

older lipsticks I have but to me it
feels<00:03:03.050> very<00:03:03.350> much<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.800> same<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.670> rest<00:03:04.820> of

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
feels very much the same as the rest of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.050 
feels very much the same as the rest of
the<00:03:05.030> revolution<00:03:05.510> lipsticks<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:05.990> I<00:03:06.110> have<00:03:07.060> it

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
does not dry this particular formula

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.600 
does not dry this particular formula
does<00:03:10.910> not<00:03:11.150> dry<00:03:11.420> on<00:03:11.600> me<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.020> does<00:03:12.410> stain<00:03:12.800> this

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
does not dry on me it does stain this

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.530 
does not dry on me it does stain this
color<00:03:14.380> lasts<00:03:15.380> like<00:03:16.090> unbelievable<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.270> part

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540

of<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.780> just<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.230> it's<00:03:18.440> hard<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.770> get<00:03:18.890> off

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
of it is just that it's hard to get off

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.520 
of it is just that it's hard to get off
it<00:03:19.250> does<00:03:19.430> stain<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.480> when<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:20.990> color

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
stains like this it's gonna look a lot

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.310 
stains like this it's gonna look a lot
