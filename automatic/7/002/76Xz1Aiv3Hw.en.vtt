hello<00:00:02.550> guys<00:00:02.700> tensile<00:00:03.210> EK<00:00:03.510> here<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.170> PBE

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hello guys tensile EK here on the PBE

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.700 
hello guys tensile EK here on the PBE
i'm<00:00:05.009> doing<00:00:05.700> some<00:00:05.850> testing<00:00:06.240> with<00:00:06.299> echo<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.230> i

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
i'm doing some testing with echo and i

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.700 
i'm doing some testing with echo and i
just<00:00:08.069> noticed<00:00:08.760> something<00:00:09.019> whenever<00:00:10.019> i<00:00:10.050> recall

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
just noticed something whenever i recall

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.240 
just noticed something whenever i recall
the<00:00:11.550> old<00:00:12.410> shadow<00:00:13.410> thingy<00:00:14.360> it-it<00:00:15.980> flies<00:00:16.980> across

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the old shadow thingy it-it flies across

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.660 
the old shadow thingy it-it flies across
the<00:00:17.520> map<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.080> will<00:00:19.340> fly<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.199> spawn<00:00:22.670> but

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the map so it will fly to the spawn but

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.980 
the map so it will fly to the spawn but
it<00:00:23.850> takes<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.090> time<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.810> there

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it takes some time for you to get there

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
it takes some time for you to get there
I<00:00:25.260> think<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.220> four<00:00:26.369> seconds<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:26.849> this

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
I think it's four seconds because this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.439 
I think it's four seconds because this
alters<00:00:27.810> four<00:00:28.289> seconds<00:00:28.760> back<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.939> time<00:00:30.119> but

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
alters four seconds back in time but

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.450 
alters four seconds back in time but
there<00:00:30.750> i'm<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.080> sure<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.980> i'm<00:00:32.070> gonna<00:00:32.250> do

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there i'm not sure but what i'm gonna do

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
there i'm not sure but what i'm gonna do
is<00:00:32.489> i'm<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> test<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:34.079> time<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
is i'm going to test if I can time it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.930 
is i'm going to test if I can time it
right<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.130> recall<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:37.200> end<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.590> at

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
right so recall and then end up at

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.080 
right so recall and then end up at
around<00:00:38.960> dragon<00:00:39.960> rip<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.899> place<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> he

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
around dragon rip off this place so he

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.090 
around dragon rip off this place so he
can<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.789> teleport<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
can actually get a teleport with I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.090 
can actually get a teleport with I
should<00:00:50.100> probably<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.520> bought<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> home<00:00:52.890> guy

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
should probably have bought the home guy

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.680 
should probably have bought the home guy
boots<00:00:55.280> well<00:00:56.280> no<00:00:56.579> time<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.030> he'll<00:00:57.270> he'll

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
boots well no time for that he'll he'll

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.349 
boots well no time for that he'll he'll
get<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> boost<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.129> he<00:00:59.280> could<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.699> could

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
get the boost so he could I could

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.049 
get the boost so he could I could
basically<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.809> i<00:01:00.899> recall<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.649> could<00:01:02.059> get

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
basically if i recall here I could get

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.899 
basically if i recall here I could get
back<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:04.140> home<00:01:04.350> guards<00:01:04.680> end<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> dragon<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
so keep an eye on the mini-map and right

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.690 
so keep an eye on the mini-map and right
here<00:01:40.400> let's<00:01:41.400> check<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.909> his<00:01:42.060> whole<00:01:42.810> thing

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
here let's check for his whole thing

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.300 
here let's check for his whole thing
there<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.750> nope<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.590> ended<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.100> here

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
there go and nope I ended up here

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.480 
there go and nope I ended up here
alright<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.689> only<00:01:48.840> teleport<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
alright so you can only teleport to the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.330 
alright so you can only teleport to the
spot<00:01:51.409> my<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:53.149> shadow<00:01:54.149> clone<00:01:54.810> time<00:01:55.560> anomaly

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
spot my my shadow clone time anomaly

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.230 
spot my my shadow clone time anomaly
thing<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:57.110> right<00:01:58.110> around<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.560> dragon<00:01:58.979> pit

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
thing was right around the dragon pit

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
thing was right around the dragon pit
but<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.930> used<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.890> ended<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.250> here

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
but then I used it and I ended up here

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.999 
but then I used it and I ended up here
so<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.840> end<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
so you can you can do that end up the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.709 
so you can you can do that end up the
place<00:02:05.310> where<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.579> recall<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> can't<00:02:06.509> end

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
place where you recall but you can't end

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.100 
place where you recall but you can't end
up<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.129> random<00:02:08.129> place<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.610> between<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.840> place

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
up and random place in between the place

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.000 
up and random place in between the place
you<00:02:10.590> recalled<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
you recalled and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.990 
you recalled and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
spawn i also tried this with them with

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.240 
spawn i also tried this with them with
teleport<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:18.079> it<00:02:18.349> seems<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.739> be<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.069> same

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
teleport but it seems to be the same

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.940 
teleport but it seems to be the same
case<00:02:20.439> so<00:02:21.439> that's<00:02:22.269> yeah<00:02:23.269> i'm<00:02:23.989> also<00:02:24.230> gonna<00:02:24.470> do
