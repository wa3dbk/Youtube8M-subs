00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
the color is much warmer so this ball

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
could show different layers of weather

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.620 
could show different layers of weather

show<00:03:33.810> also<00:03:34.020> different<00:03:34.440> layers<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.739> news

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
show also different layers of news

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.199 
show also different layers of news
information<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:37.410> other<00:03:37.920> purposes<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.820> this

multiple icons like that and so the
weather<00:04:55.940> in<00:04:56.120> different<00:04:56.420> places<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.780> see<00:04:57.020> you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
weather in different places you see you

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.830 
weather in different places you see you
see<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.650> snow<00:04:57.890> here<00:04:58.220> in<00:04:58.340> Ottawa<00:04:58.700> and<00:04:58.910> sunny

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
see it snow here in Ottawa and sunny

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.990 
see it snow here in Ottawa and sunny
here<00:05:00.080> in<00:05:00.200> Minneapolis<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:03.040> could<00:05:04.040> I<00:05:04.280> could<00:05:04.820> use

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
here in Minneapolis I could I could use

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.090 
here in Minneapolis I could I could use
different<00:05:05.390> types<00:05:05.570> of<00:05:05.780> weather<00:05:05.960> icons<00:05:06.470> I<00:05:06.650> could

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
different types of weather icons I could

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.250 
different types of weather icons I could
use<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.550> wind<00:05:07.910> speed<00:05:08.150> icon<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:08.630> will<00:05:08.780> sample

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
use a wind speed icon that will sample

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:16.300 
use a wind speed icon that will sample
the<00:05:09.380> wind<00:05:09.590> speed<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.160> every<00:05:10.640> place<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:16.190> I

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
the wind speed in every place and I

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.650 
the wind speed in every place and I
could<00:05:16.490> even<00:05:16.670> have<00:05:17.000> a<00:05:19.630> five-day<00:05:20.630> forecast<00:05:22.660> that

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
could even have a five-day forecast that

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.660 
could even have a five-day forecast that
inter<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.260> is<00:05:24.410> interactively<00:05:25.100> changing

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
inter that is interactively changing

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.590 
inter that is interactively changing
according<00:05:26.450> to<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.690> place<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.230> am<00:05:27.650> over<00:05:28.250> as<00:05:28.600> you

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
according to the place I am over as you

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600 
according to the place I am over as you
can<00:05:29.750> see<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.440> five-day<00:05:30.830> forecast<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.400> name

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
can see the five-day forecast the name

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.820 
can see the five-day forecast the name
and<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.240> temperatures<00:05:32.750> are<00:05:33.020> interactively

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
and the temperatures are interactively

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.340 
and the temperatures are interactively
changing<00:05:34.280> wherever<00:05:35.030> whenever<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.630> move<00:05:35.900> so<00:05:36.169> I

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
changing wherever whenever I move so I

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.080 
changing wherever whenever I move so I
could<00:05:36.740> tell<00:05:37.010> a<00:05:37.040> story<00:05:37.400> as<00:05:37.669> a<00:05:37.760> where<00:05:38.000> the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
could tell a story as a where the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.840 
could tell a story as a where the
presenter<00:05:38.380> tell<00:05:39.380> a<00:05:39.410> story<00:05:39.770> in<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.490> order<00:05:40.820> I

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
presenter tell a story in the order I

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.460 
presenter tell a story in the order I
like<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.300> tell<00:05:41.480> it<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:41.720> show<00:05:42.169> interesting

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
like to tell it and show interesting

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.090 
like to tell it and show interesting
places<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:44.560> finally<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:47.260> could<00:05:48.260> show<00:05:48.440> the

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
places and finally I could show the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.000 
places and finally I could show the
radar<00:05:49.520> information<00:05:50.240> to<00:05:51.110> illustrate<00:05:51.590> really
