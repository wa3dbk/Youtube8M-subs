really is using the fingers in a fan
kind<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.320> way<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.770> go<00:01:06.950> across<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.610> street<00:01:07.820> and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
kind of way you go across the street and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.920 
kind of way you go across the street and
then<00:01:09.250> there<00:01:10.250> are<00:01:10.280> many<00:01:10.520> ways<00:01:10.790> of<00:01:11.090> doing<00:01:11.570> it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
then there are many ways of doing it

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.590 
then there are many ways of doing it
I'll<00:01:12.110> show<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.500> few<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.760> go<00:01:13.970> down<00:01:14.330> like

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
I'll show you a few and you go down like

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.110 
I'll show you a few and you go down like
that<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.080> return<00:01:15.650> with<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.950> thumb<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:19.130> it's

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
that and return with the thumb and it's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.440 
that and return with the thumb and it's
quite<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> traditional<00:01:21.140> sound<00:01:21.470> they<00:01:22.270> did<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
quite a traditional sound they did the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.660 
quite a traditional sound they did the
other<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.080> other<00:01:24.260> basic<00:01:24.830> way<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.010> do<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.460> is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
other the other basic way to do that is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.210 
other the other basic way to do that is
going<00:01:25.909> down<00:01:27.070> with<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.190> finger<00:01:29.890> back<00:01:30.890> with<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
going down with the finger back with the

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
going down with the finger back with the
index<00:01:31.580> perhaps

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.969 

so<00:01:40.869> you<00:01:40.960> go<00:01:41.140> Fanning<00:01:41.890> down<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.439> returning

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
so you go Fanning down and returning

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.429 
so you go Fanning down and returning
with<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.189> index<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:48.820> Francie<00:01:49.539> odd<00:01:49.689> oh<00:01:49.750> there

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
with the index one Francie odd oh there

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.279 
with the index one Francie odd oh there
are<00:01:50.560> other<00:01:50.740> ways<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.189> doing<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.810> example<00:01:53.079> I

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
are other ways of doing it for example I

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.809 
are other ways of doing it for example I
do<00:01:53.350> one<00:01:53.679> which<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:54.009> in<00:01:54.250> triplets<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:57.460> quite

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
do one which is in triplets it's quite

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.830 
do one which is in triplets it's quite
staccato<00:01:58.479> tickety<00:01:58.960> tickety<00:01:59.079> and<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:01.539> do<00:02:01.600> that

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
staccato tickety tickety and I do that

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.590 
staccato tickety tickety and I do that
with<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.140> thumb<00:02:02.530> going<00:02:02.829> up<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:04.270> little

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
with the thumb going up the little

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.990 
with the thumb going up the little
finger<00:02:04.869> going<00:02:05.079> down<00:02:05.289> and<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.280> index<00:02:06.729> going

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
finger going down and the index going

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.009 
finger going down and the index going
down<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:15.580> sort<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.849> thing<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.269> there<00:02:16.930> are

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
down that sort of thing if there are

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.539 
down that sort of thing if there are
other<00:02:17.200> ways<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.650> doing<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.519> for

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
other ways of doing it you do for

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.820 
other ways of doing it you do for
example<00:02:18.790> with<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.360> third<00:02:20.049> finger<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
example with the third finger and the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:34.850 
example with the third finger and the
index

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.340 

down<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.610> annular<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.990> third

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
down with the annular with the third

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.700 
down with the annular with the third
finger<00:02:37.770> down<00:02:38.010> with<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> index<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.990> back<00:02:40.500> with

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
finger down with the index and back with

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.160 
finger down with the index and back with
the<00:02:40.830> ending<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.570> do<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.960> with<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the ending you can do that with the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.170 
the ending you can do that with the
little<00:02:43.410> one<00:02:43.560> as<00:02:43.680> well<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:46.230> many<00:02:46.950> ways<00:02:47.220> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
little one as well so that many ways you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.830 
little one as well so that many ways you
go<00:02:48.330> down<00:02:49.050> with<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.620> middle<00:02:50.250> finger<00:02:50.580> down<00:02:51.540> with

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
go down with the middle finger down with

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.810 
go down with the middle finger down with
the<00:02:51.930> thumb<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:53.130> back<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.880> thumb<00:02:55.820> so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
the thumb and back with the thumb so

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.790 
the thumb and back with the thumb so
there<00:02:57.390> are<00:02:57.510> different<00:02:57.990> ways<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.350> expressing

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
there are different ways of expressing

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.220 
there are different ways of expressing
this<00:02:59.310> particular<00:03:00.270> characteristic<00:03:00.930> flamenco

this particular characteristic flamenco

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.840 
this particular characteristic flamenco
sound<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.770> different<00:03:02.130> people<00:03:02.580> use<00:03:03.240> different

sound and different people use different

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.580 
sound and different people use different
versions<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.180> because<00:03:06.630> they<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:07.350> to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
versions of it because they like to

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.020 
versions of it because they like to
project<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:08.250> particular<00:03:08.580> sound<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:10.500> one<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.680> use

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
project a particular sound the one I use

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.320 
project a particular sound the one I use
most<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.080> traditional<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.890> which<00:03:17.330> is

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
most is the the traditional one which is

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.510 
most is the the traditional one which is
using<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.990> fingers<00:03:19.440> down<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:19.980> back<00:03:20.310> with

using all the fingers down and back with

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.150 
using all the fingers down and back with
the<00:03:20.640> index<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.330> also<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.440> one<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> have

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the index and also the one that I have

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.330 
the index and also the one that I have
