probably not gonna get to play thief

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.030 
probably not gonna get to play thief
until<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.910> weekend<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.660> it's<00:03:54.989> always<00:03:55.230> tough

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
until the weekend and it's always tough

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.800

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
weekend really as tough now with having

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.199 
weekend really as tough now with having
a<00:04:00.180> family<00:04:00.739> but<00:04:01.739> I'd<00:04:01.920> say<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:02.280> probably<00:04:02.820> not

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
a family but I'd say it's probably not

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.090 
a family but I'd say it's probably not
wise<00:04:03.360> happens<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.019> you're<00:04:04.230> probably<00:04:04.650> now
