00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
really low but when I do a ponytail I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
really low but when I do a ponytail I
actually<00:01:02.820> started<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.589> ear

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
actually started at about with my ear

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually started at about with my ear
level<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.180> try<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> lift<00:01:06.780> my

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
level so right now if I try to lift my

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
level so right now if I try to lift my
hair<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.340> any<00:01:08.549> West<00:01:08.850> normally

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
hair you will not see any West normally

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
hair you will not see any West normally
if<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.840> wear<00:01:10.080> my<00:01:10.110> hair<00:01:10.500> down<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.890> clip<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.280> hair

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
if I wear my hair down with clip in hair

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
if I wear my hair down with clip in hair
extensions<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.119> usually<00:01:12.780> start<00:01:12.990> quite<00:01:13.229> low

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
extensions I usually start quite low

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
extensions I usually start quite low
because<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.920> doesn't<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.280> matter<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
because it doesn't really matter if you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
because it doesn't really matter if you
start<00:01:15.240> low<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.200> longer<00:01:16.439> hair

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
start low you actually get longer hair

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.469 
start low you actually get longer hair
or<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.159> looks<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.700> longer<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.180> with

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
or it looks like it's longer but with

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
or it looks like it's longer but with
ponytail<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> lift

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
ponytail if you do that and you lift

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.649 
ponytail if you do that and you lift
your<00:01:20.460> hair<00:01:20.640> you're<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.240> some<00:01:21.450> bumps

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
your hair you're gonna have some bumps

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
your hair you're gonna have some bumps
here<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.380> whoops<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.890> sticking<00:01:23.159> out

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
here and the whoops will be sticking out

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
here and the whoops will be sticking out
so<00:01:23.610> therefore<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.659> leave<00:01:24.810> more<00:01:25.080> hair<00:01:25.409> here

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
so therefore I just leave more hair here

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039 
so therefore I just leave more hair here
at<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> bottom<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> clip<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.270> 3<00:01:27.780> clip

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
at the bottom and then I clip in 3 clip

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.499 
at the bottom and then I clip in 3 clip
weft<00:01:28.259> 4<00:01:28.770> clip<00:01:29.009> weft<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.610> another<00:01:29.909> 4<00:01:30.270> clip

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
weft 4 clip weft then another 4 clip

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.600 
weft 4 clip weft then another 4 clip
weft<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> another<00:01:31.380> 3<00:01:31.650> clip<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.040> really

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
weft and another 3 clip but really

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
weft and another 3 clip but really
really<00:01:32.729> close<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> each<00:01:33.299> other<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.900> I'll<00:01:34.350> show

maybe you'll see it can you see that's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
maybe you'll see it can you see that's
kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.799> part<00:01:41.220> because<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> want<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
kind of that part because if you want to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.090 
kind of that part because if you want to
gather<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.049> hair<00:01:43.079> together<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.890> this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
gather all the hair together like this

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
gather all the hair together like this
and<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.610> nothing<00:01:44.850> sticking<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.780> find

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and have nothing sticking out I find

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.749 
and have nothing sticking out I find
that<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.829> works<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> best<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.520> me

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that this is what works the best for me

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.520 
that this is what works the best for me
so<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.479> pull<00:01:48.780> my<00:01:48.930> hair<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
so right now if I pull my hair in a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
so right now if I pull my hair in a
ponytail<00:01:49.890> there's<00:01:50.460> nothing<00:01:50.880> sticking<00:01:51.060> out

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
ponytail there's nothing sticking out

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
ponytail there's nothing sticking out
from<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> sides<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:51.780> obviously<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.350> not

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
from the sides because obviously I'm not

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
from the sides because obviously I'm not
wearing<00:01:52.799> any<00:01:52.950> words<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.460> nothing<00:01:53.939> from<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
wearing any words there nothing from the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
wearing any words there nothing from the
bottom<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.689> perfect<00:01:55.110> base<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.590> long<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
bottom it's perfect base for long and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
bottom it's perfect base for long and
thick<00:01:56.460> ponytail<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> start<00:01:58.079> up

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
thick ponytail I'm going to start up

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.170 
thick ponytail I'm going to start up
just<00:01:58.469> by<00:01:58.590> splitting<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> hair<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.700> two<00:01:59.969> equal

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just by splitting the hair in two equal

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.990 
just by splitting the hair in two equal
sections<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.110> somewhat<00:02:02.009> equal<00:02:02.369> sections<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
sections or somewhat equal sections and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.080 
sections or somewhat equal sections and
then<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.200> gonna<00:02:04.530> grab<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.130> longest<00:02:05.670> hair

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
then I'm gonna grab the longest hair

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.180 
then I'm gonna grab the longest hair
from<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> sides<00:02:07.170> either<00:02:07.649> left<00:02:08.009> or

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
from one of the sides either left or

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.290 
from one of the sides either left or
right<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.640> doesn't<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.030> make<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
right it doesn't really make a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.510 
right it doesn't really make a
difference<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.259> once<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.099> section

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
difference so once I have that section

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.290 
difference so once I have that section
picked<00:02:11.819> I'm

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
picked I'm

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.660 
picked I'm
just<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.660> grab<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:12.960> bring<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.710> over<00:02:14.310> my

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
just going to grab it bring it over my

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.590 
just going to grab it bring it over my
left<00:02:14.940> section<00:02:15.240> like<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.090> under<00:02:18.090> my

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
left section like that and under my

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.260 
left section like that and under my
right<00:02:18.840> section<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.590> then<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.550> same<00:02:20.760> section

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
right section and then the same section

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.120 
right section and then the same section
so<00:02:21.750> you're<00:02:21.900> only<00:02:21.990> working<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.650> now<00:02:22.740> with<00:02:22.890> one

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
so you're only working for now with one

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.460 
so you're only working for now with one
section<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.760> same<00:02:23.940> section<00:02:24.360> goes<00:02:24.630> over<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
section the same section goes over the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.830 
section the same section goes over the
right<00:02:25.650> section<00:02:25.980> wraps<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:27.360> section

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
right section wraps the right section

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.530 
right section wraps the right section
and<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.230> goes<00:02:28.470> under<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.610> left<00:02:29.790> section<00:02:30.150> I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
and then goes under the left section I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.330 
and then goes under the left section I
know<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:30.990> sounds<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> bit<00:02:31.290> confusing<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:32.130> just

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
know it sounds a bit confusing but just

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.220 
know it sounds a bit confusing but just
watch<00:02:32.550> what<00:02:32.880> I'm<00:02:32.970> doing<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.870> same

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
watch what I'm doing so now the same

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.720 
watch what I'm doing so now the same
thing<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.530> going<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.710> happen<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.580> I'm

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
thing is going to happen but here I'm

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.170 
thing is going to happen but here I'm
going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> go<00:02:36.150> over<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.900> left<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.180> just

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
going to go over the left and just

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.840 
going to go over the left and just
tighten<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.080> do<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.770> under<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
tighten it as I do that and under the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.820 
tighten it as I do that and under the
right<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.330> you're<00:02:42.450> always<00:02:42.630> going<00:02:42.870> over<00:02:43.470> under

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
right so you're always going over under

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.920 
right so you're always going over under
over<00:02:43.860> under<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.610> wrapping<00:02:45.150> around<00:02:45.270> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
over under and wrapping around the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.750 
over under and wrapping around the
sections<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.830> right<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> left<00:02:47.370> section

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
sections the right and the left section

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.420 
sections the right and the left section
so<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.690> steps<00:02:48.960> are<00:02:49.200> quite<00:02:49.410> easy<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.250> just

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
so the steps are quite easy it's just

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.130 
so the steps are quite easy it's just
you<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.820> get<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> hang<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.050> a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
you have to get a hang of it so do it a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.980 
you have to get a hang of it so do it a
few<00:02:52.320> times<00:02:52.590> until<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:53.100> get<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:54.810> I'm

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
few times until you get it so now I'm

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.380
