00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.830
 good 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.650
 today in cox blocks we have the interceptor 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.320
 light eta 2 class active best 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.869
 known as the interceptor you die or 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.720
 even more known as the yellow ship 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.670
 from enix good one of many ships that has 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.369
 had this character anakin skywalker 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.590
 in this case of episode 3 of star wars 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.390
 here we see the different versions that 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.789
 the ego has taken out of this character not 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.500
 they are all people mostly and in the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.570
 box we see the last of them the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.609
 2012 version where Anna who has those 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.979
 Evil eyes since it has fallen on 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.589
 power of the dark side already in change 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:43.690
 our figure is from 2014 it still has 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.909
 a friendly face since still 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.120
 been on the side of the good guys and we see it 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.149
 with his blue saber we see that the torso 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.710
 it is printed on the front and on the back 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.139
 although the colors of the mini figure 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.940
 coffee and black because they do not help much 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.280
 design since it gets a little lost 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.039
 good from far because close up if you see 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.260
 our character has double printed 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.240
 face a serious face and a face a 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.640
 as happy as if he had seen his 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.360
 girlfriend patme both faces bring this 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.360
 golden headband 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.500
 and here we have our droid more 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.970
 famous of the universe arturito also 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.650
 we see the different versions that the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.230
 ego has taken from him the last one was the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.000
 passed in 2013 on the floating barge of 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.000
 java de hot came out as a waiter 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.140
 there were no significant changes other than 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.520
 in color on the head and if anything a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.520
 little lens design 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.920
 the head has always been white or 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.630
 clear vis this year because it comes in a tone 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.400
 darker the plastic is like that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.020
 slightly pearly what helps 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:02:02.410
 give a slightly more metallic effect is 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:03.880
 a nice figure and here we have the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.070
 Main toy of the box 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.380
 the interceptor ship headache had already 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.930
 come out an almost equal version or 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.910
 very similar came out a green ship with 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.470
 gray in a bigger set with more 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.540
 good toys with more mini figures with 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.620
 more accessories and obviously with a cost 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.050
 highest 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.610
 this 2014 version in yellow if 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.250
 it only brings two thousand figures which 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.440
 makes it a more accessible set for the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.420
 pocket of dads in matters of 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.970
 design the ship has these ailerons 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.190
 deployable that if we realize 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.260
 it looks a lot like the design of the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.570
 ships that we see in episode 4 about 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.550
 everything from the side of the empire were 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.660
 specifically designed so that 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.510
 let's realize how it evolved 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.100
 the then good technology 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.490
 the wings have two positions 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.170
 horizontal and asia 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.030
 there is a third position up 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.740
 here we are going to see it but that position of 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.080
 these wings can only be done 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.940
 with the cabin open which is 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.560
 impractical therefore we say that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.730
 they only have two positions 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.730
 horizontal and down 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.269
 the cabin because naturally you can 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.610
 open up we already see anakin in and here 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.829
 we are seeing the board the board is not 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.640
 is printed is a sticker if we put it 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.680
 carefully, it will look nice 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.800
 has this space to put the star 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.300
 droid in this case the Swiss 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.300
 although it is seen in the legs below 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.320
 in the cockpit because it has the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.360
 possibility in these clips to save 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.490
 the laser sword but we can not 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.680
 save complete because it is not possible 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.440
 close the cavity we have to separate it 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.300
 the handle and the ac and store it from this 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.010
 way so we can close the cabin 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.680
 on the bottom side we can see the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.270
 new missile launchers 2014 are these 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.340
 dark gray and gray boxes 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.310
 clear where we put the missiles in this 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.870
 green color case was in back of both 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.760
 sides 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.310
 and well now they are visible as they have 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.930
 the novelty that come out very hard inside 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.530
 these little boxes of colors as there is a 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.650
 spring 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.150
 that gives impetus to these missiles and 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.750
 it is no longer necessary to push them 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.209
 you just have to raise the missile 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.769
 well remember that the ship is 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.989
 head 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.259
 here we see the support points of the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.259
 ship 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.539
 and well, it's generally a ship 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:35.310
 nice and nice the truth that yes I 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:37.169
 liked it well this was all I hope 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.509
 that you liked the toy too 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.370
 the video I hope they subscribe to 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.680
 receive notifications of when there 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.819
 videos and well, take care of us a lot 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.819
 we see the next chao
