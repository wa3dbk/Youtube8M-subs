00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
system the motor and controls so we have

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.970 
system the motor and controls so we have

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
drive for a locomotive or example so we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
drive for a locomotive or example so we
do<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> work<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
do all that work right here in this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
do all that work right here in this
laboratory<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.360> guess<00:01:13.049> I'd

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
laboratory and right now I guess I'd

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.300 
laboratory and right now I guess I'd
like<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> turn<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.100> over<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> Herman<00:01:15.060> Wigman

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
like to turn it over to Herman Wigman

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.039 
like to turn it over to Herman Wigman
it's<00:01:17.310> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> exciting<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> fun<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> work<00:01:18.840> on

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
it's kind of exciting and fun to work on

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
it's kind of exciting and fun to work on
things<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.770> drive<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
things that you can actually drive and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
things that you can actually drive and
so<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.299> has<00:01:21.420> been<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> great<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.080> car<00:01:22.380> it's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
so this has been a great little car it's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.520 
so this has been a great little car it's
a<00:01:22.920> two-seater<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.820> vehicle<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.270> being

different<00:02:07.469> batteries<00:02:07.860> from<00:02:08.009> freedom

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
different batteries from freedom

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
different batteries from freedom
to<00:02:09.299> meet<00:02:09.479> its<00:02:09.629> production<00:02:10.110> goals<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.560> needs

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to meet its production goals and needs

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.740 
to meet its production goals and needs
and<00:02:11.370> we're<00:02:11.549> one<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.849> those<00:02:12.000> were<00:02:12.239> proud<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and we're one of those were proud to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.899 
and we're one of those were proud to
provide<00:02:13.019> this<00:02:13.560> battery<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.220> engineering<00:02:14.700> for

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
provide this battery and engineering for

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.030 
provide this battery and engineering for
a<00:02:14.939> one<00:02:15.150> two<00:02:15.269> three<00:02:15.569> now<00:02:15.930> also<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.620> able<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
a one two three now also is able to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.860 
a one two three now also is able to
charge<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> run<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.970> dynamometer<00:02:18.390> we're

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
charge and run the dynamometer we're

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
charge and run the dynamometer we're
going<00:02:19.140> through<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.379> design<00:02:19.920> validation<00:02:20.189> stage

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
going through a design validation stage

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.490 
going through a design validation stage
where<00:02:21.120> we're<00:02:21.299> verifying<00:02:21.480> all<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> functions

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
where we're verifying all the functions

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.899 
where we're verifying all the functions
of<00:02:22.620> our<00:02:22.739> battery<00:02:23.069> pack<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.549> vehicle

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
of our battery pack with the vehicle

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.399 
of our battery pack with the vehicle
that's<00:02:24.060> why<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:24.390> outside<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.989> car<00:02:25.200> right

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
that's why it's outside the car right

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's why it's outside the car right
now<00:02:25.440> I'll<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.400> jump<00:02:26.549> in<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.909> give<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> little

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
now I'll just jump in and give a little

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.940 
now I'll just jump in and give a little
spin<00:02:27.450> okay

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.420 

okay<00:02:32.640> we're<00:02:32.849> ready<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.120> drive
