 cosmetic products because i 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.740
 I want to remove them from the shelf so that I can 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.960

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.000
 try this scrub he did not help 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 The next remedy is the lab dyad 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.649

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 Well, I buy a cleaning spray from this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.809

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.860

 about the spring somehow strange but still 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.409
 I want to feel the spring and I think that these 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.930

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.370
 it was normally warm and now I kind of 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.630
 I didn't get dressed because it's minus 8 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.180
 the following things that I tell you now 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.729
 show site asos.com 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.000

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.949
 my mom orders her like a scalar 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.199
 The entire this has all these prices and so 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.780
 further but same feet 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.150
 I ordered the first time I decided to order myself 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.270
 Well, our mother asked me to help 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.400
 but the bottom line is that there were discounts then 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.000
 eat and order things that are not more expensive 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.280
 1000 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.139
 Now she will even tell you with scenes. 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.970
 nose about snapper because i 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.860
 I ordered from a month ago and just now I 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.130
 decided to shoot all the same video go 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.840
 First I ordered this skirt 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.560
 plain blue skirt as it now 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.560
 asks so 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.950
 this skirt was breasted about 300 rubles and 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:13.830
 I ordered it full brief there 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.750
 a little embarrassed okay norman i'm not so 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.460
 and I order a lot of knockings on the first 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.220
 just try what you do not give 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:25.410
 the next thing will do the next thing 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.180
 This is the basis of such a shirt like this 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.370
 big cut on the back 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.680
 wanting a little sleeves like a boy 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.550
 goes and let's shortstop parents on 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.680
 skirt would be very nice she was worth 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.620
 somewhere 500 rubles that is with all 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.270
 Good and the last thing that now 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.820
 will show this thing which 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.950
 I wanted for a long time I looked at all sorts 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.530
 there are english english-speaking bloggers 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.280
 just dreamed of some thing and this 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.830
 overalls 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.140
 from fuchsia it's a fuchsia 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.030
 bright pink saturated color 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.220
 here it is too bright and so 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.230
 a bit muffled in general the point is 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.080
 that he is not looking for an unspoken one for me 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:07.790
 lay all the complicated ordinary jumpsuit he 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.590
 straight length almost to heels but I would 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.410
 I turn everything around smartly when I think 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.910
 it will be warm I'll just share the shirt 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:19.020
