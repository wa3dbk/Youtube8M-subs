in different ways so there's this more
serious<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.289> prediction<00:00:59.039> models<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.730> we've

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
serious like prediction models so we've

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
serious like prediction models so we've
done<00:01:00.059> prediction<00:01:00.660> models<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.680> fo<00:01:02.070> one

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
done prediction models like this fo one

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
done prediction models like this fo one
we've<00:01:02.460> also<00:01:02.609> done<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> prediction<00:01:03.300> model<00:01:03.660> on

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
we've also done a prediction model on

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
we've also done a prediction model on
whether<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.019> plug<00:01:04.650> coach<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.979> fight<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.400> and

the formula for the NFL what did you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.039 
the formula for the NFL what did you
factor<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.400> how<00:01:36.119> did<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> bring<00:01:36.869> about

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
factor in and how did that bring about

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.499 
factor in and how did that bring about
the<00:01:37.350> Dolphins<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> Super<00:01:38.460> Bowl<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

the Dolphins going to the Super Bowl so
I<00:01:39.900> there's<00:01:40.770> no<00:01:40.860> easy<00:01:41.070> way<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> go<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:41.579> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
I there's no easy way to go about this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.609 
I there's no easy way to go about this
if<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.360> were<00:01:42.540> people<00:01:43.020> will<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.229> making<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
if there were people will be making a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.210 
if there were people will be making a
lot<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.770> money<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.840> looked<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.380> just

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
lot of money on it so I looked at just

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.710 
lot of money on it so I looked at just
the<00:01:47.369> core<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.850> team<00:01:48.030> why<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> finest<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the core of a team why the finest the

low-ranking<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:30.090> Miami<00:02:31.090> both<00:02:31.390> how<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.630> create

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
low-ranking so Miami both how to create

core<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.940> had<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.239> pretty<00:02:34.480> easy<00:02:34.660> schedule<00:02:35.020> if

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
core and had a pretty easy schedule if

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.360 
core and had a pretty easy schedule if
you<00:02:35.380> look<00:02:35.500> at<00:02:35.590> their<00:02:35.709> schedule<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:36.100> think<00:02:36.280> they

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
you look at their schedule I think they

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.370 
you look at their schedule I think they
have<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.700> Jaguars<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.569> Redskins<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.080> open<00:02:38.290> up

McCoy<00:02:58.390> say<00:02:58.630> under<00:02:58.870> solution<00:02:59.319> doesn't<00:02:59.500> mean

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
McCoy say under solution doesn't mean

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.890

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
looking at it this is what I didn't

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.670 
looking at it this is what I didn't
understand<00:03:04.000> Kurt<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.750> didn't<00:03:05.080> factor<00:03:05.500> in

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
understand Kurt you didn't factor in

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.670 
understand Kurt you didn't factor in
coaching<00:03:06.280> why<00:03:06.959> that's<00:03:07.959> true<00:03:08.260> i<00:03:08.290> mean<00:03:08.410> it's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
coaching why that's true i mean it's

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.050 
coaching why that's true i mean it's
very<00:03:08.860> tough<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.190> quantify<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.640> there's<00:03:09.910> no

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
very tough to quantify and there's no

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.670 
very tough to quantify and there's no

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
way to really quantify and i was looking

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.229 
way to really quantify and i was looking
up<00:03:11.769> from<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.069> quantitative<00:03:12.700> basis<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.120> do

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
up from a quantitative basis so you do

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.560 
up from a quantitative basis so you do
have<00:03:13.390> like<00:03:13.540> Joe<00:03:13.750> Philbin<00:03:14.200> who<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.970> know<00:03:16.090> you

have like Joe Philbin who you know you

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.789 
have like Joe Philbin who you know you
look<00:03:16.690> at<00:03:16.810> balichek<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.470> look<00:03:17.560> at<00:03:17.680> Joe

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
look at balichek and you look at Joe

one coach over the other I won't say

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.490 
one coach over the other I won't say
which<00:03:23.590> but<00:03:24.540> that's<00:03:25.540> one<00:03:25.720> flaw<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.140> systems

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
which but that's one flaw of the systems

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.020 
which but that's one flaw of the systems
that<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.950> know<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.130> can't<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.579> factor<00:03:27.910> in

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
that you know you can't really factor in

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.300 
that you know you can't really factor in
coaching<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:28.829> obviously<00:03:29.829> these

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
coaching and so obviously these

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.539 
coaching and so obviously these
probabilities<00:03:30.790> are<00:03:31.890> probably<00:03:32.890> not<00:03:33.070> entirely

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
probabilities are probably not entirely

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.670 
probabilities are probably not entirely
accurate<00:03:33.880> based<00:03:34.299> on<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.570> fact<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.320> just

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
accurate based on that fact but it just

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.020 
accurate based on that fact but it just
gives<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:35.980> ballpark<00:03:36.220> estimate<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.880> where

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
gives you a ballpark estimate of where

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.550 
gives you a ballpark estimate of where
these<00:03:37.180> teams<00:03:37.480> are<00:03:37.630> at<00:03:37.780> going<00:03:38.140> into<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.410> season

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
these teams are at going into the season

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.699 
these teams are at going into the season
mclovin<00:03:39.430> would<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:39.670> like<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.940> respond<00:03:40.680> well<00:03:41.680> I

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
mclovin would you like to respond well I

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.840 
mclovin would you like to respond well I
mean<00:03:42.269> Kurt<00:03:43.269> if<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.780> may<00:03:44.019> hurt<00:03:44.769> well<00:03:45.700> obviously

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
mean Kurt if I may hurt well obviously

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.900 
mean Kurt if I may hurt well obviously
like<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:47.230> approximate<00:03:48.160> value<00:03:48.190> doesn't<00:03:48.640> look

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
like the approximate value doesn't look

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.849 
like the approximate value doesn't look
at<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> fact<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.780> have<00:03:50.170> Jordy<00:03:50.470> Nelson's

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
at the fact that you have Jordy Nelson's

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.160 
at the fact that you have Jordy Nelson's
in<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.040> top<00:03:51.250> five<00:03:51.519> he's<00:03:52.450> there<00:03:52.720> because<00:03:52.900> Aaron

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
in the top five he's there because Aaron

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.660 
in the top five he's there because Aaron
Rodgers<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.739> throwing<00:03:54.100> him<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.250> ball<00:03:54.340> you're

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
Rodgers is throwing him the ball you're

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.250 
Rodgers is throwing him the ball you're
not<00:03:54.820> accounting<00:03:55.299> teamwork<00:03:55.780> which<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.109> why

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
not accounting teamwork which is why

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.800 
not accounting teamwork which is why
football<00:03:56.620> can't<00:03:57.579> be<00:03:57.730> measured<00:03:57.940> by<00:03:58.120> like

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
football can't be measured by like

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.810 
football can't be measured by like
baseball<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.410> basketball<00:03:59.530> it's<00:04:00.280> all<00:04:00.549> about

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
baseball and basketball it's all about

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.479 
baseball and basketball it's all about
the<00:04:00.970> team<00:04:01.000> everything<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:01.959> do<00:04:02.200> is<00:04:02.500> impacted

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
the team everything you do is impacted

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.800 
the team everything you do is impacted
by<00:04:03.579> everything<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.060> happens<00:04:04.420> next<00:04:04.570> we<00:04:04.690> like

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
by everything that happens next we like

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.229 
by everything that happens next we like
Mario<00:04:05.109> Williams<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.760> Marcell<00:04:06.760> Dareus<00:04:06.790> are

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus are

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.210 
Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus are
both<00:04:07.359> in<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.570> top<00:04:07.750> ten<00:04:08.049> but<00:04:08.620> obviously<00:04:08.829> they

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
both in the top ten but obviously they

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.130 
both in the top ten but obviously they
both<00:04:09.459> make<00:04:09.700> each<00:04:09.730> other's<00:04:10.090> job<00:04:10.329> easier<00:04:10.810> so

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
both make each other's job easier so

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.500 
both make each other's job easier so
it's<00:04:11.680> not<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:11.920> real<00:04:12.280> approximate<00:04:13.209> value<00:04:13.420> is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
it's not a real approximate value is

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.750 
it's not a real approximate value is
really<00:04:14.019> inaccurate<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.190> think<00:04:15.400> for<00:04:15.519> players

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
really inaccurate I think for players

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.090 
really inaccurate I think for players
it's<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.239> very<00:04:16.810> rough<00:04:17.140> measurement<00:04:17.769> oh<00:04:17.859> no

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
it's just a very rough measurement oh no

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
it's just a very rough measurement oh no
it<00:04:18.250> absolutely<00:04:18.609> is<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.760> very<00:04:18.970> rough

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
it absolutely is a very rough

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.490 
it absolutely is a very rough
measurement<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:19.750> it's<00:04:19.900> probably<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.470> best

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
measurement but it's probably the best

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.960 
measurement but it's probably the best
one<00:04:20.830> out<00:04:20.890> there<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.220> that's<00:04:21.430> why<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.609> used<00:04:21.820> it

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
one out there and that's why I used it

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.250 
one out there and that's why I used it
like<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.210> said<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.659> know<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.840> have<00:04:22.990> Jordy

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
like you said you know you have Jordy

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.700 
like you said you know you have Jordy
Nelson<00:04:23.380> what<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.710> think<00:04:23.950> is<00:04:24.070> probably

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
Nelson what I think is probably

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.680 
Nelson what I think is probably
10<00:04:24.860> waters<00:04:25.190> he<00:04:25.310> runs<00:04:25.550> own<00:04:25.759> honestly<00:04:26.180> based<00:04:26.479> on

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
10 waters he runs own honestly based on

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.590 
10 waters he runs own honestly based on
you<00:04:27.319> look<00:04:27.470> at<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.770> NFL<00:04:28.039> top<00:04:28.340> 100<00:04:28.789> that<00:04:29.449> came

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
you look at the NFL top 100 that came

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.879 
you look at the NFL top 100 that came
out<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:29.930> obviously<00:04:30.259> that's<00:04:30.410> not<00:04:30.470> entirely

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
out and obviously that's not entirely

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.860 
out and obviously that's not entirely
accurate<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.610> have<00:04:31.699> some<00:04:31.910> yep<00:04:32.240> admin<00:04:32.630> Terry

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
accurate you have some yep admin Terry

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.180 
accurate you have some yep admin Terry
is<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.050> top<00:04:33.199> hundred<00:04:33.380> player<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.770> list<00:04:33.860> but

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
is a top hundred player on that list but

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.710 
is a top hundred player on that list but
if<00:04:34.639> you<00:04:34.759> look<00:04:34.849> at<00:04:35.000> players<00:04:35.150> across<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.630> league

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
if you look at players across the league

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.210 
if you look at players across the league
given<00:04:36.020> cornerbacks<00:04:36.560> are<00:04:36.710> saying<00:04:36.889> that<00:04:37.009> Jordy

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
given cornerbacks are saying that Jordy

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.770 
given cornerbacks are saying that Jordy
Nelson<00:04:37.340> on<00:04:37.669> his<00:04:37.789> own<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.150> very<00:04:38.330> good<00:04:38.389> quarter

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
Nelson on his own is a very good quarter

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.839 
Nelson on his own is a very good quarter
wide<00:04:39.349> receiver<00:04:39.740> obviously<00:04:40.280> helps<00:04:40.520> have<00:04:40.639> Aaron

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
wide receiver obviously helps have Aaron

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.760 
wide receiver obviously helps have Aaron
Rodgers<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:41.389> on<00:04:41.870> zoning<00:04:42.169> is<00:04:42.229> pretty<00:04:42.410> good<00:04:42.530> and

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
Rodgers but on zoning is pretty good and

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.170 
Rodgers but on zoning is pretty good and
like<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.039> said<00:04:43.220> there<00:04:43.430> are<00:04:43.580> interaction

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
like you said there are interaction

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.999 
like you said there are interaction
terms<00:04:44.419> it's<00:04:44.599> not<00:04:44.720> baseball<00:04:44.930> where<00:04:45.349> you<00:04:45.889> know

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
terms it's not baseball where you know

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.230 
terms it's not baseball where you know
you're<00:04:46.160> hitting<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.639> no<00:04:46.729> one<00:04:46.849> else<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.060> really

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
you're hitting and no one else is really

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240 
you're hitting and no one else is really
affecting<00:04:47.630> how<00:04:47.720> you're<00:04:47.870> hitting<00:04:48.139> is<00:04:48.440> like<00:04:49.160> if

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
affecting how you're hitting is like if

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.320 
affecting how you're hitting is like if

that obviously Geno Smith not the

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.439 
that obviously Geno Smith not the
greatest<00:05:43.370> quarterback<00:05:43.849> in<00:05:43.969> the<00:05:44.030> league<00:05:44.090> and

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
same thing with the bills their

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.469 
same thing with the bills their
quarterback<00:05:46.219> situation<00:05:46.520> is<00:05:46.849> a<00:05:46.940> mess<00:05:47.000> Tyrod

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
quarterback situation is a mess Tyrod

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.390 
quarterback situation is a mess Tyrod
Taylor<00:05:47.780> even<00:05:48.050> might<00:05:48.169> come<00:05:48.349> out<00:05:48.469> and<00:05:48.680> start<00:05:49.250> for

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
Taylor even might come out and start for

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.490 
Taylor even might come out and start for
that<00:05:49.550> team<00:05:49.729> so<00:05:50.539> obviously<00:05:51.199> they're<00:05:51.349> a<00:05:51.380> little

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
that team so obviously they're a little

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.050 
that team so obviously they're a little
high<00:05:51.680> but<00:05:51.860> their<00:05:52.009> defenses<00:05:52.520> are<00:05:52.669> just<00:05:52.849> very

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
high but their defenses are just very

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.240 
high but their defenses are just very
strong<00:05:53.479> some<00:05:54.440> of<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.560> best<00:05:54.710> in<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.860> league<00:05:54.979> so

strong some of the best in the league so

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.600 
strong some of the best in the league so
they<00:05:55.430> could<00:05:56.409> make<00:05:57.409> that<00:05:57.560> a<00:05:57.620> fight<00:05:57.919> in<00:05:58.099> the<00:05:58.190> SES
