00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello to all stars and today I love you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.030
 teach what I bought at the toy store 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.650
 from USA called painting I went to two 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.380
 different 3rd 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.030
 in the first, this is what I buy and in 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.710
 the second against this 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.970
 now you have to see it because I already 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.760
 I want from among what I want from what the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.240
 first thing you buy 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.110
 it was jim but y is the second version 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.020
 I have the first edition that came out of 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.710
 james bulger or is the doctor's daughter 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.700
 violated which they can talk to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:47.510
 the little animals and this is what is the 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.640
 version of this example pen 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.219
 I imagine that it has to do something with 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.199
 plants because that's how you see the box is 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.930
 I like it much more because the 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.390
 hair instead of having it no more in a 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.659
 horse tail has it loose and I think 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.200
 who has it a little bit a little long 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:09.549
 I think it reaches up to his waist and I 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.549
 she really likes her clothes 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.870
 she is very well dressed that I just read 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.650
 behind the box which explains to you 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.990
 what is this edition of this doll and 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 says they are celebrating the girls of 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.900
 monserrat and that they are hardly 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:33.530
 how is it said how stella grew again 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.290
 a certain flower which there comes that is 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.600
 the little flower here 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.760
 and that's why they're celebrating the girls of 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.760
 master jai they are putting on their clothes and 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.360
 are having a party and that's why 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:52.910
 called this series climent bloom ok and the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:57.800
 second doll that I bought was lorena 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:01.340
 meknassi daughter of the monster masons 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.180
 back themselves and this is the monster series 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.100
 exchange 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.200
 I imagine they are students who 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.110
 they come from other countries and come to the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.350
 monster high school and also travel 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.360
 that she was now dressed in a kimono 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.959
 I did not buy it because I feel that I already have 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.030
 other word and that's why I do not buy it but to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.670
 the best later if I buy it because I 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.990
 I really like your last one that had this 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.100
 put good this one I think I think 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:39.990
 he has not opened it yet but 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.690
 I think that riding this doll is more 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.610
 small that the others are just like 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.030
 twilight godmother little sister of 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.030
 clarion 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.890
 here it is has red hair 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.470
 little chinito 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.470
 is the one on the back of the box 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:08.180
 I bought katrin from new I love this 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.670
 doll this 30000 is one of my 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.180
 favorite monster high dolls and 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.659
 she is also from the series commented 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.510
 and there you have your plant if you can see it 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.519
 there is the little plant 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.700
 It has a half area with some 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.930
 little flowers and his clothes I liked a lot 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.840
 a lot this series very nice the last 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.120
 doll that I bought in the first store 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.269
 I went was is marisol kocsis 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.950
 I think you 're from Peru because it 's from 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.890
 South America and more apart and he says 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.610
 monsters picchu which is machu picchu 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:58.700
 so I think it's the daughter of a 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:02.100
 Monster of Machu Picchu according to what it is 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.180
 monster with a very big foot 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.200
 and I think those feet are big 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.770
 here it looks better I think this doll 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.690
 they made him with bigger feet 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.980
 and what really caught my attention 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:24.230
 is your clothes the sweater if you see if you see 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:27.050
 Peruvian and also has a little hat 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.970
 and her face is very beautiful this doll 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.220
 really liked it 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.360
 I want to go to the camera so that 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.590
 see a little better in the light 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.590
