going to push that across the eye and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.520 
going to push that across the eye and
I'm<00:02:43.250> creating<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.849> slightly<00:02:44.150> winged<00:02:45.019> out<00:02:45.200> cat

I'm creating a slightly winged out cat
eye<00:02:45.560> obviously<00:02:46.370> being<00:02:46.640> as<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:46.940> leopard<00:02:47.360> and

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
eye obviously being as it's leopard and

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.000 
eye obviously being as it's leopard and
the<00:02:47.630> leopard<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.049> cat<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
the leopard is a cat and that is the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.440 
the leopard is a cat and that is the
shape<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.340> their<00:02:49.549> eyes<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:49.970> I'm<00:02:50.120> trying<00:02:50.420> to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
shape of their eyes so I'm trying to

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.780 
shape of their eyes so I'm trying to
recreate<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:50.989> using<00:02:51.410> eye<00:02:51.500> shadow<00:02:51.530> then<00:02:52.519> just

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
recreate that using eye shadow then just

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.220 
recreate that using eye shadow then just
using<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.090> blending<00:02:53.480> brush<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.840> want

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
using the blending brush you just want

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.170 
using the blending brush you just want
to<00:02:54.349> create<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.830> gradient<00:02:55.130> up<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.760> brow<00:02:55.910> bone

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
to create a gradient up to the brow bone

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.720 
to create a gradient up to the brow bone
so<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.540> blends<00:02:56.750> out<00:02:56.959> really<00:02:57.019> softly<00:02:57.709> I'm<00:02:58.519> now

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
so it blends out really softly I'm now

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.270 
so it blends out really softly I'm now

if we was to use liquid liner it would

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.170 
if we was to use liquid liner it would
be<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.140> process<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.340> we're<00:03:16.489> using<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.970> cold

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
be to process so we're using a cold

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.030 
be to process so we're using a cold
pencil<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.750> very<00:03:17.930> reason<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.530> then

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
pencil for that very reason and then

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.120 
pencil for that very reason and then
we're<00:03:19.220> going<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.610> use<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.890> black<00:03:21.890> eye<00:03:22.099> shadow

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
we're going to use a black eye shadow

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.729 
we're going to use a black eye shadow
just<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.700> set<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.450> given<00:03:24.079> more<00:03:24.230> smudged

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
just to set that and given more smudged

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.490 
just to set that and given more smudged
smokey<00:03:25.489> appearance<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.450> lash<00:03:26.630> line<00:03:26.870> then

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
smokey appearance to the lash line then

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.349 
smokey appearance to the lash line then
using<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:27.950> same<00:03:28.130> Brown<00:03:28.370> from<00:03:28.519> earlier<00:03:28.850> we're

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
using the same Brown from earlier we're

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.090 
using the same Brown from earlier we're
going<00:03:29.389> to<00:03:29.569> pull<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> black<00:03:30.079> up<00:03:30.260> into<00:03:30.980> the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
going to pull the black up into the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000 
going to pull the black up into the
brown<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.670> create<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.269> gradient<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.920> then

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
brown and create a gradient and then

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.229 
brown and create a gradient and then
we're<00:03:34.100> just<00:03:34.130> going<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.370> soften<00:03:34.609> all<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.060> with

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
we're just going to soften all that with
