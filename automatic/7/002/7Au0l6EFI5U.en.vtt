00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello after a long time I bring you a video on the claw I hope that you 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.519
 liked it because a long time without uploading anything and I wanted to start getting started for the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.449
 lost time we started 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.289
 origin the origins and evolution of the guitar are not too clear since 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.970
 numerous similar instruments will be used in antiquity 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.169
 so it is usual to follow the trajectory of this instrument to 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.990
 through the pictorial and sculptural representations found 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.429
 throughout history 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.739
 there is archaeological evidence in bas-reliefs found on wings of a 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.050
 northern club of the current turkey that around the year 1000 BC the Hittites and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 Assyrians created string instruments similar to life the instrument of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.280
 several strings more simple and ancient the world but with the addition of a 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.020
 sounding board 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.780
 a Moorish guitar or pandora point in the 11th centuries and yes you can distinguish 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.050
 two types of guitars today you have 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.990
 On the one hand the Moorish oomand hour with an oval shape, but here we have 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.630
 resembles the Arabic lute and the mandolin 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.480
 on the other hand the Latin guitar an evolution of the ancient cÃ©dras or 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.900
 flat-bottomed unit zithers for rice with long handle and whose pegbox was 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.420
 similar to the violin 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.320
 The first one agrees with the hypothesis of the eastern origin of the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.710
 guitar a kind of syrian uda that would have spread by persia and arabia 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.290
 until arriving to Spain during the Arab stay in the peninsula 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.570
 Iberian 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.050
 now we will go with the types of guitars see it this part you will like more good 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.920
 it depends on the character just axes 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.130
 the acoustic guitar is a type of guitar with metal strings whose 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.860
 sound is generated by the vibration of the strings that are amplified in a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.270
 wooden acoustic box or some acrylic 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.540
 the adjective acoustic is taken directly from the English acoustic remove 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 by the use of the said adjective that Anglophones do to differentiate 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.590
 the box guitar with respect to the electric guitar 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.560
 is clearly redundant because the guitar by definition is a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.150
 acoustic instrument 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.500
 the acoustic guitar derives from the designs of cf martin and orville gibson 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.110
 mainly American luthiers that developed south 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.750
 an electric guitar is a guitar with one more transgressors 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.930
 electromagnetic devices called pellets that convert the vibrations of 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.269
 strings on electrical signals capable of being amplified and processed 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.309
 there are three fundamental types of electric guitars the body ones 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.619
 solid those of semi-solid body and those of whole body 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.629
 Historically, the first ones to be invented were those with a hollow body 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.679
 derived from box guitars to which a microphone was incorporated to be able to 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.530
 the bands of them will be heard 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.709
 solid-body guitars lack resonance box so that the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.039
 body is a piece of 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:47.189
 the flamenco guitar has less loudness and offers less volume than a 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.489
 Spanish concert guitar but its sound is brighter and its execution 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.329
 It is easier and faster due to the lower height of the ropes 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.609
 which allows less pressure to be made with the fingers of the hand 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.719
 left on the fingerboard 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.989
 traditionally the tuning pegs were completely from palop and 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.749
 they were embedded in the guitar's blade perpendicular to it 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.699
 It usually carries underneath the rosette or hole a guard bucket rapper or 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.959
 protector sometimes also a superior one to prevent strumming and bumping 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.289
 what will they be 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.999
 an electroacoustic guitar is a classical guitar that has been 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:26.749
 added pads microphones or transducers to amplify their sound 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.519
 they are also called electrified guitars 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.309
 ended that we have to be anonymous and that highlights the fact that the system 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.780
 of previous may have been installed at source or by the user 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.510
 the electrification of a box guitar is the use of the microphone as it is 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.199
 connects an external amplifier like an electric guitar 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.029
 this largely avoids stockpiling and facilitates the work of the engineer 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.619
 sound in the recordings 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.619
 however the sound is not exactly 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.519
 the Renaissance and Baroque guitars are ancestors of classical guitars 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.509
 They are more delicate and produce a weaker sound 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.609
 They are easier to distinguish from other guitars since their body is more 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.629
 thin and flat 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.750
 niklison guitars special guitars joa bats for guitars 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.970
 that allow control of a synthesizer via midi protocol 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.980
 data transmission that allows you to send musical information between different 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.800
 devices connected by means of cables 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.360
 in this way a guitarist who has no ability to play a keyboard 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.020
 an electronic organ can shoot those from a midi guitar 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.099
 a basic technique is to use a monophonic frequency converter 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.630
 audio friend sent the audio signal of the guitar through his 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.850
 Carbon color microphone in the mouth of it or by means of its s 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.130
 Russian guitars contain seven strings instead of 6 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.290
 the tuning of this guitar is completely different from the Spanish 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.930
 since it's not just an acoustic guitar with a string added 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.099
 Traditionally an open tuning is used in G major 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.740
 there is also balalaika 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.080
 variations on the traditional guitar 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.910
 the first guitars had four strings as the instruments of which 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.460
 proceeded then a fifth was added and then a sixth the fat 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.410
 that ended up being the standard six-string model one of the variations 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.909
 more frequent is to increase the number of strings 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.810
 for example doubling your number from 6 to 12 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.140
 the usual six coupled individually to their respective octave 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.939
 except for the two sharpest ones that are duplicated in unison 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.370
 In addition to the 12-string guitar the guitar has a relative importance 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:39.369
 tenor of four used among others by the g 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.819
 I hope you liked the video player very soon
