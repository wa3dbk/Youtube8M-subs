00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
ones that matchbox used to sell if we

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.179 
ones that matchbox used to sell if we
turn<00:01:41.759> around<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.420> way<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.630> nose<00:01:46.189> underneath

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
turn around this way the nose underneath

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.359 
turn around this way the nose underneath
it<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.820> colored<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> front<00:01:51.210> wheel<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:52.369> yes

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it is colored and the front wheel is yes

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
it is colored and the front wheel is yes
in<00:01:53.610> fact<00:01:54.140> fake<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.470> does<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.670> move<00:01:57.049> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
in fact fake it does not really move the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.440 
in fact fake it does not really move the
back<00:01:58.320> wheels<00:01:58.710> however<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.729> real<00:02:00.149> which

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
back wheels however are real which

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.990 
back wheels however are real which
allowed<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.320> move<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.740> turn<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.520> any

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
allowed to move and turn in any

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160 
allowed to move and turn in any
direction<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.540> bonus<00:02:06.960> between<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
direction so that's a bonus between the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.510 
direction so that's a bonus between the
eze<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:09.130> old<00:02:09.399> matchbox<00:02:09.880> planes<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
eze and the old matchbox planes the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.780 
eze and the old matchbox planes the
matchbox<00:02:13.120> planes<00:02:13.620> don't<00:02:14.620> turn<00:02:15.250> easily

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
matchbox planes don't turn easily

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.820 
matchbox planes don't turn easily
because<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.450> front<00:02:16.750> wheel<00:02:17.459> really<00:02:18.459> rolls<00:02:19.830> now

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
because the front wheel really rolls now

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.740 
because the front wheel really rolls now
when<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.370> bring<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.819> closer<00:02:22.270> you're<00:02:22.599> going

well<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.709> don't<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.340> anything<00:03:03.670> on<00:03:04.090> this

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
well I don't think that anything on this

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.460 
well I don't think that anything on this
is<00:03:04.630> actually<00:03:06.810> not<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:08.140> sticker<00:03:10.260> except<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
is actually not a sticker except the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.349 
is actually not a sticker except the
things<00:03:11.860> on<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.430> little<00:03:12.880> sign<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.269> the

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
things on the little sign on the

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.090 
things on the little sign on the
winglets<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.930> believe<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.739> little<00:03:14.950> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
winglets I believe that that little a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.130 
winglets I believe that that little a
right<00:03:15.519> there<00:03:17.310> right<00:03:19.769> here<00:03:21.930> your<00:03:22.930> CVA<00:03:23.549> that<00:03:24.549> is

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
right there right here your CVA that is

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.479 
right there right here your CVA that is
actually<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.290> only<00:03:26.500> thing<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.190> plane

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
actually the only thing on the plane

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.400 
actually the only thing on the plane
that<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.880> real<00:03:28.799> except<00:03:29.799> for<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.790> blue

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.229 

underneath<00:03:35.410> there<00:03:35.709> all<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.340> anything

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
underneath there all the anything

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.289 
underneath there all the anything
painted<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:39.430> real<00:03:39.790> everything<00:03:40.780> else

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
painted that's real everything else

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.750 
painted that's real everything else
everything<00:03:43.299> else<00:03:43.480> when<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.810> say<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.760> not

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
everything else when I say that is not

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.539 
everything else when I say that is not
real<00:03:46.299> even<00:03:46.720> little<00:03:47.019> thing<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.549> like

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
real even little thing of it's like

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.819 
real even little thing of it's like
subliminal<00:03:49.180> messages<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.049> on<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.910> engine

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
subliminal messages and on the engine

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.289 
subliminal messages and on the engine
that<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:55.209> way<00:03:55.480> as<00:03:55.720> well<00:03:56.049> it's<00:03:57.299> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
that is that way as well it's the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.670 
that is that way as well it's the
engines<00:03:59.109> everything<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.829> actually<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:02.530> got

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
engines everything is actually it's got

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.000 
engines everything is actually it's got
some<00:04:02.920> good<00:04:03.730> detail<00:04:04.329> it's<00:04:04.600> got<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.049> flaps

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.580 

it's<00:04:08.700> got<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.270> flaps<00:04:09.599> back<00:04:09.870> here<00:04:10.230> as<00:04:10.349> well

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
it's got the flaps back here as well

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.199 
it's got the flaps back here as well
everything<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.620> really<00:04:13.860> looks<00:04:14.190> like<00:04:14.519> a

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
everything so it really looks like a

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.159 
everything so it really looks like a
real<00:04:15.690> plane<00:04:15.930> I'm<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:16.590> sure<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:18.359> exact<00:04:18.780> size

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
real plane I'm not sure the exact size

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.909 
real plane I'm not sure the exact size
of<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:20.070> plane<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:21.120> scale<00:04:21.480> it's<00:04:22.200> probably

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
of this plane on the scale it's probably

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:33.170 
of this plane on the scale it's probably
a<00:04:25.190> 1/2<00:04:26.270> like<00:04:27.350> 200<00:04:28.400> something<00:04:29.400> scale<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:32.580> think

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
a 1/2 like 200 something scale I think

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.080 
a 1/2 like 200 something scale I think
that<00:04:33.479> it's<00:04:33.600> about<00:04:33.750> six<00:04:34.590> inches<00:04:35.100> this<00:04:35.400> way<00:04:35.700> by

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
that it's about six inches this way by

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.000 
that it's about six inches this way by
five<00:04:37.050> inches<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.950> way<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.660> from<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.350> nose<00:04:40.620> to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
five inches that way so from the nose to

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.890 
five inches that way so from the nose to
tail<00:04:42.260> from<00:04:43.260> nose<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.070> tail<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.850> six<00:04:45.330> inches<00:04:45.479> and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
tail from nose to tail is six inches and

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.379 
tail from nose to tail is six inches and
from<00:04:46.260> what<00:04:46.500> wing<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.250> wing<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.990> is<00:04:50.389> five

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
from what wing to wing that is five

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.600 
from what wing to wing that is five
inches<00:04:53.419> so<00:04:54.419> they<00:04:55.020> sell<00:04:55.380> these<00:04:55.590> for<00:04:55.950> basically

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
inches so they sell these for basically

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.219 
inches so they sell these for basically
any<00:04:56.880> airline<00:04:57.270> as<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:59.370> see<00:04:59.550> I<00:04:59.580> have<00:04:59.900> three<00:05:00.900> here

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
well be can turn them into airports they

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.900 
well be can turn them into airports they
have<00:05:12.630> four<00:05:13.139> extreme<00:05:13.620> collectors<00:05:13.889> you<00:05:14.400> can<00:05:14.580> buy

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
have four extreme collectors you can buy

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.820 
have four extreme collectors you can buy
an<00:05:15.210> airport<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.289> go<00:05:16.470> with<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:18.800> of<00:05:19.800> course
