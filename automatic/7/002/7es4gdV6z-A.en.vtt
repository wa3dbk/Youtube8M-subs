00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
but unfortunately i have to send this

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.129 
but unfortunately i have to send this
out<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.459> the<00:00:52.579> customer<00:00:52.989> pretty<00:00:53.989> much

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
out to the customer pretty much

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:56.829 
out to the customer pretty much
immediately<00:00:54.999> otherwise<00:00:55.999> i<00:00:56.239> would<00:00:56.600> definitely

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
immediately otherwise i would definitely

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.840 
immediately otherwise i would definitely
be<00:00:56.989> getting<00:00:57.079> some<00:00:57.499> action<00:00:57.739> videos<00:00:58.249> of<00:00:58.549> this

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
be getting some action videos of this

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.079 
be getting some action videos of this
because<00:00:59.209> it<00:00:59.629> is<00:01:00.010> going<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.129> be<00:01:01.159> big<00:01:01.399> i<00:01:01.549> feel<00:01:01.789> i

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
because it is going to be big i feel i

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.569 
because it is going to be big i feel i
think<00:01:02.569> it<00:01:02.629> can<00:01:02.749> be<00:01:02.779> quite<00:01:03.170> popular<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:04.280> of

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
think it can be quite popular and of

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.380 
think it can be quite popular and of
course<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:04.939> can<00:01:05.059> be<00:01:05.119> done<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:07.390> numerous

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
course it can be done in numerous

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.480 
course it can be done in numerous
patterns<00:01:10.000> this<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.210> 54<00:01:11.659> led<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:13.100> channel

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
patterns this is the 54 led to channel

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.370 
patterns this is the 54 led to channel
it<00:01:13.700> can<00:01:13.909> be<00:01:14.000> done<00:01:14.149> with<00:01:14.479> 12<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.350> 12<00:01:15.500> 24<00:01:16.280> 24

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
it can be done with 12 and 12 24 24

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.200 
it can be done with 12 and 12 24 24
pretty<00:01:18.380> much<00:01:18.469> any<00:01:18.679> mix<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.399> can<00:01:19.549> think<00:01:19.759> of<00:01:20.000> i

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
pretty much any mix you can think of i

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.319 
pretty much any mix you can think of i
can<00:01:20.390> i<00:01:20.659> can<00:01:21.590> set<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.039> up<00:01:22.159> with<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.780> oscillation

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
can i can set it up with the oscillation

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.800 
can i can set it up with the oscillation
the<00:01:26.329> oscillation<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:27.020> also<00:01:28.299> variable<00:01:29.299> on<00:01:29.749> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the oscillation is also variable on the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.830 
the oscillation is also variable on the
build<00:01:30.380> side<00:01:30.820> you<00:01:31.820> have<00:01:31.939> two<00:01:32.240> speeds<00:01:32.570> basically

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
build side you have two speeds basically

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.859 
build side you have two speeds basically
on<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.469> hoop<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.039> user<00:01:34.450> for<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.539> hooper

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
on the hoop of the user for the hooper

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.399 
on the hoop of the user for the hooper
but<00:01:36.609> inside<00:01:37.609> i<00:01:37.640> can<00:01:38.090> i<00:01:38.329> can<00:01:38.780> basically<00:01:38.990> set<00:01:39.320> it

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
but inside i can i can basically set it

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.109 
but inside i can i can basically set it
up<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.710> do<00:01:40.060> super<00:01:41.060> slow<00:01:41.090> super<00:01:41.810> fast<00:01:42.880> any<00:01:43.880> two

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
up to do super slow super fast any two

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.660 
up to do super slow super fast any two
combinations<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:44.840> might<00:01:45.020> think<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:46.039> can

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
combinations you might think of I can

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.999 
combinations you might think of I can
also<00:01:46.789> do<00:01:46.999> an<00:01:47.090> adjustable<00:01:47.719> an<00:01:48.700> adjustable

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
also do an adjustable an adjustable

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.929 
also do an adjustable an adjustable
potentiometer<00:01:52.009> which<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:52.460> can<00:01:52.609> actually

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
potentiometer which you can actually

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.500 
potentiometer which you can actually
adjust<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.420> speed

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
adjust the speed

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.330 
adjust the speed
and<00:01:56.510> then<00:01:56.630> your<00:01:56.780> league<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:58.010> can<00:01:58.159> go

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
and then your league so it you can go

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.289 
and then your league so it you can go
analog<00:01:59.270> from<00:01:59.630> very<00:01:59.960> slow<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.229> very<00:02:00.560> fast<00:02:01.299> but

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
analog from very slow to very fast but

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.030 
analog from very slow to very fast but
yeah<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.600> can't<00:02:02.960> wait<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.110> see<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.470> one<00:02:03.650> out<00:02:03.830> in

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
yeah I can't wait to see this one out in

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.550 
yeah I can't wait to see this one out in
the<00:02:04.190> field<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:05.090> couple<00:02:05.960> fairs<00:02:06.380> festivals

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the field a couple fairs festivals

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.840 
the field a couple fairs festivals
certainly<00:02:09.560> looking<00:02:09.709> forward<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.459> I
