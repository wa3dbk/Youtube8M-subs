00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.040
 dear friends of slide mag.com Hello everyone 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 and welcome to this new one 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.900
 video for how to become a fudo cyclist 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.320
 special to him but the facility in this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.780
 dark 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.660
 I have to see how to make real e 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.630
 their montage pine forest favor 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 after photoshop getting ready to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 halloween you will see canine fields 10 kg 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.940
 end of April but let's start then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.090
 let's start from this image then for 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.920
 first we must do nothing but 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 let's say copy it in this case I put it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.020
 in a new project as a paste 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.600
 normal kobe with why then we will go 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.739
 to make the differences between the first and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.260
 after processing ok so first 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.180
 what do we rename ghosts? 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 account and let's say to change the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.680
 color of our subject then 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.600
 then the first thing I recommend 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.409
 going to do is taking this off 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.210
 effect but you have to try to give a 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.700
 color a little bit more serious from 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.070
 ricoh to our subject then 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.590
 I recommend going to the instrument 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.680
 normal brush paint brush da 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.159
 design select you want to 0 with a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 brush does not become emit 250 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.009
 see the size my method instead the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.280
 network on normal surely by default 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.130
 you will have to go to the color method as I have 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.219
 made me set an opacity of wounds 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.560
 200 to go to the color palette a 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.350
 choose with hearing complexion 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.819
 quite clear on dark brown like 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.789
 I our case 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:51.000
 we press ok and we go to color the 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.390
 our subject as you see we are 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 slowly going to take this off 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.759
 rosy complexion from a person we say alive 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.659
 we must try to give it a color 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.040
 little bit more from zombie ok you want enough 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.350
 a very point thing 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.300
 the door of this type here because how 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.910
 you will see it will surely be 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.110
 emphasized then at this point there 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.300
 we go though the bar of 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.670
 tools and select an instrument 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.020
 burn then we send in the hand and 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.810
 we select half-tones 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.070
 an exposure of 20 percent of a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.950
 medium-small brush such as a 130 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.270
 let's go to the completely logical area 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.690
 we are going to form real ones 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.270
 pestons of the time be away 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.450
 as i'm doing this you have to type 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.190
 more than once I did 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.849
 so we move away even a small one 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.000
 and ahmad highlight a little 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.599
 wrinkles and current tension paths 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.599
 Hospital 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.670
 in the open mouth we do not pass them 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.050
 at the other side, result events 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.840
 I recommend you look for how I am doing 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.260
 I now particularly stress the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.260
 cheekbones 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.030
 always to accentuate the 13 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.050
 at this point I advise you to go 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.690
 rudder of interval that there is in the mar 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.300
 Ligurian to go and rest in those 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:52.170
 points where we usually are 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.170
 more clotted blood 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.290
 ok 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.450
 let's go to the areas again 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.450
 which must be returned 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.349
 and at this point I would say that ours 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.729
 effect is complete at this point what 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.129
 let's go do let's see the 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.340
 distance in three minutes before 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:32.939
 mafia and after processing such as 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.740
 see there is a substantial difference 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:38.439
 as you can see it is not a bolvig ritual 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.250
 beauty indeed all the opposite if 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:44.860
 we want to say so they can show you 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.259
 that you can do even worse I don't have 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.169
 found the one you are seeing now 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.449
 which is a part of rice we go to 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.270
 paste in our project but let's go 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.219
 to the big yesterday to be placed big 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.439
 way at eye level of ours 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:04.349
 subject in this way here and there 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.699
 we immediately realize how it is 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.219
 inappropriate in this case the why 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.139
 because as you see the color of the 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:14.400
 skin is completely different from that 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.400
 of the crawled as we do let's go 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:22.199
 first of all in our settings 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.300
 we come scar and select a 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.300
 most fusion meter that could be 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.520
 at typical perfect dinner you see it yes 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.440
 more bride however attacks are always there 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.240
 we intrigued too dark 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.220
 compared to tapes and another in high 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.240
 so we do n't have to do what you take 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:43.410
 the instrument with a 300 one brush 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.960
 size we put 300 pixels and let's go 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:50.570
 to pass gently around the 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:54.840
 our scar in order to mix it 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:58.080
 tables of our frozen problem 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.169
 you see that the scar does not marry 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.419
 well with the skin that is close 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.520
 to the eye because it is too slow 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.389
 so we're going to select ours 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.389
 sound level 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:16.030
 they are found in the sorry titles but come on 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.090
 to see that on this area with you 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.340
 see there are no precise passages 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.410
 to perform because it depends anyway 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.530
 everything from the complexion of yours 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.570
 subject was born from the operations that 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.340
 you will go to perform on the image 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.160
 itself 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:38.470
 and here we have ours in front of us 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:41.590
 fantastic because i 'm looking forward to a 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:45.460
 compare with the original image not 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.970
 you see the difference is absolutely e 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.650
 the effect I would say is from shock 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.410
 so if you want to play tricks on yours 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.320
 friends if you need to 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.940
 make images to particular 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.710
 visual effect for halloween night 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.470
 for the carnival night 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.490
 in short, however, for any night you enjoy 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.580
 you need it 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.250
 you have seen that the method is enough 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.020
 if instead he just needs some 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.110
 of calm you can not afternoon 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.440
 having said that I will be the greeting canducci 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:24.039
 and I give you an appointment at the next video 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.039
 dangerous lie to me oh hello guys
