hey<00:00:11.639> what's<00:00:11.880> happening<00:00:12.179> guys<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.450> worth<00:00:12.599> knock

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
hey what's happening guys is worth knock

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.390 
hey what's happening guys is worth knock
while<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.230> get<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.860> today<00:00:14.190> we're

while for I get it in today we're
checking<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> new<00:00:15.179> xolo<00:00:15.599> q2000<00:00:16.560> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
checking out the new xolo q2000 and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.290 
checking out the new xolo q2000 and
we're<00:00:17.190> gonna<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.369> checking<00:00:17.520> our<00:00:17.730> benchmarks

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
we're gonna be checking our benchmarks

magnetic field sensor let's take a look
at<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> score<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.850> coordinate

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.020 

the<00:01:18.509> device<00:01:18.750> cause<00:01:19.020> 398<00:01:19.890> 8<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.280> quadrant<00:01:20.820> it

the device cause 398 8 or quadrant it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.929 
the device cause 398 8 or quadrant it
comes<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.630> number<00:01:21.890> three<00:01:22.890> under<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> HTC

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
comes in at number three under the HTC

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.230 
comes in at number three under the HTC
One<00:01:24.090> X<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.420> well<00:01:24.860> which<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.310> decent<00:01:26.820> score

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
One X as well which is a decent score

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.640 
One X as well which is a decent score
not<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> best<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.960> we've<00:01:28.110> seen<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
not the best that we've seen in this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.679 
not the best that we've seen in this
price<00:01:28.890> bracket<00:01:29.070> let's<00:01:29.640> move<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.909> over<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.390> Nina

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
price bracket let's move on over to Nina

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.080 
price bracket let's move on over to Nina
mark<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> we'll<00:01:32.040> take<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> look<00:01:32.549> at<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:32.850> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
mark and we'll take a look at how it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:47.800 
mark and we'll take a look at how it
performs<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.750> terms<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.110> traffic<00:01:34.290> FPS

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.289 

so<00:01:48.810> Nina<00:01:49.049> mark<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> device<00:01:49.590> course<00:01:49.890> 46.2<00:01:50.790> FPS

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so Nina mark the device course 46.2 FPS

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.149 
so Nina mark the device course 46.2 FPS
which<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.810> again<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.619> best<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
which is again not the best go that

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
which is again not the best go that
we've<00:01:53.280> seen<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.240> pretty<00:01:54.390> decent<00:01:54.600> for

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
we've seen but it's pretty decent for

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.670 
we've seen but it's pretty decent for
this<00:01:55.140> device<00:01:56.090> we<00:01:57.090> did<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.600> multi-touch<00:01:58.200> test<00:01:58.470> on

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
this device we did a multi-touch test on

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.210 
this device we did a multi-touch test on
the<00:01:58.770> device<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> all<00:01:59.759> we<00:02:00.000> could<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.840> for

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
the device and all we could get was for

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.529 
the device and all we could get was for
was<00:02:02.220> for<00:02:02.250> point<00:02:02.670> touching<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.149> even<00:02:03.360> five

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
was for point touching not even five

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.960 
was for point touching not even five
point<00:02:03.810> touch<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.399> even<00:02:05.399> four<00:02:05.580> point<00:02:05.789> touch

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
point touch and even four point touch

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.440 
point touch and even four point touch
was<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.299> perfect<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.080> was<00:02:07.170> slightly<00:02:07.619> jittery

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
was not perfect it was slightly jittery

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.729 
was not perfect it was slightly jittery
not<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> best<00:02:09.780> touch<00:02:09.959> experience<00:02:10.229> is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
not the best touch experience is

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530 
not the best touch experience is
expected<00:02:11.459> from<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.790> device<00:02:12.030> will<00:02:12.239> check<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
expected from this device will check it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.710 
expected from this device will check it
out<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.780> gaming<00:02:13.050> review<00:02:14.450> finally<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.569> ran

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
out in the gaming review finally we ran

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:39.220 
out in the gaming review finally we ran
and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.190
