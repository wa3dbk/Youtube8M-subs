your legs fell asleep if so it was all
in<00:00:26.189> your<00:00:26.220> nerves<00:00:28.369> see<00:00:29.369> when<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.939> sit

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
in your nerves see when you sit

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.600 
in your nerves see when you sit
especially<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.650> you're<00:00:31.769> sitting<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> hard

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
especially when you're sitting on a hard

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.049 
especially when you're sitting on a hard
surface<00:00:33.350> you're<00:00:34.350> applying<00:00:34.739> pressure<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.910> your

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
surface you're applying pressure to your

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.530 
surface you're applying pressure to your
legs<00:00:36.829> when<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.010> apply<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.579> pressure<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
legs when you apply that pressure you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
legs when you apply that pressure you
can<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:39.960> block<00:00:40.910> communication<00:00:41.910> between

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
can actually block communication between

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.950 
can actually block communication between
the<00:00:42.660> nerves<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.440> legs<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.520> brain

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
the nerves and your legs and your brain

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.020 
the nerves and your legs and your brain
that<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.710> nerves<00:00:47.070> can't<00:00:47.489> tell<00:00:47.760> your

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
that way your nerves can't tell your

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170 
that way your nerves can't tell your
brain<00:00:48.329> how<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.350> legs<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.860> feeling<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.520> your

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
brain how your legs are feeling and your

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
brain how your legs are feeling and your
brain<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:52.050> communicate<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.100> nerves

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
brain can communicate with your nerves

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.610 
brain can communicate with your nerves
to<00:00:53.850> tell<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.300> move<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.989> legs<00:00:57.260> what's<00:00:58.260> more

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to tell them move the legs what's more

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
to tell them move the legs what's more
you're<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.789> cutting<00:01:00.239> off

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you're not just cutting off

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
you're not just cutting off
communication<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.680> nerves

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
communication to your nerves

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
communication to your nerves
you're<00:01:02.640> also<00:01:03.000> cutting<00:01:03.449> off<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> circulation

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
you're also cutting off the circulation

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.850 
you're also cutting off the circulation
of<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.680> blood<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.939> legs<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:07.500> blood

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
of your blood in your legs to your blood

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
of your blood in your legs to your blood
delivers<00:01:08.520> vital<00:01:08.970> nutrients<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.780> nerves

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
delivers vital nutrients to your nerves

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.649 
delivers vital nutrients to your nerves
so<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.650> function<00:01:11.310> correctly<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.150> when

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so they function correctly and when

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.840 
so they function correctly and when
they're<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.110> giving<00:01:13.590> any<00:01:13.770> nutrients<00:01:14.430> because

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
they're not giving any nutrients because

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
they're not giving any nutrients because
the<00:01:15.060> blood<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.450> blocked<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:17.070> start

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the blood is blocked off they start

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.969 
the blood is blocked off they start
going<00:01:17.580> berserk<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.600> sum<00:01:21.900> total<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.710> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
going berserk the sum total of all this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.730 
going berserk the sum total of all this
is<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.840> there's<00:01:25.049> no<00:01:25.140> communication

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
is that because there's no communication

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.249 
is that because there's no communication
between<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.670> brain<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.270> nerves<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
between the brain and the nerves and the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.560 
between the brain and the nerves and the
nerves<00:01:28.530> aren't<00:01:28.829> getting<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> nutrients<00:01:29.820> they

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
nerves aren't getting the nutrients they

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.050 
nerves aren't getting the nutrients they
start<00:01:30.990> behaving<00:01:31.140> crazy<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
start behaving crazy and when you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.840 
start behaving crazy and when you
finally<00:01:33.390> stand<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.650> send<00:01:34.979> all<00:01:35.189> sorts<00:01:35.759> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
finally stand up they send all sorts of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.600 
finally stand up they send all sorts of
strange<00:01:36.210> signals<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.110> brain<00:01:37.610> which

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
strange signals to your brain which

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
strange signals to your brain which
accounts<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.150> pins<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> needles<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
accounts for pins and needles so the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.480 
accounts for pins and needles so the
next<00:01:44.250> time<00:01:44.549> your<00:01:45.090> legs<00:01:45.479> fall<00:01:45.840> asleep<00:01:46.259> and
