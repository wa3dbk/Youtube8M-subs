in<00:01:20.760> previous<00:01:21.210> titles<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:22.350> camera<00:01:22.770> showed

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
in previous titles the camera showed

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.030 
in previous titles the camera showed
only<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.940> side-scrolling<00:01:24.810> view<00:01:25.170> from<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.800> side

only a side-scrolling view from the side

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.030 
only a side-scrolling view from the side
but<00:01:26.910> this<00:01:27.150> time<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.990> tried<00:01:28.260> revolving<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
but this time we tried revolving the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.850 
but this time we tried revolving the
camera<00:01:29.400> around<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:30.600> off<00:01:30.870> to<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.140> back<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
camera around like off to the back and

camera around like off to the back and
to<00:01:32.400> all<00:01:32.550> sorts<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.000> different<00:01:33.060> angles<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:34.670> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to all sorts of different angles as a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
to all sorts of different angles as a
result<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:37.230> able<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.650> provide<00:01:37.890> not

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
result I think we're able to provide not

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.700 
result I think we're able to provide not
only<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.580> new<00:01:38.790> visual<00:01:39.240> experience<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.500> also

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
only a new visual experience but also

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.220 
only a new visual experience but also
gameplay<00:01:41.550> experiences<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.810> haven't<00:01:43.110> had

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
gameplay experiences you haven't had

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.250 
gameplay experiences you haven't had
before<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:48.510> increased<00:01:48.870> hardware

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
before the increased hardware

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.230 
before the increased hardware
performance<00:01:49.410> got<00:01:50.010> us<00:01:50.130> thinking<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.640> Donkey

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
performance got us thinking about Donkey

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.680 
performance got us thinking about Donkey
Kong's<00:01:51.480> fur<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.580> had<00:01:53.820> discussions

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
Kong's fur and so we had discussions

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.490 
Kong's fur and so we had discussions
with<00:01:54.990> retro<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.520> should<00:01:56.820> show<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.500> we

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
with retro on how we should show it we

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.850 
with retro on how we should show it we
decided<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.030> even<00:02:00.030> though<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.450> would<00:02:00.600> mean

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
decided that even though it would mean

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.010 
decided that even though it would mean
increased<00:02:01.860> development<00:02:02.280> costs<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.570> wanted<00:02:03.900> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
increased development costs we wanted to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.520 
increased development costs we wanted to
see<00:02:04.260> a<00:02:04.470> furry<00:02:04.979> donkey<00:02:05.490> kong<00:02:05.700> retro<00:02:06.470> spent<00:02:07.470> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
see a furry donkey kong retro spent a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.190 
see a furry donkey kong retro spent a
lot<00:02:07.830> of<00:02:08.040> time<00:02:08.429> experimenting<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.929> what

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
lot of time experimenting to see what

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.690 
lot of time experimenting to see what
would<00:02:10.530> work<00:02:10.740> best<00:02:15.920> I'm<00:02:16.920> sure<00:02:16.980> those<00:02:17.400> who<00:02:17.610> are

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
would work best I'm sure those who are

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.310 
would work best I'm sure those who are
