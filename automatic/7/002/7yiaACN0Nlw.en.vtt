besides the point so as you can see what
i<00:01:55.690> did<00:01:55.750> there<00:01:55.900> is<00:01:56.229> i<00:01:56.440> use<00:01:56.619> festering<00:01:57.100> strike<00:01:57.340> to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
i did there is i use festering strike to

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.570 
i did there is i use festering strike to
get<00:01:57.940> one<00:01:58.240> festering<00:01:59.170> strike<00:01:59.440> equals<00:02:00.009> to<00:02:00.369> death

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
get one festering strike equals to death

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.660 
get one festering strike equals to death
games<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.840> what<00:02:02.440> if<00:02:02.649> you<00:02:03.160> use<00:02:03.310> classroom

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
games so what if you use classroom

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.859 
games so what if you use classroom
strike<00:02:03.880> that's<00:02:04.060> probably<00:02:04.450> going<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.630> go<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
strike that's probably going to go and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.330 
strike that's probably going to go and
cool<00:02:05.080> down<00:02:05.110> then<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.500> scourge<00:02:05.890> strike<00:02:05.920> and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
cool down then you scourge strike and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.160 
cool down then you scourge strike and
then<00:02:06.509> festering<00:02:07.509> strike<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.810> gonna<00:02:07.930> be<00:02:08.050> off

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
then festering strike is gonna be off

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.780 
then festering strike is gonna be off
cooldown<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.619> then<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:08.979> use<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.280> once<00:02:09.459> again

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
cooldown and then you use it once again

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.030 
cooldown and then you use it once again
and<00:02:10.330> that's<00:02:11.140> basically<00:02:11.350> we're<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.890> give

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and that's basically we're going to give

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.650 
and that's basically we're going to give
you<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.250> maximum<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.850> death<00:02:13.150> ones<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.510> can

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you the maximum of death ones you can

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.930 
you the maximum of death ones you can
have<00:02:13.810> which<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.170> four<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.620> then<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.790> can

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
have which is four and then you can

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.500 
have which is four and then you can
empty<00:02:16.209> those<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.810> your<00:02:17.200> skirt<00:02:17.380> strikes<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
empty those on your skirt strikes so

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.710 
empty those on your skirt strikes so
yeah<00:02:19.840> that's<00:02:20.050> pretty<00:02:20.200> much<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.560> that's<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
helped you guys it's my dps probably

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.880 
helped you guys it's my dps probably
wasn't<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.049> right<00:02:35.200> let's<00:02:35.380> give<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.560> one<00:02:35.739> of

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
wasn't like right let's give it one of

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.589 
wasn't like right let's give it one of
tho<00:02:36.150> serious<00:02:37.150> now

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.540 

oops

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.500 

DPS<00:02:46.550> probably<00:02:46.880> isn't<00:02:47.030> gonna<00:02:47.090> be<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.270> great

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
DPS probably isn't gonna be that great

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.360 
DPS probably isn't gonna be that great
because<00:02:47.750> I'm<00:02:47.989> talking<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.770> playing<00:02:49.099> at<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
because I'm talking and playing at the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.350 
because I'm talking and playing at the
same<00:02:49.550> time<00:02:49.700> which<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.599> not<00:02:50.690> suggestive

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.089 

obviously<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.599> DPS<00:02:57.050> outcome<00:02:57.440> will<00:02:57.590> be<00:02:57.620> much

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
obviously your DPS outcome will be much

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.120 
obviously your DPS outcome will be much
greater<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.880> rate<00:02:59.270> environment<00:02:59.890> with<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
greater in a rate environment with the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.270 
greater in a rate environment with the
buffs<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.580> all<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.060> good<00:03:02.450> stuff
