welcome agents to Bible study now we're

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.720 
welcome agents to Bible study now we're
in<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.740> middle<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.099> evidence<00:00:08.490> vault

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
in the middle of the evidence vault

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.669 
in the middle of the evidence vault
which<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> great<00:00:09.719> location<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.260> Bible

which is a great location for Bible

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.230 
which is a great location for Bible
study<00:00:10.920> because<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.639> where<00:00:11.790> kids<00:00:12.090> are

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
study because this is where kids are

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.150

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
around me are really easy to reproduce

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560 
around me are really easy to reproduce
the<00:00:23.369> first<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.820> right<00:00:24.060> here

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the first is right here

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.439 
the first is right here
we've<00:00:24.840> taken<00:00:25.080> some<00:00:25.410> high<00:00:25.619> density<00:00:26.150> foam<00:00:27.150> board

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
we've taken some high density foam board

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.060 
we've taken some high density foam board
that<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.779> find<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.380> hardware<00:00:28.560> store

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that you can find at your hardware store

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.099 
that you can find at your hardware store
this<00:00:29.220> one's<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.519> 2-inch<00:00:29.970> thick<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this one's a 2-inch thick it's not the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
this one's a 2-inch thick it's not the
white<00:00:31.289> ones<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.099> when<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.579> cut<00:00:33.149> it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
white ones so it's not when you cut it

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.639 
white ones so it's not when you cut it
it<00:00:33.390> doesn't<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.960> everywhere

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
it doesn't get everywhere

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530 
it doesn't get everywhere
this<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> makes<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> really<00:00:36.000> nice<00:00:36.180> clean

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
this one is makes a really nice clean

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
this one is makes a really nice clean
cut<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> we've<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.559> cut<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.160> big

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
cut and we've just cut out some big

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.490 
cut and we've just cut out some big
rectangles<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.570> we've<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> mesh

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
rectangles in this and we've put a mesh

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
rectangles in this and we've put a mesh
netting<00:00:40.800> behind<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.820> find<00:00:42.090> at

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
netting behind it that you can find at

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
netting behind it that you can find at
your<00:00:42.239> hardware<00:00:42.510> store<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> fencing

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
your hardware store in the fencing

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
your hardware store in the fencing
section<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.879> makes<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.539> easy<00:00:45.899> kind

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
section so this makes a very easy kind

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
section so this makes a very easy kind
of<00:00:46.350> vault<00:00:46.980> almost<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> cage<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.360> area

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
of vault almost like a cage like area

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
of vault almost like a cage like area
this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.980> where<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> lock<00:00:51.180> down

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this is where you're going to lock down

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.119 
this is where you're going to lock down
your<00:00:51.480> evidence<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.079> keep<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> secure<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

that you'll find some other ideas for

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130 
that you'll find some other ideas for
things<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> decorating<00:01:09.990> made

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

I'd like to show you in this room is for

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.260 
I'd like to show you in this room is for
our<00:01:16.560> light<00:01:16.890> table<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> light<00:01:17.850> table

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
our light table now the light table

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
our light table now the light table
we've<00:01:18.420> made<00:01:18.689> by<00:01:19.049> taking<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.979> basically

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
we've made by taking or basically

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
we've made by taking or basically
repurposing<00:01:21.180> an<00:01:21.299> old<00:01:21.570> table<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.229> found

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
repurposing an old table that we found

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620 
repurposing an old table that we found
it's<00:01:22.740> got<00:01:22.860> metal<00:01:23.220> legs<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.790> metal<00:01:24.060> drawer<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it's got metal legs a metal drawer so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
it's got metal legs a metal drawer so
it's<00:01:24.810> perfect<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.920> kind<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> light

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it's perfect for this kind of light

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.670 
it's perfect for this kind of light
table<00:01:26.820> down<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.960> did<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.259> go<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
table down here all we did was go to the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
table down here all we did was go to the
the<00:01:29.189> home<00:01:29.340> improvement<00:01:29.790> store<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.570> found

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the home improvement store and we found

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
the home improvement store and we found
some<00:01:31.229> panels<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.430> fluorescent

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
some panels that you use for fluorescent

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.319 
some panels that you use for fluorescent
lighting

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
lighting

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
lighting
that's<00:01:33.630> what's<00:01:33.900> covering<00:01:34.259> four<00:01:34.530> sides<00:01:34.829> here

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that's what's covering four sides here

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's what's covering four sides here
we've<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:35.880> cut<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:37.200> sections<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
we've also cut out two sections of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
we've also cut out two sections of
two-inch<00:01:38.220> styrofoam<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> top<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
