00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.780 

are<00:06:04.300> two<00:06:04.570> approaches<00:06:05.110> you

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
I want to get far far back in then we

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.070 
I want to get far far back in then we
can<00:06:09.010> get<00:06:09.130> a<00:06:09.190> good<00:06:09.520> straight<00:06:10.300> drop<00:06:10.630> into<00:06:10.960> it

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
can get a good straight drop into it

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.720 
can get a good straight drop into it
which<00:06:11.740> is<00:06:11.890> what<00:06:12.010> we<00:06:12.130> want<00:06:12.310> so<00:06:12.430> we<00:06:12.490> don't<00:06:12.640> have

which is what we want so we don't have

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.210 
which is what we want so we don't have
the<00:06:12.850> side<00:06:13.120> of<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.360> thing

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220

the side of the thing
you<00:06:15.520> decided<00:06:16.060> the<00:06:16.300> thing<00:06:16.540> that's<00:06:16.960> not<00:06:17.170> good

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
you decided the thing that's not good

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.250 
you decided the thing that's not good
it's<00:06:18.190> going<00:06:18.370> to<00:06:18.460> kill<00:06:18.640> you<00:06:18.790> like<00:06:19.060> it<00:06:19.210> has<00:06:19.330> twice

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
