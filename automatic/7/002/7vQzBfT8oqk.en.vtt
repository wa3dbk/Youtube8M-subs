00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.790

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.340

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.410
 this promotion 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.410
 we start directly in the tour 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.720
 hi my love so I'm going to get you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 present a whole where I have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.630
 predictions here is what are we going to do 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.460
 it's firstly I'll show you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
 that this is the package a pack is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.879
 completely normal on the other hand we have 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.250
 our joker must remove the jokers 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.180
 we see there the package no problem with 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.210
 this pack is what I'm going to do it's 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.680
 just remove the dockers is what we 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.539
 will do what I'm going to need to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.430
 split the package in half because 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.840
 each of us will have to use 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.680
 one of the two packets so I asked for 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 choose choose the pacs you take it on 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 hockey and I'm just going to ask you 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:09.060
 to mix compaq and not do what I 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 I'll ask you now it's 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.400
 take a part of your package and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 return it like that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.770
 ok are we going to do this 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 simply exchange our partners 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
 neural part returned our packets 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.110
 just to be able to mix them 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.850
 together 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.470
 some cards returned and some 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.500
 cards face up agree we want 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.770
 create a kind of total chaos in the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770
 package 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.030

 still together for really who is a 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.820
 total chaos in the package so here you are 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.230
