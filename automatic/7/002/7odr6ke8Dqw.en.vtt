will<00:02:29.180> show<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.390> how<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.110> works<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.830> let's

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
will show you how it works so let's

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.370 
will show you how it works so let's

connected through bluetooth so to do

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.990 
connected through bluetooth so to do
that<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.160> go<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.370> settings<00:02:43.760> Bluetooth

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
that we have to go to settings Bluetooth

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.570 
that we have to go to settings Bluetooth
and<00:02:44.630> answers<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.019> device<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.860> then<00:02:46.040> just

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
and answers the device and then just

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.190 
and answers the device and then just
divides<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.060> search<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.569> have<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.930> click

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
divides the search you have to click

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.920 
divides the search you have to click
connect<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.030> then<00:02:50.030> we<00:02:50.209> are<00:02:50.329> connected<00:02:50.780> with

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
connect and then we are connected with

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.520 
connect and then we are connected with
the<00:02:51.049> Harman<00:02:51.380> Kardon<00:02:51.410> know<00:02:52.370> what<00:02:52.549> speakers<00:02:53.530> so

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the Harman Kardon know what speakers so

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.720 
the Harman Kardon know what speakers so
let's<00:02:55.570> have<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.780> look<00:02:57.049> at<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.650> volume<00:02:58.040> P<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
let's have a look at the volume P and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.550 
let's have a look at the volume P and
once<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.720> device<00:02:59.930> is<00:02:59.959> connected<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.530> are

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
once the device is connected you are

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.440 
once the device is connected you are
have<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.890> click<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.220> power<00:03:01.400> button<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:02.269> then

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
have to click the power button and then

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.360 
have to click the power button and then
it<00:03:02.630> got<00:03:02.810> X<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:05.959> is<00:03:06.019> how<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.320> connected<00:03:06.980> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
it got X so this is how we connected and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.180 
it got X so this is how we connected and
as<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.940> was<00:03:08.120> talking<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.660> volume<00:03:09.140> rocker<00:03:09.860> is

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
as I was talking the volume rocker is

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.370 
as I was talking the volume rocker is
very<00:03:10.579> good<00:03:10.850> we<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.660> slide<00:03:11.900> up<00:03:12.079> in<00:03:12.230> the

very good we have to slide up in the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.490 
very good we have to slide up in the
increase<00:03:13.310> or<00:03:13.459> decrease<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:15.110> does<00:03:15.260> look

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
increase or decrease it and it does look

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.210 
increase or decrease it and it does look
very<00:03:15.530> good<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.989> terms<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.739> connectivity

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
very good in terms of connectivity

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.220 
very good in terms of connectivity
options<00:03:19.610> we<00:03:20.000> have<00:03:20.180> Bluetooth<00:03:21.280> NFC<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:23.230> we

options we have Bluetooth NFC and we

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.819 
options we have Bluetooth NFC and we
also<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.340> box<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:26.930> we<00:03:27.200> can<00:03:27.350> connect<00:03:27.680> a

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
also have a box in so we can connect a

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.820 
also have a box in so we can connect a
phone<00:03:28.100> through<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.370> aux<00:03:28.670> and

system<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.720> quite<00:03:35.640> disappointing

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
system so that is quite disappointing

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.020 
system so that is quite disappointing
because<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.120> had<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.750> in<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.230> our<00:03:39.030> our

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
because we had that in the our our

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.050 
because we had that in the our our
speakers<00:03:40.860> but<00:03:41.860> considering<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.580> price<00:03:42.760> tag

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
speakers but considering the price tag

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.700 
speakers but considering the price tag
we<00:03:43.330> should<00:03:43.540> have<00:03:43.720> seen<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.980> airplane<00:03:45.430> system

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
we should have seen the airplane system

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.000 
we should have seen the airplane system
