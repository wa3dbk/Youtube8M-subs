00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.039 

in<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.890> lesson<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:03.090> will<00:00:03.120> define<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.629> color

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
in this lesson we will define a color

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.930 
in this lesson we will define a color
scheme<00:00:04.470> based<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.430> area<00:00:05.970> size<00:00:06.240> ranges<00:00:07.940> then

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
scheme based on area size ranges then

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.360 
scheme based on area size ranges then
after<00:00:09.809> applying<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.500> color<00:00:10.710> scheme<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
after applying the color scheme to the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.060 
after applying the color scheme to the
floor<00:00:11.700> plan<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.840> will<00:00:13.019> add<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> color<00:00:13.710> fill
