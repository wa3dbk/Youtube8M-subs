00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.840
 the grandfather and the grandson 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.730
 I'm going to tell you a beautiful story 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.189
 that deals with the family and 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.980
 old people 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.860
 I'm sure you'll like it a lot 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.860
 and I also hope it makes you think 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.520
 a little bit starts like this 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.830
 there was once in a small village to the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.820
 shore of a valley surrounded by immense 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:41.120
 mountains a poor old man that 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.170
 he could barely see his eyes had turned 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.100
 his ears were deaf and shaking 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.100
 the knees 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.360
 walked awkwardly stumbling 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.940
 continually 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.120
 falling on more than one occasion giving 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.120
 with his bones in the hard, cold soil 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.880
 when I was sitting at the table 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 preparing to eat almost never could 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.130
 hold your spoon and inadvertently left 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.250
 drop some soup on the tablecloth 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.040
 and another bit of soup came out again 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.400
 also from the mouth 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.170
 sometimes without being able to avoid it 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.170
 he was drooling 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.810
 the wife of his son and his son 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.950
 they felt pretty disgusted by all these 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.460
 things and they were very upset with him 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.000
 consequently he was punished and the old man 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.930
 grandfather had to finally sit down in a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.360
 corner of a room behind a stove 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.009
 where they brought their scant food in a 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.520
 old clay bowl and this one does not even 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:08.399
 It was enough to sate tea 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.399
 the old man cried frequently 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.110
 and looked sadly towards the table 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.740
 a certain day his trembling hands do not 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.740
 they could hold the bowl and this one 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.030
 fell to the ground with a crash and was 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.670
 broke 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.790
 his daughter scolding insulting him with 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.990
 rude expletives to which the poor 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.319
 Elder did not dare to answer and went down 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.500
 the head sighing and feeling a 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.680
 deep grief 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.379
 [Laughs] 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.319
 then his daughter-in-law one day walking around the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.840
 village market saw a tarter and there 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.060
 of wood in a flirty since 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.480
 he ran a man as old as his 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.400
 father- in- law with a very refined gray beard and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.709
 clean 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.500
 and some clothes of the most 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.410
 bizarre 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.070
 I bought him the letter for a few 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.760
 coins in which he was fed from 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.760
 there in the future 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.520
 some days later his son and daughter-in-law 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.000
 they saw in the little room of the humble 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.210
 home to his little chubby offspring that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.880
 I was four years very busy gathering 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.320
 some pieces of wood that had 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.320
 scattered on the ground 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.090
 the father did not know he was playing him 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.630
 intrigued how he was putting together the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.040
 small pieces of wood then you 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.460
 he asked his son 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.280
 what are you doing 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.740
 I'm going to make a very nice cake 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.560
 feed papaya mom when they are 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.290
 I do not want old people to feel so 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.939
 sad like grandpa 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.329
 then the father and mother looked at each other 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:08.769
 for a moment of milestone in milestone without 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:12.019
 say not a word after 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.290
 feeling guilty they threw themselves into 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.290
 cry 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.680
 they put the grandfather back at the table and 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.530
 since then he always ate with them 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:29.240
 being treated with the greatest kindness 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.240
 from that day the most incredible 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.410
 happiness flooded every corner of 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.410
 that humble home 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.100
 and colorado colorado this story has been 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.359
 finish 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.359
