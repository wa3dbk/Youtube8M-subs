00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 For example, today is the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.590
 federal government really the evil 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.780
 nonsense not the evil that must be evil 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 then not imagine us as something big 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.890
 can the federal government already 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.859
 Not be 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:23.279
 What would not we do to the evil? 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.890
 this poor this duo 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.380
 infernal merkel a half-dead 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:36.050
 westerwelle this is not for 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.050
 that's not the black man's eater anymore 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:51.770
 or or just as sparkle am 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:55.480
 wickedness of the evil that went also sparkle 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.480
 if the way is still there 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.640
 m20 westerwelle classic sparkle when 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:07.159
 such a crazy mature and westerwelle 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:10.159
 when the mature 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.000
 The place was wiped away the money 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.710
 completely disgusting but not 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.200
 next to it the black and yellow heads 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.899
 the next blackhead of the brothersles 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.140
 niebel, however, everything grows after all 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.210
 disgusting because you do not have to go far 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.490
 Not mentioned at all 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.350
 not from a piece of paper but even so I 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.270
 I just wanted my note for me there 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.920
 Here lie the on non-extra large 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.159
 Do not hold on to that for too long 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:47.430
 I wanted to do what she wants 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:49.470
 that had not lowered the voice 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.700
 only that we deal with the essential 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.060
 deal now we remain with 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.220
 evil now or so that is the core of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 evil which gives them the map I 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.780
 the nuclear power 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 the bad the greed georg r 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.039
 what they believe because so since 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.070
 for thousands of years in millennia 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.470
 all world religions and cultures that 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.020
 the greed and you outlawed and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 are hunted over and over again 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.330
 They try to take possession of something today 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.680
 Today today, you have them sitting today 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.320
 at the table of the ruling 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.989
 they have no such picture 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.370
 they do not sit at the table when they are here 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.340
 how long is he two three weeks 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.760
 as the Merkel has told us 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.010
 The markets now do not worry the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.120
 you say yourself twice and then 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.250
 afterwards the question arises who 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.780
 Actually, they have the rules 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.420
 Answer that does not respond 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.260
 greed governs and the merkel may with 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 to sit at the table 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.600
 It used to be different so I already have it 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.060
 But it was never like that 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.010
 like to help the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.600
 money lenders again at lakes 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.450
 that they would arrive in the middle ages 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.640
 had as the as the Ackermann and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.950
 Now do the service-door 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.120
 had to take care of the house 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.620
 to enter the ruling class 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.780
 They are allowed to sit at the table 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.970
 shows to the ruling in the middle ages 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.150
 the campaigners have paid and for that 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.709
 that the monopoly on the silver taler 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.810
 production since then clicked 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.000
 likely to blow on 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.230
 but even then there was the government 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.060
 have resisted 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.680
 this was not intentional was 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.730
 There are already speculation bubbles 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.160
 for hundreds of years 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.380
 from then I have something for them to know yet 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.590
 this tulip bulb story is not 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.630
 true 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.670
 This tulip bulb speculation bubble 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.250
 the then burst so now were 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.969
 you too here 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.140
 Thomas Aquinas 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.420
 I know what's so that it can be 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.659
 Well, yes, yes, spend less time miserable 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.639
 I have humor somewhere I have 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:54.650
 but on it in the year 1600 730 is the 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.049
 speculative bubble tulip bulbs place 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.359
 you probably know that 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.709
 At that time , that's what happened 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.420
 Inspection bubble bursts are 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.219
 However , the believers planned the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.019
 Bankers are all Dutch 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.419
 government called slow we need 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.959
 now state money otherwise this is the country 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.599
 broke 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.579
 and then it decays at that time 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.980
 in your government for consultation 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.479
 retired and left after two days 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.470
 read the following government statement 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.449
 let me quote the tulip bulbs 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.650
 speculation is in a kind of fever 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.330
 come about 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.120
 So in the state of 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.910
 Insanity in gambling addiction 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.789
 but is not the state responsible 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.449
 but the doctor 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.090
 that's what I call mine 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.270
 government declaration that something will also 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.270
 made
