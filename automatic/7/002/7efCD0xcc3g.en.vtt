00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello how are youtube friends good 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.170
 in this tutorial I will teach you how to 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.110
 install cars at gta 4 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.970
 for this we are going to need the program 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.230
 s park 4 I am the link I leave 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.230
 in the description of the video 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 here as you know we expect the 5 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.869
 seconds and we give you jump advertising 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:41.820
 and it will take us to the mediafire page 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.820
 here in nothing else we download the program 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.609
 well once downloaded it will leave us 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.850
 a weird file we give you right click 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.850
 extract here 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.660
 now we open the folder that left us 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.650
 and these files will come to us 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:10.060
 we right click on the gt4 icon and 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.060
 execute as an administrator 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.619
 will obviously open the program 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:19.670
 Now what we are going to do is give you here 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.070
 where says browser 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.280
 and we 're going to go to the bottom 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.830
 until the one until the last 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.480
 we will give a click here 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.990
 Y 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.080
 we are going to give two click to the word of 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.910
 vehicles or vehicles 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.910
 and it will open another window 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.270
 here where filter says they will put the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.090
 name of the author 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.900
 that are going to replace in this case I already 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.020
 I have one downloaded 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.110
 It's the fastest nissan skyline 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.870
 furious if they want it the link is the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.680
 I leave in the description too and as 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.680
 see the author's name is sentinel 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.170
 so here we are going to write that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.170
 first name 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.250
 As you see here, it appears 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.980
 if you want to make a copy of the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.790
 original car only select the two 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.350
 files give you to export and here already 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.780
 they obviously select where I 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.080
 example on the desk I give to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.960
 to accept 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.160
 and here are the two files of the 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.160
 auto the originals 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.799
 good now to replace the car 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.840
 we select the two files we give 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.000
 here in import 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.630
 let's find the car folder 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 we select the same two files 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.390
 we give to open 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.450
 and now we give it to the red disk that 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.670
 see what reuil says we'll give a click 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.480
 and let's wait for it to appear 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.810
 this window we will give you to accept and 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.000
 we only have to close the two 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.819
 windows or both 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.370
 Well, if the two windows of the program 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.280
 and with that we would have the car 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.750
 replaced in the game now I'm going to 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.860
 leave a gameplay to see what 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860
 that works 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.580
 or not 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.580
 really 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.470
 well that was everything I hope you 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.200

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.320

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.130
