00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.610
 [Music] 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.850
 good and what we 're going to need is going to 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:17.060
 be a rectangle of 11 x 6.5 inches 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:22.040
 we're going to need four pieces of 4 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.289
 points 50 inches on each side of 4.5 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.680
 on one side and on the other side by logic its 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:33.379
 square and we're going to need 2 squares 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:39.290
 2 pieces of 3.50 each side and also one 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:42.559
 piece of 6.12 by 1.25 all taken care of 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:48.170
 we are also going to need some strips 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:51.110
 rules resisted scissors and explain 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.990
 to decorate and a hole punch 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.680
 Well first thing we 're going to do 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:01.280
 to divide our rectangle into four 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.390
 parts and we're going to divide each part 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.790
 in two points 60 inches each part 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.360
 we make a mark both above and 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.640
 down 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 now with a pointed object without 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.450
 cut like a ruler or scissors 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.210
 let's go marking the fold so that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.980
 We make it easier to double our 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.310
 rectangle 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.310
 [Music] 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.299
 now you just have to start doing 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.299
 our folds 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.999
 [Music] 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.399
 and good as we spare a bit 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.490
 of our rectangle we are going to take 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:47.920
 our piece that we already have previously 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:52.209
 cut 16.12 by 1.25 we are going to paste 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 here where my insurance like double-sided 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.250
 or with glue 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.890
 and hey, it 's ready , we'll stick it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.830
 now we put aside and we will 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.740
 take now our squares to 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.520
 start making the boxes well let's go 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.260
 to take these two squares the most 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.230
 small ones and we're going to mark them at 1.50 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.419
 each side 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.419
 [Music] 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.460
 and since they're marked now there's only 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.750
 to score to make the doubles 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.600
 equally on all four sides 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.130
 [Music] 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.260
 Now you just have to double the 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.900
 [Music] 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.950
 and so we will be left with the best 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.950
 se with the other square 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.489
 and now let's take the squares more 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.849
 and we are going to mark these 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.620
 more careful of the four sides and let's 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.319
 to do the same procedure as before 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.319
 we did with the first squares ok 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.670
 and that we have finished with our 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.209
 fold now with our scissors the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.470
 we started the tabs to be able to 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.180
 paste we will achieve only from one side and 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.450
 let's cut this way 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.580
 [Music] 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.120
 look, you mention, you have to stay 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.550
 now let's cut another corner and so 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.370
 successively we do it with the four 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.250
 corners 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.440
 study third and establish the fourth 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.940
 and in this way we are going to do all 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.940
 our quadrants 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.870
 and good as they are ready now 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.480
 simply with our glue we go 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.510
 to put just one droplet 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.780
 and we're going to start hitting the same thing 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.710
 to do with the 4 little eyelashes 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.760
 [Music] 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.760
 we spread a little in the glue already 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.310
 then we will paste it and we will 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.400
 wait a few seconds until we 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.680
 let's make sure it's well attached and what 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.250
 same let's do with our others 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.250
 small boxes 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.820
 good since we have our lists 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.860
 boxes now yes we are going to accommodate the already 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.930
 paste them here in our base we are going to 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.160
 start from this side where is more 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.190
 small and we are going to go placing them 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.650
 this way the first box we're going to 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.570
 ensure that it remains very up one 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.800
 little bit down just to leave him the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.140
 space what is going to be our cover 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.100
 we put the lie here and since we are 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.130
 space insurance we have the box 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.120
 that will go down in this case would be 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.900
 this and we start to paste 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.419
 [Music] 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.669
 and well our second box the 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.340
 we would be in our second 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:03.260
 rectangle that is here and we are going to 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.720
 pay like this abajito the other 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.540
 and the same thing we're going to do with each other 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.080
 rectangles to go hitting boxes up 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.920
 let's finish 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.200
 [Music] 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.260
 and is now a matter of sticking to 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.820
 our bins in this case the 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.029
 above that I would go on to follow 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.029
 [Music] 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:34.389
 and the one below and in this way and look 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.370
 we almost finished now you can say that 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.930
 the most important thing from the base of the 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.499
 box is everything 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.920
 look we closed it and now they are description 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:47.249
 to decorate it 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.249
 [Music] 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.390
 and so I stay with me this was special 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.570
 for an imagined occasion 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.640
 they can not open and look inside they can 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.400
 put what you want like what 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.340
 can do for a February 14 to 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.830
 the mothers day of her birthday 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.290
 look inside you can put the gift 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.440
 an outgoing is a bracelet what 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.200
 you want to give and I hope good 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.450
 that you liked this tutorial and 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.910
 has served a lot and if they liked it in 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.100
 coherence do not forget to put offense 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.380
 up subscribe to my channel if I do not 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.430
 have done and see you for the next 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.430
 that I dominate
