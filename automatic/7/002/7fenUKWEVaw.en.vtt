together we got some fancy new a arms I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
together we got some fancy new a arms I
can't<00:00:43.680> show<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:46.700> tubular<00:00:47.700> steel

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can't show you there and tubular steel

can't show you there and tubular steel
much<00:00:48.780> later<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
much later so what we can do now is the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.920 
much later so what we can do now is the
car<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.739> an<00:00:52.829> accident<00:00:53.120> before<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.510> had<00:00:54.629> got

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
car was in an accident before we had got

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.979 
car was in an accident before we had got
it<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.370> had<00:00:56.550> put<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> new<00:00:57.030> front<00:00:57.480> end<00:00:57.750> on

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it and they had put a new front end on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
it and they had put a new front end on
it<00:00:58.399> see<00:00:59.399> where<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.609> welded<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> together

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it see where they welded it together

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:11.530 
it see where they welded it together
there<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:03.110> over<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.420> crooked

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.289 

somewhere<00:01:12.540> originally<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.200> hit<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.119> got

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
somewhere originally got hit so we got

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
somewhere originally got hit so we got
to<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:17.610> over<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.619> we're<00:01:19.619> cutting

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to do now is over here we're cutting

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
to do now is over here we're cutting
this<00:01:20.340> seam<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.200> cut

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
this seam right there we're gonna cut

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.670 
this seam right there we're gonna cut
that<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.740> open<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.130> up

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
that and open that up

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
that and open that up
and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.780> actually<00:01:27.780> asked<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and then over here we actually asked to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800 
and then over here we actually asked to
add<00:01:28.400> 3/16<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> an<00:01:29.549> inch<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.540> made<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
add 3/16 of an inch because they made it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.170 
add 3/16 of an inch because they made it
too<00:01:30.960> short<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.710> we're<00:01:32.460> gonna<00:01:32.610> cut<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.939> whole

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
too short so we're gonna cut this whole

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.590 
too short so we're gonna cut this whole
thing<00:01:33.420> off<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:34.369> take<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.549> whole<00:01:35.850> dented

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
thing off here take this whole dented

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
thing off here take this whole dented
panel<00:01:36.990> off<00:01:37.549> all<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> way<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:40.759> open

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
panel off all the way to the back open

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.690 
panel off all the way to the back open
up<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.030> weld<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:45.680> lengthen<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.799> when

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
up this weld and then lengthen it when

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.300 
up this weld and then lengthen it when
you<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.939> replacement<00:01:48.299> panel<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.189> so<00:01:50.189> we

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
you get a replacement panel there so we

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.830 
you get a replacement panel there so we
can<00:01:50.460> weld<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> three-foot

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
can weld right in there in a three-foot

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.010 
can weld right in there in a three-foot
section

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
section

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.399 
section
that'll<00:01:55.020> make<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:55.560> length<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
that'll make it the right length and

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.980 
that'll make it the right length and
make<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> straight<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> once<00:02:00.600> that's<00:02:00.750> done

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
make it straight so once that's done

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.810 
make it straight so once that's done
well<00:02:01.469> sandblast<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.310> paint<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> whole<00:02:02.790> frame

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
well sandblast and paint the whole frame

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.509 
well sandblast and paint the whole frame
