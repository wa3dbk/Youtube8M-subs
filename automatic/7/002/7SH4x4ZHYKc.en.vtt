00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.539 

let's<00:00:14.290> take<00:00:14.440> a<00:00:14.469> look<00:00:14.620> at<00:00:14.710> some<00:00:14.830> a<00:00:14.980> thoats<00:00:15.309> and

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
let's take a look at some a thoats and

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.130 
let's take a look at some a thoats and
what<00:00:16.000> does<00:00:16.119> an<00:00:16.209> eighth-note<00:00:16.449> it's<00:00:16.750> twice<00:00:17.110> as

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
what does an eighth-note it's twice as

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.560 
what does an eighth-note it's twice as
fast<00:00:17.560> as<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:17.830> quarter<00:00:18.160> note<00:00:18.279> and<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:19.210> quarter

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
fast as a quarter note and a quarter

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.839 
fast as a quarter note and a quarter
note<00:00:19.750> remember<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.529> primary<00:00:20.890> beat<00:00:21.310> of<00:00:21.520> the

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
note remember is the primary beat of the

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.960 
note remember is the primary beat of the
music<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.320> again<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.830> 4/4<00:00:24.279> time<00:00:24.310> we<00:00:24.610> have<00:00:24.700> four

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
music and again in 4/4 time we have four

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.490 
music and again in 4/4 time we have four
quarter<00:00:25.360> notes<00:00:25.390> per<00:00:25.689> measure<00:00:25.900> and<00:00:26.169> we<00:00:26.320> just

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
quarter notes per measure and we just

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.490 
quarter notes per measure and we just
count<00:00:26.650> them<00:00:26.770> one<00:00:26.980> two<00:00:27.300> three<00:00:28.300> four<00:00:28.900> so<00:00:29.349> if<00:00:29.410> we

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
count them one two three four so if we

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500 
count them one two three four so if we
were<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.679> double<00:00:30.039> that<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:31.060> would<00:00:31.210> be<00:00:31.330> eighth

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
were to double that it would be eighth

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.939 
were to double that it would be eighth
notes<00:00:31.779> and<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.140> do<00:00:32.260> that<00:00:32.410> we're<00:00:32.590> simply<00:00:32.830> going

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
notes and to do that we're simply going

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.220 
notes and to do that we're simply going
to<00:00:33.010> add<00:00:33.190> up<00:00:33.430> strums<00:00:33.879> in<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.210> mix<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.780> again

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
to add up strums in to the mix and again

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.600 
to add up strums in to the mix and again
this<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.559> not<00:00:35.710> going<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.040> sound<00:00:36.160> like<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.519> very

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
this is not going to sound like a very

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.880 
this is not going to sound like a very
exciting<00:00:36.940> strumming<00:00:37.360> pattern<00:00:37.660> yet<00:00:37.900> because

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
exciting strumming pattern yet because

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.520 
exciting strumming pattern yet because
we're<00:00:39.040> just<00:00:39.070> developing<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.790> basic<00:00:39.940> rhythm

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
we're just developing the basic rhythm

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
we're just developing the basic rhythm
but<00:00:41.530> if<00:00:41.620> I'd<00:00:41.739> go<00:00:41.920> down<00:00:42.460> down

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.880 

that<00:00:46.050> would<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.980> two<00:00:47.400> three

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that would be one and two three

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
that would be one and two three
and<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.820> takes<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> same<00:00:51.270> amount<00:00:51.540> of<00:00:51.570> time

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and that takes the same amount of time

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.000 
and that takes the same amount of time
that<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.990> would<00:00:52.050> take<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.350> strum<00:00:52.530> four<00:00:52.740> quarter

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that it would take to strum four quarter

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.270 
that it would take to strum four quarter
notes<00:00:54.380> quarter<00:00:55.380> notes<00:00:55.820> eighth<00:00:56.820> notes

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.540 

quarter<00:00:59.880> notes

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
quarter notes

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.020 
quarter notes
and<00:01:02.060> eighth<00:01:02.270> notes

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.940 

and<00:01:05.480> again<00:01:05.690> just<00:01:05.840> really<00:01:06.140> relaxed<00:01:06.470> that<00:01:06.710> right

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
and again just really relaxed that right

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.800 
and again just really relaxed that right
arm<00:01:07.130> when<00:01:07.370> you<00:01:07.460> strum<00:01:07.730> try<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.360> keep<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.630> even

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
arm when you strum try to keep it even

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.770 
arm when you strum try to keep it even
and<00:01:09.170> try<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.410> keep<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.370> volume<00:01:10.780> even

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
and try to keep the the volume even

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.120 
and try to keep the the volume even
throughout<00:01:12.350> as<00:01:12.590> well<00:01:12.620> so<00:01:12.950> we're<00:01:13.070> not

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
throughout as well so we're not

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.650 
throughout as well so we're not
accenting<00:01:13.700> anything<00:01:14.060> at<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:14.300> point<00:01:14.390> just

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
accenting anything at this point just

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.840 
accenting anything at this point just
developing<00:01:15.110> really<00:01:15.290> steady<00:01:15.710> eighth<00:01:15.920> notes<00:01:16.190> so

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
developing really steady eighth notes so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.300 
developing really steady eighth notes so
if<00:01:16.910> I<00:01:16.970> did<00:01:17.090> one<00:01:17.360> full<00:01:17.630> measure<00:01:17.840> 8<00:01:18.470> strums<00:01:18.980> of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
if I did one full measure 8 strums of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.610 
if I did one full measure 8 strums of
eighth<00:01:19.970> notes<00:01:20.000> on<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.540> D<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:21.020> full<00:01:21.320> measure<00:01:21.500> of

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
eighth notes on the D a full measure of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.010 
eighth notes on the D a full measure of
C<00:01:21.890> at<00:01:22.010> 9<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.310> then<00:01:22.430> 2<00:01:22.640> full<00:01:22.940> measures<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.390> G<00:01:23.630> it

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
C at 9 and then 2 full measures of G it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
C at 9 and then 2 full measures of G it
should<00:01:24.260> sound<00:01:24.410> like<00:01:24.590> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.960 

one<00:01:28.560> two

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.690 

to

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.889 

d

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:50.670 

see<00:01:41.619> I<00:01:41.649> know

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.290 

so<00:01:51.130> that's<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.370> basic<00:01:51.700> foundation<00:01:52.270> for

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
so that's the basic foundation for

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.110 
so that's the basic foundation for
eighth<00:01:52.630> notes<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.080> quarter<00:01:53.410> notes<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.970> I

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
eighth notes and quarter notes and I

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.820 
eighth notes and quarter notes and I
would<00:01:55.300> also<00:01:55.480> mention<00:01:55.900> that<00:01:55.930> if<00:01:56.140> that's<00:01:56.290> tricky

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
would also mention that if that's tricky

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.820 
would also mention that if that's tricky
for<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:58.480> chances<00:01:58.900> are<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.590> the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
for you the chances are that it's the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.310 
for you the chances are that it's the
left<00:02:00.100> hand<00:02:00.430> that's<00:02:00.640> slowing<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:01.090> down

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
left hand that's slowing you down

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
left hand that's slowing you down
you<00:02:02.440> can<00:02:02.590> obviously<00:02:02.680> slow<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.220> whole

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
you can obviously slow the whole

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.280 
you can obviously slow the whole
exercise<00:02:03.850> down<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.270> just<00:02:04.450> strum<00:02:04.630> slower<00:02:04.990> but

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
exercise down and just strum slower but

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.870 
exercise down and just strum slower but
keep<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.620> even<00:02:05.920> but<00:02:06.520> if<00:02:06.640> you're<00:02:06.730> having

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
keep it even but if you're having

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.670 
keep it even but if you're having
trouble<00:02:07.300> switching<00:02:07.480> between<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.080> left<00:02:08.320> hand

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
trouble switching between the left hand

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.040 
trouble switching between the left hand
chords<00:02:09.280> while<00:02:09.700> you're<00:02:09.940> strumming<00:02:10.330> that's<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
chords while you're strumming that's a

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.240 
chords while you're strumming that's a
good<00:02:11.200> indicator<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.890> really<00:02:12.100> need<00:02:12.220> to

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
good indicator that you really need to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.480 
good indicator that you really need to
break<00:02:12.580> these<00:02:12.820> two<00:02:13.920> parts<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.100> what<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> left

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
break these two parts but what the left

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.650 
break these two parts but what the left
hand<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.700> doing<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.000> what<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> right<00:02:16.330> hand<00:02:16.630> is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
hand is doing and what the right hand is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.090 
hand is doing and what the right hand is
doing<00:02:16.750> into<00:02:17.050> two<00:02:17.260> completely<00:02:17.710> separate

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
doing into two completely separate

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.010 
doing into two completely separate
exercises<00:02:18.820> where<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.510> could<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.660> count

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
exercises where you could just count
