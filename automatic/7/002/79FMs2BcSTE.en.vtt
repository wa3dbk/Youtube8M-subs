00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello together today is the penultimate 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.250
 day of the daily star flyer so slowly though 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.200
 sure it is coming to an end and me 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.700
 show you today my favorite mascara 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.790
 I have to admit that, though 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.410
 not only in the summer so wear the one 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 or others, that may be one 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.010
 recommendation for those who special 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.449
 but in the summer panda eyes have the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.170
 Of course you can always be in the picture 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.539
 carry 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.510
 one of my absolute favorites is from 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.800
 max factor the 1000km ascari I have 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.260
 also often kept pure 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 it is a relatively unspectacular one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.520
 But I think they brush one 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.250
 beautiful eye-lift does so 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.930
 so really voluminous gefÃ¤chert 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550
 but even with longer there are quite 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.059
 Clearly often on offer with any 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.629
 other things and costs I think about 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.190
 the 8 euro 50 9 euro for great 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.050
 Excited about that is one of mine 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.280
 absolute helix mascara and i will 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.219
 always buy me again 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.170
 we come to a slightly more expensive one 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.439
 mascara but she is one of my 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.010
 darlings and although of bright stone the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.450
 lesch prien sexy blacks mascara she has 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.049
 a beautiful packaging as you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.820
 So she looks so golden and then has so 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.530
 that's where this determination comes from 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 So it's really right 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.360
 beautiful and high quality costs a lot 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.689
 money so sometimes there is that because you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.460
 believe in the offer for 27 95 with still 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.710
 two things with such a small one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.750
 make up remover and an eye cream 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.369
 or something 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.490
 which lasts for a relatively long time so here is 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.799
 really a lot in there and a lot 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.570
 that makes really beautiful eyelashes i would 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.909
 me for the price so if that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.649
 now so corina would definitely be up 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.790
 she wanted to buy me for the price 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.870
 but not exactly to buy but 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.390
 she is just one 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.370
 I have very good it makes ask 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.260
 on the one hand volume on the 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.270
 other side longer so depending on how 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.190
 you turn it and which side you go there 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.050
 used and I think it's great for 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.400
 touch apps so often it looks a yes 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.900
 a little stupid if you are somehow 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.940
 Three hours later , it's his turn 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.190
 Cover up in front of the controls is getting lumpy 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.230
 and stupid but that works 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.210
 somehow without it looks good and 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.520
 That's why I really like them very much 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.140
 Then we come to a mascara I am 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.220
 that's always something to say 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.500
 but for me it is actually one 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.610
 mascara I used to love 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.960
 then I have so many others 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.010
 I tried that somehow not 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.760
 had more in mind and now more 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.710
 buy again because it then in the offer with 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.110
 was an eyeliner and that is from 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.760
 maybelline the false eyelash oscar and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.140
 So I am that it really is 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.940
 an absolute the winkler will be back 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.270
 noticed that this is just absolute 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.470
 darling is the power with a layer 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.440
 really beautiful eyelashes 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.060
 The long ones are fanned out 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.700
 can the super layers without that is 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.110
 lumpy the brush is flexible and 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.880
 I'm just really great 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.140
 excited about this maskawa because he 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880
 that's how you make me 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 Wishes 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.709
 Who had problems with the warm-up I had 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.820
 think a little bit off though 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.500
 I do not think it's bad at all 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.239
 because above are mine forever long enough 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.590
 and below I use anyway 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.570
 basically something else was for it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.920
 I think most of them just go for it 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.630
 So I think that's great too 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.860
 you're too big for bottom but otherwise that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.470
 is really an absolute favorite song 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.110
 eskara really nice black and easy 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.370
 Great then the eskara not on the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.810
 next for entrepreneur i have mine 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.430
 So all down here I just have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.680
 this super problems breakdown eyes there 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.360
 falls down with me everything down 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.010
 after a time off is also not on 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.870
 goal but something that's just up to me 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.250
 i can get off brother there i can eyes 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.840
 or not I can do what 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.540
 i want that we have easy and that 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.580
 very first of all the very first thing not 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.930
 stands apart from max factor 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.660
 masterpiece as master keys max 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.130
 ankara 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.760
 this is such a great size of this 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.220
 glass was added and that is for us 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.080
 really great he has a nice little one 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.310
 So brush it will be silly of course now 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.720
 because that's just brushing it 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.700
 Would not that be a little brush 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.960
 the confusion comes and learns 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.400
 just not off and that's why I think 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.960
 immediately calling in Herne him 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.340
 buy because otherwise really everything 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.920
 devalue that you currently looks stupid 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.590
 unfortunately so who has problems with it 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.710
 can look to make in any case 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.960
 then often two things show how 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.520
 quite a lot of great find but of 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.870
 which I do not love so much 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.790
 that's why I'm the only one 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.459
 wanted to say 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.730
 on the one hand, the benefit is the dab 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.740
 mascara the scary remained on 27 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.300
 euro for that is just real 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.100
 not a little and I have to say I think so 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.360
 I do not think they are that great 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.950
 I can not do much with that 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.660
 I think the eyelashes she makes one 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.180
 incredibly great eyelashes and shortened 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.590
 you have to be careful very fast 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.240
 they are not as long as I thought 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.200
 that they will be because it was really like that 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.110
 much talked about 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.000
 I have phenomenal but do I have to 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.900
 say and me much more 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.710
 stands as that is that I barely 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.090
 abbekommen 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.850
 So I mean I have a few 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.320
 waterproof what he what in between 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.970
 lashes but you can all me 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.130
 with my hero make up remover 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.930
 the only one I did not stray or 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.419
 where I'm out of power like a crazy one 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.770
 never us and that's not good 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.690
 because I realized that I was in 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.580
 the time where I spiced it 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.620
 an incredible number of eyelashes plucked 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.570
 I and I hang on my eyelashes 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.540
 especially since they do not grow as fast as 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.360
 they could grow or like everything 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.710
 others somehow always growing and 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.240
 That's why I'm really disappointed 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.830
 it can not necessarily be for one 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.830
 especially as she is the joke of the 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.220
 I get the thing in the 20th century 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.900
 but you still get it 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.900
 down on my songs so that is 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.199
 you really have to do that yet 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.780
 and last mascara that is too 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:49.009
 a much sought after on youtube country 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.860
 rocket is a rubber brush a very 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.500
 big rubber brush so I think so 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.220
 So do as he already does 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.750
 non-medical he will make beautiful 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.919
 eyelashes are beautifully separated and the 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.970
 But I'm getting really warm 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.830
 with that despite, I believe that the 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.330
 partly because the sausages are and 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.370
 I think that is always total 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.530
 unpleasant when applying if I always 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.669
 I can not get it up there otherwise 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.110
 always hurt so much and and 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.880
 I believe the volume a bit 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.139
 is just totally on this complete 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.449
 and now I separated very precisely 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.919
 I think so 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.729
 Imagine that's what I'm not 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.460
 think so great 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:31.300
 and then last but not least what do I find 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.800
 Also not missing is a whimpering 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.240
 i like it when we are really in the 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.770
 summer says here today I hardly want 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.270
 what's on it just a bit mascara 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.789
 but then you should from oberhausen the 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.740
 danger and therefore should a 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.740
 in principle one has one by nature 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.570
 curly eyelashes or private or 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.979
 any such sick if he is too 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.800
 really works because there should be yes 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.150
 also jumped completely 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.610
 otherwise only if you can be the one 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.590
 Fire Department then keeps it a bit 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.810
 longer I'm mostly at home for that 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.220
 I also use them most of the time 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.900
 before mascara soon after 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.880
 clumped and not so healthy 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.260
 if you have a tip for one 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.400
 really good one say because that 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.870
 I want to team ten against that somehow 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.270
 years or something old I have mine 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.500
 gums changed but yes I could 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.580
 sometimes use a new one 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.750
 then you can do that in the 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.039
 Write comments because I'm up 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.520
 I'm looking for but now I want to 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:19.979
 example for together 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.990
 which does not spend so much 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.030
 if it is totally stupid at the end of it 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.699
 if you pay a really good one 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.650
 knows then that tells me gladly 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:31.440
 otherwise we will see each other for the last time 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.199
 this week tomorrow and I wish you 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.289
 now a pentagram and goodbye 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.289
 Bye
