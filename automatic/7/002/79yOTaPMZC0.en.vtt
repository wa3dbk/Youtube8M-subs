00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.940
 or the physics and in this new video 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.880
 I'm going to teach you how to install a 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.220
 mode called without gods company that is 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.100
 a mod that is pretty good that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.039
 practically what it does is that it can 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.460
 be a pig and a pet chicken that 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.400
 they follow you and they also attack with you and 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.910
 also after they put on armor and what 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.800
 cute and good what he does for 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.640
 install it is going to go to the link that is 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.640
 in the description of the video 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:47.230
 ok since we are here simply 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.930
 we go down and here are the help 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.930
 we look forward to the wonderful and loved ones for 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.770
 everyone 5 seconds 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.770
 good but 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.420
 and we download it 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.370
 well we passed it to the desk when not 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.690
 be more comfortable and will use it 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.270
 desk because it makes me a lot more 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.640
 comfortable 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.649
 and well once we have it in the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.350
 desktop what I'm going to do is going to be 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.350
 open start we want to execute 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.290
 69 percentage app data cycle in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.290
 percentage accept 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.890
 point minecraft we go to the folder of 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.620
 well minecraft already tires lists right and 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.840
 open with alzheimer 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.640
 good since we have the biggest graft 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 point already open what follows is that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.890
 let's open the radio that we just 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.890
 to download 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:54.080
 as you will see in a folder we are going to open 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.290
 we have all this in we are going to 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.750
 overcome everything and we have it here 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.430
 I recommend that you pass it to the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.510
 where there are no folders so you can not 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.480
 the mistake of being put in 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.760
 a folder 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.630
 because it usually happens and when that's why 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.630
 no longer pulls the minecraft and we had it 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.080
 and ready I'm installed let's go 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.270
 Minecraft 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 I do not know what happened to my son 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.810
 but well 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.280
 as yang 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.750
 and good since we are here 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.750
 we are a little bigger 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.480
 as you will see it is from our 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.390
 okay 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.320
 chicken 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.990
 I eat chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.000
 chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken click 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.580
 yes 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.670
 and good publicly suppose that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.250
 we have a game here 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.740
 that we have a helmet 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.740
 a leather helmet 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.950
 and to train him we will click 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.950
 right with a seed 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.530
 and it is ours and so that it does not continue 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.400
 we put this in your hand 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.049
 and good that too 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.840
 as you can see, you can eat any type 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.049
 of the helmet and train them and make you 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.049
 follow 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.349
 and he's going to follow me and suppose I 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.349
 I attack this clip 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.280
 and good the half time to fix it but 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.510
 this is line 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.700
 Success comes success 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.700
 who we are and who we are 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.760
 but he's crazy 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.040
 I still have a hyperactive center 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.330
 well suppose there is a skeleton 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.020
 two 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.460
 do not 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.260
 a little 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.700
 well let's say you do not like them very much 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.050
 the little pigs then what you do is 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.080
 that in a while it 's a chicken 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.370
 and you put a cap 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.310
