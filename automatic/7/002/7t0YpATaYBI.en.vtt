 they are from here 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.790

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.820
 you click there 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.830
 then you have to leave this flag 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.020
 You are from Bolivia and that's where the company comes from 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.710

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.350
 Bolivians equals a magic point like this 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.540
