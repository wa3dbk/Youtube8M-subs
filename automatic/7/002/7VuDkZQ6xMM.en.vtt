00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
more you know but other than that not

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.779 
more you know but other than that not
much<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.500> thing<00:00:25.740> they're<00:00:26.099> matching<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
much of one thing they're matching up to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.380 
much of one thing they're matching up to
us<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.260> is<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.500> okay<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.340> us<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:30.090> we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
us which is not okay for us because we

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
us which is not okay for us because we
can't<00:00:30.660> match<00:00:30.960> big<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.769> go<00:00:31.980> big<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.460> thought

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
can't match big if they go big I thought

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.310 
can't match big if they go big I thought
that's<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> things<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.930> Clippers

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that's one of the things the Clippers

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
that's one of the things the Clippers
did<00:00:34.559> they<00:00:34.829> state<00:00:35.130> big<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> while<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.149> we

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
did they state big for a while and we

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.330 
did they state big for a while and we
had<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.600> take<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.320> gamble<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> paid<00:00:38.309> off

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
had to take the gamble and it paid off

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
had to take the gamble and it paid off
for<00:00:38.520> us<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.210> could<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.420> easily<00:00:39.510> gone<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
for us but it could have easily gone the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
for us but it could have easily gone the
other<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.760> get<00:00:41.760> hurt<00:00:41.969> us<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> class<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

other way to get hurt us on the class a
little<00:00:42.840> bit<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.760> other<00:00:44.940> than<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.660> much

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
little bit but other than that that much

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.979 
little bit but other than that that much
a<00:00:46.260> different<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.460> around<00:00:47.820> 10<00:00:48.090> degrees<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
a different is just around 10 degrees a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.040 
a different is just around 10 degrees a
difference<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> run<00:00:50.010> away<00:00:50.160> from<00:00:50.340> foodie<00:00:50.760> house

well<00:00:52.050> they're<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:52.980> better<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.610> know

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
well they're all there better you know

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.790 
well they're all there better you know
they've<00:00:53.940> added<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> great<00:00:54.690> score<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> team

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
they've added a great score to a team

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
they've added a great score to a team
that<00:00:55.829> could<00:00:56.219> already<00:00:56.370> score<00:00:57.000> even<00:00:57.149> though

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that could already score even though

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.080 
that could already score even though
they<00:00:57.420> had<00:00:57.600> been<00:00:57.629> scoring<00:00:58.170> much<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.680> year<00:00:59.090> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
they had been scoring much this year and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.150 
they had been scoring much this year and
Lowry<00:01:00.600> now<00:01:00.780> full<00:01:01.140> time<00:01:01.469> they're<00:01:01.739> running<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
Lowry now full time they're running a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
Lowry now full time they're running a
lot<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.449> they're<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:03.899> pushing<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
lot more so they're really pushing the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
lot more so they're really pushing the
pace<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.880> maybe<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.600> haven't

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pace and then maybe because they haven't

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.060 
pace and then maybe because they haven't
had<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> lot<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> practices<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:07.920> don't

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
had a lot of practices so they don't

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.280 
had a lot of practices so they don't
have<00:01:08.130> anything<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> run<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.170> they

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
have anything to run but now that they

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.039 
have anything to run but now that they
have<00:01:11.450> they're<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> much<00:01:13.020> better

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
have they're going to be a much better

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
have they're going to be a much better
too<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.920> gonna<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> since<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> way

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
