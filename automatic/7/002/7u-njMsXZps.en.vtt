I<00:02:12.989> has<00:02:13.920> effectively<00:02:14.459> killed<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.269> festival

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I has effectively killed this festival

I has effectively killed this festival
for<00:02:15.989> good<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.700> don't<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.209> festival<00:02:18.750> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
for good I don't think this festival I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.199 
for good I don't think this festival I
don't<00:02:19.019> think<00:02:19.170> man<00:02:19.410> would<00:02:19.739> have<00:02:19.830> lasted<00:02:20.340> too

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
don't think man would have lasted too

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.040 
don't think man would have lasted too
many<00:02:21.390> more<00:02:21.690> years<00:02:23.030> even<00:02:24.030> if<00:02:24.180> Kevin<00:02:24.599> had<00:02:24.780> not

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
many more years even if Kevin had not

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.280 
many more years even if Kevin had not
said<00:02:25.470> anything<00:02:26.330> even<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.450> Carrie<00:02:27.810> had<00:02:28.110> not

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
said anything even if Carrie had not

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.759 
said anything even if Carrie had not
opened<00:02:28.470> his<00:02:28.830> mouth<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.750> had<00:02:31.019> opened<00:02:31.650> my

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.820 
mouth because I've done a couple videos
on<00:02:34.080> those<00:02:34.769> stories<00:02:35.549> I<00:02:36.590> think<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
on those stories I think that the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.770 
on those stories I think that the
festival<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.519> starting<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.150> run<00:02:39.360> into<00:02:39.599> some

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
festival was starting to run into some

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.960 
festival was starting to run into some
dire<00:02:40.019> straits<00:02:40.530> considering<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> lineups<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
dire straits considering the lineups to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.780 
dire straits considering the lineups to
these<00:02:42.120> fests<00:02:42.629> seemed<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.110> become<00:02:43.430> two<00:02:44.430> things

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
these fests seemed to become two things

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.490 
these fests seemed to become two things
every<00:02:45.180> single<00:02:45.510> year<00:02:45.599> they<00:02:45.810> seemed<00:02:46.079> to<00:02:46.200> shrink

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
every single year they seemed to shrink

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.130 
every single year they seemed to shrink
a<00:02:46.769> little<00:02:46.950> bit<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.430> they<00:02:48.180> also<00:02:48.390> seem<00:02:49.110> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
a little bit and they also seem to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.220 
a little bit and they also seem to
really<00:02:49.950> cater<00:02:50.340> toward<00:02:50.790> only<00:02:51.209> certain<00:02:51.599> styles

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the bill that this was one that would

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.990 
the bill that this was one that would

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
would want to go out for this but this

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.199 
would want to go out for this but this
has<00:03:04.680> been<00:03:04.860> one<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.250> worst<00:03:05.370> attended

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
has been one of the worst attended

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.259 
has been one of the worst attended
mayhem<00:03:06.599> fests<00:03:07.280> probably<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.489> history<00:03:09.120> of

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
mayhem fests probably in the history of

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.589 
mayhem fests probably in the history of
the<00:03:09.690> festival<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:11.129> just<00:03:11.519> not<00:03:11.579> one<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.120> has

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
the festival it's just not one that has

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.339 
the festival it's just not one that has
really<00:03:13.560> had<00:03:13.890> all<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:15.049> perks<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.260> benefits

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
really had all of the perks and benefits

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.250 
really had all of the perks and benefits
of<00:03:16.920> what<00:03:17.670> would<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.940> consider<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.780> a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
of what would you consider a a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.500 
of what would you consider a a
flourishing<00:03:19.859> festival<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.329> one

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
flourishing festival and this is one

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.210 
flourishing festival and this is one
that<00:03:21.630> essentially<00:03:22.260> put<00:03:22.440> ozzfest<00:03:22.920> out<00:03:23.100> of

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
that essentially put ozzfest out of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.759 
that essentially put ozzfest out of
business<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.910> could<00:03:24.420> kind<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.200> argue<00:03:25.560> that

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
business so you could kind of argue that

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.500 
business so you could kind of argue that
it's<00:03:26.069> just<00:03:26.400> business<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:27.060> something<00:03:27.480> should

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
it's just business and something should

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.020 
it's just business and something should
actually<00:03:28.410> be<00:03:28.769> rising<00:03:29.010> from<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.489> ashes<00:03:29.519> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
actually be rising from the ashes to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.940 
actually be rising from the ashes to
take<00:03:30.209> its<00:03:30.389> place<00:03:30.540> some<00:03:31.290> might<00:03:31.410> say<00:03:31.650> summer

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
take its place some might say summer

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.490

slaughter<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.970> really<00:03:33.959> don't<00:03:34.109> see<00:03:34.170> that

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
slaughter but I really don't see that

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.710 
slaughter but I really don't see that

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
festival for Americans I was kind of a

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.990 
festival for Americans I was kind of a
big<00:06:31.500> deal<00:06:31.530> I<00:06:32.010> mean<00:06:32.310> it's<00:06:32.670> definitely

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
big deal I mean it's definitely

something<00:06:33.480> that<00:06:33.600> seemed<00:06:33.930> a<00:06:34.080> lot<00:06:34.320> more

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
something that seemed a lot more

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.890 
something that seemed a lot more
mainstream<00:06:34.710> which

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
mainstream which

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.680 
mainstream which
arguably<00:06:36.500> speaking<00:06:36.919> it<00:06:37.040> was<00:06:37.250> but<00:06:37.759> it<00:06:38.449> was

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
arguably speaking it was but it was

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.060 
arguably speaking it was but it was
still<00:06:38.930> something<00:06:39.229> that<00:06:39.380> was<00:06:39.560> a<00:06:39.590> big<00:06:39.830> deal<00:06:40.009> for

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
still something that was a big deal for

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.710 
still something that was a big deal for
a<00:06:40.310> lot<00:06:40.400> of<00:06:40.639> people<00:06:40.759> I<00:06:41.270> want<00:06:41.300> to<00:06:41.509> know<00:06:41.600> what
