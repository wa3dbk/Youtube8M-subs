00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello then today we're going 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 see how to remove the coil 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.830
 ignition and on a Peugeot 206 + so 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.340
 at the level of tools we will need 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.800
 a key of 10 and a cutting pliers 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.900
 so then the car is immobilized the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 cover is opened is first of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 branches and all the connectors that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.750
 go from motor to intake 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.330
 so of course we have the little yellow button 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 and its all by itself and the sensors that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.969
 serve all that is little pillon 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 so air inlets in the engine 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.239
 so here we liberates well the turn the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.190
 small white power plug 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.700
 the reel if we hold good of share and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.629
 else the on the two small wings 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:52.530
 who otherwise maintain his share not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:54.449
 easily and so here we detach the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.500
 Coil son because everyone 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 that the goal is to remove it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.910
 so it does not take who is the son who 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.820
 stay on it's going to be embarrassing a price 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.640
 there is still at the level of the case 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.270
 butterfly so he does not find another 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.439
 sensor it's this one 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.020
 so what we do is a little 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.659
 difficult to access with the hand so we 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.240
 take a small flat screwdriver 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.860
 slide behind after raised the optics 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.400
 the little flapper to be able to get out 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.400
 from prison 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.470
 so now we have pretty much everything 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.970
 is unplugged we still have a small 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.100
 plastic collar that will have to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 to turn later but good so suddenly 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.369
 we attack the vices then for for the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.840
 nuts these are nuts of 10 so of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.369
 preferably with a pipe wrench it works 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.229
 better than the stems are long enough 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.320
 so with a normal pebble key very 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.090
 quickly there is no place in addition to that 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.500
 otherwise we can not enter the key 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 so you have to create a pipe 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.039
 if it's difficult in 26 screwdrivers to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.300
 inside the key concept of the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.300
 screwdriver it turns alone 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.390
 this is baron davis is total and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.930
 they are quite long anyway so he 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.390
 it takes a little bit of time to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:39.810
 remove everything 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.890
 this is a first that lay there that 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.230
 I accessed a little bit because 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.350
 that's not the most 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.860
 interesting of the video than to see the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.170
 unscrewing of his drawings normal in the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:02.489
 reverse direction of the trunk views 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:05.370
 high schools all from there on 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.769
 already starting to see the coil to reel 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:15.930
 has a little moved when others she's going 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:20.790
 soon be able to dismount it so after 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.480
 a da gobine that can be released in this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.900
 what we have left is we have a small 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.079
 6 collar that actually keeps all the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.660
 son on the coil this necklace there he goes 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.890
 must be fired because otherwise 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.660
 what happens we hold on 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.420
 and in fact now his part not 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.670
 so we can not change it like that 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.620
 we say the little necklace and after that 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.390
 pass alone so there with a clamp 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:57.750
 cutting it we just have well cut 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:04:02.370
 little necklace here it is tac in cut and to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.780
 from there then we continue from 2 in 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.910
 the films of the bobbin uncoil 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.840
 now we have access to the coil of 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:17.010
 sure a little bit above 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.239
 it comes out normally and that's it 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.889
 this is how to make montages of 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.889
 the coil on a Peugeot 206 +
