00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
but as you can see right there killing a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.270 
but as you can see right there killing a
human<00:00:36.780> gives<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.230> four<00:00:37.469> points<00:00:37.829> killing<00:00:38.190> a

a<00:00:41.910> Spectre<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.840> they're<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.649> game<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
a Spectre if they're in this game I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.319 
a Spectre if they're in this game I
think<00:00:44.280> they're<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.579> game<00:00:44.760> mode<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
think they're in this game mode so you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.670 
think they're in this game mode so you
might<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.750> two<00:00:45.870> points<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.590> as

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
might get like two points or so but as

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
might get like two points or so but as
you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.370> he<00:00:47.430> gets<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.760> another

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you can see here he gets like another

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
you can see here he gets like another
point<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> killing<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.050> Grodd<00:00:49.289> many

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
point for a killing that Grodd many

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.080 
point for a killing that Grodd many
kills<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.340> he's<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.670> seven

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
kills some more and then he's at seven

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
kills some more and then he's at seven
and<00:00:51.239> then<00:00:51.570> he<00:00:51.690> gets<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.960> bonus<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.860> guess

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and then he gets a bonus because I guess

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.380 
and then he gets a bonus because I guess
maybe<00:00:53.190> got<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> triple<00:00:53.640> Phil<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.030> something

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
maybe got a triple Phil or something

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
maybe got a triple Phil or something
we're<00:00:54.840> human<00:00:55.230> involved<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> got<00:00:56.309> 11

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
we're human involved and then I got 11

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.330 
we're human involved and then I got 11
points<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.300> whichever<00:00:57.660> team<00:00:57.899> gets<00:00:58.340> 22

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
points so it's whichever team gets 22

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.630 
points so it's whichever team gets 22
250<00:00:59.910> points<00:01:00.300> wins<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.930> game<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.859> next<00:01:02.160> game

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
250 points wins the game the next game

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.399 
250 points wins the game the next game
mode<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> hard<00:01:03.239> point<00:01:03.449> domination<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.199> this

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
mode is hard point domination and this

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.260 
mode is hard point domination and this
is<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> map<00:01:04.979> fracture<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
is on the map fracture so this is the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.090 
is on the map fracture so this is the
other<00:01:06.360> map<00:01:06.570> there's<00:01:06.869> hard<00:01:07.080> angel<00:01:07.650> city<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
other map there's hard angel city and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.640 
other map there's hard angel city and
fracture<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.450> fracture<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.350> hard

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
fracture and this is fracture so hard

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.140 
fracture and this is fracture so hard
point<00:01:10.830> domination<00:01:11.310> seems<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.030> like

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
point domination seems to be just like

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
point domination seems to be just like
domination<00:01:12.950> there's<00:01:13.950> three<00:01:14.220> flags<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
domination there's three flags you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880 
domination there's three flags you
capture<00:01:15.210> them<00:01:15.360> whichever<00:01:16.020> team<00:01:16.320> has<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.710> most

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
capture them whichever team has the most

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.560 
capture them whichever team has the most
points<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> end<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:18.180> reaches

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
points at the end of the game or reaches

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
points at the end of the game or reaches
the<00:01:18.689> score<00:01:18.930> limit<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> might<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.530> 250<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.070> well

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the score limit it might be 250 as well

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
the score limit it might be 250 as well
I'm<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.549> exactly<00:01:20.610> sure<00:01:21.270> when's<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> game<00:01:22.140> but

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I'm not exactly sure when's the game but

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
I'm not exactly sure when's the game but
as<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.130> i'm<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.580> 10<00:01:23.759> minutes<00:01:24.000> it's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
as you can see i'm like 10 minutes it's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
as you can see i'm like 10 minutes it's
15<00:01:24.780> minutes<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> gives<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.650> five<00:01:25.890> extra

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
15 minutes so it gives you five extra

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
15 minutes so it gives you five extra
minutes<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.520> win<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> game<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> stuff<00:01:27.479> like

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
minutes to win the game and stuff like

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
minutes to win the game and stuff like
that<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.680> we're<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.189> used<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that then what we're kind of used to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
that then what we're kind of used to
which<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:29.970> good<00:01:30.299> because<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.020> 15

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
which is good because you know 15

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
which is good because you know 15
minutes<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.740> domination<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:32.790> right

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
minutes for domination is about right

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.890 
minutes for domination is about right
normally<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.360> also<00:01:36.630> like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
normally and I like that I also like

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.480 
normally and I like that I also like
that<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.350> change<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> HUD<00:01:37.920> around<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.340> little

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that they change the HUD around a little

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.760 
that they change the HUD around a little
bit<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.880> EA<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.720> responsible<00:01:40.619> for

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
bit you know EA is responsible for

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.230 
bit you know EA is responsible for
titanfall<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.460> probably<00:01:41.700> took<00:01:42.000> some

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
titanfall so they probably took some

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.749 
titanfall so they probably took some
advice<00:01:43.229> from<00:01:43.579> battlefield<00:01:44.579> because

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
advice from battlefield because

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
advice from battlefield because
battlefield<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.479> puts<00:01:45.750> them<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> bottom

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
battlefield like puts them on the bottom

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
battlefield like puts them on the bottom
left<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.280> easier<00:01:47.549> because

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
left so you can see them easier because

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700 
left so you can see them easier because
it's<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.540> hard<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.290> okay

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
it's kind of hard to see it's like okay

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.789 
it's kind of hard to see it's like okay
we<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.100> bc<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.659> seeing<00:01:51.869> okay<00:01:52.170> okay<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
we have bc is that seeing okay okay and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
we have bc is that seeing okay okay and
then<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> bottom<00:01:53.640> left<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.090> just

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
then on the bottom left you can just

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.969 
then on the bottom left you can just
look<00:01:54.420> real<00:01:54.630> quick<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> say<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.770> B

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
look real quick and say that we have a B

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.070 
look real quick and say that we have a B
and<00:01:56.100> C<00:01:56.189> or<00:01:56.670> 80<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
and C or 80 and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.680 
and C or 80 and
you<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:59.190> that's<00:01:59.550> hard<00:01:59.970> point<00:02:00.180> domination

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
you see but that's hard point domination

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.180 
you see but that's hard point domination
and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.200> last<00:02:01.350> game<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.800> don't<00:02:01.950> have

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
and then the last game out I don't have

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.130 
and then the last game out I don't have
any<00:02:02.340> gameplay<00:02:02.550> for<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.150> I'm<00:02:03.270> sorry<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:04.020> it's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
any gameplay for so I'm sorry but it's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.410 
any gameplay for so I'm sorry but it's
called<00:02:04.350> last<00:02:04.590> item<00:02:04.920> standing<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.270> is

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
called last item standing and what it is

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.990 
called last item standing and what it is
is<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.660> kind<00:02:07.050> of<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.230> searching<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.650> story

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
is it's kind of like searching the story

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.050 
is it's kind of like searching the story
where<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:10.050> all<00:02:10.229> Titan<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.710> though<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.370> so

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
where you are all Titan is though so so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.820 
where you are all Titan is though so so
it's<00:02:12.180> Titans<00:02:12.600> searching<00:02:13.290> story<00:02:13.530> there's<00:02:13.740> no

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
it's Titans searching story there's no
bomb<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.580> what<00:02:15.150> happens<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.900> spawn<00:02:16.200> into

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
bomb so what happens is you spawn into

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.620 
bomb so what happens is you spawn into
signs<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.760> objective<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.420> kill<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630

signs and the objective is to kill the
enemies<00:02:19.110> Titans<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.650> which<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.310> do<00:02:20.490> die

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
enemies Titans and which one you do die

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.670 
enemies Titans and which one you do die
you're<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.120> for<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.450> round<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.050> then<00:02:22.500> it's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
you're out for that round and then it's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.460 
you're out for that round and then it's
whoever<00:02:23.370> kills<00:02:23.940> all<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.120> enemies<00:02:24.330> wins<00:02:24.990> now

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
whoever kills all the enemies wins now

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.630 
whoever kills all the enemies wins now
i'm<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:25.680> sure<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.100> actually<00:02:26.250> get<00:02:26.490> out

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
i'm not sure if you can actually get out

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.710 
i'm not sure if you can actually get out
of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> titans<00:02:27.060> because<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.360> does<00:02:27.540> say

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
of the titans because it does say

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.780 
of the titans because it does say
killing<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.170> titans<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> pilots<00:02:29.310> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
killing the titans and the pilots so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.700 
killing the titans and the pilots so
maybe<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.270> pilots<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.780> actually<00:02:31.080> eject<00:02:31.410> let

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
maybe the pilots can actually eject let

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.860 
maybe the pilots can actually eject let
the<00:02:31.890> Titans<00:02:32.250> fight<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:32.670> themselves<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.300> then

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the Titans fight for themselves and then

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.620 
the Titans fight for themselves and then
take<00:02:34.320> out<00:02:34.500> other<00:02:34.710> Titans<00:02:35.190> easier<00:02:35.820> hopefully<00:02:36.390> I

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
take out other Titans easier hopefully I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.930 
take out other Titans easier hopefully I
think<00:02:37.170> that'd<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.560> lot<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.770> fun<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.130> there's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
think that'd be a lot of fun but there's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
think that'd be a lot of fun but there's
no<00:02:39.090> bomb<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.780> there<00:02:39.959> but<00:02:40.320> once<00:02:40.740> you've<00:02:40.920> killed

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
no bomb in there but once you've killed

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.610 
no bomb in there but once you've killed
every<00:02:41.610> team<00:02:41.850> every<00:02:41.880> enemy<00:02:42.450> then<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.410> round

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
every team every enemy then the round

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.830 
every team every enemy then the round
will<00:02:43.770> end<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.910> will<00:02:45.090> win<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.360> round<00:02:45.540> and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
will end and you will win that round and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.070 
will end and you will win that round and
then<00:02:45.959> whoever<00:02:46.350> whichever<00:02:46.830> team<00:02:47.040> wins<00:02:48.080> three

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
then whoever whichever team wins three

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.290 
then whoever whichever team wins three
out<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.290> five<00:02:49.530> rounds<00:02:49.950> wins<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.760> game<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.180> it's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
out of five rounds wins the game so it's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.940 
out of five rounds wins the game so it's
kind<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.570> searching<00:02:51.810> story<00:02:52.200> except<00:02:52.830> for

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
kind of like searching story except for

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
kind of like searching story except for
there's<00:02:53.160> no<00:02:53.250> bomb<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.760> everyone's<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
there's no bomb and everyone's and
