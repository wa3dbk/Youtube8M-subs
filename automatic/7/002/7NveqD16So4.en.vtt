one working on the wheels and axles
another<00:00:12.630> track<00:00:12.960> gear<00:00:13.309> we're<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.400> go<00:00:14.580> over<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
another track gear we're gonna go over a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.580 
another track gear we're gonna go over a
couple<00:00:14.940> quick<00:00:15.269> things<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.109> sake<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.440> time

couple quick things in the sake of time

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.950 
couple quick things in the sake of time
I<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.369> opened<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> box<00:00:18.449> pulled<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
I just opened up the box pulled out a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380 
I just opened up the box pulled out a
few<00:00:19.199> things<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.949> got<00:00:20.550> stuff<00:00:20.789> ready<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.270> can

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
few things and got stuff ready so we can

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.720 
few things and got stuff ready so we can
get<00:00:21.720> through<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.020> quick<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.800> number<00:00:23.609> one

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
get through this quick but number one

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
get through this quick but number one
it's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> graphite<00:00:24.300> test<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:25.170> we're<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it's a graphite test then we're going to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259 
it's a graphite test then we're going to
sand<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> wheel<00:00:25.920> lightly<00:00:26.340> we're<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.029> work

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
sand the wheel lightly we're gonna work

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.540 
sand the wheel lightly we're gonna work
on<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> nail<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.019> then<00:00:28.619> more<00:00:28.920> graphite<00:00:29.340> so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
on the nail and then more graphite so

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.630 
on the nail and then more graphite so
here's<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> graphite<00:00:30.570> test<00:00:31.340> here's<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.460> nail

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
here's the graphite test here's a nail

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.860 
here's the graphite test here's a nail
and<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.989> tire<00:00:34.350> fresh<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.489> box<00:00:35.870> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and a tire fresh out of the box and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.209 
and a tire fresh out of the box and
we're<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.260> gonna<00:00:37.380> spin<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
we're just gonna spin it and just to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.770 
we're just gonna spin it and just to
kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> compare<00:00:38.850> how<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> hell<00:00:39.390> does<00:00:39.540> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
kind of compare how the hell does with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.619 
kind of compare how the hell does with
graphite<00:00:40.170> versus<00:00:40.590> without<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:42.149> fact<00:00:42.360> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
graphite versus without so in fact I

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.860 
graphite versus without so in fact I
undo<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.379> bolt<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> same<00:00:44.010> time<00:00:44.870> for

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
undo these bolt at the same time for

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.260 
undo these bolt at the same time for
graphite<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.760> pop<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> inside

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
graphite on this one you pop it inside

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.840 
graphite on this one you pop it inside
the<00:00:48.660> middle<00:00:48.809> here

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
the middle here

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.299 
the middle here
flip<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.940> over<00:00:51.410> make<00:00:52.410> sure<00:00:52.440> lots<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.920> graphics

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
flip it over make sure lots of graphics

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.540 
flip it over make sure lots of graphics
coming<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.760> spam<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.960> put<00:00:55.890> more<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> eye

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
coming out spam it put more in the eye

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
coming out spam it put more in the eye
kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> pounding<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.170> try<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.710> down

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
kind of pounding to try and get down

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.590 
kind of pounding to try and get down
inside<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.699> between<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.690> nail<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
inside in between the the nail and the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.750 
inside in between the the nail and the
wheel<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:04.290> why<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.650> over<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.309> then

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
wheel that's why I go over here and then

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.160 
wheel that's why I go over here and then
if<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.090> lift<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.659> getting<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
if I lift it up I'm getting a lot of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.429 
if I lift it up I'm getting a lot of
graphite<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.610> has<00:01:08.729> graphite

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
graphite in it so this one has graphite

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.789 
graphite in it so this one has graphite
and<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.280> doesn't<00:01:12.350> let's<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and this one doesn't let's just kind of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.410 
and this one doesn't let's just kind of
see<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> spin<00:01:14.580> these<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> same<00:01:15.150> time

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
see if I can spin these at the same time

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.560 
see if I can spin these at the same time
here<00:01:17.869> alright<00:01:19.070> first<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.220> graphite<00:01:20.580> then

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
here alright first a graphite then

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.679 
here alright first a graphite then
without<00:01:21.840> graphite<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.540> was

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
without graphite and so that was

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.539 
without graphite and so that was
stopping<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.530> graphite<00:01:28.860> still<00:01:29.159> rolling

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
stopping now the graphite still rolling

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.520 
stopping now the graphite still rolling
even<00:01:29.970> though<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> spun<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.689> first<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
even though I spun it first you see the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
even though I spun it first you see the
graphite<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.920> gonna<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.280> add<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> your

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
graphite is gonna do add a lot to your

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
graphite is gonna do add a lot to your
wheel<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:34.020> sure<00:01:34.049> you're<00:01:34.320> packing<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
wheel so make sure you're packing in

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.600 
wheel so make sure you're packing in
with<00:01:35.250> graphite<00:01:35.689> now<00:01:37.100> we're<00:01:38.100> gonna<00:01:38.189> jump<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
with graphite now we're gonna jump to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
with graphite now we're gonna jump to
number<00:01:38.850> three<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.420> since<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> nail

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
number three here since I have the nail

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.090 
number three here since I have the nail
all<00:01:40.590> set<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:40.950> work<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.880> nail<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.979> brand<00:01:43.979> new

smooth<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.259> put<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.619> drill<00:01:58.920> here<00:02:00.710> cut

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
smooth so I put it in my drill here cut

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.870 
smooth so I put it in my drill here cut

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a couple strips of sandpaper I got 150

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.139 
a couple strips of sandpaper I got 150
grit<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.689> 320<00:02:07.680> grit<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> turn

one of my safety goggles when you're

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.980 
one of my safety goggles when you're
doing<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.570> stuff<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:14.990> turn<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:17.990> you

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
doing the stuff and turn this on and you

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.230 
doing the stuff and turn this on and you
see<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.010> run<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.340> through<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:20.880> gonna<00:02:21.060> move

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
see as I run it through I'm gonna move

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.070 
see as I run it through I'm gonna move
it<00:02:21.390> back<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.660> forth

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
it back and forth

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.140 
it back and forth
if<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.380> hold<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> same<00:02:22.920> spot<00:02:23.280> event<00:02:23.970> it's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
if you hold in the same spot event it's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:03:29.860 
if you hold in the same spot event it's
gonna<00:02:24.300> snap<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.140> paper

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.610 

all<00:03:30.870> right<00:03:31.280> sorry<00:03:32.280> for<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.489> noise<00:03:32.519> but<00:03:33.620> that's

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
all right sorry for the noise but that's

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.660 
all right sorry for the noise but that's
working<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.969> axle<00:03:37.159> now<00:03:38.159> you<00:03:38.219> you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
working on the the axle now you you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.069 
working on the the axle now you you
probably<00:03:38.999> can't<00:03:39.239> really<00:03:39.389> tell<00:03:39.689> let<00:03:39.840> me<00:03:39.870> just

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
probably can't really tell let me just

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.949 
probably can't really tell let me just
kind<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.290> look<00:03:40.499> up<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.819> yeah<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
kind of look up but that yeah so that

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.679 
kind of look up but that yeah so that
head<00:03:43.260> files<00:03:43.590> away<00:03:44.090> from<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> shaft<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.659> the

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
head files away from the shaft of the

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.379 
head files away from the shaft of the
nail<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.200> have<00:03:46.650> as<00:03:46.799> less<00:03:47.040> friction<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.849> as

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
nail to have as less friction and as

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.479 
nail to have as less friction and as
little<00:03:49.079> as<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.469> against<00:03:49.920> no<00:03:50.159> wheel<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:52.489> my

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
little as you can against no wheel so my

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.009 
little as you can against no wheel so my
nail<00:03:53.639> that<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:53.879> was<00:03:54.060> doing<00:03:54.269> some<00:03:54.419> graphing<00:03:54.840> on

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
nail that I was doing some graphing on

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.440 
nail that I was doing some graphing on
looks<00:03:55.859> like<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.909> one<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:57.749> here<00:03:59.209> you<00:04:00.209> start

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
looks like this one so here you start

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:17.659 
looks like this one so here you start
putting<00:04:00.599> some<00:04:00.840> crap<00:04:01.019> back<00:04:01.200> back<00:04:01.379> on<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.709> baby

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.099 

so<00:04:18.669> then<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:19.329> want<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> keep<00:04:19.810> working

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
so then you just want to keep working

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.260 
so then you just want to keep working
that<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.500> spinning<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.160> more<00:04:21.790> graphite

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
that and spinning it and more graphite

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.200 
that and spinning it and more graphite
keep<00:04:22.510> working<00:04:22.900> it<00:04:22.990> spinning<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:24.210> that

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
keep working it spinning it and that

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.439 
keep working it spinning it and that
should<00:04:25.389> be<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.510> nice<00:04:25.780> move<00:04:26.229> fast<00:04:26.680> wheel<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:28.300> that

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
should be a nice move fast wheel so that

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.200 
should be a nice move fast wheel so that
guys<00:04:28.630> ready<00:04:28.900> now<00:04:29.740> that's<00:04:30.729> working<00:04:30.940> on<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
guys ready now that's working on the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.590 
guys ready now that's working on the
nail

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
nail

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.930 
nail
that<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.530> also<00:04:32.680> covering<00:04:33.100> more<00:04:33.220> graphite<00:04:33.699> just

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
that is also covering more graphite just

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.550 
that is also covering more graphite just
keep<00:04:34.120> loading<00:04:34.389> up<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.690> graphite<00:04:35.110> as<00:04:35.229> much<00:04:35.410> as

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
keep loading up the graphite as much as

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.140 
keep loading up the graphite as much as
you<00:04:35.650> can<00:04:35.830> when<00:04:35.979> you're<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.220> done<00:04:36.340> let's<00:04:37.030> go

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
you can when you're all done let's go

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.400 
you can when you're all done let's go
back<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.479> number<00:04:37.600> two<00:04:37.840> sand<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.290> wheel

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
back to number two sand the wheel

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.180 
back to number two sand the wheel
lightly<00:04:38.889> so<00:04:39.729> let<00:04:40.030> me<00:04:40.120> open<00:04:40.210> up<00:04:40.419> a<00:04:40.919> drill<00:04:41.919> bit

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
lightly so let me open up a drill bit

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.000 
lightly so let me open up a drill bit
and<00:04:43.030> I'm<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:43.810> gonna<00:04:43.900> clamp<00:04:44.260> around<00:04:44.440> on<00:04:44.830> the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
and I'm just gonna clamp around on the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.920 
and I'm just gonna clamp around on the
outside<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.669> wheel<00:04:45.820> here<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:46.630> don't

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
outside of the wheel here so I don't

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.659 
outside of the wheel here so I don't
ruin<00:04:47.199> anything<00:04:47.860> on<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.070> interior<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.580> the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
ruin anything on the interior of the

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:58.190 
ruin anything on the interior of the
wheel<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:54.820> take<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.180> up<00:04:55.300> lightly<00:04:55.919> again

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
wheel so so take that up lightly again

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.570 
wheel so so take that up lightly again
grab<00:04:59.200> some<00:05:00.060> this<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.240> by<00:05:01.419> the<00:05:01.479> 320<00:05:02.080> grit<00:05:02.229> paper
