spider-man<00:06:05.139> 1602<00:06:06.139> I<00:06:06.620> think<00:06:07.130> it<00:06:07.220> was<00:06:07.310> 1602<00:06:07.820> I

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
spider-man 1602 I think it was 1602 I

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.870 
spider-man 1602 I think it was 1602 I
was<00:06:08.150> thinking<00:06:08.479> it<00:06:08.599> was<00:06:09.010> 1902<00:06:10.010> or<00:06:10.160> 1602

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
was thinking it was 1902 or 1602

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.200 
was thinking it was 1902 or 1602
I<00:06:11.030> think<00:06:11.570> it's<00:06:11.690> 1602<00:06:12.229> from<00:06:13.130> my<00:06:13.280> vivid<00:06:13.610> memory

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
I think it's 1602 from my vivid memory

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.779 
I think it's 1602 from my vivid memory
of<00:06:14.389> whatever<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:16.520> said<00:06:18.010> so<00:06:19.010> I<00:06:19.039> am<00:06:19.250> trying<00:06:19.580> to<00:06:19.669> do

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
unfortunately and hopefully we will

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:29.320 
unfortunately and hopefully we will
succeed<00:06:24.280> but<00:06:25.750> that's<00:06:26.750> very<00:06:27.020> slim<00:06:28.330> anyways

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
succeed but that's very slim anyways

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.110 
succeed but that's very slim anyways
that<00:06:29.720> is<00:06:29.750> pretty<00:06:30.229> much<00:06:30.440> it<00:06:30.740> spider-man<00:06:31.250> 1602

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
that is pretty much it spider-man 1602

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.580 
that is pretty much it spider-man 1602
that's<00:06:32.510> how<00:06:32.660> you<00:06:32.720> get<00:06:32.870> it<00:06:32.990> we<00:06:33.080> have<00:06:33.110> one<00:06:33.440> more

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
that's how you get it we have one more

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.320 
that's how you get it we have one more
hour<00:06:33.650> so<00:06:33.979> I'm<00:06:34.070> gonna<00:06:34.190> do<00:06:34.400> some<00:06:34.580> more<00:06:34.610> unpacking

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
hour so I'm gonna do some more unpacking

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.200 
hour so I'm gonna do some more unpacking
if<00:06:35.449> we<00:06:36.140> if<00:06:36.680> we're<00:06:36.890> good<00:06:37.130> then<00:06:37.460> we're<00:06:37.610> good<00:06:37.789> I'll

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
if we if we're good then we're good I'll

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.230 
if we if we're good then we're good I'll
do<00:06:39.169> another<00:06:39.320> video<00:06:39.590> on<00:06:39.800> the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
do another video on the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.290 
do another video on the
bullet<00:06:41.509> points<00:06:42.199> spider-man<00:06:43.039> if<00:06:43.910> we're<00:06:44.180> not

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
bullet points spider-man if we're not

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.270
