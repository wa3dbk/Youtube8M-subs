00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.350
 directed by jean-michel ribes 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.149
 like a real building site meeting planned at the end of the year we are systematic 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.530
 but it is a fine team the arms of the director jean-michel ribes 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 Muriel Robin He panics and Gourio is preparing for a rehearsal 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.760
 diablogues 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 and the atmosphere is also good behind the scenes you are a member 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.800
 connect the brand on stage 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.020
 You see 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.590
 they do not miss 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.870
 judge 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.240
 those who pose the flemish drugs episode 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.690
 no, we said it's dangerous but we're so good at having this 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.050
 part of his vision 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.800
 we were not looking for history the diablos of dollars in the absurd 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.650
 and that's all the talent of their authors 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.710
 roland dubillard 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.649
 it's someone 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:37.719
 approximate 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.579
 as well of beckett to bring back it is she who invents a language that is a 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.490
 not a word 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.860
 this language of this world everyone understands it he was clenching his teeth out 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.960
 from the greyness of the city scenes of human lives 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.530
 sunny enough in front of him 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.550
 four years the yen also comes back comfortable in the text while in the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.890
 same time as him 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 why not why 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.870
 all in the service of an actor's performance in full ping pong 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.239
 to consult the site clean 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.339
 good game 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.389
 the beach 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.769
 after 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.899
 ould babana 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.739
 the sea with its own way for the payment of compensation pay his 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.900
 studies and writing 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.210
 At the base, we have to say when you find in this room the 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.009
 diablogues 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.489
 basically like what you have it says so often on stage in your own 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.189
 sketch mr 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.999
 but we have the impression that you have written this text of euros in 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.859
 January-May the defendant is very far from our universe 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.859
 in any case, there is a gap for those who know but 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 for work it's true sometimes its part elsewhere and instead of finding that of 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.780
 the smoke in the lungs plus also found butts and a craziness like 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.909
 that he wants 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.290
 kiwi fiji 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.849
 that I love and that people m 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.020
 m with the help of sharing with me 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.260
 Billiards shifted once again it's time 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
 jean-michel really should tell us 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.430
 but with a lag of six girls and six months I discovered this text with 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.579
 the conservatory 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.269
 and I remember reading that and falling off my chair so really and I 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.430
 like to tell people alan stivell as safe as it is how is it 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.099
 that retirees play before all the Olympics while during 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.309
 long time not by the times it took the busy jean-michel 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:19.699
 asked to put some billiards 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.500
 at the time of day and its lands 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.010
 an almost liberated success but also parts 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.669
 and then I think it's time 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.759
 and again this time I can play well 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.670
 people have come to the rendezvous 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.250
 for those who know but I have a lot of fun and I think 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.729
 it is 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:38.189
 it is well pleased someone of damage I think he had a lot of people who 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.920
 love me j 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.270
 I manage Gaddafi's assets and I do not believe that the criteria 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:47.859
 is now finished always the rcc on the cake new show it is 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.029
 went to discover the motor passage because these are skits to 11 11 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.879
 story woven honest to fire they come to play for I anticipated 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.419
 maybe not good that one of your questions you will be other questions 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:58.790
 but 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.959
 I wanted to play with a school not because she is my best friend 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.249
 for 35 years we have arrived in Paris in this sense 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.759
 it's because they both find themselves taking the funniest and for those who 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:11.409
 do you know what that would be the role for? 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.389
 no longer laugh these reciprocal so we're really in a legend 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.530
 michael is the perfect man but the story of the decade because his 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.849
 idea that not always necessarily he was going to stay 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.490
 so you have to stay and always find yourself inside a 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.160
 something very high holding a perfect perfect for its part this 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.389
 that really amazes all the I do not find the words I'm that judge 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.759
 all the flavor in any case dubillard 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.990
 it remains only at the appointment with a small revenge to take face 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.499
 his debt his newspapers at the center of the agreements keep intact with the 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.360
 reconciliations there is billiards 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.219
 reindeer can put in the center of geneva 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.439
 why not then why yes and why not 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.530
 but then why so why is not one 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.750
 a last show to her very funny very tasty and who stays 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.220
 I just married or marini you certainly 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.290
 to that it is necessary to mali 19 hours because I thought it was a 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.020
 show 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.710
 which stands out from the work 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.960
 orpond level bluff a little bluff their patients to live the big 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.349
 preparation to all in diva for this first minor and a half laugh 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.059
 for their entry into the green the pest the day before at 10 4 me back 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.059
 of richard gasquet here are the wine merchants exactly 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.900
 thank you very much but I would like to have provoked in the navy in 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.620
 a few days end of this diary in a moment the method at first sight of 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.120
 price 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.120
 that's spending time with 4% 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.419
 for training tomorrow to be true jean-pierre pernaut at 1 pm 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.590
 and their transfer to a term to disappear thank you for your loyalty 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.259
 the couple got scared
