00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
one of our favorite bikes that we ever

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.920 
one of our favorite bikes that we ever
built<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.300> everybody<00:00:35.300> at<00:00:35.420> Ibis<00:00:35.570> just

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
built and everybody at Ibis just

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.380 
built and everybody at Ibis just
absolutely<00:00:36.500> loves<00:00:36.739> it<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.699> we<00:00:37.820> decided<00:00:38.300> it

we kept the geometry identical to the
original<00:00:43.430> Ripley<00:00:44.060> because<00:00:44.660> we<00:00:44.810> love<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.140> way

you<00:00:57.230> know<00:00:57.410> more<00:00:57.620> trail<00:00:57.860> bike<00:00:58.100> type<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.840> riding

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
you know more trail bike type of riding

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.470 
you know more trail bike type of riding
than<00:01:00.079> we<00:01:00.260> anticipated<00:01:00.980> they<00:01:01.160> would<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:01.700> so<00:01:02.360> we

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
than we anticipated they would so so we

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.060 
than we anticipated they would so so we
built<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.809> new<00:01:02.960> Ripley

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
built a new Ripley

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.280 
built a new Ripley
the<00:01:04.399> v2<00:01:04.759> Ripley<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.390> added<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.810> whole<00:01:05.990> bunch<00:01:06.050> of

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
the v2 Ripley we added a whole bunch of

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.529 
the v2 Ripley we added a whole bunch of
tire<00:01:06.470> clearance<00:01:06.770> it's<00:01:07.340> now<00:01:07.550> got<00:01:08.300> tire

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
tire clearance it's now got tire

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.260 
tire clearance it's now got tire
clearance<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.500> pretty<00:01:09.770> beefy<00:01:09.979> 2.35<00:01:10.940> in

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
clearance for the pretty beefy 2.35 in

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.930 
clearance for the pretty beefy 2.35 in
the<00:01:11.330> back<00:01:11.509> we've<00:01:11.930> also<00:01:12.140> put<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:12.920> threaded<00:01:13.369> BB<00:01:13.670> in

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
the back we've also put a threaded BB in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.060 
the back we've also put a threaded BB in
it<00:01:14.180> instead<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.960> press-fit<00:01:15.200> baby<00:01:15.740> we've

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
it instead of the press-fit baby we've

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.460 
it instead of the press-fit baby we've
changed<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.820> from<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.360> original<00:01:18.229> style

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
changed the from the original style

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.350 
changed the from the original style
Ripley<00:01:18.799> cable<00:01:19.130> routing<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.850> new<00:01:20.030> style

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
Ripley cable routing to the new style

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.480 
Ripley cable routing to the new style
that<00:01:20.690> we<00:01:20.840> first<00:01:21.530> introduced<00:01:22.010> in<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.250> tranny

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
that we first introduced in the tranny

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.539 
that we first introduced in the tranny
29<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:23.360> that's<00:01:23.540> an<00:01:23.690> internal<00:01:24.080> routing<00:01:24.920> via<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
29 so that's an internal routing via of

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.640 
29 so that's an internal routing via of
very<00:01:25.909> versatile<00:01:26.390> port<00:01:26.780> system<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.500> other

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
very versatile port system the other

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.560 
very versatile port system the other
thing<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:27.920> we<00:01:28.159> did<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.549> with<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.909> popularity

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
thing that we did is with the popularity

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.280 
thing that we did is with the popularity
of<00:01:30.040> longer<00:01:31.040> droppers<00:01:31.670> now<00:01:32.000> 150<00:01:32.840> droppers

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
of longer droppers now 150 droppers

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.590 
of longer droppers now 150 droppers
we've<00:01:33.530> lowered<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.920> seat<00:01:34.189> mass<00:01:34.400> on<00:01:34.729> on<00:01:35.030> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
we've lowered the seat mass on on the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.380 
we've lowered the seat mass on on the
bikes<00:01:35.810> by<00:01:36.049> half<00:01:36.770> an<00:01:36.950> inch<00:01:37.130> another<00:01:37.909> thing<00:01:38.210> that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
bikes by half an inch another thing that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.710 
bikes by half an inch another thing that
we<00:01:38.479> found<00:01:38.509> is<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.080> people<00:01:39.229> were<00:01:39.470> really

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
we found is that people were really

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.410 
we found is that people were really
riding<00:01:41.720> aggressively<00:01:42.729> especially<00:01:43.729> as<00:01:44.270> of

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
riding aggressively especially as of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.320 
riding aggressively especially as of
late<00:01:44.630> because<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.650> new<00:01:45.830> 941<00:01:46.670> rims<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.090> we

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
late because of the new 941 rims that we

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.880 
late because of the new 941 rims that we
offer<00:01:47.509> on<00:01:47.810> these<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.200> these<00:01:48.320> are<00:01:48.380> 41

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
offer on these so these are 41

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.090 
offer on these so these are 41

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
and they are just a game changer they

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.230 
and they are just a game changer they
completely<00:01:55.100> change<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.610> profile<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.150> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
completely change the profile of the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.660 
completely change the profile of the

tire and they make it possible in many
cases<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.240> run<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.450> lot<00:01:59.689> lower<00:01:59.869> pressure

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
cases to run a lot lower pressure

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.160 
cases to run a lot lower pressure
there's<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.070> lot<00:02:01.189> of<00:02:01.479> movement<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.659> wheel<00:02:03.140> size

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
there's a lot of movement in wheel size

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.800 
there's a lot of movement in wheel size
at<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.680> moment<00:02:04.070> with<00:02:04.250> we'll<00:02:04.790> talk<00:02:05.000> about<00:02:05.119> 650

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
at the moment with we'll talk about 650

two-niner<00:02:11.510> frame<00:02:12.010> was<00:02:13.010> did<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.700> was<00:02:14.180> that

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
two-niner frame was did that was that

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.060 
two-niner frame was did that was that
part<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.720> your<00:02:14.840> kind<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.380> thought<00:02:15.620> process<00:02:15.980> for

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
part of your kind of thought process for

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.220 
part of your kind of thought process for
this<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.459> did<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.820> consider<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.870> making

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
this is you did you consider like making

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.310 
this is you did you consider like making
this<00:02:18.380> bike<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.459> can<00:02:19.609> run<00:02:19.760> both<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.320> we

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
this bike that you can run both in we

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.870 
this bike that you can run both in we
were<00:02:21.799> tracking

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
were tracking

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.930 
were tracking
pretty<00:02:23.060> pretty<00:02:23.620> heavily<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.490> be<00:02:25.640> plus

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
pretty pretty heavily on the the be plus

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.520 
pretty pretty heavily on the the be plus
movement<00:02:26.840> these<00:02:26.990> days

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
movement these days

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.660 
movement these days
this<00:02:28.100> bike<00:02:28.340> was<00:02:28.370> already<00:02:28.940> molded<00:02:29.720> when<00:02:30.680> that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
this bike was already molded when that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.150 
this bike was already molded when that
really<00:02:32.240> started<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.350> know<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.680> when<00:02:34.130> we

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
really started to you know that when we

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.040 
really started to you know that when we
restore<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:35.030> see<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.330> movement<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.870> bead

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
restore to see some movement on the bead

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.950 
restore to see some movement on the bead
blood<00:02:36.290> side<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.040> there's<00:02:37.250> not<00:02:37.370> clearance

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
blood side so there's not clearance

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.330 
blood side so there's not clearance
unfortunately<00:02:38.960> it's<00:02:39.410> really<00:02:39.650> difficult<00:02:39.980> to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
unfortunately it's really difficult to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.610 
unfortunately it's really difficult to
change<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:41.000> geometry<00:02:41.390> drown<00:02:41.960> around<00:02:42.410> here

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
change the geometry drown around here

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.590 
change the geometry drown around here
around<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.950> clevis<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.520> that's<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.240> widest

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
around the clevis and that's the widest

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.000 
around the clevis and that's the widest
point<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.770> you<00:02:46.490> know<00:02:46.520> 27<00:02:47.330> 5<00:02:47.990> plus<00:02:48.320> tire

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
point of a of a you know 27 5 plus tire

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.800 
point of a of a you know 27 5 plus tire
is<00:02:49.460> right<00:02:49.820> there<00:02:50.060> where<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.450> would<00:02:50.570> be<00:02:50.600> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
is right there where it would be the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.230 
is right there where it would be the
most<00:02:51.020> difficult<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.590> us<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.740> change<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.940> this

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
most difficult for us to change so this

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.120 
most difficult for us to change so this
bike<00:02:53.630> does<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.320> know<00:02:54.500> unfortunately<00:02:55.040> does

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
bike does you know unfortunately does

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.480 
bike does you know unfortunately does
not<00:02:55.160> accommodate<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.150> B+<00:02:56.740> wheel<00:02:57.740> the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
not accommodate the B+ wheel the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.120 
not accommodate the B+ wheel the
diameter<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.240> same<00:02:59.270> yeah<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.290> it's<00:03:00.680> it's

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
diameter is the same yeah so it's it's

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.770 
diameter is the same yeah so it's it's
very<00:03:01.310> tempting<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.150> know<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:03.290> do<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:03.950> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
very tempting you know to to do that and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.830 
very tempting you know to to do that and
we've<00:03:05.780> we've<00:03:06.230> been<00:03:06.530> riding<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:08.270> B+<00:03:08.630> wheels

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
we've we've been riding the B+ wheels

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.530 
we've we've been riding the B+ wheels
and<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:10.880> think<00:03:11.090> there's<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.300> place<00:03:11.480> for

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and we we we think there's a place for

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.260 
and we we we think there's a place for
them<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:12.740> don't<00:03:13.070> think<00:03:13.460> most<00:03:13.700> people<00:03:13.850> are<00:03:14.210> going

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
them I don't think most people are going

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.240 
them I don't think most people are going
to<00:03:14.390> want<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.900> ride<00:03:15.080> them<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> do<00:03:15.620> think<00:03:16.040> that

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
to want to ride them but I do think that

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.370 
to want to ride them but I do think that
there's<00:03:16.520> going<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.820> be<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.270> know<00:03:17.870> initiative

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
there's going to be you know initiative

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.530 
there's going to be you know initiative
people<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.860> are<00:03:18.980> going<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.850> want<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.450> go

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
people that are going to then want to go

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.020 
people that are going to then want to go
that<00:03:20.750> way<00:03:20.930> yes<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:21.560> certainly<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.340> newer

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
that way yes so certainly in newer

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.260 
that way yes so certainly in newer
designs<00:03:23.390> will<00:03:23.900> be<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:25.580> know<00:03:25.730> looking<00:03:26.120> at

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
designs will be you know looking at

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.530 
designs will be you know looking at
accommodating<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.550> that<00:03:28.550> wheel<00:03:28.790> size<00:03:29.060> yeah

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
accommodating that that wheel size yeah

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.160 
accommodating that that wheel size yeah
and<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:31.120> eccentrics<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.330> kinematics<00:03:32.930> is

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
and the eccentrics and the kinematics is

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.230 
and the eccentrics and the kinematics is
that<00:03:33.350> exactly<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:33.980> same<00:03:34.160> as<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.610> big<00:03:34.970> one

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
that exactly the same as the big one

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.300 
that exactly the same as the big one
yeah<00:03:35.900> we've<00:03:36.140> kept<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.650> same<00:03:36.890> we<00:03:37.100> love

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
yeah we've kept that the same we love

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.820 
yeah we've kept that the same we love
the<00:03:37.460> way<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.700> bike<00:03:37.880> rides<00:03:38.540> or<00:03:38.840> climbs<00:03:39.110> you

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
the way the bike rides or climbs you

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.380 
the way the bike rides or climbs you
know<00:03:39.950> people<00:03:40.400> can't<00:03:40.640> believe<00:03:40.880> how<00:03:41.030> well<00:03:41.240> these

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
know people can't believe how well these

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.710 
know people can't believe how well these
DW<00:03:41.900> links<00:03:42.170> climb<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.760> would<00:03:44.060> say<00:03:44.240> that<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
DW links climb and I would say that the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.830 
DW links climb and I would say that the
the<00:03:45.230> newest<00:03:45.590> version<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.840> what's

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
the newest version of the what's

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.960 
the newest version of the what's
standard<00:03:48.320> on<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.530> on<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.490> bike<00:03:49.670> is

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
standard on the on the on the bike is

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.930 
standard on the on the on the bike is
the<00:03:50.210> new<00:03:50.390> Fox<00:03:50.780> evil<00:03:51.560> shock<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.550> it's<00:03:52.670> like

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
the new Fox evil shock and it's like

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.010 
the new Fox evil shock and it's like
really<00:03:53.390> yeah

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
really yeah

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.260 
really yeah
and<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.800> really<00:03:55.160> adds<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.550> lot<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.760> mid-stroke

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
and it really adds a lot of mid-stroke

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.730 
and it really adds a lot of mid-stroke
control<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:56.900> know<00:03:57.020> a<00:03:57.050> little<00:03:57.560> bit<00:03:57.680> more

control you know a little bit more
platform<00:03:58.580> in<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.760> mid<00:03:58.880> stroke<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.510> that

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
platform in the mid stroke and so that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.170 
platform in the mid stroke and so that
the<00:03:59.900> bike<00:04:00.050> feels<00:04:00.350> even<00:04:00.890> even<00:04:01.400> more<00:04:01.790> bottomless

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
the bike feels even even more bottomless

introducing for the for the 29er

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.380 
introducing for the for the 29er
is<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.680> same<00:04:09.890> weight<00:04:10.070> as<00:04:10.190> last<00:04:10.370> year's<00:04:10.610> 32<00:04:11.090> and

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
is the same weight as last year's 32 and

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.820 
is the same weight as last year's 32 and
and<00:04:11.690> it's<00:04:11.840> buttery<00:04:12.380> like<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.860> 36<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:15.050> and<00:04:15.590> so

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
and it's buttery like the 36 is and so

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.729 
and it's buttery like the 36 is and so
it's<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:17.030> really<00:04:17.570> big<00:04:17.900> big<00:04:18.200> improvement

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
over last year's 32 so similar weight to

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.250 
over last year's 32 so similar weight to
the<00:04:21.470> 32<00:04:21.920> buttery<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> lot<00:04:23.480> stiffer<00:04:23.810> you

got great traction of the 29 or but then

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.529 
got great traction of the 29 or but then
to<00:05:42.080> pop<00:05:42.800> that<00:05:43.010> out<00:05:43.039> by<00:05:43.400> another<00:05:43.639> you<00:05:44.030> know<00:05:44.150> 20%

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
know in reality you should probably be

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.750 
know in reality you should probably be
on<00:06:12.199> a<00:06:12.229> Ripley<00:06:12.620> because<00:06:12.979> you<00:06:13.490> know<00:06:13.610> that's

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
on a Ripley because you know that's

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.640 
on a Ripley because you know that's
that's<00:06:14.120> really<00:06:14.539> more<00:06:14.810> suitable<00:06:15.169> to<00:06:15.349> the<00:06:15.470> type

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
that's really more suitable to the type

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.680 
that's really more suitable to the type
of<00:06:15.800> terrain<00:06:16.010> and<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.940> style<00:06:17.180> of<00:06:17.240> riding<00:06:17.449> you

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
of terrain and the style of riding you

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.350 
of terrain and the style of riding you
do<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:18.099> if<00:06:19.099> we<00:06:19.280> can<00:06:19.430> convince<00:06:19.849> them<00:06:20.000> to<00:06:20.120> get<00:06:20.240> on

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
do and if we can convince them to get on

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.890 
do and if we can convince them to get on
the<00:06:20.479> Ripley<00:06:21.789> oftentimes<00:06:22.789> their<00:06:23.419> minds<00:06:23.780> are

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
the Ripley oftentimes their minds are

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.779 
the Ripley oftentimes their minds are
changed<00:06:23.930> so<00:06:24.500> yeah<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:24.770> think<00:06:24.949> I<00:06:25.310> think<00:06:25.729> that

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
changed so yeah I think I think that

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.540 
changed so yeah I think I think that
that<00:06:26.750> pendulum<00:06:27.139> has<00:06:27.440> the<00:06:27.680> opportunities<00:06:28.370> to

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
that pendulum has the opportunities to

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.760 
that pendulum has the opportunities to
swing<00:06:28.970> back<00:06:29.180> yeah<00:06:29.659> and<00:06:29.960> I<00:06:30.139> think<00:06:30.229> both<00:06:30.530> sizes

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
swing back yeah and I think both sizes

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.700 
swing back yeah and I think both sizes
are<00:06:31.840> fantastic<00:06:32.840> and<00:06:32.990> should<00:06:33.199> peacefully

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
are fantastic and should peacefully

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.659 
are fantastic and should peacefully
coexist<00:06:34.250> again<00:06:34.669> and<00:06:35.560> you<00:06:36.560> know<00:06:36.710> all<00:06:37.280> will<00:06:37.550> be

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
coexist again and you know all will be

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.200 
coexist again and you know all will be
well<00:06:37.849> in<00:06:37.880> the<00:06:38.090> world<00:06:38.830> sounds<00:06:39.830> good<00:06:39.979> to<00:06:40.099> us<00:06:40.210> well

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
well in the world sounds good to us well

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.930 
well in the world sounds good to us well
we<00:06:41.389> can<00:06:41.570> give<00:06:41.810> it<00:06:41.900> a<00:06:41.960> go<00:06:42.110> yeah

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940
