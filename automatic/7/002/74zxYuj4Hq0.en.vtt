00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
for you guys to have a closer look at it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.410 
for you guys to have a closer look at it
you<00:00:58.670> can<00:00:58.880> actually<00:00:59.120> grab<00:00:59.810> their<00:01:00.290> tail<00:01:00.560> and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
you can actually grab their tail and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.680 
you can actually grab their tail and
swing<00:01:02.420> around<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:03.020> do<00:01:03.380> massive<00:01:03.920> damage<00:01:04.690> so

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
swing around and do massive damage so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.730 
swing around and do massive damage so
that's<00:01:05.810> pretty<00:01:06.050> cool<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.440> they're<00:01:06.560> actually

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
that's pretty cool that they're actually

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.520 
that's pretty cool that they're actually
implementing<00:01:07.700> something<00:01:08.390> from<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.050> law<00:01:09.500> of

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
implementing something from the law of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.440 
implementing something from the law of
dragon<00:01:10.130> ball<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.760> way<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.300> you<00:01:11.330> can

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
dragon ball in a way that you can

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.990 
dragon ball in a way that you can
actually<00:01:11.720> use<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.110> against<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.890> villain<00:01:13.250> so

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
actually use that against a villain so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.620 
actually use that against a villain so
it's<00:01:14.960> going<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.140> be<00:01:15.229> like<00:01:15.440> mario<00:01:16.159> 64<00:01:16.630> grabbing

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
it's going to be like mario 64 grabbing

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.270 
it's going to be like mario 64 grabbing
Bowser's<00:01:17.990> tail<00:01:18.229> swing<00:01:18.590> him<00:01:18.710> around<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.190> just

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
Bowser's tail swing him around and just

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.190 
Bowser's tail swing him around and just
throwing<00:01:19.760> him<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.450> it'll<00:01:20.630> be<00:01:20.690> really<00:01:20.900> cool<00:01:21.140> to

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
throwing him so it'll be really cool to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.710 
throwing him so it'll be really cool to
see<00:01:21.440> bardock<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.340> nappa<00:01:22.940> could<00:01:23.240> also<00:01:23.450> be

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
see bardock and nappa could also be

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.110
