00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:37.690
 Well, this snare does not use much from the throat but uses the lips to make a sound 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:40.579
 It is how to put out the sound, but pronounce with put together and force the air in the mouth out as quickly as possible 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.780
 Please put out 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.400

 It is usually thin to want you to be careful 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 Please do not pronounce with ç™º éŸ³ 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:04.910
 This snare is the first 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:04.910
 And then put out the sound together with the way of unbreathing to extinguish the candle light 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:20.720
 The first lip fit is like a kick drum 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:22.909
 Use of the pronunciation called Vuvu of the kick drum similar lips and Puï½°pu of the snare of this pf 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.860
 I'm going to make a sound 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:32.000
 The lips are absolutely overlapping and the sound comes out 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.000
 Let's make a sound conscious of how to use that lip 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:42.290
 Now in order to produce strong sound out the sound in about momentum out all the breath from firmly stomach 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.490
 Please be conscious to try 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.790
 Even if the sound is small at first, the sound will gradually increase as long as you have that awareness 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.670
 Let's practice
