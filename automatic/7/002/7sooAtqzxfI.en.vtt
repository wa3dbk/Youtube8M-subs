00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello very good to all and welcome 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.400
 again to microsoft inside in this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.610
 Occasion we are going to talk about the new hp 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.860
 specter x 360 which is this ultrabook 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.840
 manufactured by hp that not only us 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.580
 will allow to use it in portable form 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.509
 but we can also use it in a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.460
 from tablet 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.600
 besides being able to give this round of 360 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 degrees to both the screen and the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.840
 keyboard and it goes to show that the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.609
 makers of moments are also going to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880
 make great ultrabooks we go with the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880
 video 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.690
 hp surprises them in their last incursion 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.460
 in the hybrid notebook market 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.260
 highlighting portability design and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.750
 enhances the a7 x 360 Specter will not leave 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.239
 nobody indifferent of a metallic finish 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.460
 and in 13 inches we highlight in the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.430
 left side the loading port the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 ventilation grill a usb 3.0 and a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.699
 sd card reader while the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.519
 right lateral we will find a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.699
 mini displayport connection hdmi two 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.729
 bones more than 33 with 5 inches in addition 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.409
 of buttons to increase and decrease the volume 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.659
 the turning hinges are solid no 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.520
 clash in the design of the laptop 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.369
 which we have to indicate the part 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.880
 lower plus ventilation and two small 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.880
 speakers 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.180
 the keyboard backlit in the form of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.100
 help is comfortable to use although the fact 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.170
 of having the enter key to horizontal 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.659
 and not vertical it made me cost me a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.159
 time to adapt his travel is short 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.570
 but not uncomfortable and backlighting 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.570
 fulfills its purpose 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 Y 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.660
 all right 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.760
 Special mention must be made to the 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.500
 trackpad have innovated with a size 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.050
 considerable to whose hill 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.720
 differentiating it costs me to find a 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.140
 advantage beyond what good if it is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.660
 big 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.460
 your answer is really good and not 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.800
 you must use it on a day-to-day basis as 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 occurs with other trackpads gestures 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.460
 without malfunction it is true that they could 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.460
 answer a little better 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.560
 now I will talk about what we are going to be 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.920
 looking in front of this hybrid its 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 screen 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.170
 a spectacular 13-inch panel 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.150
 resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.170
 stands out in its viewing angles and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.200
 content quality 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.940
 not everything is perfect windows is true 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.860
 that does not have the best scaling the world 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.840
 and although the majority of the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.540
 there will be programs where this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.580
 problem will be noticed more none of this is 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.430
 a defect of the hp device clearly 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.050
 but you should mention it by removing this 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.620
 detail the screen is simply 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.620
 spectacular 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 yes 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.550
 the unit that they have lent us comes with 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.460
 a fifth generation i7 and 8 gb of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.820
 ram memory in addition to 256 GB and disk 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.020
 hard ssd as you can imagine 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.600
 both in tablet mode and in mode 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.170
 portable the performance is simply 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.170
 spectacular 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.730
 everything works fast and without any type 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.069
 of problems of office tasks 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.920
 simple to edit photo and 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.810
 video to give you an idea this 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.909
 review is completely helped from 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.250
 this device and I have not had any 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.410
 problem 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.910
 and combine your touch screen with the use 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.310
 keyboard and mouse is one of the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.320
 best experiences that I remember and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.690
 although I was skeptical about this principle 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.400
 in this type of devices I must say 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.400
 that you miss when you do not have 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.480
 and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.480
 and 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.129
 and 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.069
 and 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.069
 and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.790
 for those who have doubts with their 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.100
 performance with games well depends on 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.810
 what kind of games or two casuals a 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.790
 little power seekers like 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.220
 minecraft will not work without any 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.290
 kind of problem to native resolution that 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.990
 yes no one expects to enjoy games 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.120
 triple to like the witcher 3 or a call of 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.240
 duty to the highest quality since it is not a 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.370
 laptop aimed at this purpose the 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.020
 battery will not disappoint us in anything and I 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.480
 I am sincere in normal line of work 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.580
 He has not been able to spend it without 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.200
 turn it off all day long so in 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.570
 this section has left a great flavor 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.550
 of mouth although this device can be 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.670
 use only in the form of a tablet 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.440
 I do not think that being able to rotate the screen to 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.080
 360 degrees have this purpose as 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.510
 objective since its weight does not allow us 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.250
 use it in this way with comfort the 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.470
 biggest advantage that live is the ability 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.330
 to be able to turn it in this way is to be able to 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.910
 place it in a lot more ways 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.710
 comfortable to view content to see 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.409
 we deceive ourselves does not seem little but are 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.559
 details that mark a 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.569
 hp has convinced with this device 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:30.489
 Portability and power design are the 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.959
 flag of an ultrabook that besides 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:33.959
 Ultrabook can also be tablet
