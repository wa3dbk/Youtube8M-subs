00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.639
 we will now tackle the 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.610
 creation of the eye of our rabbit 

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:10.749
 we will move into the life of the right in 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.999
 the polygon tab 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:16.750
 we will go get the object to create 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:19.109
 a sphere we're going to be a greenhouse of the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.480
 size of our eye 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.019
 we go then in the chain she 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.500
 boxing to go into input font do 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.740
 and we will put the site ac division if 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.110
 these subdivisions is at 32 we're going 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.719
 crisscross the vertex at the center of our 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.579
 era with the move to one will go in the 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.129
 all the cetim and we will kill them the soft 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.120
 elections this app selection let's go the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:54.550
 to put to one of the two we will go back slightly 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:57.539
 near here our selection then we go 6 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.710
 may the following two points 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:07.600
 m false the azo radius 2.75 and the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.030
 moved even if we will go into object 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.860
 mode section a note what do we do the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:19.890
 place on the eye like these one will 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.229
 then if not all of its faces here 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.280
 we will disable the only selection and 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.280
 we will delete them 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:42.290
 we also decide and the two 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.970
 last are taken in the view of 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.500
 perspectives we have it if not all 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.720
 the chips faces and the ex shift right click 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.660
 the instructor and we're going to extrude them 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:00.920
 buttocks like this to create a volume 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:04.100
 on this is our our object we are going 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.930
 then take out a little bit the subject theme this 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.679
 to see all the places where we go 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.570
 rotate 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:18.350
 here it is done we will lift his body 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:23.660
 shoot him we're going to furrow all the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:30.350
 faces like this so by doing of 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:32.270
 the eclipsed sectioned pretty much there we go 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.450
 draw this setting that they are 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.450
 the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.670
 it's us or does shift right click 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:56.510
 extract faith is a unique affair 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.510
 street view as it is 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:05.840
 we press on three and here is the outside 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.450
 from our finalized eye we come back to the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.140
 right view we will create a high 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:19.250
 sphere of about the size of our 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:23.590
 eye and we will come to the place 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.459
 perspectives in the center of our eye 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.459
 he will not grow up 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.100
 must do a notation also help 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.230
 it must also be well in the center 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.250
 have left a margin around that is 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.250
 very same everywhere 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.440
 that's it for the line 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.790
 we take this polygon we press three 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.519
 also we will select the one 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.760
 ci and the outside of the eye 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:20.440
 we will press for control and I 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.530
 create a group and when the group is 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.150
 sectioned one presses control of 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.260
 well in chesnaie the berdych match 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:33.600
 wrong we go in this call x and we support 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.630
 on -1 like these we have our two eyes 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.669
 that are created and position at the right 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.840
 in law 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.840
 I rely on you too for 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.360
 multiply the subdivisions of rabbit and 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.530
 be a little bit prettier 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.599
 so that's about the 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.370
 creating the eye of the rabbit now 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.080
 is going quickly ranked note scene so 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.080
 how are we gonna do 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.860
 selected we will go to edith 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:10.240
 bee historical type 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.220
 then we will open look liner window in 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.580
 hot liner so some kleiner is a 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.050
 object is a window that includes who 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.110
 will reference all objects 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.510
 present in mad scene so we're already going 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.460
 six the fronts and side and we're gonna on 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.690
 control h against loose it allows to 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.479
 hide the selection hide our ills 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.250
 two reference images we will go there 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.050
 this is our rabbit and we see that it 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.849
 sexual to a poly surface 4 so 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.990
 police surface cats was sectioned 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.120
 at home at home, it can be very 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.280
 well sectioned something else that will be the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.659
 number of polygon votes but in 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.770
 function of how did you work 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.960
 you may have another 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.099
 so let's renowned anyway two 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.090
 times on it and we'll call it apa 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.880
 then we see two groups 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.449
 so it's the right eye and the left eye 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.759
 so we will call them gr 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.610
 like the barp eye on her bottom 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:08.469
 left for this one and this one turns out 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.719
 I pulled out of the bottom rhin of black stockings and 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:16.050
 the spheres that are inside it's 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:16.050
 the outside of the eye and the inside 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:23.800
 outside and inside 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:27.279
 then the thing to do so we go 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.809
 look in the right view the picture 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.930
 reference has still not been 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:33.310
 deleted as well as in the front view 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.979
 so what to do we go 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:41.430
 select cast and that's it we're going 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:44.740
 open window hyper serious connection 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.569
 this window will show us all the 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.839
 connections of objects that we have 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:56.080
 selected so we have 6 may front you are 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:59.919
 side and we do that it's sectioned its 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.770
 part of which connected to the side and its 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.779
 hall faces and we will remove our 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.110
 two reference images in them 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:09.210
 deleting we see that it was deleted 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.039
 here too 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.550
 so this is our scene is perfectly 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:15.779
 tidy 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.779
 we can do the notes outlook
