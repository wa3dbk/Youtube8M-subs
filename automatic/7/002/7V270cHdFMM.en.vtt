jeremy that that would be a great
question<00:04:41.350> things<00:04:42.350> will<00:04:42.560> turn<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.460> move<00:04:43.610> I

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
question things will turn and move I

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.999 
question things will turn and move I
mean<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.250> can<00:04:46.669> certainly<00:04:46.880> guarantee<00:04:47.210> that

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.519 

the<00:04:50.729> year<00:04:50.939> with<00:04:51.240> some<00:04:51.479> stuff<00:04:51.749> to<00:04:51.900> solve<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:52.409> or

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:52.529 
the year with some stuff to solve it or

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.929 
the year with some stuff to solve it or
not<00:04:52.969> in<00:04:53.969> the<00:04:54.089> service<00:04:54.449> and<00:04:54.710> say<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.669> know<00:04:56.789> we

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
not in the service and say you know we

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.499 
not in the service and say you know we
are<00:04:57.029> going<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.270> address<00:04:57.509> a<00:04:57.659> lot<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.110> work<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:59.159> I

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
are going to address a lot of work and I

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.939 
are going to address a lot of work and I
guess<00:05:00.509> the<00:05:00.659> ramifications<00:05:01.499> as<00:05:01.680> long<00:05:01.860> as

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
guess the ramifications as long as

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.070 
guess the ramifications as long as
happen<00:05:02.279> is<00:05:02.399> what's<00:05:02.610> going<00:05:02.759> to<00:05:02.819> take<00:05:02.999> time<00:05:03.180> and

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
happen is what's going to take time and

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.469 
happen is what's going to take time and
they<00:05:04.439> say<00:05:04.619> do<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.639> with<00:05:05.789> lease<00:05:06.059> can<00:05:06.389> you

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
they say do you with lease can you

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.899 
they say do you with lease can you
Alicia<00:05:09.439> do<00:05:10.439> you<00:05:10.499> at<00:05:10.619> least<00:05:10.680> know<00:05:10.889> can<00:05:11.490> can<00:05:11.879> you
