00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
you do want to plug this in it's quite

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.790 
you do want to plug this in it's quite
hard<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.850> do<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:29.750> one<00:02:29.960> hand<00:02:29.990> because<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
hard to do with one hand because of the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.290 
hard to do with one hand because of the
angle<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.340> can't<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:31.760> see<00:02:32.060> where<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
angle I can't actually see where the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.690 
angle I can't actually see where the
input<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.020> not<00:02:33.440> fumbling<00:02:33.950> about<00:02:34.070> there<00:02:34.460> so

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
input is so not fumbling about there so

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.030 
input is so not fumbling about there so
it<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.150> very<00:02:35.690> much<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.930> two-handed<00:02:36.620> job<00:02:36.770> which

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
it is very much a two-handed job which

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.680 
it is very much a two-handed job which
means<00:02:37.250> you've<00:02:37.340> got<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.490> kind<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.940> lift<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.420> flap

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
means you've got a kind of lift the flap

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.199 
means you've got a kind of lift the flap
up<00:02:38.870> with<00:02:39.020> one<00:02:39.230> finger<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:40.250> then<00:02:40.370> get<00:02:41.060> that

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
up with one finger and then get that

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.760 
up with one finger and then get that
cable<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:44.060> then<00:02:44.270> eventually<00:02:45.140> your

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
cable in there and then eventually your

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.220 
cable in there and then eventually your
ipod<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.490> connected<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.240> that<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.600> all<00:02:47.870> a

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
ipod is connected so that is all a

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.040 
ipod is connected so that is all a
little<00:02:48.620> bit<00:02:48.800> awkward

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
little bit awkward

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.330 
little bit awkward
now<00:02:51.050> one<00:02:51.260> thing<00:02:51.500> we've<00:02:51.740> knock<00:02:51.950> out<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.250> this

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
now one thing we've knock out in this

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.760 
now one thing we've knock out in this
particular<00:02:52.700> car<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.450> an<00:02:53.690> awesome<00:02:54.200> tip<00:02:54.470> mirror

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
particular car is an awesome tip mirror

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.840 
particular car is an awesome tip mirror
and<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.040> thought<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.520> little<00:02:55.550> bit

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
and I thought it's a little bit

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.880 
and I thought it's a little bit
disappointing<00:02:56.510> really<00:02:56.750> because<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.440> car<00:02:57.709> in

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
disappointing really because the car in

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.530

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.560 
because you've got to be spending quite
a<00:03:00.770> bit<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.980> time<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.520> motorway<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.120> have

obviously does but I think that's an
indication<00:04:02.930> as<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:03.230> how<00:04:04.570> baffling<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:06.340> menu

that's<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:10.040> little<00:04:10.160> bit<00:04:10.400> frustrating<00:04:10.549> because

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
that's a little bit frustrating because

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.020 
that's a little bit frustrating because
it<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:12.110> such<00:04:12.680> an<00:04:12.829> attractive<00:04:12.950> looking<00:04:13.670> car<00:04:13.880> and
