hi GCSE biology civil of a statement
four<00:00:04.740> point<00:00:04.980> eight<00:00:05.600> here<00:00:06.600> we're<00:00:06.779> dealing<00:00:07.109> with

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
four point eight here we're dealing with

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.870 
four point eight here we're dealing with
the<00:00:07.560> water<00:00:07.950> cycle<00:00:09.590> now<00:00:10.590> rather<00:00:10.800> than<00:00:10.950> draw<00:00:11.400> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the water cycle now rather than draw a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.039 
the water cycle now rather than draw a
diagram<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.929> water<00:00:13.170> cycle<00:00:14.450> students<00:00:15.450> need

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
diagram of the water cycle students need

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
diagram of the water cycle students need
to<00:00:16.080> be<00:00:16.230> able<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.680> take<00:00:17.070> apart<00:00:17.460> diagrams<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
to be able to take apart diagrams so

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.410 
to be able to take apart diagrams so
let's<00:00:18.840> look<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> component<00:00:19.970> parts<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
let's look at the component parts of the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.740 
let's look at the component parts of the
water<00:00:21.810> cycle<00:00:22.369> starting<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:25.369> evaporation

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.910 

something<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.910> 96%<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.170> water<00:00:34.410> in

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
something like 96% of all the water in

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.380 
something like 96% of all the water in
the<00:00:35.399> world<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:36.030> found<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> oceans<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
the world is found in the oceans and

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.770 
the world is found in the oceans and
it's<00:00:39.390> constantly<00:00:40.550> evaporating<00:00:41.550> which<00:00:42.480> means

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it's constantly evaporating which means

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's constantly evaporating which means
it's<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.290> from<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.920> liquid<00:00:44.129> form<00:00:47.120> into<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it's going from the liquid form into the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.299 
it's going from the liquid form into the
gas<00:00:49.739> form<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.910> might<00:00:51.090> call<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.360> vapor

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
gas form or we might call that vapor

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.430 
gas form or we might call that vapor
water<00:00:53.309> vapor<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:56.760> achieve<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.440> need

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
water vapor and to achieve this we need

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
water vapor and to achieve this we need
to<00:00:58.680> provide<00:00:59.430> heat<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.039> of<00:01:02.039> course<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.850> source

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390

up through the stem and then it's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.060 
up through the stem and then it's

oceans lakes and transpiration is the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.759 
oceans lakes and transpiration is the
evaporation<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.569> water<00:02:16.830> from<00:02:17.830> from<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.879> leaf

this<00:02:20.769> water<00:02:21.750> if<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:23.230> cools<00:02:25.019> condenses<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.730> we

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
this water if it cools condenses so we

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.180 
this water if it cools condenses so we
have<00:02:28.480> water<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.980> gas<00:02:30.280> phase<00:02:31.019> as<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.769> vapor

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
have water in the gas phase as a vapor

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.009 
have water in the gas phase as a vapor
water<00:02:33.610> vapor<00:02:34.200> turns<00:02:35.200> back<00:02:36.510> into<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.810> liquid

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
water vapor turns back into the liquid

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:46.710 
water vapor turns back into the liquid
phase<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:40.379> this<00:02:41.379> involves<00:02:42.780> cooling<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.720> a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
phase and this involves cooling and a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.069 
phase and this involves cooling and a
common<00:02:47.290> way<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.920> which<00:02:48.489> cooling<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> car

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
common way in which cooling with a car

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:57.449 
common way in which cooling with a car
of<00:02:50.940> water<00:02:51.940> vapor<00:02:52.360> would<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.560> when<00:02:54.099> clouds<00:02:56.459> so

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
of water vapor would be when clouds so

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.319 
of water vapor would be when clouds so
cloud<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:59.079> a<00:02:59.140> cloud<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> cloud<00:03:02.760> passes<00:03:03.760> up

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
cloud is a cloud so the cloud passes up

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.410 
cloud is a cloud so the cloud passes up
and<00:03:04.569> over<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.900> mountain<00:03:04.930> ridges<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:07.060> course<00:03:07.329> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and over a mountain ridges of course the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.809 
and over a mountain ridges of course the
altitude<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.109> cooler<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:09.160> cooling

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
altitude is cooler and this cooling

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.199 
altitude is cooler and this cooling
results<00:03:10.660> in<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.230> water<00:03:11.700> within<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.940> cloud

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
results in the water within the cloud

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.620 
results in the water within the cloud
forming<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.930> liquid<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:17.230> get<00:03:17.470> rainfall<00:03:17.769> and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
forming a liquid and we get rainfall and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.360 
forming a liquid and we get rainfall and
that<00:03:19.630> actually<00:03:20.260> leads<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.680> our<00:03:20.709> fourth

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that actually leads to our fourth

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.150 
that actually leads to our fourth
concept<00:03:22.060> which<00:03:22.750> is<00:03:23.280> precipitation

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.310 

or<00:03:29.780> rainfall<00:03:32.690> now<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.810> order<00:03:33.960> to<00:03:34.140> have

or rainfall now in order to have

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.440 
or rainfall now in order to have
rainfall<00:03:35.040> we<00:03:35.370> first<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.210> have

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
rainfall we first have to have

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.380 
rainfall we first have to have
evaporation<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:37.410> water<00:03:37.470> from<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.730> oceans<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
evaporation of water from the oceans and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.650 
evaporation of water from the oceans and
lakes<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:40.070> then<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.510> condensation<00:03:42.510> into

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
lakes and then it's condensation into

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.130 
lakes and then it's condensation into
clouds<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.680> cooling<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.370> then<00:03:45.210> the<00:03:45.630> falling

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
clouds it's cooling and then the falling

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
clouds it's cooling and then the falling
of<00:03:46.580> water<00:03:47.580> as<00:03:48.090> water<00:03:48.750> rain<00:03:51.800> when<00:03:52.800> we<00:03:52.950> have

precipitation<00:03:59.780> like<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:01.280> then<00:04:02.280> what

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
precipitation like this then what

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.910 
precipitation like this then what
happens<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.870> water<00:04:04.080> either<00:04:04.440> runs

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
happens is that the water either runs

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.140 
happens is that the water either runs
off<00:04:05.190> over<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.180> surface<00:04:06.750> or<00:04:07.080> goes<00:04:07.890> down<00:04:08.150> into

the soil and porous rocks the surface is

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.990 
the soil and porous rocks the surface is
called<00:04:15.690> surface<00:04:17.540> runoff<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.430> water<00:04:20.670> will

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
called surface runoff and the water will

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.780 
called surface runoff and the water will
gather<00:04:21.270> to<00:04:22.049> form<00:04:22.290> streams<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.940> rivers<00:04:26.960> and

gather to form streams and rivers and

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.860 
gather to form streams and rivers and
lakes<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:31.430> for<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.520> most<00:04:32.760> part<00:04:33.150> these<00:04:33.510> will

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
lakes and for the most part these will

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.750

what<00:05:00.480> I<00:05:00.510> mean<00:05:00.720> here<00:05:01.020> are<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.740> parts<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.460> the

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
what I mean here are the parts of the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.840 
what I mean here are the parts of the
food<00:05:02.910> chain<00:05:03.320> including<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.530> producer<00:05:05.510> and

food chain including the producer and
the<00:05:08.870> consumers<00:05:11.570> so<00:05:12.570> it's<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.900> primary

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
the consumers so it's of a primary

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.860

consumer<00:05:13.800> here<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.460> we'll<00:05:14.850> have<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.060> secondary

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
consumer here and we'll have a secondary

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.760 
consumer here and we'll have a secondary
consumer<00:05:16.500> here<00:05:16.980> and<00:05:18.410> water<00:05:19.580> passes<00:05:20.580> through

each of the trophic levels the producer

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.940 
each of the trophic levels the producer
of<00:05:30.870> course<00:05:31.170> was<00:05:31.950> taking<00:05:32.400> in<00:05:32.550> water<00:05:33.890> along<00:05:34.890> with
