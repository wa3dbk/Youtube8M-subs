let's<00:01:16.490> say<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.700> Robin<00:01:17.539> something<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.619> an

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
let's say a Robin something and to an

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.740 
let's say a Robin something and to an
extent<00:01:18.770> competes<00:01:19.399> with<00:01:19.520> food<00:01:19.850> or<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:20.479> food

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
extent competes with food or for food

extent competes with food or for food
with<00:01:20.960> him<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:21.800> another<00:01:22.039> Robin<00:01:22.399> in<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.550> area

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
with him then another Robin in the area

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:23.920 
with him then another Robin in the area
might<00:01:22.910> think<00:01:23.149> there's<00:01:23.270> already<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.600> Robin

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
might think there's already a Robin

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.480 
might think there's already a Robin
active<00:01:24.320> let's<00:01:24.649> head<00:01:24.830> down<00:01:24.979> in<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.160> drainage

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
active let's head down in the drainage

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.580 
active let's head down in the drainage

goes for yeah a bird what you should
improve<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:35.060> lot<00:01:35.299> nah<00:01:35.510> we<00:01:35.630> can<00:01:35.780> stop<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> little

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
improve a lot nah we can stop a little

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.750 
improve a lot nah we can stop a little
bit<00:01:36.439> further<00:01:36.799> right<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.220> far<00:01:37.430> enough<00:01:37.549> away

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
bit further right just far enough away

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.700

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
where the tendons are connected so

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.690
