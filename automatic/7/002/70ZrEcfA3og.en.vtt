side and connect it to the blue okay you
can<00:01:05.280> leave<00:01:05.399> the<00:01:05.610> ground<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> dim<00:01:07.759> hooked

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
can leave the ground for the dim hooked

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.899 
can leave the ground for the dim hooked
up<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.899> to<00:01:10.049> swap<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.220> red<00:01:11.490> from<00:01:11.880> the

up but you have to swap the red from the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.029 
up but you have to swap the red from the
plug<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.509> ground<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.560> you're<00:01:13.740> basically

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
plug from the ground so you're basically

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.800 
plug from the ground so you're basically
just<00:01:14.189> swapping<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:15.000> two<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:15.509> here

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
this is the bright headlight that's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.859 
this is the bright headlight that's
 up<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.179> can<00:01:21.299> leave<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> other<00:01:21.659> ones

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
 up you can leave the other ones

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.889 
 up you can leave the other ones
are<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.130> bright<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.210> red<00:01:24.450> has<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> go

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
are out the bright has the red has to go

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.779 
are out the bright has the red has to go
to<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> blue<00:01:25.380> okay

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
to the blue okay

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.580 
to the blue okay
and<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.690> blue<00:01:27.869> stays<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> way

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and then the blue stays with that way

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.050 
and then the blue stays with that way
you<00:01:28.679> have<00:01:28.740> two<00:01:28.890> splices<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.549> put<00:01:29.819> the<00:01:29.909> red

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you have two splices so you put the red

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149 
you have two splices so you put the red
with<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.270> blue<00:01:30.569> and<00:01:30.899> then<00:01:31.679> you<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> put

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
with the blue and then you have to put

with the blue and then you have to put
the<00:01:32.280> black<00:01:32.580> from<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.149> bright<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> red

the black from the bright with the red
so<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.289> and<00:01:34.759> then<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.270> ground<00:01:36.899> wire<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
so you're and then this ground wire you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
so you're and then this ground wire you
don't<00:01:37.560> need<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.039> one<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:39.060> long<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> leave

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
one ground wire already hooked up to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.130 
one ground wire already hooked up to
your<00:01:41.729> dim<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.299> you're<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.539> not

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
leave that ground wire hooked up this

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.800 
leave that ground wire hooked up this
one<00:01:48.179> right<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.909> cut<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.360> blue<00:01:51.569> one

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
one right here and you cut the blue one

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
one right here and you cut the blue one
and<00:01:52.429> reconnect<00:01:53.429> it<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.090> red<00:01:54.330> from<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
and reconnect it with the red from the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.809 
and reconnect it with the red from the
bright<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.440> then<00:01:55.560> connect<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.160> red<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
bright and then connect the red to the

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.850 
bright and then connect the red to the
ground<00:01:57.179> from<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.569> bright<00:01:57.929> that's<00:01:58.349> how<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.619> do

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
ground from the bright that's how you do

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.609 
ground from the bright that's how you do
that<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.239> get<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.629> switch<00:02:01.379> on<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that and then you get this switch on the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.509 
that and then you get this switch on the
right<00:02:01.769> side<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> get<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.340> because

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:05.519 
right side then you get this because

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:07.160 
right side then you get this because
normally<00:02:05.970> all<00:02:06.179> four<00:02:06.479> lights<00:02:06.720> are<00:02:06.869> come<00:02:07.019> on

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
normally all four lights are come on

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.499 
normally all four lights are come on
Clyde<00:02:07.440> turn<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.739> brights<00:02:07.979> okay<00:02:08.910> that's<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
Clyde turn on brights okay that's the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.150

ground wire from the from the bright the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.900 
ground wire from the from the bright the
headlight<00:02:59.420> put<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.690> red<00:03:01.020> okay

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
headlight put it to the red okay

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.330 
headlight put it to the red okay
you<00:03:03.570> cut<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.290> ground<00:03:04.620> off<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.190> just

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
you cut the ground off and you just

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.530 
you cut the ground off and you just
leave<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.730> hanging<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.420> not

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
leave it hanging like that it's not

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.570 
leave it hanging like that it's not
going<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.720> hurt<00:03:06.840> nothing<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.250> take<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
going to hurt nothing then you take the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.060 
going to hurt nothing then you take the
red<00:03:08.790> wire<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.210> you<00:03:09.270> hook<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.540> up<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> blue

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
red wire and you hook it up to the blue

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.590 
red wire and you hook it up to the blue
that<00:03:11.070> way<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.310> can<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:11.760> both<00:03:12.000> lights<00:03:12.300> working

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
that way you can get both lights working

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.420 
that way you can get both lights working
like<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.380> again<00:03:13.820> one<00:03:14.820> more<00:03:14.940> time

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
like this do it again one more time

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.710 
like this do it again one more time
bright<00:03:18.410> dim<00:03:19.580> okay<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.210> works<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.540> both

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
bright dim okay and it works as both

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.870 
bright dim okay and it works as both
sides<00:03:21.990> now<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:22.830> trick<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.250> you're<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.820> to

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
sides now the trick is you're going to

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.720 
sides now the trick is you're going to
do<00:03:24.060> one<00:03:24.530> headlight<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.100> other<00:03:26.280> one's<00:03:26.490> not

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
do one headlight and the other one's not

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.070 
do one headlight and the other one's not
going<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> act<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.270> same<00:03:27.420> way<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.690> have<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.870> do

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
going to act the same way you have to do

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.740 
going to act the same way you have to do
them<00:03:28.230> both<00:03:28.470> at<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.770> same<00:03:29.070> time<00:03:29.600> that's<00:03:30.600> what

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
them both at the same time that's what

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.150 
them both at the same time that's what
we<00:03:30.840> had<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.110> do<00:03:31.200> excited<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> take<00:03:31.770> this<00:03:31.890> piece

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
we had to do excited to take this piece

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.840 
we had to do excited to take this piece
of<00:03:32.340> apart<00:03:32.760> put<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:33.900> Brite<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.850> then

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
of apart put it on Brite and then

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.750 
of apart put it on Brite and then
put<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.090> on<00:03:36.120> dim<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.770> one<00:03:38.040> headlight<00:03:38.490> I'd

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
put it on dim so do one headlight I'd

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
put it on dim so do one headlight I'd
recommend<00:03:39.450> doing<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.780> past<00:03:39.990> in<00:03:40.170> your<00:03:40.200> life
