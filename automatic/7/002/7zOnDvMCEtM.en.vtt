Lego<00:02:10.259> walkie-talkie<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.280> least<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.849> would

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
Lego walkie-talkie at least I would

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.130 
Lego walkie-talkie at least I would
say<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.290> think<00:02:14.040> four<00:02:14.489> times<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.150> guy<00:02:15.360> once

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
say I think four times on this guy once

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.380 
say I think four times on this guy once
for<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.440> tracker<00:02:16.739> which<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.220> painted<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.819> screen

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
for the tracker which I painted a screen

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.309 
for the tracker which I painted a screen
on<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:19.340> bit<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.430> focus<00:02:23.510> there<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.959> have<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.200> get

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
on a bit to focus there you have to get

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.089 
on a bit to focus there you have to get
there<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.800> go

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
there we go

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.850 
there we go
but<00:02:27.000> yeah<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> painted<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.140> sanded<00:02:28.770> off

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
but yeah I painted that and sanded off

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.620 
but yeah I painted that and sanded off
the<00:02:28.980> side<00:02:29.160> cut<00:02:29.400> off<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.670> antenna<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.209> then

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the side cut off the antenna and then

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.800 
the side cut off the antenna and then
for<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> backlight<00:02:31.830> use<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.819> heat<00:02:33.390> formed

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
for the backlight use that heat formed

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.259 
for the backlight use that heat formed
this<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.860> antenna<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.880> painted<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269

end<00:02:36.390> white<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.840> heat<00:02:37.080> formed<00:02:37.470> cut<00:02:37.769> off<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
end white and heat formed cut off the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.830 
end white and heat formed cut off the
antenna<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.519> heat<00:02:39.060> formed<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
antenna and heat formed that to be the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.990 
antenna and heat formed that to be the
mic<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.920> helmet<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.400> actually<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.819> a

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
mic and the helmet is actually just a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720 
mic and the helmet is actually just a
red<00:02:42.360> random<00:02:42.900> Lego<00:02:43.349> helmet<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.580> would

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
red random Lego helmet that you would

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.880 
red random Lego helmet that you would
notice<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.269> then<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.810> cut<00:02:46.110> off<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.470> side<00:02:46.680> with

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
notice but then I cut off one side with

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.920 
notice but then I cut off one side with
the<00:02:46.920> wood<00:02:47.519> burner<00:02:47.760> there<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.450> an<00:02:48.540> exacto

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930

knife<00:02:49.140> actually<00:02:49.530> heated<00:02:50.340> exacto<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.030> then

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
knife actually heated exacto and then

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.479 
knife actually heated exacto and then
left<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.110> side<00:02:52.380> sanded<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> little<00:02:53.160> bit<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
left one side sanded a little bit and

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.400 
left one side sanded a little bit and
then<00:02:53.610> glued<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.569> used<00:02:55.140> another

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
then glued this on and used another

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.589 
then glued this on and used another
antenna<00:02:55.799> cut<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> little<00:02:56.880> bit<00:02:57.030> shorter<00:02:57.390> and

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
antenna cut it a little bit shorter and

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.930 
antenna cut it a little bit shorter and
used<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.799> camera<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> back

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
used it for the camera and on the back

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.610 
used it for the camera and on the back
if<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.269> look<00:03:00.480> closely<00:03:00.959> in<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> movie<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
if you look closely in the movie you

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.600 
if you look closely in the movie you
would<00:03:01.709> see<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:01.980> they<00:03:02.099> have<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> little<00:03:02.459> bit<00:03:02.580> of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
would see if they have a little bit of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.150 
would see if they have a little bit of
flap<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.500> piece<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.830> back<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.069> their

haven't made this guy a certain
character<00:04:17.310> yet<00:04:17.459> I've<00:04:17.639> thought<00:04:17.910> about<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.359> I

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
character yet I've thought about it I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.360 
character yet I've thought about it I
thought<00:04:18.720> about<00:04:19.380> Hix<00:04:19.709> when<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.010> was<00:04:20.160> creating

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
thought about Hix when I was creating

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.420 
thought about Hix when I was creating
him<00:04:21.080> or<00:04:22.080> Hudson<00:04:22.470> or<00:04:22.830> somebody<00:04:23.159> like<00:04:23.190> that

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
him or Hudson or somebody like that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.580 
him or Hudson or somebody like that
somebody<00:04:23.700> with<00:04:23.909> a<00:04:23.940> distinct<00:04:24.450> body<00:04:24.720> armor

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
somebody with a distinct body armor

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.310 
somebody with a distinct body armor
like<00:04:25.710> Hicks<00:04:25.949> has<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> heart<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:28.290> I

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
like Hicks has the heart and so I

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.230 
like Hicks has the heart and so I
thought<00:04:28.590> about<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:29.010> decided<00:04:29.490> not<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.730> for

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
thought about that I decided not to for

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480 
thought about that I decided not to for
now<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.990> know<00:04:31.080> who<00:04:31.290> knows<00:04:31.650> what<00:04:31.800> will

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
now but you know who knows what will

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.200 
now but you know who knows what will
happen<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.910> future

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
happen in the future

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.840 
happen in the future
was<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:34.889> really<00:04:35.130> wasn't<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.400> hard<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.729> come

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
was it really wasn't that hard to come

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.330 
was it really wasn't that hard to come
across<00:04:35.880> materials<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.320> there<00:04:37.919> may<00:04:38.040> be<00:04:38.070> another

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
across materials so there may be another

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.640 
across materials so there may be another
one<00:04:38.490> in<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.699> future<00:04:38.970> who<00:04:39.090> knows<00:04:39.270> but<00:04:40.080> the

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
one in the future who knows but the

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.409 
one in the future who knows but the
tracker<00:04:40.949> was<00:04:41.190> easy<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.550> make<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.150> just

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
tracker was easy to make and then I just

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.960 
tracker was easy to make and then I just
used<00:04:42.810> paint<00:04:43.139> marker<00:04:43.470> on<00:04:43.650> his<00:04:43.800> shoes<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.880> make

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
used paint marker on his shoes to make

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.780 
used paint marker on his shoes to make
the<00:04:45.120> black<00:04:45.360> around<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.620> really<00:04:47.490> wasn't<00:04:47.639> that

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
the black around and really wasn't that

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.140 
the black around and really wasn't that
hard<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:49.130> that's<00:04:50.130> pretty<00:04:50.250> much<00:04:50.340> for<00:04:50.699> the<00:04:50.940> base

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
hard and that's pretty much for the base

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.500 
hard and that's pretty much for the base
of<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.449> bead<00:04:51.630> but<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.770> pulse<00:04:53.010> rifle<00:04:53.510> applaud
