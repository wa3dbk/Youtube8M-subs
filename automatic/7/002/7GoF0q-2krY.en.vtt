macronutrient ratio if for instance you
take<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.649> banana<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.510> you<00:01:03.510> take<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> sugar<00:01:04.260> out

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
take a banana and you take the sugar out

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.830 
take a banana and you take the sugar out
of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.010> banana<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:06.330> consume<00:01:06.720> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
of the banana and then consume that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
of the banana and then consume that
sugar<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.740> negative<00:01:07.979> effects<00:01:08.460> but

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
sugar it can have negative effects but

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.399 
sugar it can have negative effects but
if<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.030> consume<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> banana<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:10.049> has<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
if you consume the banana which has the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
if you consume the banana which has the
exact<00:01:10.860> same<00:01:10.979> amount<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.580> sugar<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
exact same amount of sugar it's going to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.270 
exact same amount of sugar it's going to
have<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.350> different<00:01:13.560> effect<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> body

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
have a very different effect on the body

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
have a very different effect on the body
because<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:16.400> holistic<00:01:17.570> mechanism<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because of the holistic mechanism that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
because of the holistic mechanism that
that<00:01:18.869> banana<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.460> many

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that banana is there are so many

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.910 
that banana is there are so many

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that banana same with the avocado it's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.480 
that banana same with the avocado it's
not<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.400> fat<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> holistic<00:01:29.009> entity

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
not just fat it's a holistic entity

does to my body there's all kinds of
communication<00:02:37.560> going<00:02:37.740> on<00:02:37.920> between<00:02:38.180> fruit

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
communication going on between fruit

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.940

animals as well they actually help to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.260 
animals as well they actually help to
regulate<00:02:43.650> our<00:02:43.920> DNA<00:02:44.220> or<00:02:44.370> methylate<00:02:44.850> our<00:02:45.000> DNA<00:02:45.950> so

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
regulate our DNA or methylate our DNA so
