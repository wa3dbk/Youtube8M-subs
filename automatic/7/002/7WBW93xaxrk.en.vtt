00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
then obviously they're at sea

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.720

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
you could shoot across the map and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.680 
you could shoot across the map and
probably<00:02:19.290> kill<00:02:19.470> somebody<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.569> now<00:02:21.569> you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
probably kill somebody at a now you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.199 
might have some fast runners on your
team<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.080> go<00:02:25.080> past<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.650> plate<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
team that go past the plate and the you

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.550 
team that go past the plate and the you
know<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> choke<00:02:27.780> point<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.230> probably

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
know like the choke point is probably

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.940 
know like the choke point is probably
the<00:02:28.709> helicopter<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:31.080> once<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.709> past

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the helicopter be and once you go past

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
the helicopter be and once you go past
be<00:02:33.230> then<00:02:34.230> they're<00:02:34.740> probably<00:02:34.770> going<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.459> be<00:02:35.700> at

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
be then they're probably going to be at

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.040 
be then they're probably going to be at
sea<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.590> they're<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.920> at<00:02:38.130> sea<00:02:39.050> then

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
sea so if they're not at sea then

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.470 
sea so if they're not at sea then
they're<00:02:40.380> at<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.780> really<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.890> simple

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
they're at a and really it's that simple

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.180 
they're at a and really it's that simple
so<00:02:45.480> basically<00:02:46.290> i'm<00:02:46.470> going<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.680> show<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.890> like

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so basically i'm going to show you like

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.630 
so basically i'm going to show you like
a<00:02:47.989> higher<00:02:48.989> version<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.010> then<00:02:50.519> i'm

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
a higher version of it and then i'm

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.800 
a higher version of it and then i'm
gonna<00:02:50.730> sit<00:02:50.910> down<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.090> i'm<00:02:51.360> going<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.570> show<00:02:51.780> you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
gonna sit down and i'm going to show you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.690 
gonna sit down and i'm going to show you
on<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.350> map<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.670> see<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.090> from<00:02:54.440> there

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
on a map so you can see it from there

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.330 
on a map so you can see it from there
see<00:02:56.700> here<00:02:57.150> above<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.410> map<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.130> see

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
see here above the map and you can see

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.300 
see here above the map and you can see
that<00:02:59.370> i'm<00:02:59.670> looking<00:02:59.880> over<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.600> B<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.019> C<00:03:01.310> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
that i'm looking over a B and C that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.960 
that i'm looking over a B and C that
simple

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.550 

so<00:03:08.970> let's<00:03:09.180> take<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.810> map<00:03:10.910> high<00:03:11.910> rise<00:03:12.410> now<00:03:13.410> I've

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
so let's take the map high rise now I've

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.240 
so let's take the map high rise now I've
already<00:03:13.680> shown<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.310> videos<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.740> you<00:03:16.740> get

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
already shown you the videos and you get

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.370 
already shown you the videos and you get
an<00:03:17.340> idea<00:03:17.459> where<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.270> went<00:03:18.420> over<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:20.190> fact<00:03:20.490> about

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.000 

the<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.410> B<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.010> C<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:27.120> got<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:28.190> B<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.490> C<00:03:30.740> now<00:03:31.740> in

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the a B and C you got a B and C now in

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.150 
the a B and C you got a B and C now in
this<00:03:32.190> map<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:35.190> only<00:03:35.340> spawn<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.940> juice<00:03:36.209> box<00:03:37.160> see

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
this map you only spawn a juice box see

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.720 
this map you only spawn a juice box see
an<00:03:38.750> A<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.940> C<00:03:42.350> smaller<00:03:43.350> maps<00:03:43.620> are<00:03:43.980> divided<00:03:44.489> into

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
an A and C smaller maps are divided into

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.150 
an A and C smaller maps are divided into
so<00:03:45.209> kind<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.019> visualize<00:03:46.380> there's<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.680> circle

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
so kind of visualize there's a circle

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.070 
so kind of visualize there's a circle
around<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.760> then<00:03:48.390> through<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> middle

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
around it and then through the middle

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.220 
around it and then through the middle
there's<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.680> line<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.510> helicopter<00:03:51.989> pad

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
there's a line just the helicopter pad

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.570 
there's a line just the helicopter pad
this<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.040> B<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.530> propane<00:03:56.280> tank

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
this is B and this is that propane tank

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.090 
this is B and this is that propane tank
that<00:03:56.760> everybody<00:03:57.120> blows<00:03:57.390> up<00:03:58.040> now<00:04:00.410> if<00:04:01.410> your<00:04:01.739> team

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
that everybody blows up now if your team

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.060 
that everybody blows up now if your team
is<00:04:03.080> going<00:04:04.080> from<00:04:04.790> C<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:07.500> your<00:04:07.650> most<00:04:07.920> of

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
is going from C to a and your most of

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.580 
is going from C to a and your most of
your<00:04:08.160> team<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.519> over<00:04:08.700> here<00:04:09.000> then<00:04:09.989> they're

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
your team is over here then they're

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.949 
your team is over here then they're
going<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.860> spot<00:04:11.100> over<00:04:11.370> here<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.540> know<00:04:12.810> that

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
going to spot over here so you know that

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.310 
going to spot over here so you know that
either<00:04:13.049> going<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.320> come<00:04:13.470> from<00:04:13.560> underground<00:04:15.320> or

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
either going to come from underground or

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.659 
either going to come from underground or
they're<00:04:17.220> going<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.400> come<00:04:17.640> this<00:04:18.540> way<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:20.489> it

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
they're going to come this way so it

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.060 
they're going to come this way so it
means<00:04:20.820> really<00:04:21.450> simple<00:04:21.900> on<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.530> type<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> map

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
means really simple on this type of map

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.890 
means really simple on this type of map
you<00:04:23.760> only<00:04:23.910> have<00:04:24.060> two<00:04:24.210> spots<00:04:24.510> where<00:04:24.690> they're

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
you only have two spots where they're

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.140 
you only have two spots where they're
going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.080> spawn

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.510 

now<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:29.540> showed<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.020> under<00:04:30.350> rail<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:33.460> mean<00:04:34.460> I
