very<00:01:35.220> beat<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:35.939> could<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.329> place<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
very beat so you could just place the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.929 
very beat so you could just place the
keyboard<00:01:37.020> mouse<00:01:37.200> directly<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.740> top<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.820> still

keyboard mouse directly on top but still

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
keyboard mouse directly on top but still
I<00:01:39.090> would<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> keep<00:01:39.810> working<00:01:39.990> mouse<00:01:40.259> tray

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

this<00:02:55.890> put<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.760> CPU<00:02:57.239> down<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> little

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
this put the CPU down here in a little

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.449 
this put the CPU down here in a little
box<00:02:58.260> then<00:02:59.069> put<00:02:59.310> these<00:02:59.569> little<00:03:00.890> wooden<00:03:01.890> cubes<00:03:02.250> I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
guess you can say make them a part of

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.780 
guess you can say make them a part of
the<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.319> don't<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.040> idea<00:03:05.220> but<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.640> can

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the I don't like that idea but you can

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.870 
the I don't like that idea but you can
put<00:03:05.940> them<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.299> instead<00:03:07.459> or<00:03:08.459> on<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.700> ride

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880

put them up here instead or on the ride
or<00:03:09.060> whatever<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.450> mean<00:03:09.599> you<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.989> could

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
or whatever I mean you can you could

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.190 
or whatever I mean you can you could

think it's a silly actually if anyone
knows<00:03:18.510> how<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.720> build<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.200> they<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.440> find<00:03:19.590> make

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
knows how to build it they can find make

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.650 
knows how to build it they can find make
some<00:03:19.890> serious<00:03:20.100> money<00:03:20.400> because<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.180> would
