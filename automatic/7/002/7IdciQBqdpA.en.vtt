in<00:00:46.260> my<00:00:46.289> system<00:00:46.489> then<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.730> down<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.989> drink

now my second MRI this was my brain

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.209 
now my second MRI this was my brain
before<00:00:53.280> caffeine<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:55.410> after<00:00:55.739> the

before caffeine this was after the

before caffeine this was after the
difference<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.329> remarkable<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
difference was remarkable it's like a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.310 
difference was remarkable it's like a
40%<00:00:59.699> drop<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.629> blood<00:01:00.870> flow<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.199> brain
