00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.540 
regardless I'm not winning the World Cup
so<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.510> opted<00:01:04.440> from<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.100> opinion<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> think

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
so I opted from from my opinion I think

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.490 
so I opted from from my opinion I think
he's<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> best<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.510> Ranade

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
he's the best but Ranade

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
he's the best but Ranade
needs<00:01:07.950> recognition<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.610> well<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.120> he's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
needs recognition as well because he's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.380 
needs recognition as well because he's
such<00:01:09.870> a<00:01:09.900> special<00:01:10.229> player<00:01:10.620> that<00:01:10.920> um

the best things in the world in Holland

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.139 
the best things in the world in Holland
so<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> occasion<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> fans<00:01:52.049> being<00:01:52.440> Brazil

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
so the occasion the fans being Brazil

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.490 
so the occasion the fans being Brazil
added<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> extra<00:01:54.360> spice<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.080> but

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
added that extra spice as well but

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.559 
added that extra spice as well but
they're<00:01:56.490> definitely<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.179> proudest

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
they're definitely one of my proudest

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.320 
they're definitely one of my proudest
moments<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.080> footballer<00:01:58.530> I<00:02:02.209> think<00:02:03.209> it's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
moments as a footballer I think it's

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.800 
moments as a footballer I think it's
really<00:02:03.539> difficult<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.259> feel<00:02:04.799> with<00:02:05.039> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
really difficult I feel with the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.109 
really difficult I feel with the
strategy<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.020> structure<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
strategy and the structure of the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.410 
strategy and the structure of the
payment<00:02:09.569> plan<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:10.380> restricts<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> MLS

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
payment plan really restricts the MLS

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.900 
payment plan really restricts the MLS
which<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.600> positive<00:02:13.049> in<00:02:13.230> itself<00:02:13.530> because<00:02:14.160> it

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
which is a positive in itself because it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.880 
which is a positive in itself because it
keeps<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.239> lot<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.750> American<00:02:16.230> talent<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.709> keeps

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
keeps a lot of American talent and keeps

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.910 
keeps a lot of American talent and keeps
the<00:02:17.040> growth<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:18.180> when<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> team<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:19.860> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the growth but when you have a team at a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.120 
the growth but when you have a team at a
