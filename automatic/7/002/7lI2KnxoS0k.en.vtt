think<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.750> return<00:02:52.020> was<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.620> was<00:02:53.040> really

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
think the return was really was really

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160 
think the return was really was really
good<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:53.550> they<00:02:53.670> need<00:02:53.850> scoring<00:02:54.270> off<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.870> bench

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.550 
good but they need scoring off the bench
to<00:02:55.500> give<00:02:56.460> them<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.970> lift<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.810> push<00:02:58.140> to

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
to give them that lift in that push to

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.010 
to give them that lift in that push to
really<00:02:59.160> make<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> run<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.660> regular<00:03:00.930> season

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
really make a run in the regular season

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.220 
really make a run in the regular season
but<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.410> make<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> run<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> postseason<00:03:03.230> but

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
but to make a run of the postseason but

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.630

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.880 
as of right now I think the Heat are
still<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> favorite<00:03:06.570> by<00:03:06.990> far<00:03:07.020> in<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> Eastern

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
Conference but really to be honest it

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.680 
Conference but really to be honest it
just<00:03:10.890> depends<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.250> how<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:12.210> Brooklyn<00:03:12.630> Nets
