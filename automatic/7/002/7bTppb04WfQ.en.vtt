makes the two corners of a cuboid if you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550 
makes the two corners of a cuboid if you
can<00:01:57.030> sort<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.270> imagine<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.259> covers

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
can sort of imagine that so that covers

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
can sort of imagine that so that covers
divide<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.240> there<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
divide to that and like was there this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.719 
divide to that and like was there this
will<00:02:00.780> cover<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> whole<00:02:01.320> thing<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.729> that's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
will cover this whole thing as that's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.389 
will cover this whole thing as that's
one<00:02:02.909> corner<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.299> cube<00:02:03.450> cute<00:02:04.200> q<00:02:05.009> cop

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
one corner of the cube cute q cop

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.069 
one corner of the cube cute q cop
that's<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:05.939> corner<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> cuboid<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
that's one corner of the cuboid and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.359 
that's one corner of the cuboid and
that's<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.619> other<00:02:07.770> corner<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.160> cube

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that's the other corner of the cube

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
that's the other corner of the cube
would

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
would

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.559

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
standing in relation to it so yeah if

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.240 
standing in relation to it so yeah if
you're<00:04:15.900> standing<00:04:16.139> in<00:04:16.349> front<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.680> something<00:04:16.950> it

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you're standing in front of something it

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.709 
you're standing in front of something it
will<00:04:17.310> copy<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.969> so<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:18.450> probably

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:18.719 
will copy like that so it's probably

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.509 
will copy like that so it's probably
easier<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.989> stand<00:04:19.229> in<00:04:19.380> front<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.769> but<00:04:20.340> yeah

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
easier to stand in front of it but yeah

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.550 
easier to stand in front of it but yeah
if<00:04:20.729> you're<00:04:21.150> standing<00:04:21.359> top<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.930> it

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
if you're standing top of it

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.700
