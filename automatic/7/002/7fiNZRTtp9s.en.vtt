00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
a more of a neutral tone which i think

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.569 
a more of a neutral tone which i think
is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.650> easier<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
is a little bit easier to do than that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580

burnt orange kind of color and that was

like this or a color like this because

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090 
like this or a color like this because
it<00:01:47.939> does<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> color<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> notch

it does take the color down just a notch

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069
