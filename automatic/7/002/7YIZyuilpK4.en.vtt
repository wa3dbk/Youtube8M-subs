 Evaluation that will have viewers non-fluorescent, which not convinced to see the evaluation of home butter murder of of whether this video 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.959
 Be careful 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:17.780
 This time it was written to this video 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:20.130
 We will introduce some of the comments that are believed to be supporters of Shibata 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.519
 Evidence Who steps on the diagnosis 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 There is a comment that has been written to deal with it 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:34.559
 It seems that there are a lot of people who express the name of the convict 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.800
 Meeting the same person to the next, which replied in writing image was 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.120
 Come on differently than the first comment 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.840
 It has become a claim here 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:49.930
 I understand that it was good for the person who can be lucky 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:53.199
 I can not think that there is another cause, or I can not say that it is absolutely not 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.180
 People who don't die for a while look for opportunities 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:00.110
 Day be said to die or miscellaneous and delivery person around is I think I was the starting point 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.870
 Ec want to change, etc. 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.210
 did 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:11.759
 As I wrote in this makeover , people who can not die for themselves are asking for a chance to die . 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:18.330
 I think that I was no longer wearing momentum that is suicide the dentist anymore star 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:20.860
 If it was not known, it might have been alive now The next is a comment from another person 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:27.940
 I do not read this all but 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:30.730
 First I do I is assertion of this man have the first two lines is inconsistent is bankrupt in Marmara suicide 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.670
 It is not written, though 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:40.210
 In the next line, it is reflected and written in the steaming about the turf striker six flow 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.880
 A lot of parts at one time are suicide acts 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.710
 Because 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:52.369
 At first I broke down with dexterity , so I don't really know how it is to be honest 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.780
 I did not have a reply button if I wanted to ask in detail 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.960
 I sent a message with this is the message I sent 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.870
 ã‚€ The usual six lap tatami mat 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.490
 Coletti Panty 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:09.479
 It is miscellaneous, what does Marmal mean if it is suicide? 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.770
 Change the ad and send a message so far 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.950
 There is no translation . 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:25.480
 It is this last two lines, but I understand that I want to fall into a shame, but I write on foot 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:29.349
 A result that I do is Kedomo there wrote a sentence at Ki There conclusion that has put through the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.790
 I think I think but as I was going crazy first to say 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:39.370
 It also does not have any transformation to the place of the now send it in well message 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.420
 If you look at the bag or something of this account , you don't have much love for it. 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.500
 That's why I felt like laughing to become a subakan 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.500

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.490
 Maybe I do not want to develop properly 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.510
