00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 the best selling racing game series of the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.290
 world is back on the asphalt after the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.269
 rather inglorious need for speed run 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.769
 electronic arts focuses on everything 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.000
 apparently after remakes 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.949
 past parts 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 he has great with hot pursuit 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.760
 worked and should now also with 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 a new edition of need for speed most 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.019
 wanted to work like a lot of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 original is still in the game and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.590
 how to settle as an open world game 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.179
 place for the single and multiplayer 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.179
 Mode makes us find out 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.399
 as in the original turns into need for 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 speed most wanted everything on the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.300
 blacklist the police way up too 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 so the most wanted of the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.160
 most wanted city ​​break 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 Why, because we can do it well 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.870
 wear as we were the 10 most wanted 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 to challenge drivers gradually and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.320
 to defeat 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.180
 we need strong replenishment over ps 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.890
 us to not think about that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 Greatest whiz are just here 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.079
 around 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.850
 we just have to find her close enough 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100
 drive a button and press 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.659
 we crouch in our new 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.280
 street cruiser money does not play any 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.650
 whether it is at 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.200
 theft or legal 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.430
 acquired huge fleet 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.619
 interested not the core are just 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.590
 just there the decent underground 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.670
 feeling of the original, however, gone 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.950
 instead, the developer studio lays 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 criterion more value on a stylish 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 Presentation and befitting 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.829
 splendid announcement videos of the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.829
 leisure train most wanted dare 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.729
 on 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.650
 very chic before we, however, against 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.270
 the top ten of the blacklist compete 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.229
 we must first have their 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.229
 earn respect 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 and the mirror in most wanted east 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.080
 point again points that you put into 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.330
 at every corner and for different 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.270
 gets actions like through lawn 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.830
 or cops frame comes great mass 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 however with good placements in 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.119
 the race and there is a whole of it 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.770
 there is a lot for every controllable car 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.660
 a handful of racing events with 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.700
 whom we gather speed friend and for 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.980
 good placements also still tuning parts 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110
 like nitro boost better or mature 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.970
 the like receive speed 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.040
 Increase the tuning necessary above all else 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.050
 difficult for the ravens academy 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.600
 the ki of the computer-controlled adversaries 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.660
 is never typical rubbery and 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.410
 always looks good around you 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.850
 the challenging ones are just the ones 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.310
 medium and heavy race but 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.170
 anyway, and sometimes even because frustig 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.360
 straight in long races is a later one 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.030
 often no longer catch takedown 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.830
 so does the fact that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.440
 it in the singleplayer mode of most wanted 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.959
 only a few modes are race against 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.459
 several opponents duels and flees from the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.140
 police as well as achieving one 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.959
 average speed 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.880
 bit against a revision of most 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.890
 wanted is the easy drive baptized 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.630
 selection menu a great invention, the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.579
 even make a main menu superfluous 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.290
 we reach that via the steering wheel 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.360
 selection menu out of which we free 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.010
 Played tuning parts and select cars 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.380
 can and points to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.329
 race event set the good idea 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.130
 but at least while running and 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.780
 chases because of the necessary 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.180
 do not really embrace it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.709
 What works us out of the easy drive 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.150
 menu is also missing out is the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.450
 direct comparability of 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.220
 different cards for haven is 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.400
 a good replacement for that as well 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.350
 drivable rockport from the original of 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.299
 2005 similar to paradise city the 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.870
 city on burnout paradise is levy 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.760
 versatile and big city 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.400
 The highway autobahn sneak paths 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.140
 a beach and everywhere 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.610
 possibilities to jump over ramps 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.620
 and doing some tricks 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.480
 for broken signs about there's 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.280
 again speed points are in comparison 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.620
 we paradise city but something 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.390
 Lively the numerous radars 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.400
 which are distributed throughout the city 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.290
 whoever wants content also wants a speed 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.480
 indicate where we are in speed 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.069
 comparison with friends are the bulls 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.319
 the radar devices call on the plan 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.400
 Strangely , we do not think so 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.560
 but very quickly in one 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.569
 chase once the police us 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.739
 sees lawn and get rid of them again 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.739
 is not that easy 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.139
 in multiplayer mode, this is decided 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.639
 full savings potential of most we wanted 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.100
 meet us with friends in the city 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.500
 rasen stalker moderately to the meeting point and 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.690
 contest a series of races and fun 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.090
 events there are no orderly 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.889
 start the game gives for the team race 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.840
 instead, suddenly just one 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.340
 goal before and all must have over the 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.340
 checkpoints rush there 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.630
 or there is a specific team 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.000
 number to produce takedown 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.650
 another very amusing game mode 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.510
 rush up to a house and the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:55.030
 most jump meters of all participants 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:05:00.970
 collect online flowers speed most 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:02.560
 wanted right on graphically is need for 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.000
 speed most wanted a punch the 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.040
 See licensed car models 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.790
 fantastic as well as the purely optical 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.790
 damage system 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.000
 The environment joins the good 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.740
 impression except for a few textor 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.330
 slip into the numerous 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.340
 Lighting effects complete the optical 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.020
 impression again from the only one 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.180
 disadvantage if you the loud sun the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.040
 next wall or the opponents I see 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.700
 one ends up as a scrap dice 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.680
 in the ditch 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.960
 the acoustics make the technical 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.760
 perfect impression the cry of the engines 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.530
 is authentic, especially in 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.090
 enjoy tunnels and also at 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.360
 soundtrack is something for every taste 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.360
 there 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.890
 a race still only this one 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.360
 impose a good plaster around 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.770
 to have fun online 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.900
 many of the modes have huge 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.610
 addiction offline in singleplayer 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.470
 Mode is need for speed most wanted 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.540
 very good but not outstanding 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.920
 racing game braked in the first line 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.810
 by contrast with that 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.580
 multiplayer mode hardly where the variety 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.410
 there and also a bit of the red 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.850
 lacking thread one fights oneself so through the 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.680
 events until you get the necessary points 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.510
 together, the next one has most wanted 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.440
 to compete and then play the same game 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.440
 again and again
