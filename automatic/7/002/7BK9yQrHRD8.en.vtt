00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:11.389
 Hello, do a review of the shower 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:18.050
 Chinese cabins ft 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:20.990
 crystal n 80 82 so here it is with us 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 back wall 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:34.309
 which is drawn in principle on the site so 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:41.570
 and crush not visicalc and then he himself later 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:50.730
 Here is such a bud Seat overlapping 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:58.829
 the valve there is well as they say Chinese 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:02.489
 then immediately visible that is sorry 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.379
 materials on everything save on the dish 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.200
 fluff and out of thicker 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:16.080
 i.e. the frame could have 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:19.650
 thieves better make acrylic thickness here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:29.670
 here at the top side of me tanos and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 millimeter four not so noisy fat 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.290
 the Chinese have come to terms with it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 Cubic dialysis I think something give 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.920
 you can do with it 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.630
 so that it is bolted, that is, it 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.630
 already delivered in this position 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:00.690
 will have all 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:05.110
 adjust thoroughly overflow 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.500
 drying plums we have as they say 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.270
 Installed in Chinese not evenly 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.290
 in the middle will have to reinstall 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.540
 to glue 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.370
 now why would they do it 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.150
 just leave yourself inside so this 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:28.530
 the upper part is like a lattice 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:33.910
 rain shower nozzles we have rubber 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.680
 this is a plastic rubber part there 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:46.170
 inside diode tape 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.170
 glow should i think okay from above 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:03:01.810
 somalika watering usual some there 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:06.830
 There is a switch in it . 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:12.970
 mana lik here we have a speaker here u 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.970
 we can view the fan from behind 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.810
 that's what we have behind 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:29.440
 the speaker itself is a computer fan 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:33.740
 the fan and this is the whole system we have 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.980
 so blender us brass principle 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.980
 OK 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.260
 these are these clamps here I do not inspire 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:53.110
 trust that is better than them too 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:53.880
 remake pray tighten the clamps such 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:03.850
 system 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:14.920
 we have a power supply unit 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:19.380
 rollers all sorts of tap poured water with us for 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.380
 shelves and awards here already pinned 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:37.650
 foot hose 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.240
 also on site 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:59.410
 changed for a sliding disk 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.919
 such a rug surface is still on 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.690
 skin 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.340
 pretty smooth rim a pity not 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.020
 the one at the back 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:14.950
 that is, everything is necessary here about the silicone case 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.560
 put the back wall otherwise everything will be 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:23.850
 flow for some reason did calm 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.850
 bumpers and front-rear for some reason no 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:37.479
 these nozzles we have for the back 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:40.020
 pretty good spinning under 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:45.330
 high angle 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.330
 rubber nozzles themselves 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.410
 we have a mixer handle 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:06:04.710
 there is an ordinary pen that we switch 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:04.710
 on the shower on the mixer and on the faucet radio 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:20.130
 usually the radio button is not all accepted 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.130
 the right 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.780
 the whole thing is worth today we bought for 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:39.310
 27900 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:47.560
 there is a little more expensive on sites and for 30 per 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:50.100
 32 here you are the whole review 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.100
 goodbye
