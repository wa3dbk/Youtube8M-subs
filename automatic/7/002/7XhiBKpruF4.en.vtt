00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.870
 lizunov lizunov and dig out 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.290
 Wanda I saw in different forms and were 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.260
 not bad were strange but well i 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.790
 the strangest is not a bad font 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.770
 interesting idea and rhyme from the bottom down 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.630
 there is an inscription minor mischief 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.460
 or to the bone but itâ€™s somehow 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 positioning and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.540
 the excuse of a toy that principle is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.790
 some dirty trick 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.510
 well now let's not be for you 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:44.760
 to put 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:48.180
 and show the very lizuna and so gram well 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.750
 something like this before us so young 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.890
 man you know it doesn't look like 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.270
 monster it looks like a bad 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.130
 made by monster 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.500
 because his eyes somehow see 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.250
 have moved what is this this nose this 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.489
 kind of why it is red and black that is why 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.049
 it is me no I don't know for sure 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.060
 there must have been something cool 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.200
 form watch ghosts or can 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.689
 be some kind of alien but this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.140
 painting she spoils everything just awful 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.870
 disgusting ugly and fu fu to some 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.820
 but hufu to here is not only painting 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.450
 fukuko here is what he is made of 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450
 gas stinks 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.040
 If it were not for this terrible painting, then 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.200
 maybe it would be fun if he did 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.930
 transparent then thought from green that's it 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.850
 cool trickster of view it's just on 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.890
 Green on Green's here that the substrate 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.380
 lizun himself attached and it seems that he 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.540
 once green so transparent 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 well and disgusting material to the touch 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.640
 Well, that is, bourbon in principle the idea 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.490
 interesting and fun can be something with him 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.700
 so come up with but here like a stinker 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.540
 gasoline and painting 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.530
 Well, somehow very nasty to the touch 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.209
 this stuff does its thing but how 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.470
 it is indecent food we have a story 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.150
 it turns out look a little bit though 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.650
 even the whole will be cool with someone 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:29.390
 say give five is a language i got it 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.700
 look like bizarre something like that 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.980
 karimov companies grow right together 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.330
 here it's just simply not written by all 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.070
 time confuses what is the right 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.420
 title 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.980
 tried to do something like nothing 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.239
 but so for me 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.760
 stink stinks and it is terrible Pokrovskaya well 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.950
 and here is to touch too terrible I 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.280
 I'll try maybe to do a review on 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.260
 lizun good so to speak but this pro 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.900
 worth a penny and basically for fun 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.450
 You can not so bad and he is not asleep 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.600

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.600
