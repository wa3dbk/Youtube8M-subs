fun<00:01:50.730> boom<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.300> this<00:01:51.510> all<00:01:51.720> over<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.020> road<00:01:52.200> not

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
fun boom all this all over the road not

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:21.400 
fun boom all this all over the road not
happening<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.430> time

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.310 

close<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.770> think<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.190> car<00:02:24.050> there's<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.110> lot

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
close but I think the car there's a lot

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.870 
close but I think the car there's a lot
of<00:02:25.440> curves<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> bikes<00:02:26.520> going<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.760> be

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
of curves here so the bikes going to be

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.220 
of curves here so the bikes going to be
leaning<00:02:27.120> over<00:02:27.330> he's<00:02:27.600> gonna<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.900> how<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:27.990> get<00:02:28.140> on

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
leaning over he's gonna be how to get on

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:37.010 
leaning over he's gonna be how to get on
the<00:02:28.350> power<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.920> easy<00:02:33.140> why<00:02:35.300> he'll<00:02:36.300> ever<00:02:36.480> put

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the power so easy why he'll ever put

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.750 
the power so easy why he'll ever put
speed<00:02:37.320> on<00:02:37.470> top<00:02:37.740> straight<00:02:38.070> bottom<00:02:38.370> straight

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
speed on top straight bottom straight

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180 
speed on top straight bottom straight
and<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.750> thought<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.320> want<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.980> try

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
and this to the thought I want to try

00:02:41.190 --> 00:05:20.459 
and this to the thought I want to try
and<00:02:41.310> waste<00:02:41.490> him

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.219 

so<00:05:21.469> I<00:05:21.529> come<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.889> end<00:05:21.979> of<00:05:22.039> the<00:05:22.129> day<00:05:22.279> and<00:05:23.229> well

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
so I come to the end of the day and well

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.929 
so I come to the end of the day and well
it's<00:05:24.439> been<00:05:24.619> pretty<00:05:24.830> close<00:05:25.099> I<00:05:25.339> must<00:05:25.520> admit<00:05:25.669> when

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939 
it's been pretty close I must admit when

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.059 
it's been pretty close I must admit when
they<00:05:26.059> rolled<00:05:26.270> it<00:05:26.389> out<00:05:26.559> and<00:05:27.559> Craig<00:05:27.800> went<00:05:27.979> out

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
they rolled it out and Craig went out

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.429 
they rolled it out and Craig went out
there<00:05:28.279> initially<00:05:28.719> he's<00:05:29.719> doing<00:05:29.929> 53

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 
there initially he's doing 53

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.989 
there initially he's doing 53
straightaway<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:30.889> thought<00:05:31.189> this<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.819> going<00:05:31.909> to

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:31.999 
straightaway I thought this is going to

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.409 
straightaway I thought this is going to
be<00:05:32.089> tricky

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
be tricky

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.820 
be tricky
initially<00:05:33.229> we're<00:05:33.349> going<00:05:33.469> to<00:05:33.529> use<00:05:33.619> the<00:05:33.709> whole

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
initially we're going to use the whole

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.199 
initially we're going to use the whole
teepee<00:05:34.099> circuit<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.639> was<00:05:34.759> confident<00:05:35.119> the

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:35.209 
teepee circuit and I was confident the

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.879 
teepee circuit and I was confident the
bike<00:05:35.419> down<00:05:35.719> the<00:05:35.749> straights<00:05:36.139> and<00:05:36.469> the<00:05:36.559> sweeping

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
bike down the straights and the sweeping

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.639 
bike down the straights and the sweeping
corners<00:05:37.279> without<00:05:38.029> the<00:05:38.270> edge<00:05:38.419> as<00:05:39.050> particularly

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:39.649 
corners without the edge as particularly

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:43.149 
corners without the edge as particularly
with<00:05:39.740> BMWs<00:05:40.279> traction<00:05:40.550> control<00:05:41.439> but<00:05:42.439> as<00:05:42.589> it<00:05:43.129> is

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
with BMWs traction control but as it is

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.959
