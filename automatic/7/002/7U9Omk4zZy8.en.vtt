00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello dear sports fans with 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.930
 again you i dmitry x-fit and today i 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.690
 I want to continue the exercise with you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.920
 at home and today show you how to rock 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.150
 at home hands or rather triceps us today 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.890
 you will need a dumbbell best 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 so she was collapsible to her 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.269
 there was a weight of 5 there and up to 20 kilograms and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.130
 above 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.660
 so you can swing big hands in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 home conditions without resorting to 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.309
 the gym what exercise will be 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
 exercises are called as many already 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.219
 know the french dumbbell press with 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 one dumbbell and I'll tell you how to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.570
 technically how to technically do 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.149
 right and at what angles can 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.860
 do 30 so that you have more triceps 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.170
 and the load was on not meet on 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 average to middle part and up 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.789
 triceps so you get completely 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 load on the whole triceps first 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 exercise can be said at one angle 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.090
 it is horizontal you should lie down take 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.979
 dumbbell 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.630
 bring out your elbow to you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.280
 if you extracted horizontally so that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 you logot looked exactly up without 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
 no fluctuations here 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.750
 will only guys move forearm 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.750
 all took in such a way as a hammer and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.700
 raise is the easiest way to do 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.170
 This exercise elbow should not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.970
 walk just go get drunk all slowly 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.920
 raised 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 Home could not need it that the load 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.329
 you are constantly denied so that when 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.659
 straight when straightening your arms slightly 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.820
 the load can go off the triceps and this 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.000
 traumatic you must have 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.770
 voltage was lowered to 90 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.210
 degrees no longer do you need to allow 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 he understand 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.079
 lowered raised in the style of the triceps always 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.759
 should always be tense like 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.470
 increase the load on the triceps 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.750
 the best way i basically is 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.620
 as always do the downside you saw 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.830
 I already showed you the video how to make 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.820
 brush you need to rotate and headquarters palm 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.950
 I was looking to you to face here the same 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.050
 keep everything just along already there 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.460
 the most important thing not to drop on face 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.320
 it is this projectile once raised 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.450
 lowered raised 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.180
 dropped here harder even you already 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.220
 it's hard for me if you're afraid of dropping 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.370
 support and dumbbell support 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.660
 hand like that so she attacked you 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.600
 or at least protect your face raised 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.550
 lowered raised lowered guys load 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.650
 almost doubled 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.420
 Now I did this way not 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.209
 easy to do and when i turned so 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.580
 I started to brush a lot harder 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.840
 why because guys when turning 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.480
 brushes you basically so sue 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.610
 your forearm doesn't even help you not 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.800
 helps cause triceps and when you 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.390
 turn so here you brush 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.300
 forearm helps look how much 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.810
 here is meat and it is this part you are very 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.030
 helps a lot to guide 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.320
 forearm and thereby reduces the load 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.780
 from the triceps here is the best sea 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.910
 can say the position for the brush so 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.880
 do it all the time like that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.870
 will be external and internal and long 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.120
 head and outer head will be much 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.950
 I'll show you more now 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.380
 from different angles we still have two 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.170
 angle on what can be done french 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.420
 bench leave the second way to do 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.390
 french bench press see how 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.900
 i lay down and ice tilted but here we are 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.390
 also take mintel first try so 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.040
 as at first you showed it here 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.620
 diagonal 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.840
 understand see elbow could and also 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.750
 looking strictly years elbow looking at you 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:15.350
 strictly up all and raise the same time 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.350
 two times two 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:24.539
 1 forearm only work all here 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.090
 you are already 30 more stretched value load 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.669
 even more will be here for you 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.490
 you need guys have to lower the weight of dumbbells 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.379
 if you do horizontally you have weight 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.909
 the heaviest dumbbells should be if 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.669
 you tilt and make a little bit easier 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.650
 and at 90 degrees the lightest dumbbell 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:45.629
 should be so you do not get hurt 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:48.110
 thus the safest will be here too 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:55.939
 the most complicated in this way 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:59.219
 turned the brush hard if you have a brush 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:03.270
 when you exercise when you tilt 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:05.699
 tilt fails to bend completely 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.590
 then at least slightly ahead of this 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.979
 provisions here as much as possible 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.400
 turn the brush and do because in 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.240
 this is exactly the slope you will be hard 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.819
 make a brush turn out and completely that 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.069
 banks looked at the face that is, in the longer 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.449
 it becomes very difficult to make water 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.150
 a little bit at least brought 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:31.169
 already load change on guys and 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.990
 third exercise option then you 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.020
 will sit at a 90 degree angle 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.979
 here is the same just as well 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.589
 elbow looks strictly yo here you can 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.520
 here already in this situation turn 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:50.460
 so the elbow so that the elbow is from 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.430
 you also looked up to press 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.719
 you can even press your biceps down and 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.879
 raises all the same here yet 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.319
 more stretching triceps goes but here 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.000
 clear well you will need to 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.370
 lower you said not to 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.979
 get hurt don't damage log all 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:12.800
 again changed the position of the brush and 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:17.550
 understand here the action load 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.439
 awesome here I guarantee that 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.020
 more weight can not be done 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:25.529
 just very much load goes to 30 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.690
 so guys try the french press 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:30.590
 do as i showed you by quality by 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.560
 technique and i'm still you 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.510
 odessa views always make French 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.850
 press would love whatever you did with 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.550
 dumbbells barbell at home gym 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.710
 always do 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.260
 know at all angles how i do i 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.050
 I do everything I have one 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:52.160
 horizontal approach 2 tilted 3 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:55.550
 90 then liked 4 again 95 under 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.070
 tilt and 6 I do horizontally and how 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.310
 I have enough grip at first 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.890
 always do a reverse grip because 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.650
 triceps is not tired yet i can stand 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.390
 I do the load at such an angle 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.970
 grip on such a reverse on such 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.700
 inverse in everything and immediately changing 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.040
 Grip on another case again for 90 s 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.450
 straight grip then tilted and 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.190
 horizontally everything i did six 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.800
 approaches I killed 30 myself 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.740
 here is the best set of exercises 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.080
 30 I consider it the base complex you 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.320
 should in principle do it after thrust 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.180
 times warmed up warmed up the thrust to the bottom 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.970
 triceps all proceed french 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.740
 I just shook my husband all the time 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.930
 all my life I downloaded in this way 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.180
 triceps and i have triceps can say 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.650
 grew so guys aspire 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.630
 train watch my 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.770
 workout subscribe to my channel 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.160
 Dmytro Fried was with you
