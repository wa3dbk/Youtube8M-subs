00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.700

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.430
 first time on the new information 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.620
 So far we already knew that the first 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.360
 map-pack includes new weapons and four 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.700
 new cards but what we do not yet 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.800
 knew how the whole mappack in the whole 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.300
 house and when it comes out at all 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.700
 and so on but that's what I'm telling you 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.220
 now in any case the name of the map 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.770

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.110

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.250

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.510
 mappacks release and so on 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.940
 it's also interesting to know, of course 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.070
 that there will not be only one weapon 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.620
 as we have two cards out there blackout 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.660

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.670
 dlc out with a new weapon 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.530
 In any case, it is in big so that it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.630
 again and again will give new weapons in 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.680

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.530

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.600
 I listed all the maps there 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.850
 then there is a question for you me 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.680
 would have liked to know what maps you 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.630

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.549

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.380
 if you like them so the maps the 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.150

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.550

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.750
 I'm very interested in that 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.450
 and then I would be interested 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.520
 whether you buy the mappacks individually 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.590
 first wait to be like the map 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.660
 if they are small and like you or 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.250
 whether you bought the season pass 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.470
 Maybe you'll buy yourself, too 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.390
 no mappacks and no team at all 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.740
 all this would interest me 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.810
 that's a bit too 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.580

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.330

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.340

 All this for my team, of course 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.530
 We also see each other for each case 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.050
