00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.889
 Year came to a new video of me for Ullrich 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.580
 and already was 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.299
 they did not want to have them there first time could 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 So it was slim first, many thanks for hundreds of subscribers 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.659
 that violently in life did not believe many thanks it will be on the next 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.230
 Album "Slave to the Rhythm" I'm not sure what I'm going to do 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.900
 but I already had some ideas 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.810
 has to hold out to see if I can put the searchers all 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.460
 seen here now in May own post a gang problem sees 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.530
 a local price advantage of docking with Luca at yet another long evening 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 the video at hole at hole one, and so on and so forth 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.690
 I get a lot of messages respectively 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.210
 to comments but also Averhoff is coming soon 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.150
 how that works and problem here but thank you very much though me 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.149
 I really look forward to hearing from you 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 Of course I try to answer everything but yesterday evening I am 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.759
 then 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.159
 Vote a fabric sample of the 1 you can from the one stopped 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.910
 to answer because Weichert Committee questions keeps repeating 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.670
 and that has been considered in the mach I'm doing now I hope you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 Video 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.950
 and answers the question as one of the strongest or the most 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.500
 were made 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 graduated from Réver in the video here I told that in Parchim 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.100
 then the bag is simply overslept at the moment even one 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.120
 Day »and now here are all the comments 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.860
 So the most requested questions were 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.870
 what will stay good doing Hartwig 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.549
 I have a look at Wiemann 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.580
 that so 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.010
 Customers can 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.289
 and then I showed him on PEFC's page 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.489
 if we do not know exactly what you are doing well 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.220
 used to answer if that's easy 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.539
 No 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.169
 the Englishman is about to push this bus with these buttons 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.009
 to have 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:17.319
 because world you see if he is right or wrong because if tennis is that 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.499
 wrong booking was and an error you can see the whole 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.309
 do it again and then just go hunting 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.309
 and percent then it will work too 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.609
 what else was 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.889
 Now I want to do well but stay with me 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.619
 for smile bass pop 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:41.219
 Quite a quarter of an hour from there 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.249
 I do not know exactly how the phone took APA 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:49.529
 so it does not take him long to get shot so just despised patiently 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.189
 and then theoretically I should actually work 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.790
 here on the problem since one has loaded the distribution Wolter and 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:59.519
 so 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.040
 that shows us four point earned as a lorry zip file is unimportant 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.929
 the PSB of the 3 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:12.259
 which the DSW of the partially up to three euro it was a purposefully divided in 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.839
 double-click your zip file 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.740
 those with WinZip or percent 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.949
 seven times I believe it opened 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.319
 and percentages 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.419
 in it you can export the file and then I had the 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:30.639
 Iro is 4 file on the desktop and could then move into the Epson profession 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.669
 yes, I was also pointed out 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.669
 is the impression and has four points 1 of Zenit that is you do not have to 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.269
 on 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.569
 4 2 2 Points 1 but then needed an older version of Hubert 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.059
 Food profession 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.129
 and i do not thank for it now i have the video was about this 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.509
 Region Asia-Pacific rotated by two points 1 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.129
 I can unload in the layman say 'I'm sorry' then you have to 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.939
 look for another video 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.620
 Here was the question that is 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.980
 additional hook nose hook can do it 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.559
 just because one has a 3g and in 3g 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:16.009
 is that yes 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.359
 sda wallpapers so these are mine 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.980
 on the homescreen also a pictorial not demanding that it is only black 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.430
 the multitasking so if you press the home button twice and then 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.610
 Stephan r can switch back and forth 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.740
 and the battery indicator is impotent above 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.210
 not available or ifo 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.200
 and you can do that with crises html so if you set these species 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.190
 So you have the full protest but I do not recommend it to you 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.240
 This will make iPhone pretty slow 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.469
 Year then the question was what it looks like you can get the sim card 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.499
 Rhine port must 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:56.869
 So «I did it so did not carry a sim card 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.440
 then I put the telecom in it I still have that powder north up 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.199
 made 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.160
 and then when smoking is served so all the active of our faith 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.969
 would have 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.989
 I then started my iPhone Flori and I have for the 

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:14.150
 sim card inserted 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.139
 To start over Speaking again fell not asked the SPD is considering he says or 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.490
 others say 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.880
 that means if a jailbreak is downside that you can see that 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.039
 every time you give it to Loeb 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.240
 to do it 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.499
 Wus after restarting the iPhone has restarted 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.409
 Before he started when he was set, that's what you do not care if you're on 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.180
 in Neustadt or not 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.220
 Dahlmann the iPhone like other states must have or dike made my 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.400
 iPhone restarted 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.169
 after powder lost attracted 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.679
 and then it is normal ramped up I would guess 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.309
 That's hot at Pisa 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.139
 Jailbreak I guess that of course means that something 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.590
 iPhone from time to time others can start and restart what I of course very much 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.189
 great team 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.060
 yes that was for van Miert 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.410
 The question of course, Boll also knows the video 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.389
 Post 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.060
 I think it's very nice that other people are already trying in other people 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.139
 to help have the problems 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.930
 Of course, I'm going to try a little bit now, too 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.940
 work through a bit 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.809
 to answer your questions 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:33.389
 but of course I submit this video first 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.800
 and yes, I'm just happy 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.949
 APA rating a field to be like even small I finally like it 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.919
 Yesterday we also had two out of 18 here 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.999
 7 award under this video also 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:53.389
 I'm also real for the 404 arguments 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.970
 I just have to give you something nice and 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.490
 soon there will be a demolition of the spö övp and spö I told him 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.180
 Of course, even though he never commented on why calls maybe even favor 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.889
 So this video will be back or show to your friends or 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.130
 of course, I have not made too much advertising for me now 

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:18.719
 That's why I just say cheesy until the next
