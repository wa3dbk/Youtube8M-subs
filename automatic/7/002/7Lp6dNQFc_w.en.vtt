inches<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:02.810> recommend<00:04:03.810> learning<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.230> shove<00:04:04.470> it

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
inches I recommend learning the shove it

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.560 
inches I recommend learning the shove it
first<00:04:04.890> because<00:04:05.550> it's<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.820> whole<00:04:06.000> lot<00:04:06.030> easier

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
first because it's a whole lot easier

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.200 
first because it's a whole lot easier
than<00:04:07.020> learning<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> pop<00:04:07.650> sugar<00:04:08.060> you'll<00:04:09.060> have

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
than learning the pop sugar you'll have

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.180 
than learning the pop sugar you'll have
to<00:04:09.360> jump<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.660> whole<00:04:09.810> lot<00:04:09.960> higher<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.890> do<00:04:11.070> the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
to jump a whole lot higher so do the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.100 
to jump a whole lot higher so do the
shove<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.550> first<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.120> once<00:04:12.690> you've<00:04:12.900> got<00:04:13.080> your

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
shove it first and once you've got your

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.540 
shove it first and once you've got your
Ollie's<00:04:13.560> up<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:13.890> become<00:04:14.130> more<00:04:14.160> comfortable

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
Ollie's up and become more comfortable

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.580 
Ollie's up and become more comfortable
with<00:04:14.850> shove-its<00:04:15.360> then<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.900> can<00:04:16.049> try<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.320> pop

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
with shove-its then you can try the pop

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.729 
with shove-its then you can try the pop
shove<00:04:16.830> it<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.600> many<00:04:18.750> common<00:04:19.080> mistakes<00:04:19.470> with<00:04:19.680> a

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
shove it so many common mistakes with a

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.910 
shove it so many common mistakes with a
pop<00:04:19.980> shuvit<00:04:20.280> are<00:04:20.520> landing<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.270> with<00:04:21.360> one<00:04:21.540> foot

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.970 

say<00:04:25.920> very<00:04:26.220> much<00:04:26.540> like<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.720> when<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.710> land<00:04:28.890> it

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
say very much like this when you land it

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.440 
say very much like this when you land it
with<00:04:29.100> one<00:04:29.250> foot<00:04:29.580> there's<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.940> couple<00:04:30.270> of

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
with one foot there's a couple of

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.150 
with one foot there's a couple of
problems<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.930> are<00:04:31.020> happening<00:04:31.140> number<00:04:31.980> one

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
problems that are happening number one

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.260 
problems that are happening number one
is<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.580> don't<00:04:32.730> have<00:04:32.820> enough<00:04:33.030> confidence

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
is that you don't have enough confidence

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.030 
is that you don't have enough confidence
to<00:04:33.720> get<00:04:33.840> up<00:04:34.020> in<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.200> air<00:04:35.810> long<00:04:36.810> enough<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:37.920> have

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
to get up in the air long enough to have

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.780 
to get up in the air long enough to have
the<00:04:38.250> board<00:04:38.430> turn<00:04:38.670> around<00:04:38.910> on<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:40.100> so<00:04:41.100> jump<00:04:41.700> a

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
the board turn around on you so jump a

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.580 
the board turn around on you so jump a
little<00:04:41.880> bit<00:04:42.030> higher<00:04:42.120> next<00:04:42.660> time<00:04:42.900> when<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.470> do

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
little bit higher next time when you do

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.890 
little bit higher next time when you do
the<00:04:43.710> pop<00:04:43.890> shove<00:04:44.130> it<00:04:44.280> also<00:04:44.610> when<00:04:45.420> your<00:04:45.540> board<00:04:45.750> is

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
the pop shove it also when your board is

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.560 
the pop shove it also when your board is
in<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.080> air<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.260> want<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:46.800> looking<00:04:47.130> down

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
in the air you want to be looking down

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.970 
in the air you want to be looking down
and<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.630> want<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.990> make<00:04:49.110> sure<00:04:49.140> that<00:04:49.590> your<00:04:49.770> feet

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
and you want to make sure that your feet

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.940 
and you want to make sure that your feet
are<00:04:50.040> coming<00:04:51.030> over<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.450> bolts<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.770> want

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
are coming over the bolts and you want

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.950 
are coming over the bolts and you want
to<00:04:53.010> be<00:04:53.070> aiming<00:04:53.340> for<00:04:53.520> those<00:04:53.820> bolts<00:04:54.210> as<00:04:54.390> it's<00:04:54.870> in

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
to be aiming for those bolts as it's in

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.810 
to be aiming for those bolts as it's in
the<00:04:55.050> air<00:04:55.260> if<00:04:55.500> you're<00:04:56.070> not<00:04:56.220> aiming<00:04:56.460> for<00:04:56.640> the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
the air if you're not aiming for the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.850 
the air if you're not aiming for the
bolts<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.270> just<00:04:57.750> aimlessly<00:04:57.960> throwing<00:04:58.740> it

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
bolts and just aimlessly throwing it

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.590 
bolts and just aimlessly throwing it
within<00:04:59.070> your<00:04:59.280> board<00:04:59.460> around<00:04:59.670> yeah<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.480> going

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
within your board around yeah it's going

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.060 
within your board around yeah it's going
to<00:05:00.660> be<00:05:00.750> pretty<00:05:00.990> difficult<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:01.500> catch<00:05:03.710> so<00:05:04.710> shove

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
to be pretty difficult to catch so shove

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.520 
to be pretty difficult to catch so shove
it<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.340> pretty<00:05:05.670> consistent<00:05:06.090> trick<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:07.380> you

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
it is a pretty consistent trick that you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.890 
it is a pretty consistent trick that you
can<00:05:07.740> do<00:05:07.950> once<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.430> get<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.670> down<00:05:08.790> it's<00:05:09.720> not<00:05:09.840> a

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
can do once you get it down it's not a

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.460 
can do once you get it down it's not a
very<00:05:10.170> difficult<00:05:10.380> trick<00:05:10.890> some<00:05:11.820> people<00:05:12.470> then

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
very difficult trick some people then

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.530 
very difficult trick some people then
move<00:05:13.770> on<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:14.010> kick<00:05:14.280> flips<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.580> heel<00:05:14.790> flips<00:05:15.090> now

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
move on to kick flips and heel flips now

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.670 
move on to kick flips and heel flips now
those<00:05:15.720> are<00:05:15.870> difficult<00:05:16.020> tricks<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.650> learn

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
those are difficult tricks to learn

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.800 
those are difficult tricks to learn
every<00:05:17.010> try<00:05:17.250> once<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.090> learn<00:05:18.270> how<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.480> do<00:05:18.660> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
every try once you learn how to do the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.990 
every try once you learn how to do the
push<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:20.160> can<00:05:20.340> pretty<00:05:20.550> much<00:05:20.640> do<00:05:20.970> it

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
push of it you can pretty much do it

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.210 
push of it you can pretty much do it
every<00:05:21.270> every<00:05:21.540> fundamental<00:05:22.050> water

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.680 

once<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.370> learn<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.670> shoving<00:05:27.030> on<00:05:27.090> flat<00:05:27.420> you

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
once you learn the shoving on flat you

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.870 
once you learn the shoving on flat you
can<00:05:27.870> do<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.080> off<00:05:28.230> curbs<00:05:28.620> over<00:05:29.040> stairs<00:05:29.370> over

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
can do it off curbs over stairs over

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.640 
can do it off curbs over stairs over
gaps<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:31.590> can<00:05:31.710> do<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.890> fakie<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:37.500> can

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
gaps and you can do it fakie and you can

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.480 
gaps and you can do it fakie and you can
also<00:05:37.850> add<00:05:38.850> it<00:05:39.150> into<00:05:39.500> combinations<00:05:40.500> like<00:05:40.770> fakie

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
also add it into combinations like fakie

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.000 
also add it into combinations like fakie
big<00:05:41.730> spins<00:05:42.090> and<00:05:42.390> nollie<00:05:42.600> pop<00:05:43.110> shove-its<00:05:43.680> I'll

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
big spins and nollie pop shove-its I'll

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:51.650 
big spins and nollie pop shove-its I'll
show<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.370> nollie<00:05:44.640> shove-it<00:05:50.330> and<00:05:51.330> I'll<00:05:51.480> show

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
show you a nollie shove-it and I'll show

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.540 
show you a nollie shove-it and I'll show
you<00:05:51.690> a<00:05:51.780> fakie<00:05:52.080> show<00:05:55.160> so<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.280> difference

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
you a fakie show so the difference

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.810 
you a fakie show so the difference
between<00:05:56.580> ollie<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.120> fakie<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:58.580> Knollys<00:05:59.580> are

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
between ollie to fakie is Knollys are

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.150 
between ollie to fakie is Knollys are
going<00:06:00.090> in<00:06:00.360> regular<00:06:00.870> direction<00:06:01.380> so<00:06:01.950> if<00:06:02.010> you're

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
going in regular direction so if you're

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.360 
going in regular direction so if you're
pushing<00:06:02.570> you<00:06:03.570> can<00:06:03.780> off<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.020> nose<00:06:04.190> that's<00:06:05.190> a

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
pushing you can off the nose that's a

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.910 
pushing you can off the nose that's a
knowledge<00:06:05.730> show<00:06:06.350> if<00:06:07.350> you<00:06:07.560> push<00:06:07.770> yourself
