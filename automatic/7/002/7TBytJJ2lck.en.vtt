00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that I can grip very comfortably in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
that I can grip very comfortably in
three<00:01:12.270> different<00:01:12.479> ways<00:01:12.660> i<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.170> fingertip

three different ways i can fingertip

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.120 
three different ways i can fingertip
grip<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.040> i<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.580> claw<00:01:14.850> grip<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.300> in<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> i<00:01:16.740> can

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
grip it i can claw grip it in and i can

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.060 
grip it i can claw grip it in and i can
also<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.940> it<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.840> palm<00:01:19.110> grip<00:01:19.350> although<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
also use it in a palm grip although that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.249 
also use it in a palm grip although that
is<00:01:20.190> not<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> optimal<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.690> hold<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
is not the optimal way to hold this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.430 
is not the optimal way to hold this
mouse<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.800> was<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.940> expected<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.869> sense<00:01:25.290> of

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
mouse as was to be expected the sense of

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.550 
mouse as was to be expected the sense of
performance<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.280> mouse<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.700> excellent<00:01:27.560> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
performance of the mouse is excellent it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
performance of the mouse is excellent it
uses<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.920> best<00:01:29.160> sensor<00:01:29.580> currently<00:01:29.910> available

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
uses the best sensor currently available

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.560 
uses the best sensor currently available
so<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.780> should<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.619> no-brainer<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so that should be a no-brainer it can

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.870 
so that should be a no-brainer it can
easily<00:01:34.020> track<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> 6<00:01:34.920> meters<00:01:35.100> per<00:01:35.460> second

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
easily track up to 6 meters per second

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.630 
easily track up to 6 meters per second
probably<00:01:36.810> even<00:01:36.960> higher<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.860> i<00:01:38.369> doubt<00:01:38.580> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
probably even higher but i doubt that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.669 
probably even higher but i doubt that
anybody<00:01:39.240> would<00:01:39.420> ever<00:01:39.479> reach<00:01:39.900> speeds<00:01:40.410> like

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
anybody would ever reach speeds like

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.430 
anybody would ever reach speeds like
that<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.220> game<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.390> also<00:01:42.569> be<00:01:42.690> tuned<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.319> the

which<00:02:34.140> might<00:02:34.560> be<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.709> downside<00:02:34.920> if<00:02:35.370> you're<00:02:35.550> a

which might be a downside if you're a

which might be a downside if you're a
left-handed<00:02:36.209> user<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.560> an

left-handed user so this is an

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.620 
left-handed user so this is an
ambidextrous<00:02:38.099> shape<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.209> really<00:02:39.510> only

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
mouse is the same as the g502 so it's a
