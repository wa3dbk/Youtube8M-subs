00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
little twisting then the second design

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.940 
little twisting then the second design
is<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> seaplane<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.379> pretty<00:00:43.649> cool<00:00:43.890> i

is a seaplane it's also pretty cool i

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.529 
is a seaplane it's also pretty cool i
haven't<00:00:44.250> built<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> yet<00:00:44.579> i'll<00:00:45.120> make<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
haven't built it yet i'll make the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.860 
haven't built it yet i'll make the
second<00:00:45.899> review<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:47.930> use<00:00:48.930> point<00:00:50.870> comes

second review of that use point comes

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.000 
second review of that use point comes
with<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.590> winch

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.030 

um<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.910> still<00:01:00.330> flock<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.260> doesn't<00:01:01.710> come<00:01:01.860> it

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
um this still flock here doesn't come it

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.650 
um this still flock here doesn't come it
doesn't<00:01:02.130> come<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.489> history<00:01:02.970> I'll<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
doesn't come with history I'll put it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't come with history I'll put it
back<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.730> the<00:01:05.850> very<00:01:06.030> long<00:01:06.270> range<00:01:06.570> actually

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
back and so the very long range actually

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
back and so the very long range actually
I'm<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.410> pull<00:01:07.620> it<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:10.370> for<00:01:11.370> a<00:01:11.400> long

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I'm just going to pull it up for a long

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
I'm just going to pull it up for a long
Lynch<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:12.180> can't<00:01:12.750> put<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:12.960> back<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:15.720> house

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
Lynch I can't put it back and in house

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.700 
Lynch I can't put it back and in house
of<00:01:16.290> automated<00:01:16.860> rotors<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:19.170> twist<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
of automated rotors just twist this

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.890 
of automated rotors just twist this
little<00:01:20.070> rudder<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.940> thing<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.390> also<00:01:21.720> i

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
little rudder little thing I here also i

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
little rudder little thing I here also i
use<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.440> test<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.800> winch<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.820> twist

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
use this to test the winch you twist

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.370 
use this to test the winch you twist
this<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.200> moves<00:01:25.410> both<00:01:26.810> rudders<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.050> think

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
this and it moves both rudders I think

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.010 
this and it moves both rudders I think
and<00:01:29.899> didn't<00:01:30.899> move<00:01:31.440> pretty<00:01:31.649> fast<00:01:32.660> it<00:01:33.660> doesn't

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and didn't move pretty fast it doesn't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.820 
and didn't move pretty fast it doesn't
use<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:34.860> unique<00:01:35.040> design<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.180> move<00:01:36.330> it

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
use a really unique design to move it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.440 
use a really unique design to move it
comes<00:01:37.830> pretty<00:01:38.190> hard<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
comes pretty hard to see but just a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.120 
comes pretty hard to see but just a
little<00:01:39.860> miss<00:01:40.860> gears<00:01:42.259> meets<00:01:43.259> when<00:01:43.530> i<00:01:43.560> sees<00:01:43.860> they

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
little miss gears meets when i sees they

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.590 
little miss gears meets when i sees they
could<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.700> there's<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.240> gear<00:01:45.479> right

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
could go better there's a gear right

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.880 
could go better there's a gear right
there<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.289> fun<00:01:48.440> out<00:01:51.440> with<00:01:52.440> pretty<00:01:52.770> much

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
there that's fun out with pretty much

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.340 
there that's fun out with pretty much
spins<00:01:53.280> other<00:01:53.729> gears<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.600> spins<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.020> rod

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
spins other gears and it spins this rod

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.930 
spins other gears and it spins this rod
right<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.789> which<00:01:56.789> in<00:01:57.030> turn<00:01:57.300> spin<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
right here which in turn spin to this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.850 
right here which in turn spin to this
and<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:01.640> caught<00:02:02.640> up

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
having trouble building it the reason is

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.560 
having trouble building it the reason is
that<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:16.090> little<00:02:16.420> pink<00:02:16.960> thing<00:02:18.870> right<00:02:19.870> here

that this little pink thing right here
and<00:02:23.100> you'll<00:02:24.100> notice<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> little<00:02:25.090> stick

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
and you'll notice as a little stick

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.540 
and you'll notice as a little stick
placed<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.140> stick<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:27.070> hard<00:02:27.220> to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
placed in stick and it's really hard to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.070 
placed in stick and it's really hard to
put<00:02:27.790> back<00:02:28.300> in<00:02:29.040> now<00:02:30.060> solve<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.420> got<00:02:31.630> twist

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
put back in now solve this you got twist

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.800 
put back in now solve this you got twist
and<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.940> put<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> little<00:02:34.090> pressure<00:02:34.270> i'm<00:02:34.630> just

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
and in put a little pressure i'm just

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.410 
and in put a little pressure i'm just
looking<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.650> twist<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.310> no<00:02:37.030> snap

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
looking it and just twist it in no snap

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.600 
looking it and just twist it in no snap
right<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:39.370> snap<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.760> back<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.310> you're

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
right in and snap it back on and you're

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.680 
right in and snap it back on and you're
set<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.000> go<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:45.370> pretty<00:02:45.580> cool<00:02:45.730> um<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.360> kind<00:02:46.540> of

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
set to go it's pretty cool um it kind of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.070 
set to go it's pretty cool um it kind of
absolute<00:02:47.020> least<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.260> little<00:02:47.380> adjustable<00:02:47.890> seats
