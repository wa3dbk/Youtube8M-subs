00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
so there were some interesting news that

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.640 
so there were some interesting news that
came<00:00:02.730> out<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.090> week<00:00:03.149> about<00:00:03.480> Spinosaurus<00:00:04.440> and

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
came out this week about Spinosaurus and

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.249 
came out this week about Spinosaurus and
I<00:00:05.069> just<00:00:05.759> felt<00:00:06.089> like<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.420> had<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.690> talk<00:00:06.839> about<00:00:07.020> it

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
I just felt like I had to talk about it

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.290 
I just felt like I had to talk about it
because<00:00:07.529> it<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.830> big<00:00:08.130> deal<00:00:08.400> basically<00:00:08.880> from

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
because it is a big deal basically from

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.330 
because it is a big deal basically from
what<00:00:09.480> I've<00:00:09.630> read<00:00:09.780> National<00:00:10.349> Geographic<00:00:10.679> are

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
what I've read National Geographic are

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.959 
what I've read National Geographic are
we<00:00:11.700> constructing<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.719> new<00:00:12.920> version<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:14.519> what

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
we constructing a new version are what

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.890 
we constructing a new version are what
Spinosaurus<00:00:15.870> looks<00:00:16.230> like<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.180> it's<00:00:18.180> really

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
Spinosaurus looks like and it's really

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840 
Spinosaurus looks like and it's really
odd<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.189> expect<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
odd it's not what you would expect the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.840 
odd it's not what you would expect the
sail<00:00:21.060> dips<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.470> center<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> also<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
sail dips in in the center and also the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
sail dips in in the center and also the
legs<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.810> shorter<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.070> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
legs are a lot shorter than what you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950 
legs are a lot shorter than what you
would<00:00:26.279> expect<00:00:26.820> now<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> read<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
would expect now from what I read it

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.210 
would expect now from what I read it
seems<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.349> Spinosaurus

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
seems that Spinosaurus

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
seems that Spinosaurus
wasn't<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> bipedal<00:00:30.390> animal<00:00:31.380> but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
wasn't actually a bipedal animal but

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.860 
wasn't actually a bipedal animal but
instead<00:00:32.040> spent<00:00:32.430> most<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.730> its<00:00:32.880> time<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.510> four

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
instead spent most of its time on four

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.040 
instead spent most of its time on four
limbs<00:00:34.260> which<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.489> really<00:00:36.090> weird<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.809> since

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
limbs which is really weird but since

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
limbs which is really weird but since
the<00:00:37.200> evidence<00:00:37.469> over<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> years<00:00:38.129> has<00:00:38.280> been

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the evidence over the years has been

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.160 
the evidence over the years has been
building<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.719> aquatic

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
building up that this is of aquatic

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950 
building up that this is of aquatic
animal<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> makes<00:00:41.910> sense<00:00:42.180> now<00:00:42.780> we'll

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
animal it kind of makes sense now we'll

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.779 
animal it kind of makes sense now we'll
have<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> wait<00:00:43.410> until<00:00:43.590> more<00:00:43.980> stuff<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.579> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
have to wait until more stuff about this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
have to wait until more stuff about this
is<00:00:44.969> released<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.539> find<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.899> what's<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.469> on

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is released to find out what's going on

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.880 
is released to find out what's going on
here<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:48.180> looks<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.899> material<00:00:49.680> has

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
here but it looks like more material has

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
here but it looks like more material has
been<00:00:50.160> found<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.700> Spinosaurus<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> that

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
been found from Spinosaurus and that

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
been found from Spinosaurus and that
other<00:00:52.620> specimens<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.489> been

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
other specimens that have been

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
other specimens that have been
discovered<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.270> been<00:00:54.480> researched<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
discovered have been researched and it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.729 
discovered have been researched and it's
building<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.610> new<00:00:57.059> picture<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.230> what

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
building up to this new picture of what

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
building up to this new picture of what
Spinosaurus<00:00:59.609> actually<00:01:00.090> looked<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.390> which

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
Spinosaurus actually looked like which

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
Spinosaurus actually looked like which
is<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> weirdest<00:01:02.760> thing<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.660> could

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
is just the weirdest thing you could

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
is just the weirdest thing you could
ever<00:01:04.049> expect<00:01:04.650> we'll<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.700> wait<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.090> see

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
ever expect we'll have to wait and see

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.710 
ever expect we'll have to wait and see
if<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.229> most<00:01:07.439> accurate<00:01:07.710> view<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
if this is the most accurate view of

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
if this is the most accurate view of
Spinosaurus<00:01:09.720> we've<00:01:09.900> ever<00:01:10.049> had<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.820> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
Spinosaurus we've ever had but if it is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030 
Spinosaurus we've ever had but if it is
it<00:01:12.390> means<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> image<00:01:13.260> we've<00:01:13.650> had<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it means that the image we've had in

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.120 
it means that the image we've had in
Jurassic<00:01:14.549> Park<00:01:14.580> free<00:01:15.259> primeval<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.740> planet

Jurassic Park free primeval and planet

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.320 
Jurassic Park free primeval and planet
dinosaur<00:01:17.930> hasn't<00:01:18.930> been<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.330> that's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
dinosaur hasn't been right and that's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.170 
dinosaur hasn't been right and that's
just<00:01:22.189> amazing<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.790> lot<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
just amazing there are a lot of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.210 
just amazing there are a lot of
Spinosaurus<00:01:25.020> fans<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.439> there<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.799> could<00:01:26.189> be

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
Spinosaurus fans out there that could be

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.730 
Spinosaurus fans out there that could be
upset<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.119> news<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.259> always<00:01:28.439> think

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
upset by this news and I always think

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.580 
upset by this news and I always think
it's<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.159> risky<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.990> become<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> fan<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's a little risky to become a fan of a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.289 
it's a little risky to become a fan of a
dinosaur<00:01:32.189> where<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
dinosaur where we we don't know that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
dinosaur where we we don't know that
much<00:01:33.689> from<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.350> only<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> tiny

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
much from it or we only have a tiny

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
much from it or we only have a tiny
little<00:01:35.310> amount<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:37.110> bound

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
little amount of it because it's bound

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.069 
little amount of it because it's bound
to<00:01:37.680> change<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.549> start<00:01:38.880> finding<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.659> stuff

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to change as we start finding more stuff

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.649 
to change as we start finding more stuff
I<00:01:40.290> mean<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.920> look<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.159> Dino<00:01:41.430> Kairos<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.299> not

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I mean just look at Dino Kairos I'm not

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.889 
I mean just look at Dino Kairos I'm not
trying<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.649> pee<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:44.360> spinosaurus<00:01:45.360> Ponce<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
trying to pee off spinosaurus Ponce I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.679 
trying to pee off spinosaurus Ponce I

you can find out where I'm getting this
information<00:01:51.030> from<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.780> again<00:01:52.049> we'll<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
information from but again we'll have to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.319 
information from but again we'll have to
weigh<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.890> National<00:01:53.430> Geographic<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
weigh in to National Geographic and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
weigh in to National Geographic and
other<00:01:54.720> sources<00:01:55.049> start<00:01:55.530> releasing<00:01:55.799> them

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
other sources start releasing them

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.350 
other sources start releasing them
information<00:01:56.399> about<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.149> new

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
information about this new

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660 
information about this new
reconstruction<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.950> interesting

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
reconstruction but it is interesting

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.120 
reconstruction but it is interesting
that's<00:02:00.149> everything<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> really

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that's everything for now but I really

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.530 
that's everything for now but I really
felt<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.670> should<00:02:02.909> talk<00:02:03.060> about<00:02:03.299> this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
felt like I should talk about this

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929 
felt like I should talk about this
because<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.200> pretty<00:02:04.530> much<00:02:05.009> breaking<00:02:05.729> news

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
because it's pretty much breaking news

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.630 
because it's pretty much breaking news
in<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> world<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.659> dinosaurs<00:02:06.869> because<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in the world of dinosaurs because the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.790 
in the world of dinosaurs because the
the<00:02:09.149> image<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.629> Spinosaurus<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.440> we've<00:02:10.590> had

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the image of Spinosaurus like we've had

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
the image of Spinosaurus like we've had
for<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.550> many<00:02:11.760> years

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
for so many years

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.410 
for so many years
and<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.650> hear<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.550> wrong<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.330> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and then to hear that it's wrong on a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.790 
and then to hear that it's wrong on a
big<00:02:16.080> scale<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.950> massive<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.470> we'll<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
big scale is massive so we'll have to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.950 
big scale is massive so we'll have to
wait<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.100> see<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.540> putting<00:02:21.840> my

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
wait and see but I'm just putting my

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.290 
wait and see but I'm just putting my
thoughts<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:23.100> what<00:02:23.460> I've<00:02:23.580> heard<00:02:23.610> if

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
thoughts out there on what I've heard if

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.090 
thoughts out there on what I've heard if
the<00:02:24.480> new<00:02:24.660> V<00:02:24.840> construction<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.770> most

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
the new V construction is the most

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.490 
the new V construction is the most
accurate<00:02:26.490> then<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.170> makes<00:02:28.380> this

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
accurate then that just makes this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.040 
accurate then that just makes this
dinosaur<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:29.940> interesting<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:30.810> at<00:02:30.960> the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
dinosaur really interesting but at the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.710 
dinosaur really interesting but at the
same<00:02:31.230> time<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.790> might<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> little

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
same time it might be a little

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.650 
same time it might be a little
disappointing<00:02:34.440> as<00:02:34.590> well<00:02:34.940> because<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.630> know

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
disappointing as well because you know

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.590 
disappointing as well because you know
the<00:02:37.020> largest<00:02:37.380> theropod<00:02:37.950> dinosaur<00:02:38.550> ever<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the largest theropod dinosaur ever to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.970 
the largest theropod dinosaur ever to
live<00:02:40.250> was<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.520> crawling<00:02:41.790> around<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.540> water

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
live was just crawling around in water

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.770 
live was just crawling around in water
we'll<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.340> well<00:02:44.730> thanks<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.090> watching<00:02:45.510> and

we'll see well thanks for watching and
