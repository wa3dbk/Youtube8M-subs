00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
attention to detail whereas it might not

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160 
attention to detail whereas it might not

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
know they they weren't bright when you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
know they they weren't bright when you
can<00:01:39.390> break<00:01:39.600> down<00:01:39.630> skateboarding<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.950> can

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
can break down skateboarding and you can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
break down these little movements and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
break down these little movements and
what<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.290> look<00:01:43.500> good<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.640> know

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
what would look good and you know

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.389 
what would look good and you know
certain<00:01:45.299> ways<00:01:45.540> they<00:01:45.869> turn<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> line

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
certain ways they turn in like a line

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.389 
certain ways they turn in like a line
they'll<00:01:48.240> turn<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.740> turn<00:01:49.950> back

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
they'll turn one way and then turn back

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
they'll turn one way and then turn back
the<00:01:50.610> other<00:01:50.640> way<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.930> way

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the other way because they like the way

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.100 
the other way because they like the way
that<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.350> looks<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.270> skate<00:01:54.270> filmer<00:01:54.780> will

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
that that looks or the skate filmer will

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.910 
that that looks or the skate filmer will
film<00:01:55.470> things<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.210> skater<00:01:57.710> begins<00:01:58.710> in

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
film things so that the skater begins in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
film things so that the skater begins in
the<00:01:59.040> left<00:01:59.250> side<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> frame<00:01:59.850> weaves<00:02:00.600> on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the left side of the frame weaves on

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410 
the left side of the frame weaves on
like<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> opposite<00:02:02.880> side<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> frame

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
like on the opposite side of the frame

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.270 
like on the opposite side of the frame
and<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> next<00:02:04.590> clip<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:04.979> video

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and then the next clip in this video

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.639 
and then the next clip in this video
part<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:06.060> start<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.540> opposite<00:02:07.020> way<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
part will start the opposite way so that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.820 
part will start the opposite way so that
your<00:02:07.770> eyes<00:02:07.920> move<00:02:08.780> during<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> video<00:02:10.020> it's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
your eyes move during the video it's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.490 
your eyes move during the video it's
really<00:02:11.099> creative<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.440> we
