00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 create a miniature forest is one of 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.450
 the greatest pleasures enjoyed by the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.269
 amateur as soon as he has acquired a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.640
 little experience 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.279
 as for the crop it is convenient to choose 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.160
 species that lend themselves easily to 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.310
 live in a group and share a volume 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.860
 of limited land I do not advise you 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.989
 realize forests with mixed species 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.849
 sooner or later one of them will dominate 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.640
 to the rest on the other hand the demands 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.559
 of cultivation are not the same for all 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.660
 small groups should not have a 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.809
 even number of trees to prevent the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.000
 composition is artificial in this 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.550
 I show you a group of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.860
 pineapple glau conical houses bought in 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.579
 a nursery for little more than one euro each 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.710
 pencil and glauca plant does not exceed two 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.230
 meters natural and lends itself very well to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.270
 the pencil pruning already supports the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 very sunny exhibitions in exchange for 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.950
 be well watered as far as the soil 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.800
 it is indifferent is well both 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.350
 in acid soils as in calcareous 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.970
 does not require proper pruning 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.100
 that suppress the annoying branches and 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.290
 apply ligatures if necessary in 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.330
 How much to watering spray requires a 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.820
 abundant watering especially if the plant 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.190
 is in full sun with regard to 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.220
 subscriber I recommend adding powder 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.260
 Horn in the transplant or on the ground 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.630
 in spring I usually what I do 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.440
 is to always use organic fertilizer in balls 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.960
 put on the surface of the earth 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.300
 in spring you have to monitor the aphid 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.640
 that invades him in a short time in summer 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.010
 with strong heats treat 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.960
 preventively against the red spider that 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.640
 it is easily installed on the care 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.850
 also with the cochineal that sometimes 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.860
 also invades it in my opinion is a 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.230
 good small conifer easy to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.030
 get in all sizes turn on and 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.210
 Take shape easily by what you 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.580
 I recommend it to start this group 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.770
 of pifias has settled in this pot 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.980
 three years and I have not transplanted it yet 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.270
 I'm waiting for the time to come 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.429
 As you can see for very little money 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.570
 you can make a composition that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.570
 be pretty pretty
