00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the recent ones for the 1st country of the congress 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
 national executive power exactly 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 also asks directly the following to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.099
 people would be living a kind a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.950
 parliamentary white river in one country 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.310
 parameter embarrassed right because it has not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.710
 the decision of the people you speak half will be 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.170
 the champion is a species at that time a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.900
 kind of crisis of authority 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.720
 it is not only the parallel soil that is in the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 beginning and not only is one person more 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.700
 which would be more appropriate for executive 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.370
 injustice also its to say that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.559
 to see with some indecision on duty 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 time when our we have to 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.399
 being rethought is also not even there 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.620
 that over time this political system 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.620
 party was losing is the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.260
 credibility on the stage lose a belief 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.770
 with the weight of the ratings here a bit 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860
 huh 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.960
 you take place at the national congress but 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 Wait, that's the reason why the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.399
 own system was allowing 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.809
 there was a deformation than the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.090
 popular representation 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.840
 We have in Brazil today at the congress. 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.420
 more than 20 parties in the country more than 30 and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.110
 we have to with to meet the 39 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.270
 Ministries at the right level are 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.909
 inefficiency in the cup are not matches 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 we have talks more than 20 groups 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.090
 playing it has 456 are split by the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.280
 rest are groups organizing to have a 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.900
 part of the government and then the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.090
 President began to do if you did not 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.670
 No, I do not like it, I do not like it. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.390
 magno is not supported by 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.700
 a long time 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.799
 love already bald social of its 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.560
 companions when characterized in the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.040
 with a coalition presidentialism not 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.130
 is equal to the reputation of a truck when 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.470
 they collected two different draws 45 ante 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
 a program that you could not 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.079
 explain what was being done now 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.119
 It has no program with people together and 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.759
 to be counted 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.320
 the goose for the cup as giving a 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.840
 important government opportunity to 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.210
 ministry and you will not be able to 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.340
 time I think it contributes 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.260
 you do not print but everyone 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.960
 realized that the body is speaking in 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.970
 Your question is false. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.490
 also false when justice 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.290
 starts talking about decisions, it 's because 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.420
 no one making decisions from our 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.870
 constitution allows in the vacuum of 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.630
 regulation or start can give an opinion 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.150
 but I think it is coming 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.150
 time we will actually have to do 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.580
 a reform to enforce reform spoke 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.740
 national magic of almost nothing when he 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.680
 want to change everything, change nothing, have nothing to do 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.270
 what are the key points 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.220
 subject to changes in the political system 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.660
 and can really approve the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.940
 private funding would be in 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.460
 remembers the iron pulse at least this 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.140
 year the way organ yes what the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.420
 financing we have today is not 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.310
 financing is a copy of a brief 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.070
 to the sky 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.000
 erase all sides whoever was not 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.230
 he gave none he recovers the second 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.360
 it's okay no matter who wins 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.590
 we liked fourth but it is not is the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.200
 fundamental there 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.020
 although the unit is this I think 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.900
 any personal financing of a person 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.150
 physics with limit and attending companies 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.280
 since it has a limit and that runs 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.620
 if you give or not you can hear it 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.110
 produced in the world do not because it is not 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.750
 Safer then it's the way it is today. 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.490
 one thing is demoralizing 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.040
 I just think that for us to 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.870
 coming out of this crisis would 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.460
 formation of the framework of the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.400
 alliance as happened at the time of 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.010
 president franklin to be 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.780
 sincere i think you always one 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.620
 of this size has to have a new 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.890
 consensus 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.110
 what the problem is that what is the Polga 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.510
 difference of conchavo and an alliance and 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.440
 with a consensus- seeking proposal is 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.890
 tenuous 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.340
 Today people want to give justice 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.770
 So much is an appeal of appeal that 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.990
 so much corruption that he was thinking about 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.620
 Caution, we have already consulted the complaint 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.050
 do not go 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.350
 the court gave the number one concern 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.380
 from Brazil and makes friends there takes time 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.910
 But you have to have patience, yes, government. 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.120
 show firmness 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.280
 the saliva he wanted when the hormones 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.310
 to appeal conflicts in itabatÃ£ then with a 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.380
 broader group an act of support 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.620
 if you do not you will start 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.150
 how she started with the boy. 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.300
 had pizza right? 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.820
 then it is a delicate situation that the 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.540
 impasse does not need consensus is a 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.770
 consensus type 1 if from a mobile base 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.270
 with your understanding then that in other 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.320
 saying that the federal government is 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.510
 your reputation 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.700
 the government lost popularity not only to 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.980
 credibility and reputation and 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.470
 credibility for which he was president of 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.960
 old time to clean 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.460
 its popular image but never had loss 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.960
 credibility 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.240
 I know I can understand life 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.790
 congress always the country always 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.490
 I explained I went wrong many times when 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.220
 I wandered in a way I tried 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.150
 explain why I will have but never lost 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.000
 confidence of the decisive 60 years of the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.520
 country and that I have this teaching confidence 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.010
 Unfortunately, at that moment, it was ready. 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.300
 to a crisis of popularity that borders on 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.300
 textile and credibility
