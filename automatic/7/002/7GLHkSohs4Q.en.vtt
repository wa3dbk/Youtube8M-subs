00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.630 
my talk about just how sensitive the
release<00:06:30.260> zone<00:06:30.530> is<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:30.950> know<00:06:31.040> if<00:06:31.130> you<00:06:31.220> catch<00:06:31.460> it

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
release zone is you know if you catch it

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.940 
release zone is you know if you catch it
a<00:06:31.700> little<00:06:31.880> too<00:06:32.150> much<00:06:32.360> if<00:06:32.600> you<00:06:33.110> don't<00:06:33.740> catch

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
a little too much if you don't catch

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.030 
a little too much if you don't catch
quite<00:06:34.280> enough<00:06:34.580> of<00:06:34.670> it<00:06:34.790> and<00:06:34.970> how<00:06:35.450> that

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
quite enough of it and how that

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.470 
quite enough of it and how that
translated<00:06:37.040> translates<00:06:37.790> into<00:06:37.940> ball<00:06:38.150> motion

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
translated translates into ball motion

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.410 
translated translates into ball motion
down<00:06:38.600> the<00:06:38.750> name<00:06:39.430> you<00:06:40.430> know<00:06:40.550> this<00:06:40.670> isn't<00:06:41.390> the

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
down the name you know this isn't the

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.190 
down the name you know this isn't the
long<00:06:41.720> as<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:42.080> fans

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
long as the fans

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.040 
long as the fans
it's<00:06:44.320> a<00:06:44.350> little<00:06:44.620> bit<00:06:44.770> shorter<00:06:45.420> especially<00:06:46.420> TV

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
it's a little bit shorter especially TV

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.320 
it's a little bit shorter especially TV
set<00:06:47.350> these<00:06:48.070> lames<00:06:48.340> have<00:06:48.550> been<00:06:48.700> cleaned<00:06:49.090> have

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
set these lames have been cleaned have

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.240 
set these lames have been cleaned have
been<00:06:49.510> walked<00:06:49.780> on<00:06:50.020> there's<00:06:50.320> debris<00:06:50.620> all<00:06:51.220> over

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
been walked on there's debris all over

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.010 
been walked on there's debris all over
them<00:06:51.670> so<00:06:51.790> he'd<00:06:52.030> be<00:06:52.120> clean<00:06:52.300> again<00:06:52.540> so<00:06:52.870> they've

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
them so he'd be clean again so they've

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.990 
them so he'd be clean again so they've
been<00:06:53.110> extra<00:06:53.500> cleaned<00:06:53.800> over<00:06:54.610> the<00:06:54.700> last<00:06:54.850> couple

been extra cleaned over the last couple

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.120 
been extra cleaned over the last couple
of<00:06:55.180> days<00:06:55.330> and<00:06:55.600> that<00:06:56.140> accentuates<00:06:57.040> the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
of days and that accentuates the

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.800 
of days and that accentuates the
shortness<00:06:57.550> of<00:06:57.580> the<00:06:57.670> pattern<00:06:58.030> so<00:06:58.210> anything

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
shortness of the pattern so anything

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.240 
shortness of the pattern so anything
that<00:06:58.840> has<00:06:59.080> a<00:06:59.110> little<00:06:59.350> bit<00:06:59.560> of<00:06:59.620> grab<00:06:59.920> or<00:07:00.220> a

that has a little bit of grab or a

that has a little bit of grab or a
little<00:07:00.370> extra<00:07:00.760> hit<00:07:00.970> is<00:07:01.210> going<00:07:01.450> to<00:07:01.630> end<00:07:01.750> up

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810
