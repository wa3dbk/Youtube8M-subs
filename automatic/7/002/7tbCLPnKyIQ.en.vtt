hey there YouTube Nick here and I'm back

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.110 
hey there YouTube Nick here and I'm back
from<00:00:03.870> vacation<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.799> spent<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.430> few<00:00:05.609> days<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.850> New

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
from vacation I spent a few days in New

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.570 
from vacation I spent a few days in New
York<00:00:06.270> City<00:00:06.569> but<00:00:07.170> I'm<00:00:07.290> back<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.980> I'm<00:00:08.340> working

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
York City but I'm back and I'm working

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.180 
York City but I'm back and I'm working
on<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.849> gun<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.389> day<00:00:09.510> series<00:00:09.900> again<00:00:10.200> I'm<00:00:11.040> on

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
on my gun of the day series again I'm on

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.110 
on my gun of the day series again I'm on
to<00:00:11.370> LMGs<00:00:12.059> now<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.690> finished<00:00:13.700> assault<00:00:14.700> rifles

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
to LMGs now I finished assault rifles

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.840 
to LMGs now I finished assault rifles
and<00:00:15.299> submachine<00:00:16.170> guns<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:17.160> I'm<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.730> be

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
and submachine guns so I'm going to be

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.269 
and submachine guns so I'm going to be
using<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.750> LMG<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.010> unlock

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
using the first LMG that you unlock

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.120 
using the first LMG that you unlock
today<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.430> l86<00:00:23.430> LSW<00:00:25.130> I'm

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
today and that would be the l86 LSW I'm

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.089 
today and that would be the l86 LSW I'm
not<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.519> big<00:00:26.699> fan<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.330> LNG's<00:00:28.099> partly

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
not really a big fan of LNG's partly

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.820 
not really a big fan of LNG's partly
because<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> lot<00:00:31.080> more<00:00:31.109> recoil<00:00:31.590> than

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
because they have a lot more recoil than

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.560 
because they have a lot more recoil than
assault<00:00:32.040> rifles<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> slower

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
assault rifles do they have a slower

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.740 
assault rifles do they have a slower
mobility<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.670> they<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> slower

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
mobility you have they have a slower

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
mobility you have they have a slower
sensitivity<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.770> feel<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> slower

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
sensitivity they just feel like a slower

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.440 
sensitivity they just feel like a slower
done<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.070> they're<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> lot<00:00:41.280> harder<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.059> use<00:00:42.090> I'd

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
done and they're a lot harder to use I'd

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.340 
done and they're a lot harder to use I'd
say<00:00:43.070> anyways<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.850> LA<00:00:45.059> e6<00:00:45.480> has<00:00:45.690> maximum<00:00:46.170> damage

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
say anyways the LA e6 has maximum damage

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.270 
say anyways the LA e6 has maximum damage
of<00:00:46.620> 40<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.489> minimum<00:00:47.820> damage<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.390> 30<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.410> LMG

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of 40 and a minimum damage of 30 but LMG

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
of 40 and a minimum damage of 30 but LMG
is<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> unique<00:00:50.969> damage<00:00:51.690> structure<00:00:52.260> in

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
is have a unique damage structure in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.520 
is have a unique damage structure in
that<00:00:53.190> their<00:00:53.820> damage<00:00:54.210> does<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.629> decrease<00:00:55.110> over

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that their damage does not decrease over

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
that their damage does not decrease over
distance<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.350> l86<00:00:58.350> LSW<00:00:58.699> will<00:00:59.699> do<00:01:00.020> 40

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
distance so the l86 LSW will do 40

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.070 
distance so the l86 LSW will do 40
damage<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.649> any<00:01:01.949> range<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:03.210> makes<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.840> gun

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
damage at any range which makes this gun

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.870 
damage at any range which makes this gun
with<00:01:04.350> stopping<00:01:04.650> power<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.010> two<00:01:05.220> bullet<00:01:05.489> kill<00:01:05.700> at

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
with stopping power a two bullet kill at

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
with stopping power a two bullet kill at
any<00:01:06.090> distance<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> only<00:01:08.220> time<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.820> any<00:01:09.810> LMG

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
any distance the only time that any LMG

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
any distance the only time that any LMG
is<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.860> its<00:01:11.040> minimum<00:01:11.369> damage<00:01:11.580> will

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
is going to do its minimum damage will

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.719 
is going to do its minimum damage will
be<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> silencer<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> being<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
be when you put a silencer on it being a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.609 
be when you put a silencer on it being a
silencer<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.240> any<00:01:15.630> LMG<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> will<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
silencer on any LMG you will make it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.300 
silencer on any LMG you will make it
constantly<00:01:17.460> always<00:01:17.900> do<00:01:18.900> its<00:01:19.250> minimum<00:01:20.250> damage

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
constantly always do its minimum damage

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.969 
constantly always do its minimum damage
so<00:01:21.150> by<00:01:22.080> putting<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.350> silencer<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.799> your<00:01:22.890> gun

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so by putting a silencer on your gun

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
so by putting a silencer on your gun
you're<00:01:23.310> decreasing<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> damage<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.509> any

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you're decreasing the damage at any

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.980 
you're decreasing the damage at any
range<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> good<00:01:25.890> idea<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.250> LNG's<00:01:26.990> so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
range not a good idea for LNG's so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
range not a good idea for LNG's so
recommend<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
recommend you don't do that the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
recommend you don't do that the
attachment<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.450> using<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.900> grip<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.530> would

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
attachment I'm using is grip I would

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.819 
attachment I'm using is grip I would
recommend<00:01:32.490> grip<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.939> every<00:01:33.659> LMG<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
recommend grip for every LMG because it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
recommend grip for every LMG because it
reduces<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.460> recoil<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.259> that<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> really

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
reduces the recoil and that you really

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
reduces the recoil and that you really
need<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.920> even<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.729> grip<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.210> gun<00:01:39.479> still

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
need that even with grip this gun still

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.859 
need that even with grip this gun still
has<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> lot<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> recoil<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:42.630> quite

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
has a lot of recoil and it's quite

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
has a lot of recoil and it's quite
difficult<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.470> use<00:01:43.649> I'd<00:01:43.890> say<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.939> not

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
difficult to use I'd say I don't not

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
difficult to use I'd say I don't not
really<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> fan<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> iron<00:01:46.110> sights<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.729> yeah

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
really a fan of the iron sights and yeah

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.300 
really a fan of the iron sights and yeah
basically<00:01:48.409> this<00:01:49.409> gun<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> worse

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
basically this gun is like a worse

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.429 
basically this gun is like a worse
version<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.479> RPD<00:01:52.369> does<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> same<00:01:53.729> damage

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
version of the RPD does the same damage

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.160 
version of the RPD does the same damage
similar<00:01:55.439> fire<00:01:55.829> rate<00:01:56.130> only<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.810> can't

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
similar fire rate only it's I I can't

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.639 
similar fire rate only it's I I can't
say<00:01:58.229> I'd<00:01:58.890> say<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.790> good<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.469> it's<00:02:01.469> got

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
say I'd say is not as good and it's got

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.190 
say I'd say is not as good and it's got
more<00:02:01.829> recoil<00:02:02.250> I'd<00:02:02.490> say<00:02:02.930> not<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.990> hundred

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
more recoil I'd say not a hundred

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.050 
more recoil I'd say not a hundred

you<00:02:42.470> don't<00:02:42.620> want<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.799> be<00:02:42.890> sitting<00:02:43.519> there<00:02:43.549> for

stopping<00:02:49.549> power<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.910> kind<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:51.910> don't<00:02:52.910> know

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
stopping power is kind of I don't know

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.270 
stopping power is kind of I don't know
it's<00:02:53.450> not<00:02:53.630> really<00:02:53.690> needed<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.200> much<00:02:54.590> because

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
it's not really needed that much because

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.759 
it's not really needed that much because
you<00:02:55.579> do<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:56.090> 40<00:02:57.049> damage<00:02:57.230> at<00:02:57.560> any

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
you do have that 40 damage at any

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.280 
you do have that 40 damage at any
distance<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.329> don't<00:02:59.750> really<00:02:59.870> have<00:03:00.079> to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
distance so you don't really have to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.830 
distance so you don't really have to
worry<00:03:00.530> about<00:03:00.970> stopping<00:03:01.970> power<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.480> do<00:03:02.720> have

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
worry about stopping power you do have

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.080 
worry about stopping power you do have
an<00:03:02.959> advantage<00:03:03.049> but<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.160> always<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.760> use<00:03:04.790> it

an advantage but I always like to use it

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
much as stopping power would and you

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.120 
much as stopping power would and you
could<00:03:30.019> use<00:03:30.139> cold<00:03:30.440> blooded<00:03:30.680> if<00:03:30.889> you<00:03:30.980> really

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
I'd recommend using stopping power I'd

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.410 
I'd recommend using stopping power I'd
also<00:03:36.230> recommend<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:37.489> not<00:03:37.670> using<00:03:38.030> LM<00:03:38.239> DS

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
also recommend just not using LM DS

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.770 
also recommend just not using LM DS

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
use for an LMG would be just like spray

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.620 
use for an LMG would be just like spray

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.399 
use but still assault rifles in those
situations<00:03:55.579> would<00:03:55.819> be<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> better<00:03:56.359> choice

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409

it<00:04:08.430> earlier<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.959> I'd<00:04:09.959> see<00:04:10.290> snipers<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.069> I'd

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
it earlier and I'd see snipers and I'd

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.309 
it earlier and I'd see snipers and I'd
be<00:04:11.430> aimed<00:04:11.610> at<00:04:11.819> them<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.720> would<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.170> was

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
be aimed at them and it would it was

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.320 
be aimed at them and it would it was
just<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:13.709> hard<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.220> hit<00:04:14.430> them<00:04:14.670> across<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.150> map

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
just so hard to hit them across the map

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.810 
just so hard to hit them across the map
because<00:04:15.569> I<00:04:16.019> get<00:04:16.560> one<00:04:16.709> bullet<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.220> then<00:04:17.310> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
because I get one bullet and then the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.879 
because I get one bullet and then the
recoil<00:04:18.120> would<00:04:18.359> just<00:04:18.510> go<00:04:18.630> everywhere<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.290> it's

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
recoil would just go everywhere and it's

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.580 
recoil would just go everywhere and it's
a<00:04:20.160> it's<00:04:20.880> quite<00:04:21.150> difficult<00:04:21.449> gun<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.079> use<00:04:22.260> at

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
a it's quite difficult gun to use at

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.230 
a it's quite difficult gun to use at
long<00:04:23.340> range<00:04:24.199> so<00:04:25.340> medium<00:04:26.340> range<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:26.729> fairly

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
long range so medium range it's fairly

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.870 
long range so medium range it's fairly
effective<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.770> can<00:04:28.979> learn<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.490> control

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
effective if you can learn to control

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.230 
effective if you can learn to control
the<00:04:30.180> recoil<00:04:30.330> in<00:04:30.870> close<00:04:31.650> range<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.250> do<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.940> do

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
the recoil in close range you do you do

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.879 
the recoil in close range you do you do
kill<00:04:33.479> them<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.720> bullets<00:04:34.050> but<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:34.620> do<00:04:34.680> most

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
kill them to bullets but so do most

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.779 
kill them to bullets but so do most
other<00:04:35.160> weapons<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:36.620> not<00:04:37.620> probably<00:04:38.520> not<00:04:38.639> the

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
other weapons so not probably not the

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.460 
other weapons so not probably not the
greatest<00:04:38.910> idea<00:04:39.210> its<00:04:39.539> hipfire<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:39.930> okay<00:04:40.410> but

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
greatest idea its hipfire is okay but

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.600 
greatest idea its hipfire is okay but
not<00:04:40.710> not<00:04:41.610> amazing<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.860> it's<00:04:43.860> mobility<00:04:44.070> as<00:04:44.580> I

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
not not amazing and it's mobility as I

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.210 
not not amazing and it's mobility as I
said<00:04:44.880> earlier<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.419> slower<00:04:46.260> so<00:04:46.650> you're<00:04:47.130> gonna

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
said earlier is slower so you're gonna

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.930 
said earlier is slower so you're gonna
have<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:48.380> bit<00:04:49.380> more<00:04:49.710> difficulty<00:04:50.370> aiming<00:04:50.699> around

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
have a bit more difficulty aiming around

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.439 
have a bit more difficulty aiming around
those<00:04:51.090> corners<00:04:51.479> than<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.810> would<00:04:52.020> with<00:04:52.199> in

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
those corners than you would with in

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.060 
those corners than you would with in
sorry<00:04:54.449> in<00:04:54.630> assault<00:04:55.050> rifle<00:04:55.380> or<00:04:55.500> an<00:04:55.620> SMG<00:04:58.070> the

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
sorry in assault rifle or an SMG the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.460 
sorry in assault rifle or an SMG the
iron<00:04:59.310> sight<00:04:59.490> on<00:04:59.610> this<00:04:59.699> gun<00:04:59.940> is<00:05:00.479> probably<00:05:01.020> not

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
iron sight on this gun is probably not

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.310 
iron sight on this gun is probably not
my<00:05:01.650> favorite<00:05:02.070> it's<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.910> decent<00:05:03.570> iron<00:05:03.780> sight<00:05:04.050> but

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
my favorite it's a decent iron sight but

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.820 
my favorite it's a decent iron sight but
it<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.770> feels<00:05:05.250> weird<00:05:06.050> it's<00:05:07.050> really<00:05:07.380> strange

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
it just feels weird it's really strange

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.580 
it just feels weird it's really strange
to<00:05:08.550> use<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:09.090> don't<00:05:09.690> know<00:05:09.780> if<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:09.960> ever<00:05:09.990> get<00:05:10.349> that

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
to use I don't know if you ever get that

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.040 
to use I don't know if you ever get that
where<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.979> just<00:05:11.310> pick<00:05:11.520> up<00:05:11.639> a<00:05:11.789> weapon<00:05:12.599> or<00:05:12.930> an

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
where you just pick up a weapon or an

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.140 
where you just pick up a weapon or an
iron<00:05:13.260> sight<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:14.160> aim<00:05:14.340> down<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.610> site<00:05:14.940> and

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
iron sight and you aim down the site and

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.990 
iron sight and you aim down the site and
this<00:05:15.690> doesn't<00:05:15.990> feel<00:05:16.200> right<00:05:16.530> but<00:05:17.370> that's<00:05:17.820> how

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
this doesn't feel right but that's how

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.460 
this doesn't feel right but that's how
that's<00:05:18.330> how<00:05:18.419> I<00:05:18.510> feel<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.810> want<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.020> use<00:05:19.110> this<00:05:19.260> gun

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
that's how I feel I want to use this gun

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.120 
that's how I feel I want to use this gun
it's<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.039> bit<00:05:20.190> difficult<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:20.789> me<00:05:20.849> to<00:05:20.970> use<00:05:22.130> plus

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
it's a bit difficult for me to use plus

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.779 
it's a bit difficult for me to use plus
it<00:05:23.370> on<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:24.120> positive<00:05:25.110> side<00:05:25.139> it<00:05:25.620> does<00:05:26.580> have<00:05:26.729> a

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
it on the positive side it does have a

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.670 
it on the positive side it does have a
lot<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.000> ammo<00:05:27.389> and<00:05:27.419> you<00:05:27.599> can<00:05:27.780> spray<00:05:28.139> a<00:05:28.169> lot<00:05:28.410> and

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
lot of ammo and you can spray a lot and

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.279 
lot of ammo and you can spray a lot and
get<00:05:29.280> quite<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:29.970> few<00:05:30.090> kills<00:05:30.510> per<00:05:30.750> clip<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.200> you

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
get quite a few kills per clip and you

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.659 
get quite a few kills per clip and you
don't<00:05:31.440> really<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.889> worry<00:05:32.070> about<00:05:32.130> missing

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
don't really have to worry about missing

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.330 
don't really have to worry about missing
too<00:05:32.849> much<00:05:33.979> so<00:05:34.979> it's<00:05:35.370> it's<00:05:36.740> not<00:05:37.740> not<00:05:38.160> the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
too much so it's it's not not the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.770 
too much so it's it's not not the
greatest<00:05:38.729> guy<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.630> be<00:05:39.750> using<00:05:40.550> as<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:42.120> said<00:05:42.330> RPG

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
greatest guy to be using as I said RPG

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.300 
greatest guy to be using as I said RPG
is<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:42.960> better<00:05:43.110> choice<00:05:43.349> assault<00:05:43.860> rifles<00:05:44.220> are

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
is a better choice assault rifles are

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.250 
is a better choice assault rifles are
always<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.610> better<00:05:44.789> choice<00:05:45.060> I<00:05:45.360> think<00:05:45.900> that<00:05:46.080> they

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
always a better choice I think that they

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.070 
always a better choice I think that they
just<00:05:46.470> like<00:05:46.910> made<00:05:47.910> LNG's<00:05:48.389> in<00:05:48.570> this<00:05:48.720> game<00:05:48.900> you're

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
just like made LNG's in this game you're

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.080 
just like made LNG's in this game you're
really<00:05:49.260> bad<00:05:50.330> in<00:05:51.330> that<00:05:52.669> assault<00:05:53.669> rifles

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
really bad in that assault rifles

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.270 
really bad in that assault rifles
basically<00:05:54.750> beat<00:05:55.020> them<00:05:55.199> in<00:05:55.320> every<00:05:55.590> situation

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
basically beat them in every situation

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.360 
basically beat them in every situation
so<00:05:56.720> I<00:05:57.720> don't<00:05:58.229> know<00:05:58.289> maybe<00:05:58.440> they'll<00:05:58.680> change<00:05:59.220> it

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
so I don't know maybe they'll change it

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.790 
so I don't know maybe they'll change it
in<00:05:59.460> black<00:05:59.639> ops<00:05:59.910> and<00:06:00.349> assault<00:06:01.349> rifles<00:06:01.380> will<00:06:01.710> be

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
in black ops and assault rifles will be

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.070 
in black ops and assault rifles will be
useful<00:06:02.250> or<00:06:02.430> something<00:06:02.789> like<00:06:02.940> that<00:06:03.000> might<00:06:03.960> be<00:06:04.050> a

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
useful or something like that might be a

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.409 
useful or something like that might be a
strange<00:06:04.380> idea<00:06:04.800> anyways<00:06:05.610> final<00:06:06.090> score<00:06:06.300> this

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
strange idea anyways final score this

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.659 
strange idea anyways final score this
game<00:06:06.599> was<00:06:06.750> 232<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.320> for<00:06:07.740> hope<00:06:08.340> you<00:06:08.490> guys
