00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.530
 [Music] 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.559
 and with love 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.559
 [Music] 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 [Music] 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:25.250
 I never imagined life without you all that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.190
 I thought you were always good 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.190
 only you know well who I am 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.430
 Where I go 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:47.320
 I already lied to you, I never hid anything from you 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:51.950
 You always had me when you needed me 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:57.370
 and nobody better than you will know 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.370
 and that I gave everything I could 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:09.620
 now 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:15.320
 the new kitchen contributing with life and 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:18.070
 looking down and his subject and I 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.909
 I lose between nothing 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.220
 where they want words and love 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.760
 what has he given me if you go 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760
 or more 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:42.590
 and where was the love that you go nica 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:47.840
 [Music] 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.579
 If you failed, tell me with when 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 if I have rested and now I have 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.840
 released 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.670
 but nobody feels more 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.310
 just like I can 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 I wear 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:21.890
 as if nothing shortening life every 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:27.950
 looking away and you leave and I 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:33.430
 I lose between nothing where you want and the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.430
 love has 17 themes 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:46.560
 As much as I look for I do not find a reason 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:53.020
 no matter how hard I try, I can not live 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.440
 it's like a flame that to read the background of 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.440
 my heart 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.479
 [Music] 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:11.310
 shortening life fighting the look and 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:17.110
 you leave and I get lost between nothing 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.980
 where is the love now on your side if 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.980
 you leave 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.030
