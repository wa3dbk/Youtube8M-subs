think<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.069> was<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.310> five<00:02:17.970> dollars<00:02:18.470> but<00:02:19.470> I

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
think it was like five dollars but I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.770 
think it was like five dollars but I
believe<00:02:20.040> my<00:02:20.580> hair<00:02:20.760> gets<00:02:20.880> lighter<00:02:21.150> every<00:02:21.540> time
