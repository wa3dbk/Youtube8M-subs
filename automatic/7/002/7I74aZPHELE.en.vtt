the three most common methods are by

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.630 
the three most common methods are by
sewing<00:03:09.480> directly<00:03:09.960> on<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> fabric<00:03:10.650> creating<00:03:11.520> a

elastic

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.170 

if<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:47.020> were<00:03:47.170> sewing<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.830> circular<00:03:48.610> garment<00:03:49.030> like

if I were sewing a circular garment like
a<00:03:49.210> waistband<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.990> would<00:03:50.680> start<00:03:51.040> by<00:03:51.250> sewing<00:03:51.580> the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
a waistband I would start by sewing the

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.990 
a waistband I would start by sewing the
elastic<00:03:52.330> ends<00:03:52.570> together<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:54.000> remember

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
elastic ends together like this remember

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.340 
elastic ends together like this remember
to<00:03:55.150> backstitch<00:03:55.600> multiple<00:03:56.140> times<00:03:58.020> then<00:03:59.020> I

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
to backstitch multiple times then I

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.190 
to backstitch multiple times then I
would<00:03:59.530> pin<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.040> elastic<00:04:00.640> at<00:04:00.820> four<00:04:01.570> evenly

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
would pin the elastic at four evenly

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.650 
would pin the elastic at four evenly
spaced<00:04:02.560> points

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.800 

again<00:04:07.620> I'm<00:04:07.860> stretching<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.970> fabric<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:09.660> the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
again I'm stretching the fabric and the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.930 
again I'm stretching the fabric and the
elastic<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.620> fit<00:04:10.650> from<00:04:11.160> one<00:04:11.430> point<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.880> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
elastic to fit from one point to the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.300 
elastic to fit from one point to the
next<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.020> evenly<00:04:13.440> distributed<00:04:13.740> you

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
next so it is evenly distributed you

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.060 
next so it is evenly distributed you
don't<00:04:14.970> want<00:04:15.300> one<00:04:15.660> side<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.410> more<00:04:16.770> gather

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
don't want one side to have more gather

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.220 
don't want one side to have more gather
than<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.520> other

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.500 

getting<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.830> casein<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.580> my<00:04:23.760> favorite<00:04:24.330> method

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
getting a casein is my favorite method

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.870 
getting a casein is my favorite method
and<00:04:24.930> it's<00:04:25.320> very<00:04:25.500> similar<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:26.160> creating<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.700> hem

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
and it's very similar to creating a hem

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.210 
and it's very similar to creating a hem
first<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:27.750> need<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.080> either<00:04:28.260> finish<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.040> raw

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
first you need to either finish the raw

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.790 
first you need to either finish the raw
edge<00:04:29.490> or<00:04:29.880> turn<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.900> under<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.200> quarter<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.740> an

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
edge or turn it under a quarter of an

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.480 
edge or turn it under a quarter of an
inch<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.340> press<00:04:33.140> then<00:04:34.140> determine<00:04:34.980> how<00:04:35.160> wide

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
inch and press then determine how wide

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.700 
inch and press then determine how wide
you<00:04:35.820> need<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.120> casing<00:04:36.600> by<00:04:36.870> adding<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.410> quarter

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.830 
you need the casing by adding a quarter
of<00:04:37.860> an<00:04:37.950> inch<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.190> your<00:04:38.340> elastic<00:04:38.940> width<00:04:39.150> measure
