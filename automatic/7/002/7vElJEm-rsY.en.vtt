00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.370
 look you call tennessee bruce am 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.230
 bringing this video is a doubt that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.730
 many people have which is like a place 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.839
 cable on your guitar 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'll show you how. 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.670
 professional to do this ok let's go 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.430
 You'll need to just type your car. 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.830
 here is the following is good to say 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.449
 there are three types of cable a cable with 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.949
 pin and ball 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.300
 these two mechanisms people should speak 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.550
 suddenly in another video but they 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.719
 help you not to make help not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.050
 There is that noise here to know 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.760
 plugs high business so right and this one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 is more common than simple cable 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.710
 this one when you go place it you 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.090
 off the amplifier sound or if the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.750
 period is there let us try 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 neighborhood 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.390
 Come on, it's the next one you got the car you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.309
 will pass the cable here behind the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.050
 belt is passed behind the run you 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:06.170
 goes place 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.470
 he was his guitar renan guitar 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.630
 simple 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 now you can turn on the sound 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860
 amplifier or if we are going to you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.460
 strip the neighborhood booth because people 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.740
 played this place without using this technique 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.390
 to pass behind the hour strap and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:31.100
 place here without any of that direct place 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.100
 down here without going through the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.530
 imagine you now playing this way 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.259
 You'll have a show for example on the stage. 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.479
 or in the test with your band you are with 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.020
 Cable forward, see yourself with your foot here. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.030
 O 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 unwittingly he refused to give 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 Stretch any other kind of goal and there 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.689
 that stolen in maggi in the middle of the show 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.000
 this happens that is as bad as 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.640
 break the rope does not break pot worse 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 so that's why we use the car for 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.360
 back is the most professional way not 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.509
 requires correct or wrong way there is a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.969
 The most appropriate way would be for the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.580
 behind the belt guys hope 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.580
 leaning soon more tips in embrace
