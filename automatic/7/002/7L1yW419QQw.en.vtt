the machine will pull itself towards the

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.410 
the machine will pull itself towards the
edge<00:01:32.410> there's<00:01:33.340> no<00:01:33.520> pressure<00:01:33.759> needed<00:01:34.179> to<00:01:34.270> do

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
edge there's no pressure needed to do

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.669 
edge there's no pressure needed to do
that<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.869> disengage<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:36.130> engage<00:01:36.569> so<00:01:37.569> first<00:01:38.530> of

that so disengage and engage so first of
all<00:01:38.800> set<00:01:39.670> your<00:01:39.849> angle<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.209> you<00:01:40.360> want

all set your angle that you want

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.499 
all set your angle that you want
remember<00:01:41.380> 87<00:01:42.039> is<00:01:42.130> three<00:01:42.369> degrees<00:01:42.640> 88<00:01:43.240> would<00:01:43.390> be
