00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
string all the way across the top where

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.369 
string all the way across the top where
you're<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:14.879> supposed<00:00:15.090> to<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.420> able<00:00:15.539> to<00:00:15.660> grab

you're just supposed to be able to grab
the<00:00:16.530> one<00:00:16.680> string<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.250> push<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.580> open<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.940> so

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
the one string and push to open it so

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.290 
the one string and push to open it so
when<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.860> have<00:00:20.040> your<00:00:20.220> string<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.910> bags<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
when you have your string your bags that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.030 
when you have your string your bags that
are<00:00:21.390> closed<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.260> string<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.620> this<00:00:22.650> there

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
are closed with string like this there

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.160 
are closed with string like this there
would<00:00:23.130> be<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.250> long<00:00:23.460> chain<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.450> on<00:00:24.900> one

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
would be a long chain like this on one

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.340 
would be a long chain like this on one
side<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:26.490> another<00:00:26.700> chain<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.480> other<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
side and another chain on the other this

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.440 
side and another chain on the other this
one<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.860> a<00:00:29.040> string<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:30.180> you<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.360> to

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
one is just a string so what you have to

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.720 
one is just a string so what you have to
do<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.660> find<00:00:30.930> whichever<00:00:31.320> chain<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
do is find whichever chain is the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.090 
do is find whichever chain is the
smallest<00:00:33.350> because<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.710> want<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> be

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
smallest because what you want to be

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.579 
smallest because what you want to be
doing<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.699> untying<00:00:36.659> a<00:00:36.989> single<00:00:37.409> knot

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
doing is just untying a single knot

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.020 
doing is just untying a single knot
closest<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.390> bag<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.679> I'm<00:00:40.829> doing<00:00:41.339> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
closest to the bag so what I'm doing is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.709 
closest to the bag so what I'm doing is
going<00:00:43.339> in<00:00:44.339> here<00:00:44.819> and<00:00:46.100> just<00:00:47.569> loosening<00:00:48.569> it<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
going in here and just loosening it a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.809 
going in here and just loosening it a
little<00:00:49.109> bit<00:00:51.559> until<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.979> find<00:00:53.249> the<00:00:53.460> where

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
little bit until I can find the where

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.500 
little bit until I can find the where
that<00:00:53.999> end<00:00:54.269> comes<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.199> there<00:00:55.499> I<00:00:55.530> found<00:00:55.889> it<00:00:56.510> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that end comes from there I found it so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.029 
that end comes from there I found it so
all<00:00:57.839> I'm<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.129> see<00:01:00.079> undo<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.289> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
all I'm going to do is see undo it like

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.399 
all I'm going to do is see undo it like
so<00:01:02.429> now<00:01:03.059> having<00:01:03.780> done<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:05.150> should

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
so now having done that I should

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.970 
so now having done that I should
technically<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:09.320> able<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.410> find<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.800> other

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
technically be able to find the other

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:22.970 
technically be able to find the other
part<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> string<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.510> just<00:01:15.510> pull<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.320 

every<00:01:23.980> time<00:01:24.190> I've<00:01:24.370> done<00:01:24.580> this<00:01:24.790> without<00:01:25.090> a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
every time I've done this without a

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:45.780 
every time I've done this without a
camera<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.470> know<00:01:29.940> no<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:44.400> and<00:01:45.400> as<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.580> can

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
camera you know no there and as you can

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.450 
camera you know no there and as you can
see<00:01:45.970> Leslie<00:01:48.420> nice<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.660> open<00:01:49.990> they're<00:01:50.460> not

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
see Leslie nice and open they're not

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.430 
see Leslie nice and open they're not
just<00:01:51.729> worked<00:01:52.060> perfectly<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:52.960> there<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.290> go

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
just worked perfectly so there you go

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.170 
just worked perfectly so there you go
that's<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.930> that's<00:01:55.930> how<00:01:56.080> you<00:01:56.229> open<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:58.090> of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
that's a that's how you open one of

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.310 
that's a that's how you open one of
those<00:01:58.270> bags<00:01:58.570> there<00:01:58.810> was<00:01:59.140> strength<00:02:01.140> from<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
those bags there was strength from the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.259 
those bags there was strength from the
art<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.560> doing<00:02:02.920> stuff<00:02:04.259> yes
