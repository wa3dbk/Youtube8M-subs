percentage<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.790> really

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
percentage which is really really

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.910 
percentage which is really really
crucial<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> turn<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.799> my

just<00:03:16.650> cool<00:03:17.100> overall<00:03:17.519> oh<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.269> also<00:03:18.930> reset<00:03:19.410> your

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
just cool overall oh you also reset your

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.680 
just cool overall oh you also reset your
max<00:03:19.739> speed<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:20.459> Oreos<00:03:20.850> at<00:03:21.060> zero<00:03:21.390> so

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
max speed so it's Oreos at zero so

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.759 
max speed so it's Oreos at zero so
there's<00:03:21.959> no<00:03:22.110> difference<00:03:22.470> right<00:03:22.590> there
