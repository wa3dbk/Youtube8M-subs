this<00:00:44.100> location<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.850> recovery<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.690> what

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
this location on recovery and what

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.720 
this location on recovery and what
you're<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> jump<00:00:46.920> backwards<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
you're going to do is jump backwards and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.100 
you're going to do is jump backwards and
then<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> were<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> pretty<00:00:48.989> much

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
then you were just going to pretty much

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.720 
then you were just going to pretty much
do<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.350> thing<00:00:49.680> where<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> fly<00:00:50.280> down<00:00:50.309> really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
do the thing where you fly down really

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
do the thing where you fly down really
quickly<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.420> believe<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.289> by

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
quickly I believe you can do this by

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
pressing either B or the analog stick on

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
pressing either B or the analog stick on
xbox<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.379> add<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> circle<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> analog

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
xbox and add a circle or the analog

you're in this spot you can actually go

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
you're in this spot you can actually go
quite<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> bit<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> way<00:01:08.280> around<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.970> well

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
quite a bit of the way around as well

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.820 
quite a bit of the way around as well
and<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.049> come<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> parts<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and you can actually come to parts of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.050 
and you can actually come to parts of
the<00:01:10.920> map<00:01:11.010> where<00:01:11.159> you'll<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.340> able<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.820> into

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the map where you'll be able to see into

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700 
the map where you'll be able to see into
the<00:01:12.299> map<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.020> obviously<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> go

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the map and then obviously you can go

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710 
the map and then obviously you can go
back<00:01:13.890> around<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> nice<00:01:15.090> hiding<00:01:15.479> spot

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
back around and be in a nice hiding spot

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.749 
back around and be in a nice hiding spot
so<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:15.990> absolutely<00:01:16.500> insane<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.130> definitely

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so it's absolutely insane and definitely

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
so it's absolutely insane and definitely
worth<00:01:17.909> trying<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.479> advanced<00:01:18.750> warfare<00:01:19.290> I

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
worth trying out an advanced warfare I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.840 
worth trying out an advanced warfare I
like<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> say<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.369> probably<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
like to say this is probably one of the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
like to say this is probably one of the
