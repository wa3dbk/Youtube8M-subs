know these answers how to fix an

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.849 
know these answers how to fix an
upside-down<00:00:15.210> computer<00:00:15.929> screen<00:00:16.170> oh<00:00:16.410> it's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
upside-down computer screen oh it's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.200 
upside-down computer screen oh it's
quite<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.100> complicated<00:00:17.460> procedure<00:00:17.760> that's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
quite a complicated procedure that's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.029 
quite a complicated procedure that's
going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.449> require<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:19.050> complete<00:00:19.619> hardware

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
going to require a complete hardware

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.990 
going to require a complete hardware
really<00:00:20.490> Asian<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> correct<00:00:21.480> pinout<00:00:22.289> topology

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
really Asian and correct pinout topology

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.019 
really Asian and correct pinout topology
now<00:00:24.000> look<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.050> quite<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.439> easy<00:00:26.029> but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
now look it's not quite that easy but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.339 
now look it's not quite that easy but
it's<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.300> quite<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.510> complicated<00:00:27.869> either

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
it's not quite that complicated either

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.290 
it's not quite that complicated either
well<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.890> upside-down<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.940> course<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
well if it's upside-down of course the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
well if it's upside-down of course the
easiest<00:00:33.630> way<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.620> turn<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
easiest way would be just to turn it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
easiest way would be just to turn it
right-side<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.630> today's<00:00:36.809> monitors

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
right-side up but with today's monitors

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130 
right-side up but with today's monitors
especially<00:00:37.890> flat<00:00:38.550> panel<00:00:38.910> monitors<00:00:39.360> they<00:00:39.899> have

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
especially flat panel monitors they have

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.069 
especially flat panel monitors they have
the<00:00:40.260> ability<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.890> rotate<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.820> screen<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.930> is

the ability to rotate the screen this is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
the ability to rotate the screen this is
very<00:00:43.260> helpful<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.890> case<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
very helpful in case you would like to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
very helpful in case you would like to
turn<00:00:45.629> your<00:00:45.930> monitor<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.710> something<00:00:46.980> long

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
turn your monitor and see something long

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.940 
turn your monitor and see something long
ways<00:00:47.700> you're<00:00:48.059> able<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> rotate<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.140> image<00:00:49.350> up

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
ways you're able to rotate the image up

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.959 
ways you're able to rotate the image up
to<00:00:50.989> 360<00:00:51.989> degrees<00:00:52.579> however<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> should

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
to 360 degrees however if you should

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
to 360 degrees however if you should
come<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.989> find<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.590> image<00:00:55.920> is

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
come in and find that your image is

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.240 
come in and find that your image is
upside<00:00:56.760> down<00:00:57.109> typically<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:58.859> easy

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
upside down typically it's a very easy

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.420 
upside down typically it's a very easy
process<00:00:59.699> of<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.530> control<00:01:02.010> panels

or your system preferences selecting the
display<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.439> look<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> selection<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
display and look for the selection that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
display and look for the selection that
says<00:01:09.360> rotate<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.560> you'll<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> can

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
says rotate here you'll see that you can

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.249 
says rotate here you'll see that you can
actually<00:01:11.700> rotate<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.420> screen<00:01:12.840> 90<00:01:13.760> 180<00:01:14.760> or

actually rotate your screen 90 180 or
270<00:01:16.259> degrees<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.759> should<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> simple<00:01:18.600> matter

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
270 degrees it should be a simple matter

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.590 
270 degrees it should be a simple matter
of<00:01:19.259> actually<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.860> selecting<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.600> rotation

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
of actually just selecting the rotation

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
of actually just selecting the rotation
that<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.259> notice<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.759> have

monitors<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.270> very<00:01:36.720> rare<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.170> still

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
monitors it's very rare but still

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
monitors it's very rare but still
occasionally<00:01:38.460> you'll<00:01:38.640> find<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> has<00:01:39.420> an

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
occasionally you'll find one that has an

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.560 
occasionally you'll find one that has an
upside-down<00:01:40.079> image<00:01:40.740> typically<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.640> pen<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
upside-down image typically a pen in the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
upside-down image typically a pen in the
cable<00:01:42.990> has<00:01:43.200> become<00:01:43.590> dislodged<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.610> broken<00:01:45.180> off

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
cable has become dislodged or broken off

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.109 
cable has become dislodged or broken off
and<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.320> might<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.040> very<00:01:47.280> pin<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and this might be the very pin that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.510 
and this might be the very pin that
sends<00:01:48.479> information<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.320> orient<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> screen

sends information to orient the screen

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760 
sends information to orient the screen
typically<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.750> way<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> fix<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
typically the way to fix this is to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.609 
typically the way to fix this is to
simply<00:01:53.310> buy<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> new<00:01:53.880> cable<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:55.049> worst<00:01:55.350> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
simply buy a new cable on the worst of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.740 
simply buy a new cable on the worst of
occasions<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.310> might<00:01:56.700> need<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> new<00:01:57.240> graphics

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
occasions you might need a new graphics

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.899 
occasions you might need a new graphics
card<00:01:57.840> however<00:01:58.590> over<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.130> past<00:01:59.250> few<00:01:59.670> years

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
card however over the past few years

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.670 
card however over the past few years
this<00:02:00.119> has<00:02:00.299> become<00:02:00.479> almost<00:02:00.930> completely

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
this has become almost completely

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130 
this has become almost completely
non-existent<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.329> problem<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
non-existent as a problem in the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020 
non-existent as a problem in the
computer<00:02:04.560> world<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.369> come<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.759> some

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
computer world so if you come in some

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.940 
computer world so if you come in some
day<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.390> you've<00:02:06.509> got<00:02:06.689> an<00:02:06.810> upside<00:02:07.229> down<00:02:07.439> screen

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
day and you've got an upside down screen

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.949 
day and you've got an upside down screen
and<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.270> monitor<00:02:09.750> that's

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and it's not you or the monitor that's
