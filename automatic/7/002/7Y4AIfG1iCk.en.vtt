where<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.580> standin<00:02:47.250> definitely<00:02:48.250> throwing

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
where you standin definitely throwing

00:02:48.459 --> 00:03:01.570 
where you standin definitely throwing
some<00:02:48.730> more<00:02:48.880> over<00:02:49.060> there

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:13.720 

he's<00:03:02.580> big<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> dog<00:03:03.300> there

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730

so essentially he can take that and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.470 
so essentially he can take that and
build<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.460> dogs<00:03:29.640> are<00:03:29.790> great<00:03:29.850> big<00:03:30.090> snow<00:03:30.270> pile
