00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
here I'm still on the camera probably

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:27.770 
here I'm still on the camera probably
wasn't<00:02:17.810> okay<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:18.870> oh<00:02:23.120> oh<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:26.780> the

wasn't okay so oh oh here we have the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.930 
wasn't okay so oh oh here we have the
cover<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:35.160> table<00:02:35.550> itself

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
cover and the table itself

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.100 
cover and the table itself
yeah<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.269> look<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:44.690> nice<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.900> made<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
yeah go look at that nice and made a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.460 
yeah go look at that nice and made a
metal<00:02:46.470> that's<00:02:46.739> cool<00:02:48.049> guess<00:02:49.049> that's<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
metal that's cool guess that's the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.320 
metal that's cool guess that's the
little<00:02:49.709> belt<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.160> goes<00:02:50.310> underneath<00:02:50.610> no

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
little belt that goes underneath no

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.780 
little belt that goes underneath no
check<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.230> guess<00:02:52.410> we're<00:02:52.560> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.790> we'll

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
check it up I guess we're going to we'll

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.770 
check it up I guess we're going to we'll
see<00:02:54.030> when<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.239> goes<00:02:54.570> together<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.630> is

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
see when that goes together and this is

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.339 
the the arm so I get this twist tie out
of<00:04:48.289> here<00:04:49.720> this<00:04:50.720> is<00:04:50.840> what<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.080> call<00:04:51.229> the
