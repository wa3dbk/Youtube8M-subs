if you're using a fork or whatever we
didn't<00:01:40.340> used<00:01:40.549> to<00:01:40.729> do<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.030> back<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.569> day

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
didn't used to do this back in the day

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.029

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
then they started doing this and usually

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.550 
then they started doing this and usually
I<00:01:49.189> just<00:01:49.340> have<00:01:49.789> roll<00:01:50.359> off<00:01:50.569> but<00:01:50.929> I<00:01:50.959> have<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.409> have

oven rack and we'll leave them in there
for<00:02:36.230> an<00:02:36.349> hour<00:02:36.940> alright<00:02:37.940> my<00:02:38.120> oven<00:02:38.389> is<00:02:38.480> heating

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
for an hour alright my oven is heating

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.960 
for an hour alright my oven is heating
up<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.139> it's<00:02:39.230> pretty<00:02:39.560> close<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.829> there<00:02:40.220> it

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970

up and it's pretty close to there it
really<00:02:41.090> doesn't<00:02:41.540> matter<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.440> much

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
really doesn't matter all that much

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.410 
really doesn't matter all that much
because<00:02:43.160> we're<00:02:43.459> talking<00:02:43.760> about<00:02:43.940> an<00:02:44.090> hour<00:02:44.209> here

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
