has<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.500> tendency<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.340> look<00:00:14.429> nice<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.790> compact

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.609 
has a tendency to look nice and compact
and<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.389> think<00:00:15.540> that's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> good<00:00:15.839> thing<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.350> our

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and I think that's a good thing in our

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.130 
and I think that's a good thing in our
cities<00:00:16.920> also<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.910> tail<00:00:18.090> lamp<00:00:18.330> cluster<00:00:19.020> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
cities also the tail lamp cluster is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.650 
cities also the tail lamp cluster is
very<00:00:19.320> distinct<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.010> got<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> straight

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
very distinct it's got a lot of straight

very distinct it's got a lot of straight
lines<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.260> distinctly<00:00:23.160> French<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.609> terms

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
lines in it distinctly French in terms

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
lines in it distinctly French in terms
of<00:00:23.880> its<00:00:24.000> styling<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.840> don't<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.080> stuff

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of its styling and we don't have stuff

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.509 
of its styling and we don't have stuff
like<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.710> our<00:00:25.800> market<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.189> that's<00:00:26.279> good

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
like this in our market so that's good

the<00:00:26.970> fluence<00:00:27.300> badging<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.010> very<00:00:29.010> distinct

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the fluence badging is very distinct

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.070 
the fluence badging is very distinct
because<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.760> bold<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.420> big<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
because it's bold it's big and it's a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
because it's bold it's big and it's a
company<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.710> chrome<00:00:32.009> strip<00:00:32.309> it's

company with this chrome strip it's
right<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> center<00:00:33.149> too<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.840> that's

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
right in the center too so that's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.410 
right in the center too so that's
different<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.610> Renault<00:00:35.610> logo<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.059> top<00:00:36.210> well

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
different and Renault logo on top well

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.209 
different and Renault logo on top well
you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> side

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you know all about that now on the side

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979 
you know all about that now on the side
again<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.790> same<00:00:38.969> compact<00:00:39.360> look<00:00:39.570> continues

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
again that same compact look continues

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
again that same compact look continues
because<00:00:40.140> you've<00:00:40.379> got<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.760> line<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.000> starts

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
because you've got this line that starts

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
because you've got this line that starts
off<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> tail<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.649> comes<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> way

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
off from the tail and comes all the way

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.340 
off from the tail and comes all the way
along<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> side<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.570> pretty<00:00:45.840> distinct

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
along the side and it's pretty distinct

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
along the side and it's pretty distinct
because<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> runs<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> way<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> front

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
because it runs all the way to the front

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
because it runs all the way to the front
so<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.450> adds<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> character<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
so it adds a little bit of character to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.979 
so it adds a little bit of character to
the<00:00:50.190> cars<00:00:50.489> look<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.360> side<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> doesn't

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the cars look on the side it doesn't

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
the cars look on the side it doesn't
make<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.170> look<00:00:52.289> drab<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.829> otherwise<00:00:53.010> it's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
make it look drab because otherwise it's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.520 
make it look drab because otherwise it's
pretty<00:00:54.180> generic<00:00:54.510> looking<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.170> far<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
pretty generic looking as far as the

pretty generic looking as far as the

I'm so glad

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310

front<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> part<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.920> really

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
front this is the part that I really

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
front this is the part that I really
actually<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.150> styling<00:01:27.509> because

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
actually like with the styling because

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
actually like with the styling because
this<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.439> very<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.369> distinct<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:29.970> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this is very very distinct it's so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.460 
this is very very distinct it's so
different<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.930> anything<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
different we don't have anything like it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
different we don't have anything like it
in<00:01:31.560> our<00:01:31.650> market<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.430> hood<00:01:32.610> line<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.150> sort<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
in our market the hood line it sort of

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.090 
in our market the hood line it sort of
cuts<00:01:33.750> right<00:01:34.020> through<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.860> high<00:01:35.070> up

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
cuts right through all the way high up

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
cuts right through all the way high up
here<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:35.850> nice<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.630> big<00:01:36.780> logo<00:01:37.140> that's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
here so that's nice the big logo that's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.319 
here so that's nice the big logo that's
very<00:01:38.159> familiar<00:01:38.340> terra-tory<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> comes

very familiar terra-tory when it comes

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.460 
very familiar terra-tory when it comes
to<00:01:39.479> rhinos<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> there's<00:01:40.170> something<00:01:40.290> we'll

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to rhinos and there's something we'll

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
to rhinos and there's something we'll
get<00:01:40.619> used<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> seeing<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> part

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
get used to seeing but this is the part

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.520 
get used to seeing but this is the part
of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> story<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.049> look<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.409> this

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
of the story that I like look at this

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
of the story that I like look at this
there's<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.070> line<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.549> comes<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:45.030> down

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
there's this line which comes right down

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.080 
there's this line which comes right down
here<00:01:45.479> into<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.020> logo<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.640> provides<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.820> lot<00:01:47.970> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
here into the logo and provides a lot of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
here into the logo and provides a lot of
definition<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.200> hood<00:01:49.409> lid<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.920> that's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
definition to the hood lid so that's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
definition to the hood lid so that's
very<00:01:50.700> different<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.420> front<00:01:51.659> grille<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.049> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
very different the front grille will is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.600 
very different the front grille will is
hardly<00:01:52.439> much<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.399> here

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
hardly much of it but it's down here

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.580 
hardly much of it but it's down here
lots<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.509> chrome<00:01:54.810> thrown<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
lots of chrome thrown in there and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.819 
lots of chrome thrown in there and
pretty<00:01:56.159> subtle<00:01:56.490> still<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.869> fog<00:01:58.079> lamps<00:01:58.409> again

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
pretty subtle still the fog lamps again

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.899 
pretty subtle still the fog lamps again

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
have a little bit of a chrome housing

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
have a little bit of a chrome housing
and<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.960> course<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.380> come<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> headlamp

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and of course you come to the headlamp

and of course you come to the headlamp
cluster<00:02:02.369> which<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.579> again<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.570> Renault<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
it's contemporary it's penny blingy too

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.520 
it's contemporary it's penny blingy too
so<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.600> lot<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.750> people<00:02:08.929> are<00:02:09.020> gonna<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.319> that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
so a lot of people are gonna like that

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.140 
so a lot of people are gonna like that
so<00:02:09.709> when<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.190> take<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.369> look<00:02:10.520> at<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.700> car<00:02:10.910> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
so when you take a look at this car and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.460 
so when you take a look at this car and
you<00:02:11.480> see<00:02:11.630> coming<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.140> your<00:02:12.290> rear<00:02:12.410> view

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
you see coming up in your rear view

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.390 
you see coming up in your rear view
mirror<00:02:12.680> you're<00:02:12.800> gonna<00:02:12.920> think<00:02:13.069> hey<00:02:13.220> what's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
mirror you're gonna think hey what's

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.190 
mirror you're gonna think hey what's
that<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.790> that's<00:02:14.360> perhaps<00:02:14.569> gonna<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:15.080> its

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
that and that's perhaps gonna be its

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.720 
that and that's perhaps gonna be its
biggest<00:02:15.410> advantage<00:02:15.920> because<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.340> doesn't

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
biggest advantage because it doesn't

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.000 
biggest advantage because it doesn't
tend<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.030> look<00:02:17.120> very<00:02:17.360> big<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:18.319> think<00:02:18.680> that's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
tend to look very big I think that's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.620 
tend to look very big I think that's
good<00:02:19.220> thing<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:19.640> when<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:19.970> compare<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> car

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
good thing but when you compare to a car

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.600 
good thing but when you compare to a car
like<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.230> Civic<00:02:21.530> or<00:02:21.680> perhaps<00:02:21.920> even<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.340> Skoda

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
like the Civic or perhaps even the Skoda

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.729 
like the Civic or perhaps even the Skoda
Laura<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.450> might<00:02:23.720> seem<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.500> car

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
Laura it might seem to you that this car

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.750 
Laura it might seem to you that this car
could<00:02:25.340> look<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.819> little<00:02:26.150> bit<00:02:26.270> smaller

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.430 

so<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.970> different<00:02:31.390> looking<00:02:31.720> car<00:02:31.960> with<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
so it's a different looking car with the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.530 
so it's a different looking car with the
right<00:02:32.620> proportions<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.520> yet<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.940> distinct

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
right proportions and yet a distinct

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.080 
right proportions and yet a distinct
character<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.740> also<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:35.980> lot<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.250> class<00:02:36.670> coming

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
character and also a lot of class coming

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.240 
character and also a lot of class coming
through<00:02:37.210> especially<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.500> head<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:38.950> tail

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
through especially in the head and tail

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.510 
through especially in the head and tail
and<00:02:39.400> cluster<00:02:39.910> now<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.290> drive<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.950> here's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
and cluster now the drive and here's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.580 
and cluster now the drive and here's
where<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.940> being<00:02:43.270> different<00:02:43.810> part<00:02:44.140> really

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
where the being different part really

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.910 
where the being different part really
stood<00:02:44.980> out<00:02:45.100> for<00:02:45.400> me<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:46.300> engine<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.780> same

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
stood out for me the engine is the same

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.730 
stood out for me the engine is the same
1.5<00:02:47.920> liter<00:02:48.190> ECI<00:02:48.790> block<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.720> fires<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.230> Logan

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
1.5 liter ECI block that fires the Logan

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.210

surprisingly alert and adequate on this

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.820 
surprisingly alert and adequate on this
car<00:02:57.459> -<00:02:57.700> cause<00:02:58.540> it's<00:02:58.780> been<00:02:58.990> tweaked<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.380> produce
