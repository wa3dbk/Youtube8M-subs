00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350 
fifth on our left here as we zoom out
you'll<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.890> coming<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> screen<00:01:23.580> no<00:01:24.180> one

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you'll see them coming the screen no one

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.539 
you'll see them coming the screen no one
even<00:01:24.570> touches<00:01:25.140> us<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.100> had<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> few

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
even touches us and you had to get a few

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.149 
even touches us and you had to get a few
good<00:01:26.850> blocks<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.330> spring<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.659> free<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.979> move

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
good blocks of spring this free the move

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
good blocks of spring this free the move
alone<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.880> think<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> strategy<00:01:30.360> put<00:01:30.780> us<00:01:30.900> in

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
alone and I think the strategy put us in

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.469 
alone and I think the strategy put us in
place<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.829> create<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.280> angles<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.180> number

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
place to create some angles but number

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.260 
place to create some angles but number
88<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> top<00:01:34.680> left<00:01:35.009> first<00:01:35.670> engages

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
88 there on the top left first engages

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.330 
88 there on the top left first engages
that<00:01:36.299> linebacker<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.259> white<00:01:37.799> guy<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> then

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that linebacker the white guy and then

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.550 
that linebacker the white guy and then
he<00:01:38.430> flies<00:01:38.700> across<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.329> screen<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.869> pancakes

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
he flies across the screen and pancakes

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.370 
he flies across the screen and pancakes
82<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:42.060> after<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.020> had<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.170> do

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
82 and all after that all we had to do

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.649 
82 and all after that all we had to do
is<00:01:43.560> beat<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> kicker<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:45.000> user<00:01:45.180> tried<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
is beat the kicker the user tried to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 
is beat the kicker the user tried to
take<00:01:45.990> control<00:01:46.110> 25<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.490> completely

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
take control 25 here and just completely

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
take control 25 here and just completely
missed<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> hit<00:01:48.600> stick<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.770> our

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
missed on a hit stick but that was our

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
missed on a hit stick but that was our
