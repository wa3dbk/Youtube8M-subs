 morich magic marple brought by the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.199
 Company Kroll we will do now 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.900

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.530
 company joy, there is the bucket right away 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 with this perfectly in the water we have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.260
 filled and we devils us the same goes 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.769
 unlikely many 30 color film 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.040
 in total including nine metallic colors 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.290
 and two glitter perfect yes, of course 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.869
 never more than four colors in styrofoam and 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.759
 testify materials work and also 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.320
 never more than four drops per color 

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.640
 what texture do the eggs need 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.270
 have dust-free wish can 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 take styrofoam eggs I can goose eggs 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.049
 rabbinic others if you do not now 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.420
 Well -known but hearty one can in the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.829
 can take glass 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.180
 plastic by the way the very smooth 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.470
 surfaces it is important that you 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.500
 maybe just with the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.090
 On the other hand, matt lacquer guarantees easy 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.490
 the color sticks better but am 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.350
 entertaining always work beautifully clean 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.620
 what now you do not have to be quick on everything 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.570
 but only the solvent fast 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.909
 it evaporates then it will become dry 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.229
 Let's take the colors the colors 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.060
 the last to come is the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.920
 dominating which color should domenica 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.670
 orange on him orally then we leave the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.979
 ever to the side 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.659
 you can be careful now 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.159
 shake or the money now money there 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.750
 Small balls are all high 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:00.860
 Color pigments have to be added 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.860
 will drip so beautifully on a sound 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.909
 SchaschlikspieÃŸ now can the whole 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.150
 mulling musician wants a bit 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.129
 quickly to work is not such that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.939
 solvent evaporates then evaporates 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.770
 I am now taking a small plastic 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:28.720
 eigenwirtschaftlich spits fixes firmly 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:34.960
 slowly dive in and then stay 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.740
 post is after three hours 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.780
 bone dry 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.640
 then it is also smudge-proof if 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.470
 it is completely dried and quiet 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.870
 on the spit wants to dry 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.280
 put aside with it is now 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.980
 important to become really nice 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.570
 the color in there is still one 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.520
 Carefully wonder with the paper again 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.080
 scoop up if that does not work well 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.040
 then just what can I do now 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.950
 more eggs in this place make 235 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.090
 and of course again 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.110
 this will go back though 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.820
 Of course it will not be so nice anymore 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.010
 intense colors and the same is already clear 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.240
 that, of course, a bit more 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.680
 and above all things because the solution 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.780
 possible plastered is then also hertha 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.700
 we prefer to steal new ones again 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.230
 Colors can be so before we go now 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.480
 We can do that again the next time 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.560
 quite simply the color up here with 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.150
 a paper edge of a link 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.910
 and there are lots of colors there 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.310
 Also glitter effects like glitter shades 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.840
 new metallic shades madness 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.610
 and then of course you can really 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.900
 also work on every material first 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.780
 really in the appeal 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.550
 That's what I really want to say, yes, yes, to them 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.110
 a lot of fun doing that now 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.420
 namely really great results of 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.830
 easter eggs the aareal songs no one else 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.420
 and we'll say happy for now 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.290
 Easter and until next time when 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.290
 craft time ev
