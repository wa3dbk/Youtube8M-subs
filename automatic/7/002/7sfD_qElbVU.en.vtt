anyway we'll do that after inside the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.030 
anyway we'll do that after inside the
box<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.390> get<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.629> camera<00:02:28.110> oh<00:02:28.319> look<00:02:28.680> at<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:28.799> in

box we get the camera oh look at that in

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.339 
box we get the camera oh look at that in
the<00:02:29.099> minute<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.760> also<00:02:29.940> get<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.599> very<00:02:30.959> short

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
you'll never use it again unless you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.009 
you'll never use it again unless you
need<00:02:37.349> this<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.250> power<00:02:38.430> no<00:02:39.180> judging<00:02:39.840> by

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
anyway they look the same what's the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.880 
anyway they look the same what's the
operating<00:02:51.299> on<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.840> thing<00:02:52.140> here<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.650> thing

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
operating on this thing here this thing

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.550 
operating on this thing here this thing
here<00:02:53.160> runs<00:02:53.400> at<00:02:53.730> 5<00:02:54.720> volts<00:02:54.750> 1.2<00:02:55.620> amps<00:02:56.010> almost<00:02:56.700> USB

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
here runs at 5 volts 1.2 amps almost USB

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.020 
here runs at 5 volts 1.2 amps almost USB
compatible<00:02:58.560> how<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.670> looks<00:02:59.819> like<00:02:59.940> it's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
compatible how so it looks like it's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.380 
compatible how so it looks like it's
just<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:00.269> standard<00:03:00.569> plug<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:02.269> take<00:03:03.269> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
just your standard plug in and take the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.099 
just your standard plug in and take the
camera<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:03.989> box<00:03:04.250> box<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.519> know<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> bag

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
camera out of the box box you know a bag

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.740 
camera out of the box box you know a bag
okay<00:03:07.109> so<00:03:07.590> here's<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.129> camera<00:03:08.400> very<00:03:09.000> basic<00:03:09.480> but

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
okay so here's the camera very basic but

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.059 
okay so here's the camera very basic but
your<00:03:09.930> lens<00:03:10.140> doesn't<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:10.859> what<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
your lens doesn't see what the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.069 
your lens doesn't see what the
megapixels<00:03:11.700> are<00:03:11.819> on<00:03:11.909> the<00:03:12.000> lens<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.959> says

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
megapixels are on the lens it just says

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.870 
megapixels are on the lens it just says
it's<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.349> lens<00:03:13.530> I'm<00:03:14.010> assuming<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:14.609> thing<00:03:14.790> is

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
it's a lens I'm assuming this thing is

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.180 
it's a lens I'm assuming this thing is
gonna<00:03:15.060> shoot<00:03:15.269> 640<00:03:15.870> by<00:03:15.989> 480<00:03:16.290> that's<00:03:16.859> got<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.130> be

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
gonna shoot 640 by 480 that's got to be

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.740 
gonna shoot 640 by 480 that's got to be
the<00:03:17.280> light<00:03:17.459> sensor<00:03:17.849> on<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.030> bottom<00:03:18.359> or<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
the light sensor on the bottom or the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.720 
the light sensor on the bottom or the
motion<00:03:19.049> detector<00:03:19.440> one<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.919> two<00:03:20.069> on<00:03:20.579> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
motion detector one of the two on the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.970 
motion detector one of the two on the
base<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.870> standard<00:03:22.230> base<00:03:22.410> with<00:03:22.709> screw

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
base just a standard base with screw

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.500 
base just a standard base with screw
locking<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.579> can<00:03:23.700> stick<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> wall<00:03:24.329> or
