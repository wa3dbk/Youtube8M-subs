 hello good morning today we are going to learn to 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.260
 make a roasted lamb with a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.930
 accompaniment of bakery potato for 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.630
 we're going to need 4 potatoes half 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:20.130
 onion a green pepper a glass of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 white wine lamb salt pepper 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
 and olive oil we have started with 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.250
 the bakery potatoes for this we have 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.010
 caught the potato we have peeled it and the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.140
 we have started with this thickness more or 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.840
 less the next step is going to be add 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 the olive oil the salt the onion and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.760
 the pepper when we have cut the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.440
 onion the pepper and the potato we are going to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.440
 add a splash of olive oil 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.000
 quite plentiful and a glass of wine 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.000
 White 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.449
 once we have this done 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.000
 we should put it in the oven at 180 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.890
 up and down about 25 minutes as 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.329
 is going to be done in another source 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.559
 independent of the lamb we what 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.449
 What we are going to do is put the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.900
 lamb and when the lamb is left 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.730
 now we will put the potatoes 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.550
 in a baking dish let's take 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.710
 first a splash of olive oil 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.750
 then we put the lamb 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 and now the most important and without status 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.560
 of olive and salt and smear well the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.500
 lamb then we take a little 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.500
 of oil we take a little salt 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.400
 and we're going to put a layer of 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.400
 oil and salt all over the lamb 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.659
 once we have it perfectly 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.020
 been on both sides let's put it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.969
 baked is very important that it is 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.890
 220 degrees the oven above and by 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.990
 down the trick for the roast to come out 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.789
 it is good to put a little water and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.860
 control that during all the time of 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.289
 roast go a little water here you can 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.330
 see the thickness of the water we need 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.850
 in the roast 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.520
 after two hours in the oven and the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.940
 potatoes have been 25 minutes already we have 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.530
