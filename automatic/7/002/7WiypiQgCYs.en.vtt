00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
traffic so I didn't really get to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
traffic so I didn't really get to
actually<00:01:02.370> take<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.760> car<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> max<00:01:03.570> but

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:08.279 

whoa<00:01:58.890> stay<00:01:59.700> away<00:01:59.850> from<00:01:59.909> me

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.179 

a<00:02:08.379> little<00:02:09.340> bit<00:02:09.459> messed<00:02:09.670> up<00:02:09.879> in<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.149> corner

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
a little bit messed up in that corner

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.860 
a little bit messed up in that corner
we've<00:02:12.189> only<00:02:12.310> got<00:02:12.489> one<00:02:12.519> lap<00:02:13.000> here<00:02:13.329> Oh<00:02:13.480> God

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.030 

well<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> mean<00:02:17.170> if<00:02:17.319> he<00:02:17.439> can<00:02:17.590> drive<00:02:17.829> in<00:02:17.950> a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
well I mean if he can drive in a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.619 
well I mean if he can drive in a
straight<00:02:18.099> line<00:02:18.489> which<00:02:18.730> he<00:02:18.849> most<00:02:19.030> likely<00:02:19.420> can

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
straight line which he most likely can

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.630 
straight line which he most likely can
he's<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.109> have<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.469> straight<00:02:20.829> but

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
he's going to have the straight but

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.910 
he's going to have the straight but
there<00:02:22.420> are<00:02:22.629> more<00:02:22.810> quarters<00:02:23.230> there<00:02:23.439> are<00:02:23.650> more

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
there are more quarters there are more

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.500 
there are more quarters there are more
corners<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.489> hopefully<00:02:24.939> I'll<00:02:25.030> get<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.209> chance

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
corners so hopefully I'll get a chance

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.459 
corners so hopefully I'll get a chance
to<00:02:25.659> pass<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> corners

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.050 

210

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:46.589 

come<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:36.090> 215

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.420 

3:19<00:02:49.900> 220

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.760 

come<00:02:54.150> on

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.050 

keeping<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.640> flat<00:02:57.880> through<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.330> corner<00:03:00.060> kind

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
keeping it flat through the corner kind

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.880 
keeping it flat through the corner kind
of<00:03:01.210> maintaining<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> at<00:03:01.810> -<00:03:01.960> between<00:03:02.260> 220<00:03:02.770> and

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
of maintaining it at - between 220 and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.970 
of maintaining it at - between 220 and
219<00:03:03.400> yeah<00:03:04.300> -<00:03:04.630> 20<00:03:04.990> I<00:03:05.020> think<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.350> about<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.740> max

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
219 yeah - 20 I think is about the max

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:16.280 
219 yeah - 20 I think is about the max
we're<00:03:06.160> gonna<00:03:06.250> get<00:03:06.490> out<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.790> thing

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.350 

well<00:03:16.950> he's<00:03:17.129> probably<00:03:17.340> got<00:03:17.640> some<00:03:17.819> experience

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
well he's probably got some experience

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.640 
well he's probably got some experience
here<00:03:18.540> he<00:03:18.599> didn't<00:03:18.810> mess<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.140> corner<00:03:19.409> up<00:03:19.530> at

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
here he didn't mess that corner up at

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.050 
here he didn't mess that corner up at
all

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060
