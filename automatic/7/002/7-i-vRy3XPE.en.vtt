yeaaah alright people today we're gonna
be<00:00:07.760> looking<00:00:08.090> at<00:00:08.210> some<00:00:08.660> fingering<00:00:09.260> from<00:00:09.590> the

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
be looking at some fingering from the

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.700 
be looking at some fingering from the
Goldberg<00:00:10.250> Variations<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:11.350> first<00:00:12.350> variation

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
Goldberg Variations the first variation

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.269 
Goldberg Variations the first variation
and<00:00:13.840> you<00:00:14.840> can<00:00:15.140> see<00:00:15.320> here<00:00:15.620> I<00:00:15.650> printed<00:00:15.950> it<00:00:16.189> out

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
and you can see here I printed it out

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.679 
and you can see here I printed it out
from<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.580> internet<00:00:16.910> I've<00:00:17.090> been<00:00:17.269> doing<00:00:17.510> some

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
from the internet I've been doing some

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.310 
from the internet I've been doing some
analysis<00:00:18.380> of<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:19.579> different<00:00:19.909> chords

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
analysis of the different chords

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.540 
analysis of the different chords
thinking<00:00:21.320> about<00:00:21.529> this<00:00:21.829> because<00:00:22.009> the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
thinking about this because the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.939 
thinking about this because the
fingering<00:00:23.029> in<00:00:23.150> this<00:00:23.269> piece<00:00:23.539> is<00:00:23.810> not<00:00:24.079> easy<00:00:24.439> okay

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
fingering in this piece is not easy okay

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.220 
fingering in this piece is not easy okay
there<00:00:25.519> are<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.609> couple<00:00:25.759> of<00:00:25.970> rough<00:00:26.480> patches<00:00:26.779> that

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
there are a couple of rough patches that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.960 
there are a couple of rough patches that
you've<00:00:27.380> got<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.710> watch<00:00:27.829> out<00:00:28.069> for<00:00:28.099> even<00:00:28.699> in<00:00:28.819> this

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
you've got to watch out for even in this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.010 
you've got to watch out for even in this
first<00:00:29.300> part<00:00:29.539> here<00:00:30.640> particularly<00:00:31.840> here<00:00:32.840> in

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
first part here particularly here in

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.740 
first part here particularly here in
this<00:00:33.230> measure<00:00:35.350> right<00:00:36.350> here<00:00:36.730> know<00:00:37.730> right<00:00:38.600> here

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
this measure right here know right here

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.250 
this measure right here know right here
you've<00:00:39.649> got<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:39.980> pattern<00:00:40.460> here<00:00:41.059> see<00:00:41.480> we're

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
you've got this pattern here see we're

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.090 
you've got this pattern here see we're
gonna<00:00:42.320> look<00:00:42.679> at<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.190> pattern<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:45.070> kind<00:00:46.070> of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
gonna look at this pattern and kind of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.520 
gonna look at this pattern and kind of
think<00:00:46.340> geek<00:00:46.670> about<00:00:47.210> fingering<00:00:47.809> come<00:00:48.289> up<00:00:48.379> with

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
think geek about fingering come up with

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.590 
think geek about fingering come up with
some<00:00:48.710> useful<00:00:49.070> strategies<00:00:49.250> okay<00:00:50.239> we're<00:00:50.510> gonna

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
some useful strategies okay we're gonna

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.049 
some useful strategies okay we're gonna
look<00:00:50.750> at<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.929> concept<00:00:51.320> here<00:00:51.530> what<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:51.679> call

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
look at a concept here what I call

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.479 
look at a concept here what I call
consistency<00:00:53.059> in<00:00:53.350> progression<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:54.890> you've<00:00:55.309> got

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
consistency in progression so you've got

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.819 
consistency in progression so you've got
three<00:00:55.760> chords<00:00:56.179> here<00:00:56.480> G<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.649> third

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
three chords here G in the third

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.869 
three chords here G in the third
position<00:00:58.039> a<00:00:59.920> minor<00:01:00.920> in<00:01:01.429> the<00:01:01.550> third<00:01:01.760> position

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
position a minor in the third position

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.700 
position a minor in the third position
and<00:01:02.679> D<00:01:04.600> major<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.080> first<00:01:06.290> position

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
and D major in the first position

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.150 
and D major in the first position
alright

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.580 

so<00:01:16.160> that's<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.850> pattern<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:18.110> first<00:01:18.140> time

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
so that's the pattern the first time

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.170 
so that's the pattern the first time
it's<00:01:19.520> on<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.270> than<00:01:21.080> this<00:01:21.320> than<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
it's on this than this than this and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.060 
it's on this than this than this and
we're<00:01:23.750> going<00:01:23.930> for<00:01:24.200> consistency<00:01:24.830> on<00:01:24.920> our

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
we're going for consistency on our

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.670 
we're going for consistency on our
strategy<00:01:25.340> here<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:25.880> two<00:01:26.090> points<00:01:26.570> first<00:01:27.200> the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
strategy here in two points first the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.320 
strategy here in two points first the
start<00:01:28.220> finger<00:01:28.580> which<00:01:28.910> is<00:01:29.300> four<00:01:33.880> like<00:01:34.880> that

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
start finger which is four like that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.040 
start finger which is four like that
the<00:01:36.290> second<00:01:36.650> point<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:38.030> three<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.540> one<00:01:38.810> in

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
the second point is the three to one in

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.130 
the second point is the three to one in
as<00:01:39.770> we<00:01:40.040> ascend<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> scale<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:43.930> see<00:01:44.930> what<00:01:45.050> I'm

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
as we ascend the scale so see what I'm

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:55.719 
as we ascend the scale so see what I'm
doing<00:01:45.380> there

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.520 

now<00:01:56.270> they're<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.509> varies<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.110> little<00:01:57.259> bit<00:01:57.409> but

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
now they're in varies a little bit but

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.740 
now they're in varies a little bit but
for<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.009> first<00:01:58.189> two<00:01:58.490> we've<00:01:58.729> got<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:59.090> 3<00:01:59.360> 2<00:01:59.539> 1

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
for the first two we've got that 3 2 1

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.660 
for the first two we've got that 3 2 1
action<00:01:59.960> going<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:01.159> helps<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.610> to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
action going and that helps you to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.270 
action going and that helps you to
remember<00:02:02.509> your<00:02:02.780> sequence<00:02:03.229> when<00:02:04.009> you're<00:02:04.130> on

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
remember your sequence when you're on

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.580 
remember your sequence when you're on
automatic<00:02:05.119> alright<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:05.899> measures<00:02:06.200> 9

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
automatic alright so it measures 9

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.270 
automatic alright so it measures 9
through<00:02:07.070> 12<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:09.440> get<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.649> little<00:02:10.009> bit<00:02:10.129> of<00:02:10.220> a

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
through 12 you get a little bit of a

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.229 
through 12 you get a little bit of a
break<00:02:10.660> ok<00:02:13.510> sharp<00:02:14.510> minor<00:02:14.690> each<00:02:15.590> our<00:02:15.980> letter<00:02:16.250> and

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
break ok sharp minor each our letter and

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:30.699 
break ok sharp minor each our letter and
then<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.720> 7<00:02:27.610> right<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:29.690> now<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.319> gets<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.590> little

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
then a 7 right but now it gets a little

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.490 
then a 7 right but now it gets a little
nasty<00:02:31.010> here<00:02:31.430> with<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.849> part<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.780> let's<00:02:33.380> take

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
nasty here with this part so let's take

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.890 
nasty here with this part so let's take
a<00:02:33.530> closer<00:02:33.829> look<00:02:33.950> at<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:35.030> next<00:02:35.269> four

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
a closer look at this the next four

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.509 
a closer look at this the next four
measures<00:02:36.049> where<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> right<00:02:36.769> hand<00:02:36.799> is<00:02:37.160> hopping

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
measures where the right hand is hopping

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.360 
measures where the right hand is hopping
over<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.819> left<00:02:41.079> so<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.620> left<00:02:42.829> hand<00:02:43.040> has<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.190> lot

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
over the left so the left hand has a lot

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.180 
over the left so the left hand has a lot
of<00:02:43.489> ground<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.790> cover<00:02:43.849> and<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.920> want<00:02:46.130> to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
of ground to cover and you want to

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.729 
of ground to cover and you want to
explode<00:02:46.519> off<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.030> 3<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:49.549> third<00:02:49.819> position

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
explode off of this 3 the third position

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.630 
explode off of this 3 the third position
but<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.829> want<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.040> be<00:02:52.130> able<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.310> set<00:02:52.549> yourself

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
but you want to be able to set yourself

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.110 
but you want to be able to set yourself
up<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.239> go<00:02:53.360> down<00:02:53.569> again<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:54.819> 3<00:02:55.819> is<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:55.940> good
