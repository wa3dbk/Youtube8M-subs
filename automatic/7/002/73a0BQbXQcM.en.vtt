up to win prizes of various sizes and
weights<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.890> what<00:00:36.039> it<00:00:36.129> really<00:00:36.219> depends<00:00:36.789> on<00:00:36.879> is

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
weights but what it really depends on is

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.110 
weights but what it really depends on is
the<00:00:37.329> positioning<00:00:37.839> of<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.140> prizes<00:00:39.069> and<00:00:39.280> the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
the positioning of the prizes and the

type of claw mechanism that is installed
in<00:00:42.789> the<00:00:42.909> machine<00:00:43.179> so<00:00:44.170> what<00:00:44.289> I'd<00:00:44.379> like<00:00:44.499> to<00:00:44.559> do

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
in the machine so what I'd like to do

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.099 
in the machine so what I'd like to do
today<00:00:45.039> is<00:00:45.489> give<00:00:46.030> you<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.210> few<00:00:46.390> pointers<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:47.079> make

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
today is give you a few pointers to make

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.379 
today is give you a few pointers to make
your<00:00:47.409> next<00:00:47.710> trip<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.069> the<00:00:48.159> arcade<00:00:48.519> a<00:00:48.789> little

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:49.389 
your next trip to the arcade a little

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:54.260 
your next trip to the arcade a little
bit<00:00:49.510> more<00:00:49.719> productive

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.580 

depending<00:00:55.270> on<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.480> age<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.960> machine<00:00:56.110> it

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
depending on the age of the machine it

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.020 
depending on the age of the machine it
can<00:00:56.770> have<00:00:56.980> one<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.430> three<00:00:57.640> common<00:00:58.000> types

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
can have one of the three common types

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.210 
can have one of the three common types
of<00:00:58.420> claw<00:00:58.629> mechanisms<00:00:59.260> I'm<00:00:59.800> going<00:00:59.950> to<00:01:00.010> try<00:01:00.160> to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
of claw mechanisms I'm going to try to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.740 
of claw mechanisms I'm going to try to
explain<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.670> difference<00:01:01.000> between<00:01:01.270> them<00:01:01.629> and

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
explain the difference between them and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.040 
explain the difference between them and
how<00:01:02.440> they<00:01:02.620> affect<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.100> gameplay<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:04.050> we'll

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
how they affect the gameplay and we'll

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.690 
how they affect the gameplay and we'll
start<00:01:05.320> with<00:01:05.500> stuffed<00:01:06.100> animals<00:01:06.520> because

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
start with stuffed animals because

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.190 
start with stuffed animals because
that's<00:01:06.850> probably<00:01:07.030> one<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.600> more<00:01:07.750> common

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
that's probably one of the more common

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that's probably one of the more common
types<00:01:08.409> of<00:01:08.619> prizes<00:01:08.979> found<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.670> these<00:01:09.820> games<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
types of prizes found in these games the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.920 
types of prizes found in these games the
first<00:01:12.460> type<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.759> claw<00:01:13.090> mechanism<00:01:13.660> can<00:01:13.869> be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
first type of claw mechanism can be

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.990 
first type of claw mechanism can be
found<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.470> older<00:01:14.770> machines<00:01:15.190> which<00:01:15.759> have<00:01:15.970> a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
found in older machines which have a

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480 
found in older machines which have a
fixed<00:01:16.420> claws<00:01:16.659> strength<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:18.040> give<00:01:18.190> stuffed

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
fixed claws strength they give stuffed

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.830 
fixed claws strength they give stuffed
animals<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.970> new<00:01:19.090> meaning<00:01:19.300> because<00:01:19.659> they're

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
animals a new meaning because they're

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.510 
animals a new meaning because they're
literally<00:01:20.140> stuffed<00:01:20.590> into<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.979> machine<00:01:21.280> and

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
literally stuffed into the machine and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.980 
literally stuffed into the machine and
even<00:01:21.729> if<00:01:21.850> you're<00:01:21.970> looking<00:01:22.300> at<00:01:22.450> an<00:01:22.570> exposed

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
portion is most likely wedged in so that

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.210 
portion is most likely wedged in so that

the cloth strength rarely makes a
difference<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.970> these<00:01:34.180> machines<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.899> is<00:01:34.930> very

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
difference in these machines it is very

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.410 
difference in these machines it is very
important<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.740> find<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.190> toy<00:01:36.369> that<00:01:36.399> is<00:01:36.970> easily

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
important to find a toy that is easily

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.419 
important to find a toy that is easily
accessible<00:01:37.720> from<00:01:38.020> all<00:01:38.289> sides<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:38.920> does<00:01:39.250> not

small<00:03:46.540> will<00:03:46.750> most<00:03:47.020> likely<00:03:47.170> be<00:03:47.440> impossible

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
general tricks of the skill cranes the

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.670 
general tricks of the skill cranes the
last<00:04:33.850> advice<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.360> can<00:04:34.419> give<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.290> if

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
last advice I can give you is that if

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.110 
last advice I can give you is that if
there<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:35.950> an<00:04:36.100> item<00:04:36.220> of<00:04:36.460> interest<00:04:36.639> you<00:04:36.940> should

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
there is an item of interest you should

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.850 
there is an item of interest you should
let<00:04:37.270> someone<00:04:37.479> else<00:04:37.750> play<00:04:37.960> first<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:38.830> can

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
let someone else play first so you can

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.409 
let someone else play first so you can
get<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.160> feel<00:04:39.400> for<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.790> speed<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
get a feel for the speed and the

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.940 
get a feel for the speed and the
strength<00:04:40.720> of<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.900> machine<00:04:41.229> prior<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.740> playing

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
strength of the machine prior to playing

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.090 
strength of the machine prior to playing
thanks<00:04:42.639> for<00:04:42.790> watching
