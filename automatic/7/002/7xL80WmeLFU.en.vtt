00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
actually a little bit more expensive but

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
actually a little bit more expensive but
um<00:02:59.720> CRA<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.940> could<00:03:02.120> buy<00:03:02.480> these<00:03:02.540> first<00:03:03.140> and

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500
