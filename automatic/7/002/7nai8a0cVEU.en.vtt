 how to enter another secret place but 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.529
 well first of all I hope that you 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.610
 can give a like to what is this 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.470
 video remember that this helped me and I 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.610
 motivates a lot as well as supervise 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.500
 what is a social network is the channel 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.300
 to watch for each video and 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.699
 every time I record with subscribers and 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.470
 every time I do livestream on the channel 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.239
 of tweets and tips from the bottom and 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.100
 in the top part of the screen now 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.140
 gentlemen, we are going to accommodate a vehicle 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.180
 the same way as I did in the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.399
 entrance of what is the garage now 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.930
 let's go up for what is the chest 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.370
 and what this little guy will show us 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.620
 box that if we want to enter beat him 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.600
 we stung that so obviously not at 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.730
 button by then we go up through this 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.870
 small wall now we're going to 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.579
 find above what is the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.079
 department and practically here 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.969
 We will not be seen by people who 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.040
 are in front of this 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.540
 department but you can walk tro 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.399
 read things that way can be left 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.810
 four or whatever and at the bottom and 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.100
 then it 's climbing and when they go to 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.840
 enter everything you destroy or things like that 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.580
 You can walk around all the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.380
 parts that are here too 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 there is a little trick to upload a 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.640
 love 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.140
 but it's a little complicated that I'm not going 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.299
 to go up because if it's like a little 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.409
 weird and they're going to be struggling a lot 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.390
 maybe later the tubes 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.460
 justifying it a little better but good 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.409
 so walk around all these 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.539
 parts what is the part where you enter 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.060
 to the garage and what is supposed to be the 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.530
 garage lobby and good several parts 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.030
 from here not but I hope I have 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.649
 liked this little tutorial is something 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.899
 fast only because the video I am 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.640
 doing to come is to warn that the day 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.860
 today in a little while we will be in the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 tweet channel which shows that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.250
 at the bottom and it's showing up 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.539
 the screen of the screen so that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.250
 go and play with me I will be 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.340
 playing modern warfare 3 and I'll be 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 playing maybe the top 2 and 7 to 5 so 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.030
 go to play with me and then 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 obviously have a good time there 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.149
 in a little while I think that as more or 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.580
 less at 9 o'clock from mexicalli or the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.819
 from the north that is being like 11 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.110
 of the hour of the df but good I hope that 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.819
 be like the video remember that the pri 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.119
