00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello my comrades greetings I'm lay 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.589
 alfonso with a new avatar and with a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.110
 new video but this time it's not about 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.210
 tutorial but it's about a pancake and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.650
 pasta of the series my little pony the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.809
 magic of friendship 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.869
 this creepy pasta is called equestrian 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.300
 jpg point here goes the story was 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.310
 made by a drone and his partner I 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 I was looking through the archives 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.050
 randomly on the computer as images or 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.480
 things like that when I realized something 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.630
 that was not there before it was called 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.090
 equestrian and pointed jpg I thought maybe 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.670
 my friend that is a joke put is there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.280
 I opened it as a joke and it was the city 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 main of the ponys what you saw in 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.420
 a bird's eye view 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 however, look more closely and I saw that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.070
 nobody or no pony like the grones what 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.920
 call was 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.110
 it seemed quite abandoned I called my 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.600
 friend and I asked him hey what is the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.840
 equestrian file to jpg point that you put 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.090
 on my computer he just said I did not put 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.909
 no file on your computer but 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.100
 why did you ask him later? 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.800
 he good is a bird's eye view of the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.930
 main city he interrupted me with 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.450
 boni bill followed yes I guess of all 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.690
 bird's-eye view of the city 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.410
 there's nobody there seems empty really 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.740
 empty just said send me the file and I'll 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.420
 to take a look and how I did what 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.780
 he asked me and I sent it to him by mail 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.020
 electronic later a day later we 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.360
 we called again and he responded with 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.159
 never open the file again 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.549
 it seemed strange and he answered what happens 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.369
 he answered once again with that picture is 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.460
 bad never open the file again or 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.380
 you'll regret it after that he does not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.990
 I answer my calls emails 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.270
 electronic or texts I thought that only 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.100
 was playing with me when I found out 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.979
 that he just left his house out of nowhere 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.899
 I was very worried about him but more 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.149
 focused on why I never wanted that 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.640
 open the equestrian file and point jpg 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.530
 again I have not opened the file one 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.720
 good couple of weeks until my 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.390
 curiosity took over and I had to 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 see what was happening and I went to his 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.349
 home and I told his brother that if he could 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.230
 use his equipment telling him that I lost in 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.760
 the act first I went to his room and I 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.849
 I noticed that his team still 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.430
 was in an open notebook had 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.099
 only three words I will not see again 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.040
 I also realized that I kidnapped 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.700
 jpg pointed was still open like this 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.890
 that I clicked on him 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.050
 but he had used black paint to 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.080
 cover the whole image and it seemed that what 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.180
 saved so I could not undo it I took 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.170
 a picture of her with my phone and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.930
 it came back very portable 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.000
 I could not find the jpg file in my 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.370
 Photo folder or any folder in 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 absolute 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.590
 the recycling bin and it was app and of 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.299
 somehow I restored it and opened it 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.360
 found the part where I lost the 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.580
 knowledge there standing there was a pony 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.739
 with black tone with bright red eyes 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.930
 showing a devilish smile and 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.780
 twisted looking directly at me 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.849
 It was just when I saw my computer 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.579
 laptop was blocked and nothing allowed me 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.280
 restart the system had frozen 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.140
 the screen suddenly a terrible 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.049
 screech began to emit from the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.450
 Speakers unplug, turn off the speaker but 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.609
 the squeaking did not go away just when my 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.190
 ears were about to bleed I heard 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.470
 behind me quietly in the background not 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.260
 I'll see again I fainted and when I 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.180
 I woke up everything was very dark it was 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.079
 then when I realized that no 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.329
 I could see nothing 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.590
 no matter how close I even kept 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.590
 my hands in front of me 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.409
 I'm not going to lie, my head hurt 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.359
 when I opened it I could feel the breeze and 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.030
 I thought I was out but still 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.430
 I was completely black I knew that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.859
 I was out due to certain sounds and 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.739
 as I still could not see anything just 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.170
 could one thing suppose what was 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.329
 behind me he had hit me some 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.159
 hunters had found me walking 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.739
 without direction and they helped me to return to the 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.560
 city ​​and it has been to help me write this 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.539
 story for all of you I just have 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.120
 one more thing to say and read 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.130
 last words carefully if any 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.680
 Once the equestrian file is 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.380
 point jpg on your computer delete it and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.040
 empty in the recycle bin 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.320
 if you will regret it good that was the 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.900
 story I hope you have entertained 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.150
 with the creative until a little bit I am already 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.150
