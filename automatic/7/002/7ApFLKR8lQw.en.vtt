00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.530
 ah 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.340
 how 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.470
 i 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.470
 ah 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 one of the biggest drawbacks of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.750
 live in a big city like Tehran 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.720
 is having to endure long hours in the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.610
 traffic and in traffic jams here in tehran 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.130
 has been thought of several alternatives 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.130
 to tackle this problem let's look at the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.719
 Tehran is a megalopolis with 8 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:04.589
 million inhabitants and a population 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:06.930
 floating of 15 million people a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.240
 of the best transport options to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.940
 the life of the traffic is to use the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.700
 fast bus lines by whose 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.119
 development of RNE was awarded the year 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.119
 past 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 the bus system this fast 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.240
 transit obviate good English is a 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.000
 public transport system based on 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.580
 buses began to be applied 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 integrate in the year 2008 in order to 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.710
 lighten traffic and reduce 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.500
 air pollution 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.020
 in little more than four years they left 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.909
 already with six lifelines with one 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.909
 length of more than one hundred kilometers 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.220
 between public transport options 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.170
 existing is the most common and everyday is 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.760
 the taxi trains are used to 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.180
 daily to walk the streets of the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.180
 capital 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.270
 80,000 taxis transported daily to a 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.730
 million Tehran and US for more than one 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.000
 a thousand lines that are organized 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.130
 from specific stops the lines of 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.720
 city ​​buses also have their great 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.240
 role in the movements of 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.190
 citizens since according to official data 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.960
 17 percent of passengers 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.960
 use these buses 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.420
 two 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.290
 but the means of transport that more weight 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.740
 has won in recent years is the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.740
 subway 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.300
 i 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.750
 each day more than 2 million 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.460
 people use the meter for their 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.460
 efficiency quickly and its good 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.230
 accessibility in this way since 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.320
 will begin its journey more than one 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.810
 decade 3100 million people have 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.940
 traveled with the metro what has supposed 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.370
 an average saving of 26 minutes in the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.970
 each passenger's time according to surveys 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.970
 carried out 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.310
 ah 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.079
 the young mont station in the center 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.939
 of tehran is the point of union between 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.299
 the two most frequented lines of 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.299
 subway 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.530
 the Tehran metro has been a step 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.629
 decisive for the progressive reduction of 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.009
 pollution and the improvement of 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.009
 quality of life in the city 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.110
 like many other agents that use 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.330
 public transport to the river 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.980
 I also feel it frequently and 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.810
 now as we have finished the work 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.130
 I take the opportunity to go home to 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.130
 tender to go
