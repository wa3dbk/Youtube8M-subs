 I'm studying graphic design in the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.850
 Nava University Collado I chose the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.080
 petticoat for its academic excellence all 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.080

 I know that in tourism administration and 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.560
 I decided to come to Mérida because first I saw 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.989
 that the university had very complete 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.360
 this race this and I had not seen it in 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.280
 other side and apart I liked the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.459
 opportunities offered by the type of 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.560
 agreements and that in addition that affiliated as 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.660
 that with the best companies are those of 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 name is fernando domínguez estudio 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.180
 mechatronics and I'm from the taste and I chose the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.459
 Nava as not only by the visas but 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.640
 that also because of the study plan that 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.050
 has mechatronics that are complex but 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.060
 funny 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.599
 Mérida because it's a quiet city 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.010
 they treat well and the city is healthy and 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.540
 You can walk on the street when 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.090
 want what I like most about the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.220
 university apart from its infrastructure 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.459
 they are your excellent quality teachers 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.440
 that not only teach you but share 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.410
 your ideas and your emotions and you 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.049
 they transmit that fervor of matter 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.299
 towards one and finally for the people 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.590
 how I got hired for being foreigners 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.209
 nobody has discriminated against me they have treated me 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.860
 super good they have grabbed me as friends 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.959
 that they really abused all the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.050
 quality that gave me until now has been 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.320
