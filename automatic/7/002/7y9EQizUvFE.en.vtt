00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.589 
when they lose you and I think it's
healing<00:04:51.419> in<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.599> games<00:04:51.780> come<00:04:53.060> Cowboys<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.419> mean

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
healing in the games come Cowboys I mean

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.129 
healing in the games come Cowboys I mean
it<00:04:55.319> sucks<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.800> lose<00:04:56.039> not<00:04:57.000> because<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.389> you<00:04:58.050> know

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
it sucks to lose not because of you know

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.809 
it sucks to lose not because of you know
the<00:04:58.169> playoffs<00:04:58.830> or<00:04:58.889> anything<00:04:59.220> just<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.610> don't
