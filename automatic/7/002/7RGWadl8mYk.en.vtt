00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 we should take a double-layer cardboard and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.730
 cut it the size we want the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.710
 tray and paint it on one of its faces 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.920
 of the color that we like or better we 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 go below we will use raffia 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.570
 of paper or paper rope and stick the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.490
 end with silicone in the lower base 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.490
 of the cardboard as you are seeing 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.700
 we measure it depending on the height that 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.340
 we want edge of the tray and 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.060
 we cut the excess 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.320
 you 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.329
 we cut many strips of it 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.309
 length than the previous one and we are hitting 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.170
 the same way one next to the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.170
 another until surrounding all the cardboard 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 Y 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.020
 i 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.860
 once we have all stuck we must 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 interlace a strip horizontally and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.450
 it will be as you are seeing 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 to do this you take the end of the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 rope and the stick in one of the strips 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.930
 vertical and then you just have to go 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.230
 intertwining the one in front and another 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230
 behind 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.500
 yes 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840
 d 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 Y 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.160
 so until you get the height that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.170
 you want in some of the strips you can 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.750
 apply a silicone droplet to 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.150
 sticking them together this will prevent the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.840
 rope is up and you are very separated 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.840
 from the one below 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.619
 Y 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.750
 when you have finished that part you must 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 finish it by hiding the ends of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.010
 the vertical strips for it alone 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.380
 you have to roll the excess in the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.180
 last horizontal line and apply a 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.180
 silicone droplet to seal it 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.290
 You have 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.290
 mmm 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 and 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 here 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.070
 all right 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.890
 if you have all the finished edge you can 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.410
 put handles how are you 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.630
 to do it we need three strips of 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.300
 the rope and we put them through one of the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.310
 holes of the edge sealed with silicone 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.640
 one end and we make it towards 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.640
 above 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.310
 yes 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.900
 the next step is to make a braid 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.900
 simple long we want in the area 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.430
 when we have the braid made 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.560
 we insert the end into the hole 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.850
 edge and we paste it with such silicone and 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.850
 as we said at the beginning 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.050
 Y 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.240
 d 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.810
 Y 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.650
 Y 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.870
 now it's time to decorate it, I 've pasted it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.870
 picture I have painted in the letters 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.650
 Y 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.030
 Y 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.639
 here 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.690
 Y 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.530
 i 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.230
 i 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.840
 When everything has dried we apply a 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.580
 layer or two of varnish to protect this 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.860
 the paint seal to the image that 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.550
 we stick and waterproof the cardboard 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.550
 in case they fall 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.020
 we have finished the upper part 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.729
 Now it's time to cover the strips that we paste 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.800
 in the bottom for it we are going to 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.990
 use a thin cardboard or cardboard 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.970
 if you prefer it and we are going to hit it with 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.970
 white tail to the base of the flag 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.180
 when it is dry we will cut the 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.180
 surplus 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.050
 no no 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.820
 the last step will be to cover the edges of the 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.890
 cardboard still look I've done 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.230
 a braid with the same rope that occupies 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.430
 all the edge of the tray we're going 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.430
 sticking with silicone 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.819
 Y 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.070
 and the trays are ready to 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.960
 use are resistant and you can also 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.960
 customize everything you want 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.799
 yes 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.219
 yes
