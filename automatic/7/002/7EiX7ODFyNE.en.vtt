00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
rolling pin we'll repeat that process

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.220 
rolling pin we'll repeat that process
for<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.580> other<00:04:40.880> end<00:04:41.120> then<00:04:41.750> we<00:04:41.840> can<00:04:41.990> move<00:04:42.050> on<00:04:42.200> to

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
rolling pin just push it back into shape

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.090 
rolling pin just push it back into shape
before<00:04:50.890> it<00:04:51.190> starts<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.580> sit<00:04:52.830> moving<00:04:53.830> onto<00:04:53.980> our
