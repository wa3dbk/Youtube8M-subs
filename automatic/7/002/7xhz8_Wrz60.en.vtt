00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
leaves a little bit of kind of shimmer

don't have you know bad eye circles you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.920 
don't have you know bad eye circles you
could<00:03:31.459> use<00:03:31.639> this<00:03:31.939> and<00:03:32.239> just<00:03:32.479> set<00:03:32.689> it<00:03:32.810> with<00:03:32.900> a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
could use this and just set it with a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.399 
could use this and just set it with a
powder<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:33.829> for<00:03:34.099> me<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.250> need<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:35.329> and<00:03:35.659> the

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
powder but for me I need this and the

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.929 
powder but for me I need this and the
concealer<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:36.979> then<00:03:37.370> set<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.609> with<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.909> powder

concealer and then set it with a powder

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.449 
concealer and then set it with a powder
so<00:03:38.900> I've<00:03:39.199> only<00:03:39.319> tried<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.769> once<00:03:40.009> because<00:03:40.340> I

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
so I've only tried that once because I

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.099 
so I've only tried that once because I
do<00:03:40.519> just<00:03:40.879> like<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.209> use<00:03:41.509> it<00:03:41.629> as<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.750> highlight

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
do just like to use it as a highlight

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.330 
do just like to use it as a highlight
and<00:03:42.259> you<00:03:42.319> can<00:03:42.379> run<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.859> down<00:03:42.949> your<00:03:43.159> nose

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
and you can run it down your nose

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.129 
and you can run it down your nose
overall<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.030> do<00:03:44.180> think<00:03:44.479> it<00:03:44.569> is<00:03:44.689> a<00:03:44.720> luxury

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
overall I do think it is a luxury

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.020 
overall I do think it is a luxury
product<00:03:45.409> not<00:03:45.769> everybody<00:03:46.310> highlights<00:03:46.790> their

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
product not everybody highlights their

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.270 
product not everybody highlights their
face<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.900> terms<00:03:48.139> of<00:03:48.379> buying<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:49.009> product

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
face so in terms of buying a product

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.879 
face so in terms of buying a product
that<00:03:49.579> is<00:03:49.729> $40<00:03:50.419> I<00:03:50.659> would<00:03:50.930> recommend<00:03:51.379> if<00:03:51.650> you're

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
that is $40 I would recommend if you're

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.770 
that is $40 I would recommend if you're
someone<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.310> likes<00:03:52.449> highlighters<00:03:53.449> a<00:03:53.479> lot

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
someone that likes highlighters a lot

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.629 
someone that likes highlighters a lot
and<00:03:54.019> you're<00:03:54.199> going<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.379> use<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.680> everyday<00:03:54.889> go

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
and you're going to use it everyday go

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.490 
and you're going to use it everyday go
ahead<00:03:55.879> and<00:03:56.180> think<00:03:56.419> about<00:03:56.449> spending<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> $40

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
ahead and think about spending the $40

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.679 
ahead and think about spending the $40
but<00:03:57.859> if<00:03:57.949> you<00:03:58.040> don't<00:03:58.430> wear<00:03:58.879> highlighters<00:03:59.449> every

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
but if you don't wear highlighters every

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.860 
but if you don't wear highlighters every
day<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.109> do<00:04:00.439> think<00:04:00.949> $40<00:04:01.579> is<00:04:01.870> incredibly

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
day I do think $40 is incredibly

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.949 
day I do think $40 is incredibly
expensive<00:04:03.439> or<00:04:03.889> $38<00:04:04.639> is<00:04:04.819> incredibly<00:04:05.599> expensive

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
expensive or $38 is incredibly expensive

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.229 
expensive or $38 is incredibly expensive

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699
