00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.620
 try front wide brake pedal 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.840
 these are the credentials of the segment 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.480
 of tricycles definition of the code from 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.320
 license b that of the piaggio mp3 that now 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.810
 350 s framework challenge is worse metropolis 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 400cc 8,034 euros of price and finishes of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 automotive level for example yes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.560
 start without a key just have it in your pocket 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.050
 but there is the pleasure founder 500cc 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 also 300 good finishes ours 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 also had the optional usb socket for 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.239
 connecting a smartphone costs 8810 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.940
 euro the 350 s day 3 framework is the most 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 small of 350 cc displacement but also the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.950
 less expensive with its 7,240 euros 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.170
 simple finishes and no luggage compartment 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.690
 back but under the saddle is the only one 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 which houses an integral and a jet for 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.809
 better evaluate the characteristics of the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.730
 three roles also performed one 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 slalom with 8 pins at 5 meters each 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.870
 on the other hand the test envisaged going 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.699
 return and a right reversal are 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 states 4 of different extractions 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.030
 to have a comparison term three 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.820
 wheels were compared to one 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.890
 normal scooter suzuki burgman 650 then 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.600
 the fastest results 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.860
 the peugeot suspension consists of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.229
 wheels interconnected through the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 quadrilateral with the only shock absorber 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.869
 horizontal at the top, that is, it uses them 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 very quickly it can put in 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.020
 difficulty in diving la 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 suspension soon reaches the bottom 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 race triggers a reengineering e 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.479
 however, it does not affect safety 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.979
 on average the testers using the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.880
 metropolis got the times 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.720
 worse 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.150
 the architecture of the suspension 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.710
 mp3 front of the expected two arms 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.470
 cushioned joined by a square 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 articulating place wheels are therefore more 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.710
 free compared to those of the metropolis 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.690
 it was the most agile and 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.310
 consequently the faster the sum of 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.350
 times of the four testers saw it 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.409
 first between the two wheels also transmits 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.119
 a good surprise confidence at 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.009
 second place was placed which 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.570
 surprise because it is the widest e 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.159
 requires a lot of physical work 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.200
 to bend them because of the pattern 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.880
 of the front two oscillating triangles 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.100
 independent connected by the circuit 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 hydraulic and through the dampers 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.270
 acts as a dynamic support in a nutshell goes 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.899
 spinto employs on the other hand communicates 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.899
 great security 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.610
 these three wheels can be useful 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.830
 for a motorist, a motorcyclist from 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.540
 I certainly come back 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.980
 more stable things than a two-wheeler and more 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.320
 safe when it rains and the bottom is 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.040
 disconnected then there is no need for 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.040
 to make the license a
