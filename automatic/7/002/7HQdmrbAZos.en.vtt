00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 good morning take advantage of the last lights 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.609
 of the day to show you two 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.519
 purchases I returned home from 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.170
 expense and so I decided to try 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.480
 cut out five minutes to do a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.610
 the trick little video I have not 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.369
 retouched and from this morning and cell o 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.770
 maybe I do a little see should 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.460
 interesting to someone 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.550
 here is either the green mascara over black 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.369
 underneath I had a green pencil inside 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 of the eye that we now see if it is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.040
 almost completely gone a line of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.989
 eyeliner and green as the protagonist 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
 purchases of the chanel collection 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.149
 to the already registered I showed him 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.379
 a video with a little trick 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.200
 application of the purchased products 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 now I let myself be tempted by a couple 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 of other little things and we see them together 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 after chanel and the first collection 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.680
 I was waiting for dior 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.750
 I was interested in a small spoon 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.550
 particular that is what he had 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.550
 precisely the model also in the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.040
 photograph of the collection this 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:08.369
 spoon here I see how I still have to 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 use it and we'll do it at a trick 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.549
 together so as to also see the yield 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.210
 of this palette logically those 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.920
 clear on the skin you don't see much 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.979
 these are the darkest ones the most beautiful 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.439
 surely and red in the collection 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.400
 there were several other posts but not 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.350
 I considered a red enamel 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.780
 among other things, here on you I own it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.829
 tried today but I'm another area red 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 beautiful different rossignol enamels e 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.630
 then as I repeat until exhaustion e 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.270
 I don't use nail polish much 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.399
 on the feet more than the three summer months then 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.250
 they dry me to the enamels that already 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.079
 many more than needed then 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.520
 on the enamel I can hold myself a little 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.890
 precisely because I know that in the end it is not 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.469
 I would use a red lipstick 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.979
 always combined with the enamel is me 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.869
 really liked it 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.369
 it was really a beautiful color 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.829
 I don't know for now I managed to 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.410
 resist just by convincing me to have 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.230
 many similar things at home 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.610
 I hope to be able to continue in mine 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.410
 in short these are mainly intentions 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.330
 things that struck me then were there 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.819
 other glazes other things however the glaze 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.410
 red combined with red lipstick with 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.180
 this little thing was things more 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.459
 nice for now I gave myself to 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.799
 Palettina seems to me already passed then 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.040
 near the tender exhibitor and I saw 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.380
 three posts or new noghera posts 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.410
 I have several, maybe I'll show you 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.420
 in a video, I do n't remember any expenses 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.030
 I often remember having these posts 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.340
 not even if I add up, I'm not sorry 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.590
 some are really nice 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.840
 this in particular one of the new e 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.530
 from a plot a little bit different 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.400
 to the others 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.680
 and that's how these are the colors are 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.989
 all completely mart 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.120
 I know shot in the store and I have to say that 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.480
 it was precisely writers yes but not 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.420
 I wanted to buy but when you try it 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.230
 blossomed I could not leave it there 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.329
 these new deaths completely made 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.829
 I don't know how they can make it now 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.220
 on the eye also of this me 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.829
 would like to make a video a trick 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.480
 together we will peel them 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.130
 together we talk 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.170
 I don't know why I saw it when I saw it 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.100
 thought agate this little stick could 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.470
 do for you 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.620
 I would have seen her well on her I don't have 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.970
 absolutely its colors 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.799
 but I let myself be tempted 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.680
 because I liked it they even gave me 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:53.299
 two maps with the new gran e lipsticks 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:04:00.799
 there are three colors that are the 368 baby 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:03.680
 pink the 325 rouge kiss and 344 sexy cora e 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.569
 we will try them again we will try together too 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.909
 because of this tactic 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:16.669
 line here I assume that the 362 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:19.669
 cherry pink this is the case I have 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.160
 purchased the 362 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.370
 here it is this here is the rossettini 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.880
 which is a dark color with micro 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.880
 glitter 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:38.570
 here is perhaps so here it is in the collection 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:42.259
 new of estée lauder instead in which 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.610
 there were a couple of sticks a couple of 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.120
 smartphone among other things I liked 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.289
 very much, however, I repeat the discussion on 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:58.370
 there were also 8 lipsticks, enamels 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:05:03.560
 new of these though color sendings has me 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.810
 got one here here marasà 460 I like 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.030
 because a dark color the free 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.300
 I often use it often 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.699
 dark colors on the lips and this the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.000
 then applied lipstick you will see that it is not 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.050
 as sure as it may seem then it is 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.909
 released at the yves saint collection 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.970
 laurent in ron stall dumped me 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:25.130
 it looks like two stakes in the two mascara two 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.960
 enamels one among other Lombard 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.150
 beautiful and 4 matt lipsticks of the 4th 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.970
 mate lipsticks there was a very nice mood 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:40.880
 I liked an old rose too 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.550
 a brick red 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.099
 and yet I liked that just that 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.860
 he already has several of these reds 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.889
 matt lipsey nolan while not 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.320

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:59.030
 of the collection if I can open it 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.909

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:30.139

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:35.959

 Hello
