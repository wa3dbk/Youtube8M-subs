00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that feels more like a simulation we

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
that feels more like a simulation we
think<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.579> achieved<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> goals<00:01:00.539> because

last editions we had we had a type of
physics<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.189> cool

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
physics that cool

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
physics that cool
2<00:01:28.460> pairs<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.790> love<00:01:30.000> simulation<00:01:30.540> also<00:01:31.310> but

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
2 pairs that love simulation also but

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
2 pairs that love simulation also but
maybe

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
maybe

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.349 
maybe
it<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.649> too<00:01:34.890> stressing<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.549> people<00:01:36.179> that

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
it was too stressing for people that

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.300 
it was too stressing for people that
have<00:01:36.539> a<00:01:36.750> better<00:01:37.200> feeling<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.740> arcade<00:01:38.070> games

will<00:04:08.770> like<00:04:09.770> to<00:04:10.100> try<00:04:10.370> even<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.270> simulation

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
will like to try even the simulation

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.600 
will like to try even the simulation
mode<00:04:11.960> so<00:04:12.410> they<00:04:12.530> can<00:04:12.680> start<00:04:12.890> with<00:04:13.070> simulation

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610

from<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.490> bike<00:04:25.670> then<00:04:26.570> you<00:04:27.230> can<00:04:27.410> move<00:04:27.620> to

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920

have full simulation setting but

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.960 
have full simulation setting but
automatic<00:04:47.560> rider<00:04:48.560> movement<00:04:49.220> or<00:04:49.430> automatic

yourself at home you can really

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.420 
yourself at home you can really
customize<00:04:53.900> your<00:04:54.200> experience<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.100> have<00:04:55.220> what

customize your experience to have what

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.170 
customize your experience to have what
you<00:04:55.580> want
