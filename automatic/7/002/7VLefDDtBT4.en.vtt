00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:28.000 

oh<00:03:26.209> look<00:03:27.209> look<00:03:27.480> at<00:03:27.599> this

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.360 

so<00:03:38.930> here<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.740> like<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.280> know<00:03:40.930> executor<00:03:41.930> of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
so here is like I know executor of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.160 
so here is like I know executor of
be<00:03:43.760> reasonable<00:03:43.909> figure<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.720> guess<00:03:47.959> that's

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
be reasonable figure so I guess that's

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.839 
be reasonable figure so I guess that's
the<00:03:48.440> multiplayer<00:03:49.099> characters<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:49.730> could
