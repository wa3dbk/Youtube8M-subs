you would wanted to you could leave this

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.830 
you would wanted to you could leave this
open<00:02:42.989> in<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.739> middle<00:02:43.860> um<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.660> my

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
open in the middle um this is just my

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.630 
open in the middle um this is just my
basic<00:02:46.080> idea<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.980> said<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.489> can<00:02:47.519> change<00:02:48.120> it

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
basic idea like I said you can change it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.030 
basic idea like I said you can change it
so<00:02:50.640> yeah<00:02:50.670> there's<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.769> had

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
so yeah there's that and then if you had

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.380 
so yeah there's that and then if you had
wanted<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.610> give<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.910> little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.269> more

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
wanted to give it a little bit more

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:04.190 
wanted to give it a little bit more
character<00:03:01.100> hold<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.280> all<00:03:03.180> right<00:03:03.239> yeah<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.049> if

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
character hold on all right yeah so if

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.449 
character hold on all right yeah so if
you<00:03:04.319> had<00:03:04.440> wanted<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.860> give<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.160> little<00:03:05.280> bit

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
you had wanted to give it a little bit

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.420 
you had wanted to give it a little bit
more<00:03:05.580> character<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.660> can<00:03:06.870> put<00:03:07.100> some<00:03:08.100> stone

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
more character you can put some stone

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.090 
more character you can put some stone
slabs<00:03:08.819> up<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.330> just<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.230> make<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.410> look<00:03:10.560> you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
really wanted to like I said the brick

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.520 
really wanted to like I said the brick
slabs<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.670> brick<00:03:18.450> stairs<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.049> stuff<00:03:19.260> will<00:03:19.440> be

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
slabs and brick stairs and stuff will be

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.030 
slabs and brick stairs and stuff will be
coming<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:20.790> one<00:03:21.060> point<00:03:21.299> eight<00:03:21.420> point<00:03:21.720> two<00:03:22.040> next

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
coming in one point eight point two next

you're<00:03:23.130> going<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.280> want<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.459> make<00:03:23.579> an<00:03:23.730> infinite

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you're going to want to make an infinite

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.789 
you're going to want to make an infinite
water<00:03:24.329> source<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.230> what<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.739> to

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
water source so what you're going to

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.759 
water source so what you're going to
want<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.070> do<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.519> put<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.299> bucket<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.170> water<00:03:28.380> in

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
want to do is put a bucket of water in

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.420 
want to do is put a bucket of water in
one<00:03:29.310> corner<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:31.200> then<00:03:31.980> you're<00:03:32.160> going<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> want

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
one corner and then you're going to want

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.420 
one corner and then you're going to want
to<00:03:32.489> take<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:33.470> bucket<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.650> water<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.100> put<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.340> in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to take a bucket of water and put it in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.400 
to take a bucket of water and put it in
the<00:03:35.549> other<00:03:35.850> corner<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:37.049> makes<00:03:37.260> an

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
the other corner and then makes an

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.300 
the other corner and then makes an
infinite<00:03:37.739> water<00:03:37.890> source<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.640> take<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.420> and

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
infinite water source so take that and

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.360 
infinite water source so take that and
this<00:03:41.310> well<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:42.019> basically<00:03:43.019> done<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:44.100> can<00:03:44.250> add

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
this well is basically done you can add

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.180 
this well is basically done you can add
some<00:03:44.549> torches<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.660> see<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.959> at<00:03:46.079> night

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
some torches so you can see it at night

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.789 
some torches so you can see it at night
this<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.609> be<00:03:47.640> changed<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.359> any<00:03:48.480> way<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:49.230> want

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
this can be changed in any way you want

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.460 
this can be changed in any way you want
it<00:03:49.890> this<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.269> case<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:51.989> sperm

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
it this just in case like it's sperm

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.520 
it this just in case like it's sperm
urgencies<00:03:53.160> really<00:03:53.930> in<00:03:54.930> case<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.410> would

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
urgencies really in case you would

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.030 
urgencies really in case you would
really<00:03:56.010> really<00:03:56.400> needed<00:03:56.940> water<00:03:57.859> you<00:03:58.859> can

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
really really needed water you can

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.720 
really really needed water you can
change<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.549> in<00:03:59.640> any<00:03:59.700> way<00:04:00.560> such<00:04:01.560> as<00:04:01.769> I'm<00:04:02.489> not

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
change it in any way such as I'm not

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.759 
change it in any way such as I'm not
going<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.940> do<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.180> but<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.900> even<00:04:04.109> make<00:04:04.500> it

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
going to do it but you can even make it

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.210 
going to do it but you can even make it
deeper<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.819> add<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.840> ladder

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
deeper and add a ladder

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.890 
deeper and add a ladder
and<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.850> can<00:04:08.970> make<00:04:09.120> an<00:04:09.240> infinite<00:04:09.720> water

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
and you can make an infinite water

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.800 
and you can make an infinite water
source<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:11.100> know<00:04:11.220> like<00:04:11.580> 10<00:04:11.970> or<00:04:12.300> 12<00:04:12.330> blocks

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
source you know like 10 or 12 blocks

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.009 
source you know like 10 or 12 blocks
below<00:04:13.290> ground<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:15.690> seem<00:04:15.990> a

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
below ground and that would seem a

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.699 
below ground and that would seem a
little<00:04:16.200> bit<00:04:16.410> more<00:04:16.530> realistic<00:04:17.060> but<00:04:18.060> I'm<00:04:18.720> sorry

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
little bit more realistic but I'm sorry

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.050 
little bit more realistic but I'm sorry
but<00:04:20.220> yeah<00:04:20.609> that's<00:04:20.970> basically<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.630> um<00:04:23.060> thank

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060
