00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.650 
you see that uh that snare is cinched
down<00:01:58.100> on<00:01:58.730> that<00:01:59.090> stick<00:01:59.590> nice<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.160> tight<00:02:01.660> this

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
down on that stick nice and tight this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.450 
down on that stick nice and tight this
was<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.930> one<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.260> had<00:02:03.410> set<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.280> damn

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
was the one that I had set on the damn

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.150 
was the one that I had set on the damn
crossover<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:05.720> obviously<00:02:06.170> what<00:02:06.740> happened<00:02:07.070> is

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
crossover and obviously what happened is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.490 
crossover and obviously what happened is
the<00:02:07.280> beaver<00:02:07.460> swam<00:02:08.030> through<00:02:08.420> would<00:02:09.080> stick<00:02:09.380> in

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
the beaver swam through would stick in

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.090 
the beaver swam through would stick in
his<00:02:09.590> mouth<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.150> I<00:02:11.150> snared<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> stick<00:02:12.530> instead

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
his mouth and I snared the stick instead

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.240 
his mouth and I snared the stick instead
of<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.370> beaver<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:15.620> pretty<00:02:15.770> obvious<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
of the beaver so it's pretty obvious to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.640 
of the beaver so it's pretty obvious to
me<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.690> beaver<00:02:17.690> here<00:02:17.900> have<00:02:18.020> been<00:02:18.200> harassed

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
me that beaver here have been harassed

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.699 
me that beaver here have been harassed
these<00:02:19.160> are<00:02:19.340> educated<00:02:20.030> beavers<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.350> what<00:02:21.620> I'm

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
these are educated beavers so what I'm

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.470 
these are educated beavers so what I'm
going<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.940> case<00:02:23.150> I'm<00:02:23.300> going<00:02:23.420> to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
going to do is in this case I'm going to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750 
going to do is in this case I'm going to

going<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.690> I'm<00:02:51.260> gonna<00:02:51.380> reset<00:02:51.830> this<00:02:51.980> cross<00:02:52.280> over

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
going to I'm gonna reset this cross over

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.030 
going to I'm gonna reset this cross over
for<00:02:52.790> example<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.690> I'm<00:02:53.959> gonna<00:02:54.050> put<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> TSA<00:02:54.680> t5

what they've got in their mouth as long

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.330 
what they've got in their mouth as long
as<00:03:02.299> they<00:03:02.390> step<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.930> they're<00:03:03.080> caught<00:03:03.340> so

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
as they step on it they're caught so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.229 
as they step on it they're caught so
anyway<00:03:05.260> one<00:03:06.260> muskrat<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.920> one<00:03:07.100> kit<00:03:07.370> that's<00:03:08.000> it

for this morning we'll try it again
tomorrow<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:11.090> guess<00:03:11.510> that's<00:03:11.720> why<00:03:11.840> they<00:03:12.019> call<00:03:12.170> it

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
tomorrow I guess that's why they call it

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.640 
tomorrow I guess that's why they call it
trapping<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:12.860> not<00:03:12.980> catching<00:03:13.220> huh<00:03:14.500> okay<00:03:15.500> I'm

every time so never underestimate the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.230 
every time so never underestimate the
blind<00:04:21.530> set<00:04:21.859> especially<00:04:22.730> when<00:04:22.910> dealing<00:04:23.060> with

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
blind set especially when dealing with

blind set especially when dealing with
educated<00:04:23.810> beaver<00:04:24.550> there's<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.610> better<00:04:25.790> look<00:04:25.970> at

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
educated beaver there's a better look at

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.390 
educated beaver there's a better look at
that<00:04:26.180> beaver<00:04:26.390> that<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.630> caught<00:04:26.900> on<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.530> with

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
that beaver that I caught on the with

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.190 
that beaver that I caught on the with
the<00:04:28.490> blind<00:04:28.730> foothold<00:04:29.419> set<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:29.840> see
