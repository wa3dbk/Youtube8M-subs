00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the lanyard on there in the blade he's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.680 
the lanyard on there in the blade he's
got<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> bead<00:02:28.170> blast<00:02:28.470> finish<00:02:29.420> Kershaw<00:02:30.420> does

got the bead blast finish Kershaw does

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.810 
got the bead blast finish Kershaw does
the<00:02:30.840> bead<00:02:31.050> blast<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.620> lot<00:02:31.800> not<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.580> greatest

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the bead blast a lot not the greatest

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.580 
the bead blast a lot not the greatest
thing<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.240> world<00:02:33.300> because<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.140> opens<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
thing in the world because it opens the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.560 
thing in the world because it opens the
pores<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> still<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.090> will<00:02:36.270> lead

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
pores and the still and that will lead

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.120 
pores and the still and that will lead
to<00:02:36.600> rust<00:02:37.820> because<00:02:39.500> when<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.590> open<00:02:40.860> up<00:02:40.920> all<00:02:41.100> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
to rust because when you open up all the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.130 
to rust because when you open up all the
pores<00:02:41.460> throughout<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.000> still<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.050> to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
pores throughout the still it's going to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.070 
pores throughout the still it's going to
allow<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.320> water<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.460> sweat<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.150> stuff<00:02:45.600> to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
allow the water and sweat and stuff to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.620 
allow the water and sweat and stuff to
enter<00:02:46.440> them<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.770> when<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> wipe<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.120> down<00:02:48.360> you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
enter them and when you wipe it down you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.660 
enter them and when you wipe it down you
get<00:02:49.350> them<00:02:49.500> all<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:49.770> they're<00:02:50.070> down<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.490> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
get them all because they're down in the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.020 
get them all because they're down in the
stew<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.959> will<00:02:52.140> lead<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.380> rust<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.700> keep

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
stew and that will lead to rust and keep

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.080 
stew and that will lead to rust and keep
on<00:02:54.780> your<00:02:55.050> blade<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:55.920> kershaw<00:02:56.310> knives<00:02:56.550> require

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
USA and I love how the design on the

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.760 
USA and I love how the design on the
handles<00:04:59.849> it<00:05:00.419> kind<00:05:00.659> of<00:05:00.690> like<00:05:00.840> reminds<00:05:01.169> me<00:05:01.409> of<00:05:01.620> a

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
handles it kind of like reminds me of a

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.779 
handles it kind of like reminds me of a
spider<00:05:02.520> web<00:05:02.729> design<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:04.340> if<00:05:05.340> you've<00:05:05.520> watched

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
spider web design and if you've watched

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.610 
spider web design and if you've watched
my<00:05:06.060> other<00:05:06.090> videos<00:05:06.629> you<00:05:06.659> know<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:06.960> have<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.259> thing

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
my other videos you know I have a thing

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.059 
my other videos you know I have a thing
for<00:05:07.830> spider<00:05:08.099> webs<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.610> spiders<00:05:09.319> so<00:05:10.319> it's<00:05:10.770> even

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
for spider webs and spiders so it's even

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.559 
for spider webs and spiders so it's even
see<00:05:11.219> it's<00:05:11.340> got<00:05:11.430> like<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.759> spider<00:05:12.000> web<00:05:12.270> design

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
see it's got like the spider web design

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.600 
see it's got like the spider web design
that's<00:05:12.780> what<00:05:12.930> first<00:05:13.139> drew<00:05:13.770> me<00:05:14.009> to<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.219> was<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
that's what first drew me to it was the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.249 
that's what first drew me to it was the
design<00:05:14.909> on<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.150> handle<00:05:17.449> it's<00:05:18.449> got<00:05:18.599> no<00:05:18.750> liners

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.070 
design on the handle it's got no liners
or<00:05:19.379> nothing<00:05:19.740> you'd<00:05:19.860> really<00:05:20.129> don't<00:05:20.340> need<00:05:20.550> them

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080

clip off get you a dremel get you some

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.329 
clip off get you a dremel get you some
sandpaper<00:07:02.719> sand<00:07:03.110> it<00:07:03.229> down<00:07:03.259> and<00:07:03.680> you'll<00:07:04.219> have

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:04.339

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
your stainless clip but I don't think it

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:06.999 
your stainless clip but I don't think it
