00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
couple of limitations that made them a

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.740 
couple of limitations that made them a
little<00:01:13.040> more<00:01:13.160> difficult<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.700> use<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:14.660> we

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
little more difficult to use so we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.480 
little more difficult to use so we
started<00:01:15.020> thinking<00:01:15.140> about<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:16.250> built

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
started thinking about it and we built

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.390 
started thinking about it and we built
an<00:01:16.610> extension<00:01:17.060> onto<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:18.170> rim<00:01:18.350> protector<00:01:18.800> to

that we wanted to do with this product
was<00:02:00.320> make<00:02:01.160> a<00:02:01.190> chain<00:02:01.520> breaker<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.970> was<00:02:02.060> really

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
was make a chain breaker that was really

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.230 
was make a chain breaker that was really
easy<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.600> use<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.200> also<00:02:03.650> was<00:02:04.430> pretty<00:02:05.090> much<00:02:05.180> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
easy to use and also was pretty much a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.000 
easy to use and also was pretty much a
one-piece<00:02:05.930> unit<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.740> didn't<00:02:06.950> have

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
one-piece unit so that you didn't have

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.889 
one-piece unit so that you didn't have
to<00:02:07.160> be<00:02:07.250> searching<00:02:07.640> around<00:02:07.760> your<00:02:08.060> toolbox<00:02:08.539> when

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
to be searching around your toolbox when

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.960 
to be searching around your toolbox when
you<00:02:09.019> were<00:02:09.170> looking<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.739> have<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.610> go<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.849> break

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
you were looking to have to go and break

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.680 
you were looking to have to go and break
a<00:02:11.030> chain<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.470> PBR<00:02:12.860> chain<00:02:13.099> breaker<00:02:13.400> has<00:02:14.150> a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
a chain so the PBR chain breaker has a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.380 
a chain so the PBR chain breaker has a
special<00:02:15.470> block<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.489> position<00:02:16.879> in
