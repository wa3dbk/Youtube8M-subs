00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
a quite quite a good start yeah and then

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.190 
a quite quite a good start yeah and then
the<00:00:41.969> pace<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.300> good<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> rest

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the pace was good for the for the rest

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.420 
the pace was good for the for the rest
in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> city<00:00:43.559> where<00:00:43.800> he<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.040> taking<00:00:44.309> with

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
in the city where he was taking with

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
in the city where he was taking with
them<00:00:44.460> yeah<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.360> pace<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.809> good<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
them yeah the pace was good in the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
them yeah the pace was good in the
beginning<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.579> taking<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> first

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
beginning I was taking with the first

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
beginning I was taking with the first
two<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> gap<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:50.250> i

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
two but then there was a gap because i

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
two but then there was a gap because i
think<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> tire<00:00:51.120> pressure<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.750> something

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
think the tire pressure or something

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
think the tire pressure or something
went<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.829> front<00:00:53.100> tires<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.670> i<00:00:53.879> had<00:00:54.360> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
went up with my front tires and i had a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.880 
went up with my front tires and i had a
lot<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> understeer<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.710> had<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
lot of understeer and I really had to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.860 
lot of understeer and I really had to
stop<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> car<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.969> started<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.719> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
stop the car and we started because I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.599 
stop the car and we started because I
couldn't<00:00:58.140> carry<00:00:58.350> speed<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
couldn't carry speed because of the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.270 
couldn't carry speed because of the
understeer<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.329> managed<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> stayed

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
understeer but I managed it and stayed

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.810 
understeer but I managed it and stayed
in<00:01:02.460> p3<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.539> ok<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.280> you're<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
in p3 so it's ok and so you're in the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.960 
in p3 so it's ok and so you're in the
first<00:01:06.060> stint<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:07.200> had<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> rainfall<00:01:08.010> well

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
first stint and we had the rainfall well

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
first stint and we had the rainfall well
you're<00:01:09.090> driving<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.479> slicks<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you're driving on slicks you see the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
you're driving on slicks you see the
rain<00:01:10.830> coming<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.430> put<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> wipers<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.119> then

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
rain coming you put the wipers on then

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270 
rain coming you put the wipers on then
it's<00:01:12.479> almost<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> flooded<00:01:13.830> track<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's almost like a flooded track on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.359 
it's almost like a flooded track on
slicks<00:01:14.780> how<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.049> judge<00:01:16.409> whether<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.130> need

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
slicks how do you judge whether you need

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
slicks how do you judge whether you need
to<00:01:17.490> come<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.509> wet<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.200> prepared<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
to come in for wet or you're prepared to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
to come in for wet or you're prepared to
stay<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.220> until<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> pitstop<00:01:21.060> window

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
stay out until the pitstop window

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.710 
stay out until the pitstop window
actually<00:01:21.750> opens<00:01:22.820> yeah<00:01:23.820> i<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.330> it's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
actually opens yeah i think it's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.990 
actually opens yeah i think it's
difficult<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.530> didn't<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.100> didn't<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
difficult I didn't I I didn't have it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
difficult I didn't I I didn't have it
when<00:01:27.180> i<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.450> driving<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.140> no<00:01:28.439> rain<00:01:28.650> but

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
when i was driving there was no rain but

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.149 
when i was driving there was no rain but
this<00:01:29.460> time<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.259> it's<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.500> difficult<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this time but it's really difficult to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.429 
this time but it's really difficult to
judge<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.720> feel<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.229> one

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
judge you know you can feel it at one

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.950 
judge you know you can feel it at one
point<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.369> too<00:01:35.579> much<00:01:35.610> water<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
point if there's too much water you and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560 
point if there's too much water you and
if<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> cannot<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.369> too<00:01:38.579> much<00:01:38.610> risk<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
if you cannot if it's too much risk to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.600 
if you cannot if it's too much risk to
stay<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.930> track<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.070> feel<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
stay on track so then you feel that you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.609 
stay on track so then you feel that you
have<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.820> come<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.570> possible<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.259> we

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
have to come in if it's possible and we

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
have to come in if it's possible and we
stay<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:44.939> difficult<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
stay out so it's really difficult to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
stay out so it's really difficult to
judge<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> depends<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.220> gap<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
judge and it depends on the gap to the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.679 
judge and it depends on the gap to the
pit<00:01:48.720> window<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.500> yeah<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
pit window so yeah and then when a you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
pit window so yeah and then when a you
took<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> car<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.680> put<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> great<00:01:53.820> move

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
took over the car and put a great move

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
took over the car and put a great move
on<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.360> max<00:01:54.600> book<00:01:54.780> around<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> outside<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
on on max book around the outside of the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.679 
on on max book around the outside of the
chicane<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.189> mean<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.090> could<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
chicane I mean we could see that the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.660 
chicane I mean we could see that the
mysterious<00:01:58.170> was<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.770> slower<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> wet

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
mysterious was a bit slower in the wet

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
mysterious was a bit slower in the wet
conditions<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.329> were<00:02:00.450> apparently<00:02:00.930> much

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
conditions we were apparently much

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.219 
conditions we were apparently much
faster<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.820> tried<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.420> three<00:02:03.659> laps<00:02:03.899> but

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
faster and I tried it to three laps but

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.670 
faster and I tried it to three laps but
was<00:02:05.009> no<00:02:05.189> way<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.399> me<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> end<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
was no way for me but at the end a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.380 
was no way for me but at the end a
single<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> fair<00:02:08.550> fight<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.179> was<00:02:09.330> very

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
single was a fair fight it was very

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.780 
single was a fair fight it was very
close<00:02:09.750> fight<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.129> know<00:02:11.250> each<00:02:11.370> other<00:02:11.580> from

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
close fight but we know each other from

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.090 
close fight but we know each other from
the<00:02:11.970> GT<00:02:12.239> german<00:02:12.629> GGG

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
the GT german GGG

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.800 
the GT german GGG
chip<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.760> all<00:02:13.880> always<00:02:14.300> fighting<00:02:14.720> like

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
chip and we all always fighting like

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.500 
chip and we all always fighting like
that<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.170> he<00:02:15.590> left<00:02:15.800> me<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.430> space<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.330> dive

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
that and he left me the space to to dive

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
that and he left me the space to to dive
in<00:02:17.690> into<00:02:17.810> chicane<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.650> think<00:02:18.950> was<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.100> favor

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
in into chicane and I think was a favor

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.340 
in into chicane and I think was a favor
yeah<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.420> was<00:02:20.540> nice<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.840> see<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:20.990> actually

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
yeah it was nice to see that actually

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.660 
yeah it was nice to see that actually
because<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.530> lot<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:21.740> drivers<00:02:22.010> could<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:22.460> just

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
because a lot of drivers could have just

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.980 
because a lot of drivers could have just
sort<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.000> squeezed<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.510> out<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.840> you'd<00:02:23.930> have

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
sort of squeezed you out and you'd have

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.930 
sort of squeezed you out and you'd have
been<00:02:24.110> bouncing<00:02:24.470> over<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.740> grass<00:02:24.920> yeah<00:02:25.700> that's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
been bouncing over the grass yeah that's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.820 
been bouncing over the grass yeah that's
what<00:02:26.120> at<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.390> wing<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.720> mean<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:27.290> you're<00:02:27.500> used

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
what at the wing I mean if you're used

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.650 
what at the wing I mean if you're used
to<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.520> we<00:02:28.910> are<00:02:29.210> used<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.570> because

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
to that and we are used to that because

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.270 
to that and we are used to that because
we're<00:02:29.960> driving<00:02:30.260> together<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:30.650> several

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
we're driving together in several

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.330 
we're driving together in several
championships<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.210> if<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.260> play<00:02:33.440> fair<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.980> to

championships and if you play fair to to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.630 
championships and if you play fair to to
your<00:02:34.630> competitor<00:02:35.630> they<00:02:36.110> also<00:02:36.890> play<00:02:37.250> fair<00:02:37.490> to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
your competitor they also play fair to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.130 
your competitor they also play fair to
you<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.910> that's<00:02:38.090> what's<00:02:38.390> what's<00:02:38.900> nice<00:02:39.110> about

thought job done Renee's you know

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.250 
thought job done Renee's you know
Renee's<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.150> lead<00:02:44.330> he's<00:02:44.600> gonna<00:02:44.780> cruise

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
Renee's in the lead he's gonna cruise

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.290 
Renee's in the lead he's gonna cruise
home<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:46.130> wasn't<00:02:46.430> quite<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:46.640> easy<00:02:46.970> I

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
home but it wasn't quite that easy I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.260 
home but it wasn't quite that easy I
sorts<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.200> same<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.670> mean<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.820> saw<00:02:49.970> nobody

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270

memories<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:51.020> was<00:02:51.500> like<00:02:51.680> five<00:02:51.890> seconds<00:02:52.250> ahead<00:02:52.340> I

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
memories I was like five seconds ahead I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.580 
memories I was like five seconds ahead I
said<00:02:52.760> okay<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.150> cool<00:02:53.750> down<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.200> just<00:02:54.410> bring

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
said okay now cool down and just bring

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the car home and two left after the beam

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.570 
the car home and two left after the beam
WS<00:02:57.110> behind<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.710> I<00:02:57.800> was<00:02:57.980> just<00:02:58.010> surprised

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
WS behind and I was just surprised

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.790 
WS behind and I was just surprised
because<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:59.060> was<00:02:59.300> just<00:02:59.480> trying<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.290> go<00:03:00.440> no<00:03:00.620> risk

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
because I was just trying to go no risk

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.130 
because I was just trying to go no risk
and<00:03:01.040> apparently<00:03:01.910> he<00:03:01.940> told<00:03:02.330> me<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:03.050> he

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
and apparently he told me just that he

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.410 
and apparently he told me just that he
was<00:03:03.290> taking<00:03:03.560> high<00:03:03.830> risk<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.330> driving<00:03:05.330> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
was taking high risk and driving the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.630 
was taking high risk and driving the
same<00:03:05.630> line<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.680> same<00:03:06.890> pace<00:03:07.100> as<00:03:07.130> in<00:03:07.490> dry

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
same line and same pace as in dry

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.520 
same line and same pace as in dry
condition<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.360> was<00:03:08.840> possible<00:03:09.260> but<00:03:09.320> I

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
condition and it was possible but I

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.590 
condition and it was possible but I
didn't<00:03:09.830> know<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.490> when<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:10.970> was<00:03:11.090> behind<00:03:11.240> and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
didn't know so when you was behind and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600 
didn't know so when you was behind and
and<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.960> okay<00:03:12.230> now<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> can<00:03:12.680> maybe<00:03:13.220> go<00:03:13.460> bit

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
and you okay now I can maybe go bit

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.330 
and you okay now I can maybe go bit
faster<00:03:14.380> Randy<00:03:15.380> what<00:03:15.470> I've<00:03:15.620> we<00:03:15.890> thought<00:03:16.160> you

were doing very commenting on it was

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.260 
were doing very commenting on it was
that<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:18.320> were<00:03:18.440> driving<00:03:18.680> on<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.250> precise<00:03:19.790> dry

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
that you were driving on the precise dry

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.350 
that you were driving on the precise dry
line<00:03:20.510> not<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.960> wheel<00:03:21.290> an<00:03:21.620> inch<00:03:22.160> off<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:23.240> were

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
line not a wheel an inch off you were

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.840 
line not a wheel an inch off you were
forcing<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.140> BMW<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:25.340> he<00:03:25.430> was<00:03:25.580> going<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
forcing the BMW to if he was going to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.270 
forcing the BMW to if he was going to
pass<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.300> take<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.480> high-risk<00:03:26.930> maneuver<00:03:27.800> he

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
pass to take a high-risk maneuver he

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.160 
pass to take a high-risk maneuver he
didn't<00:03:28.610> do<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.240> was<00:03:29.600> surprising<00:03:30.140> was

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
didn't do it but I was surprising was

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.890 
didn't do it but I was surprising was
the<00:03:30.320> pace<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.710> the<00:03:30.800> BMW<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:32.420> was<00:03:32.690> very

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
the pace of the BMW it was very

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.230 
the pace of the BMW it was very
surprising<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.650> mean<00:03:33.980> as<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.550> said<00:03:34.730> he<00:03:34.880> was<00:03:34.910> she

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
surprising I mean as I said he was she

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.300 
surprising I mean as I said he was she
was<00:03:35.420> just<00:03:35.630> flying<00:03:35.900> within<00:03:36.560> two<00:03:36.890> laps<00:03:37.100> he

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
was just flying within two laps he

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.850 
was just flying within two laps he
closed<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.700> gap<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:37.970> five<00:03:38.150> seconds<00:03:38.660> but<00:03:38.860> I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
closed the gap of five seconds but I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.530 
closed the gap of five seconds but I
think<00:03:40.100> he<00:03:40.160> just<00:03:40.340> took<00:03:40.520> more<00:03:40.790> risk<00:03:41.000> than<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.300> did

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
think he just took more risk than I did

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.020 
think he just took more risk than I did
apparently<00:03:42.500> turned<00:03:42.770> seven<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.250> eight<00:03:43.370> was

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
apparently turned seven and eight was

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.270 
apparently turned seven and eight was
what<00:03:44.450> was<00:03:44.870> dry<00:03:45.350> already<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:45.890> i<00:03:45.920> thought<00:03:46.130> it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
what was dry already but i thought it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.580 
what was dry already but i thought it
was<00:03:46.370> wet<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.850> was<00:03:47.060> always<00:03:47.270> going<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.410> the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
was wet so I was always going in the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.990 
was wet so I was always going in the
second<00:03:49.010> gear<00:03:49.160> through<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.430> corners<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:49.910> he

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
second gear through the corners and he

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.270 
second gear through the corners and he
was<00:03:50.180> applying<00:03:50.510> Lee<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.750> was<00:03:51.020> fourth<00:03:51.410> gear<00:03:51.680> in

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
was applying Lee I was fourth gear in

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.730 
was applying Lee I was fourth gear in
this<00:03:52.520> corner<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.330> lost<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.140> lot<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.320> time<00:03:54.590> in

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
this corner so I lost a lot of time in

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.110 
this corner so I lost a lot of time in
these<00:03:54.860> corners<00:03:55.250> but<00:03:55.490> it's<00:03:55.640> difficult<00:03:56.000> to

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
these corners but it's difficult to

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.110 
these corners but it's difficult to
judge<00:03:56.330> when<00:03:56.810> you're<00:03:56.930> driving<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:59.000> was

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
judge when you're driving and it was

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.540 
judge when you're driving and it was
with<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.480> view<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.440> track<00:04:00.770> didn't<00:04:01.160> didn't

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
with a view and the track didn't didn't

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.910 
with a view and the track didn't didn't
really<00:04:01.760> look<00:04:01.910> dry<00:04:02.180> so<00:04:02.600> i<00:04:02.630> was<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:02.960> careful

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
really look dry so i was just careful

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.470 
really look dry so i was just careful
how<00:04:04.310> much<00:04:04.520> when<00:04:04.850> you're<00:04:04.970> driving<00:04:05.180> i<00:04:05.360> was

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
how much when you're driving i was

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.060 
how much when you're driving i was
commentating<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:06.110> particularly<00:04:06.770> here<00:04:07.040> in

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
commentating that particularly here in

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.280 
commentating that particularly here in
zandvoort<00:04:07.490> weather<00:04:07.910> seems<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.270> come<00:04:08.480> from<00:04:08.510> to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
zandvoort weather seems to come from to

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.290 
zandvoort weather seems to come from to
the<00:04:09.440> north-northwest<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:11.030> when<00:04:11.180> you're

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
the north-northwest so when you're

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.390 
the north-northwest so when you're
coming<00:04:11.570> down<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.320> final<00:04:12.620> two<00:04:12.950> corners<00:04:13.310> you

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
coming down to the final two corners you

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.160 
coming down to the final two corners you
can<00:04:13.430> see<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.880> weather<00:04:14.030> coming<00:04:14.300> are<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.810> doing

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
can see the weather coming are you doing

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.960 
can see the weather coming are you doing
that<00:04:15.200> consciously<00:04:15.920> or<00:04:16.010> just<00:04:16.400> relying<00:04:16.760> on<00:04:16.880> the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
that consciously or just relying on the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.229 
that consciously or just relying on the
team<00:04:17.180> informing<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:18.160> both<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.520> mean<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:20.060> course

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
team informing you both I mean of course

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.080 
team informing you both I mean of course
it's<00:04:20.690> difficult<00:04:21.440> for<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.799> driver<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.610> look

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
it's difficult for the driver to to look

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.510 
it's difficult for the driver to to look
into<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.330> sky<00:04:23.419> during<00:04:23.870> your<00:04:24.200> drive

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
into the sky during your drive

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.059 
into the sky during your drive
but<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.389> team<00:04:26.960> literally<00:04:27.530> look<00:04:27.680> at<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.889> sky

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
but the team literally look at the sky

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.830 
but the team literally look at the sky
but<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.460> know<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.270> see<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.479> different

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
but you know you can see a different

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.439 
but you know you can see a different
shade<00:04:30.199> or<00:04:30.440> tone<00:04:30.710> yeah<00:04:31.699> I<00:04:31.729> know<00:04:32.060> what<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.240> mean

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
shade or tone yeah I know what you mean

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.430 
shade or tone yeah I know what you mean
but<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.740> did<00:04:34.159> it<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.490> had<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.090> small<00:04:35.629> look<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.050> I

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
but I did it I had a small look and I

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.589 
but I did it I had a small look and I
decided<00:04:36.770> where<00:04:37.460> we<00:04:37.580> decided<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.120> stay<00:04:38.569> on

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
decided where we decided to stay on

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.659 
decided where we decided to stay on
track<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.319> team<00:04:39.500> asked<00:04:39.800> me<00:04:39.889> what<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.370> want<00:04:40.580> to

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
track the team asked me what I want to

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.760 
track the team asked me what I want to
do<00:04:40.759> and<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.210> said<00:04:41.270> okay<00:04:41.599> we<00:04:41.780> stay<00:04:42.169> on<00:04:42.199> slicks

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
do and I said okay we stay on slicks

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.529 
do and I said okay we stay on slicks
because<00:04:43.069> the<00:04:43.190> track<00:04:43.400> was<00:04:43.550> still<00:04:43.789> a<00:04:44.000> little<00:04:44.330> bit

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
because the track was still a little bit

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.180 
because the track was still a little bit
dry<00:04:44.750> but<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.289> then<00:04:45.409> it<00:04:45.530> started<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.860> rain<00:04:46.039> again

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
dry but it then it started to rain again
