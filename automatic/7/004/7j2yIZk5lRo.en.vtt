00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
they're going to be in the correct

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.029

places<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> pass<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.780> does<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:03.989> could<00:01:04.170> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
places for a pass so does it could be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.690 
places for a pass so does it could be
frustrating<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> game<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> ball

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
frustrating in the game you on the ball

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.160 
frustrating in the game you on the ball
and<00:01:05.970> you've<00:01:06.420> got<00:01:06.510> no<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> pass<00:01:07.020> through

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and you've got no one to pass through

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710 
and you've got no one to pass through
but<00:01:07.229> hopefully<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:08.600> teammates<00:01:09.600> going

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
but hopefully now your teammates going

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.940 
but hopefully now your teammates going
to<00:01:09.810> make<00:01:09.930> smart<00:01:10.170> runs<00:01:10.409> without<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.710> having<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to make smart runs without you having to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.380 
to make smart runs without you having to
tell<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:11.369> obviously<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:11.820> tap<00:01:12.000> lb

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
tell them obviously you could tap lb

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.450 
tell them obviously you could tap lb
before<00:01:12.750> time<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> make<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> run<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> top

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
before time to make a run over the top

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190 
before time to make a run over the top
but<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.540> hopefully<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
but now they're gonna hopefully do that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.390 
but now they're gonna hopefully do that
sort<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.470> stuff<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.100> without<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
sort of stuff you know without you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700 
sort of stuff you know without you
having<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> tell<00:01:18.240> them<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.689> much<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.439> i<00:01:19.530> think

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
having to tell them so much and i think

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.929 
having to tell them so much and i think
that's<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:19.950> cool<00:01:20.220> i<00:01:20.250> mean<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.790> you're

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that's really cool i mean if you're

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.039

pressing<00:02:11.620> as<00:02:11.860> much<00:02:12.070> as<00:02:12.190> you'd<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:12.370> you're

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
pressing as much as you'd like you're

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.890

trying<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.940> win<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> ball<00:02:13.360> back<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.780> can

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
trying to win the ball back and that can

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.970 
trying to win the ball back and that can
be<00:02:13.930> very<00:02:14.020> frustrating<00:02:14.320> when<00:02:14.620> someone<00:02:14.890> tries

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
be very frustrating when someone tries

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.410 
be very frustrating when someone tries
to<00:02:15.040> do<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:16.090> think<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.300> many

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to do that for you I can think of many

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.880 
to do that for you I can think of many
occasions<00:02:16.930> I've<00:02:17.020> been<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> game<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.530> the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
occasions I've been in a game and the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.470 
occasions I've been in a game and the
person's<00:02:18.520> pack<00:02:18.700> pass<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.210> back<00:02:19.360> for

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
person's pack pass it on the back for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.520 
person's pack pass it on the back for
the<00:02:19.570> last<00:02:19.660> 20<00:02:19.990> minutes<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.290> it's<00:02:20.440> been

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the last 20 minutes and it's been

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.510 
the last 20 minutes and it's been
impossible<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:21.100> get<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> ball<00:02:21.400> back

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
impossible to get the ball back

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.580 
impossible to get the ball back
hopefully<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.030> make<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.510> lot<00:02:23.020> easier<00:02:23.050> your

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
hopefully to make it a lot easier your

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.010 
hopefully to make it a lot easier your
teammates<00:02:24.070> will<00:02:24.280> there<00:02:24.520> be<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:25.540> lot<00:02:25.720> smarter

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
teammates will there be a lot smarter

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.470 
teammates will there be a lot smarter
and<00:02:26.350> try<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.770> win<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.220> ball<00:02:27.370> back<00:02:27.550> more<00:02:28.300> time

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
and try and win the ball back more time

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.940 
and try and win the ball back more time
not<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.110> another<00:02:29.260> thing<00:02:29.350> you'll<00:02:29.560> notice<00:02:29.710> about

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
not so another thing you'll notice about

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.740 
not so another thing you'll notice about
the<00:02:30.250> gift<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:30.850> really<00:02:31.000> about<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.660> know

leave them with loads of options of who
to<00:02:38.680> pass<00:02:39.010> through<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.340> you're<00:02:39.490> gonna<00:02:39.610> your
