00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
subscribed you know I built this from

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.479 
subscribed you know I built this from
nothing<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.840> didn't<00:03:21.230> really<00:03:21.410> sign<00:03:22.280> up

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
nothing and so I didn't really sign up

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.309 
nothing and so I didn't really sign up
for<00:03:22.670> anything<00:03:22.880> because<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.600> didn't<00:03:23.930> ever<00:03:24.109> want

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
for anything because I didn't ever want

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.319 
for anything because I didn't ever want
to<00:03:24.500> give<00:03:24.769> anything<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.549> middleman<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.209> know

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
to give anything to a middleman you know

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.940 
to give anything to a middleman you know
and<00:03:27.400> with<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:28.760> many<00:03:28.940> publishers<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.720> fact<00:03:30.019> with

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
and with so many publishers in fact with

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.750 
and with so many publishers in fact with
every<00:03:31.549> other<00:03:31.700> publisher<00:03:32.299> not<00:03:33.019> doing<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.769> I

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
every other publisher not doing this I

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.090 
every other publisher not doing this I
just<00:03:35.600> think<00:03:35.840> it's<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.109> terrible<00:03:36.410> policy<00:03:36.799> and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
just think it's a terrible policy and

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.650 
just think it's a terrible policy and
here's<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.430> other<00:03:37.549> bad<00:03:37.880> thing<00:03:38.150> about<00:03:38.269> this

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
here's the other bad thing about this

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.809 
here's the other bad thing about this
because<00:03:39.139> if<00:03:39.530> Nintendo<00:03:39.980> ask<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.609> sign<00:03:40.760> up

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
because if Nintendo ask you to sign up

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
the right direction I've seen that

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.960 
the right direction I've seen that
comment<00:05:24.740> posted<00:05:25.070> more<00:05:25.250> than<00:05:25.310> once<00:05:25.669> or<00:05:25.820> twice

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
comment posted more than once or twice

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.860 
comment posted more than once or twice
and<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:27.350> think<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.370> is<00:05:28.610> absolutely<00:05:28.940> insane

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
and I think that is absolutely insane

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.400 
and I think that is absolutely insane
and<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:31.310> as<00:05:31.520> long<00:05:31.760> as<00:05:32.090> Nintendo<00:05:32.750> has<00:05:33.020> crazy

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
and so as long as Nintendo has crazy

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.890 
and so as long as Nintendo has crazy
insane<00:05:33.890> policies<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:35.060> know<00:05:35.210> you<00:05:35.270> won't<00:05:35.690> see<00:05:35.870> a

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
insane policies you know you won't see a

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.040 
insane policies you know you won't see a
Nintendo<00:05:36.440> video<00:05:36.590> on<00:05:37.070> this<00:05:37.310> channel<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:38.050> for

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
Nintendo video on this channel and for

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.590 
Nintendo video on this channel and for
anybody<00:05:39.500> else<00:05:39.740> who<00:05:40.039> publishes<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.880> game<00:05:41.360> who

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
anybody else who publishes a game who

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.120 
anybody else who publishes a game who
tries<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:41.990> go<00:05:42.080> down<00:05:42.260> this<00:05:42.380> path<00:05:42.440> I<00:05:42.830> think<00:05:43.039> it

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
tries to go down this path I think it

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.730 
tries to go down this path I think it
would<00:05:43.250> be<00:05:43.340> a<00:05:43.370> bad<00:05:43.910> mistake<00:05:44.570> and<00:05:45.169> you<00:05:45.350> won't<00:05:45.530> see

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
would be a bad mistake and you won't see

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.380 
would be a bad mistake and you won't see
their<00:05:46.039> videos<00:05:46.490> on<00:05:46.760> this<00:05:46.880> channel<00:05:46.940> either

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
their videos on this channel either

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.870 
their videos on this channel either
because<00:05:47.840> out<00:05:48.020> of<00:05:48.050> principle<00:05:48.650> I<00:05:48.979> won't<00:05:49.550> upload

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
because out of principle I won't upload

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.120 
because out of principle I won't upload
it<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:51.080> know<00:05:51.200> some<00:05:51.470> people<00:05:51.500> will<00:05:51.800> turn<00:05:51.979> that

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
it you know some people will turn that

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.890 
it you know some people will turn that
around<00:05:52.310> and<00:05:52.639> say<00:05:52.820> oh<00:05:52.850> well<00:05:53.270> you<00:05:53.450> must<00:05:53.660> just

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
around and say oh well you must just

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.840 
around and say oh well you must just
upload<00:05:54.260> videos<00:05:54.560> for<00:05:54.800> money<00:05:54.979> no<00:05:55.460> it's<00:05:55.700> the

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
upload videos for money no it's the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.330 
upload videos for money no it's the
principle<00:05:56.360> of<00:05:56.510> it<00:05:56.690> now<00:05:57.200> and<00:05:57.470> you<00:05:57.530> know<00:05:58.130> if

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
principle of it now and you know if

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.140 
principle of it now and you know if
anybody<00:05:58.910> if<00:05:59.150> nobody<00:05:59.720> else<00:05:59.900> is<00:06:00.139> doing<00:06:00.169> this

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
anybody if nobody else is doing this

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.460 
anybody if nobody else is doing this
there's<00:06:02.150> no<00:06:02.330> reason<00:06:02.690> for<00:06:02.840> Nintendo<00:06:03.260> to<00:06:03.320> be

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
there's no reason for Nintendo to be

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.430 
there's no reason for Nintendo to be
doing<00:06:03.770> it<00:06:03.889> okay<00:06:04.010> so<00:06:04.820> that's<00:06:05.360> where<00:06:05.660> I<00:06:05.690> stand<00:06:06.200> on

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
doing it okay so that's where I stand on

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.020 
doing it okay so that's where I stand on
it<00:06:06.650> and<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:07.130> don't<00:06:07.340> think<00:06:07.460> it's<00:06:07.639> a<00:06:07.669> step<00:06:07.850> in<00:06:07.910> the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
it and I don't think it's a step in the

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.730 
it and I don't think it's a step in the
right<00:06:08.180> direction<00:06:08.240> I<00:06:08.930> think<00:06:09.169> this<00:06:09.289> could<00:06:09.620> even

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
right direction I think this could even

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.100 
right direction I think this could even
hurt<00:06:10.100> him<00:06:10.220> even<00:06:10.400> further<00:06:10.760> and<00:06:11.120> it<00:06:11.690> just<00:06:11.930> sucks

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
hurt him even further and it just sucks

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.960 
hurt him even further and it just sucks
