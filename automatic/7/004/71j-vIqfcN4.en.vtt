that's<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.539> crystal<00:00:56.530> splash<00:00:56.710> here<00:00:57.609> is<00:00:57.909> the

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
that's the crystal splash here is the

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.180 
that's the crystal splash here is the
mirror<00:00:58.929> flash<00:00:59.230> this<00:01:00.159> is<00:01:00.219> basically<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.269> pearl

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
mirror flash this is basically a pearl

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.180 
mirror flash this is basically a pearl
material<00:01:03.190> that's<00:01:04.030> been<00:01:04.330> dyed<00:01:04.750> over<00:01:05.379> pearl<00:01:05.650> so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
material that's been dyed over pearl so

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.490 
material that's been dyed over pearl so
that's<00:01:06.820> why<00:01:06.970> we<00:01:07.120> call<00:01:07.300> it<00:01:07.330> mirror<00:01:07.750> it's<00:01:07.930> it's<00:01:08.230> I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
that's why we call it mirror it's it's I

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.010 
that's why we call it mirror it's it's I
use<00:01:08.740> this<00:01:09.010> probably<00:01:09.490> more<00:01:10.210> than<00:01:10.450> any<00:01:10.630> almost

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
use this probably more than any almost

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.960 
use this probably more than any almost
any<00:01:11.290> other<00:01:11.470> flash<00:01:11.800> and<00:01:12.100> all<00:01:12.190> of<00:01:12.310> my<00:01:12.460> different

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
any other flash and all of my different

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.890 
any other flash and all of my different
patterns

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
patterns

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.200 
patterns
there's<00:01:14.830> also<00:01:14.979> glow-in-the-dark<00:01:16.060> this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
there's also glow-in-the-dark this

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.020 
there's also glow-in-the-dark this
stuff's<00:01:16.450> cool<00:01:16.690> because<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:17.170> can<00:01:17.200> use<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.710> for

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
stuff's cool because you can use it for

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.640 
stuff's cool because you can use it for
laying<00:01:19.030> back<00:01:19.240> for<00:01:19.570> wings<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.050> can<00:01:20.170> also<00:01:20.320> use

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
laying back for wings you can also use

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.680 
laying back for wings you can also use
it<00:01:20.890> around<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.700> shank<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.360> hook<00:01:22.510> as<00:01:22.660> a

it around the shank of the hook as a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.460 
it around the shank of the hook as a
body<00:01:22.990> or<00:01:23.260> as<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.560> rib<00:01:23.920> which<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.430> nice<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:26.320> is

body or as a rib which is nice this is

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.380 
body or as a rib which is nice this is
called<00:01:26.710> bliss<00:01:27.010> and<00:01:27.190> gloss<00:01:27.730> this<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
called bliss and gloss this is a

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.670 
called bliss and gloss this is a
reinforced<00:01:29.290> fiber<00:01:29.650> as<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:32.100> mylar<00:01:33.100> spectra

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
reinforced fiber as is the mylar spectra

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.160 
reinforced fiber as is the mylar spectra
Specter<00:01:35.680> splash<00:01:35.980> which<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.460> right<00:01:36.670> here

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
Specter splash which is right here

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.530 
Specter splash which is right here
these<00:01:38.890> are<00:01:39.100> reinforced<00:01:39.940> so<00:01:40.090> they're<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.360> little

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
these are reinforced so they're a little

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.900 
these are reinforced so they're a little
bit<00:01:40.690> stronger<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.890> also<00:01:42.190> what<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:42.520> get<00:01:42.760> with

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
bit stronger and also what you get with

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.850 
bit stronger and also what you get with
these<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:43.420> get<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.810> little<00:01:44.170> bit<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.440> cranky

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
these is you get a little bit of cranky

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.310 
these is you get a little bit of cranky
creaky<00:01:45.460> nuts<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.820> them<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.840> can<00:01:46.870> see<00:01:47.230> in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
creaky nuts to them as you can see in

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.430 
creaky nuts to them as you can see in
this<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.610> adds<00:01:48.820> kind<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.330> scaling<00:01:49.930> look<00:01:50.170> so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
this it adds kind of a scaling look so

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.930 
this it adds kind of a scaling look so
that's<00:01:50.650> really<00:01:50.830> nice<00:01:51.100> when<00:01:51.370> you<00:01:51.460> use<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.790> and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
that's really nice when you use it and

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.580 
that's really nice when you use it and
on<00:01:52.090> minnows<00:01:52.480> and<00:01:52.510> such<00:01:53.580> we<00:01:54.580> have<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.910> normal

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
on minnows and such we have the normal

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.070 
on minnows and such we have the normal

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
metallic mylar motion my talvik mylar

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.380 
metallic mylar motion my talvik mylar
motion<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.620> very<00:01:59.860> similar<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.790> flash<00:02:01.090> blue

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
motion is very similar to flash blue

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
motion is very similar to flash blue
that<00:02:01.570> you're<00:02:01.660> gonna<00:02:01.780> see<00:02:01.990> all<00:02:02.110> over<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.280 
that you're gonna see all over the
country<00:02:03.000> basically<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.450> same<00:02:04.660> thing<00:02:04.960> we<00:02:05.170> have

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
country basically the same thing we have

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.350 
country basically the same thing we have
just<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.650> little<00:02:05.830> different<00:02:06.100> name<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.610> again

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
just a little different name on it again

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.540 
just a little different name on it again
it's<00:02:07.630> used<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.289> be<00:02:08.410> trailed<00:02:08.739> back<00:02:09.009> as<00:02:09.280> wings

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
it's used to be trailed back as wings

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.740 
it's used to be trailed back as wings
that's<00:02:09.940> used<00:02:10.179> as<00:02:10.390> body<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:10.929> used<00:02:11.200> as<00:02:11.379> ribs

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
that's used as body it's used as ribs

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.520 
that's used as body it's used as ribs
here<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.769> holographic<00:02:16.200> material<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.379> we

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
here is the holographic material that we

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.339 
here is the holographic material that we
sell<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.250> ton<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.360> again<00:02:19.720> use<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> lot<00:02:20.319> of

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
sell a ton of and I again use a lot of

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.760 
sell a ton of and I again use a lot of
this<00:02:20.620> particularly<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.430> so

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
this particularly and so

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.490 
this particularly and so
golde<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:23.120> very<00:02:23.330> flashy<00:02:23.630> kneeling<00:02:24.320> what<00:02:24.470> a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
golde it's very flashy kneeling what a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.260 
golde it's very flashy kneeling what a
little<00:02:24.830> bit<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.130> their<00:02:25.370> comes<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.090> two

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
little bit on their comes in two

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.290 
little bit on their comes in two
different<00:02:26.600> diameters<00:02:28.480> 1/64<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.630> 1/32<00:02:31.300> 1/64

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
different diameters 1/64 and 1/32 1/64

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.600 
different diameters 1/64 and 1/32 1/64
is<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.720> fine<00:02:32.960> which<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.410> use<00:02:33.620> more<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.160> than<00:02:34.460> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
is the fine which I use more of than the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.540 
is the fine which I use more of than the
the<00:02:35.270> slightly<00:02:35.660> heavier<00:02:35.960> material<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:37.400> then

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
the slightly heavier material and then

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.030 
the slightly heavier material and then
we<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.820> DNA<00:02:38.650> there's<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.710> number<00:02:39.920> of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
we have DNA there's a number of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.070 
we have DNA there's a number of
different<00:02:40.130> types<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:40.730> DNA<00:02:40.910> we<00:02:41.450> import<00:02:41.870> this

is I'll cut a v-notch in the top of the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.470 
is I'll cut a v-notch in the top of the
bag<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.620> then<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.130> stick<00:03:04.370> my<00:03:04.520> set<00:03:04.790> scissors<00:03:05.270> up

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
bag and then I stick my set scissors up

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.210 
bag and then I stick my set scissors up
into<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.080> bag<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.560> pull<00:03:06.800> some<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
into the bag and I pull some of the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.580 
into the bag and I pull some of the
material<00:03:07.670> out<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.870> way<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.200> rest<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.500> the

material out that way the rest of the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.590 
material out that way the rest of the
material<00:03:10.010> stays<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.520> good<00:03:10.700> condition<00:03:11.210> in<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
material stays in good condition in the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.950 
material stays in good condition in the
bag<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.080> clean<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.760> ready<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.150> use<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.810> then

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
bag it's clean and ready to use and then

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.750 
bag it's clean and ready to use and then
I<00:03:15.050> can<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.440> sort<00:03:15.650> out<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> little<00:03:16.190> bit<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.550> this

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
I can just sort out a little bit of this

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.570 
I can just sort out a little bit of this
and<00:03:17.390> use<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.140> as<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.620> need<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.280> lot<00:03:19.460> of

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
and use it as I need it and a lot of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.790 
and use it as I need it and a lot of
times<00:03:19.790> what<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.030> do<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:21.260> all<00:03:21.530> kind<00:03:21.770> of

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
times what I do with this is all kind of

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.650 
times what I do with this is all kind of
chunk<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.670> only<00:03:22.820> cut<00:03:23.090> about<00:03:23.240> half<00:03:23.540> of

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
chunk of it and I only cut about half of

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.140 
chunk of it and I only cut about half of
what<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.840> think<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.260> need<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.460> Center<00:03:25.940> tie

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
what I think I need because I Center tie

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.030 
what I think I need because I Center tie
it<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.720> tie<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.020> right<00:03:27.290> there<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.800> then<00:03:27.950> I

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
it and I tie it right there and then I

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.760 
it and I tie it right there and then I
fold<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.520> back<00:03:28.670> over<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:29.180> itself<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.590> I

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
fold it back over on itself so that I

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.370 
fold it back over on itself so that I
get<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> whole<00:03:31.310> great<00:03:31.790> big<00:03:31.820> wing<00:03:32.390> out<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.930> and

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
get a whole great big wing out of it and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.530 
get a whole great big wing out of it and
because<00:03:34.100> it's<00:03:34.430> Center<00:03:34.730> tied<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.150> will<00:03:35.300> never

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
because it's Center tied it will never

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.020 
because it's Center tied it will never
ever<00:03:35.810> pull<00:03:36.170> out<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:36.740> that's<00:03:37.490> kind<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:37.910> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
ever pull out so that's kind of a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.910 
ever pull out so that's kind of a
durability<00:03:38.480> issue<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.200> lot<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.560> patterns

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
durability issue on a lot of patterns

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.520 
durability issue on a lot of patterns
that<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.510> as<00:03:41.510> an<00:03:41.630> example<00:03:42.110> this<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:42.320> a

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
that I like as an example this is a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.570 
that I like as an example this is a
headlight<00:03:43.370> catice<00:03:43.790> this<00:03:44.540> shows<00:03:45.310> some<00:03:46.310> flash
