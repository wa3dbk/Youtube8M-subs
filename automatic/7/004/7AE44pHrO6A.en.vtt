really starts to drop so i blinked the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.359 
really starts to drop so i blinked the
really<00:01:29.640> long<00:01:30.439> intercept<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.159> i<00:01:32.220> get

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
really long intercept and then i get

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.030 
really long intercept and then i get
thrown<00:01:32.670> down<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.570> about<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
thrown down right about here and you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.679 
thrown down right about here and you
have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.310> block<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> throw<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
have to block the throw down and the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.330 
have to block the throw down and the
thing<00:01:36.869> would<00:01:36.960> throw<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.650> even<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
thing would throw down is even if you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.950 
thing would throw down is even if you
leave<00:01:38.610> ice<00:01:38.790> block<00:01:39.119> you're<00:01:39.299> still<00:01:39.509> thrown<00:01:39.780> down

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
leave ice block you're still thrown down

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
leave ice block you're still thrown down
it's<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> most<00:01:40.590> poorly<00:01:40.829> designed<00:01:41.070> ability<00:01:41.610> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it's the most poorly designed ability in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.380 
it's the most poorly designed ability in
the<00:01:41.759> game<00:01:42.079> but<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.729> warrior<00:01:45.090> down

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the game but if you get the warrior down

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.359 
the game but if you get the warrior down
to<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> point<00:01:46.140> where<00:01:46.350> he's<00:01:46.950> gonna<00:01:47.070> die

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to the point where he's gonna die

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.499 
to the point where he's gonna die
anyways<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.840> safe<00:01:49.250> what<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.430> dangerous<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
anyways you're safe what is dangerous is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.200 
anyways you're safe what is dangerous is
if<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> warrior<00:01:52.590> gets<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.460> throw<00:01:53.670> down<00:01:53.850> early

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
if the warrior gets the throw down early

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
if the warrior gets the throw down early
because<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.630> weren't<00:01:54.780> cutting<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.290> enough

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
because you weren't cutting well enough

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.760 
because you weren't cutting well enough
and<00:01:56.180> he<00:01:57.180> gets<00:01:57.719> ridiculous<00:01:58.259> amounts<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> damage

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and he gets ridiculous amounts of damage

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.149 
and he gets ridiculous amounts of damage
