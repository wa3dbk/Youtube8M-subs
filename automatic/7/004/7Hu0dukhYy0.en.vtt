00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.220
 good and attention because the ones that are 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.959
 many but many are the new 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.900
 images that have been presented of that 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.670
 split a title that is about to come 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.560
 aguayo the truth is that it is a 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.030
 multiplayer that sure gives a lot that 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.029
 talk on the desktop console 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.619
 nintendo and sure that many users 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.289
 they are even made with the console by this 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.539
 title and even if it seems a bit suicidal 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 kamikaze what I'm saying is like this 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.069
 nintendo has distributed new images 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 and new renders of that is litigation in 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.489
 all of them surrounded by the playable part 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.280
 of the title 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.630
 this title focused on the world 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 multiplayer the truth is that the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.280
 company is very excited about this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.750
 exclusive for wii 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 good in these images we can see 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.150
 different characters shooting we can 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.580
 see different illustrations we can see 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.650
 more weapons because the truth is that the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.990
 weapons after all weapons of painting 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.870
 of course, always because you already know 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.630
 that here the bullets in this title are the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
 painting here our mission is to paint 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.120
 all of our color that every time 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.880
 more spaces painted with our color 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.039
 and so 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.750
 so our team will win the truth 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.630
 is that the painting battle is 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.939
 point to start this is plate a 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.220
 title in which you have to conquer 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.340
 different scenarios filling all the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.439
 ink level with our effort and 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.450
 sweat the gameplay of esplai tum 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.000
 allows us to hide in the ink of 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.100
 our color to get around it by 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.890
 what will offer us a lot of mobility 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.970

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.500
 be more than fun is a title 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.080
 mainly oriented for the mode 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.869
 multiplayer but eye because also 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.520
 He will campaign for a single player a 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.250
 campaign that will combine puzzles 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.459
