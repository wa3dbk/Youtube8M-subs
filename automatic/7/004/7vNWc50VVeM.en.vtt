I just get a typical leaf here we go
this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.360> what<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.510> consider<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.290> be

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
this is what I would consider to be

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.320

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.109 
you want to get rid of it
I'd<00:01:39.360> suggest<00:01:40.520> probably<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> best<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I'd suggest probably the best thing to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.850 
I'd suggest probably the best thing to
do<00:01:42.360> would<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.630> eat<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.759> it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.939> difficult

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
do would be eat it it's a difficult

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.149 
do would be eat it it's a difficult
invasive<00:01:46.860> perennial<00:01:47.670> herb<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:49.009> good<00:01:50.009> luck

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
invasive perennial herb so good luck

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.740 
invasive perennial herb so good luck
getting<00:01:50.369> rid<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.570> certainly

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
getting rid of it but it's certainly

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.020 
getting rid of it but it's certainly
very<00:01:52.170> tasty<00:01:52.680> we're<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.159> over<00:01:53.399> by<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> Romans

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
very tasty we're all over by the Romans

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.999 
very tasty we're all over by the Romans
as<00:01:54.329> were<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.159> other<00:01:56.310> plants<00:01:56.610> being<00:01:57.600> used

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
as were a lot of other plants being used

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.100 
as were a lot of other plants being used
medicinally<00:01:59.240> to<00:02:00.240> treat<00:02:00.509> arthritis<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.939> gout

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
medicinally to treat arthritis and gout

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.789 
medicinally to treat arthritis and gout
and<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> known<00:02:04.740> gout<00:02:05.009> lead<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:07.290> does

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and it's the known gout lead it does

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.100 
and it's the known gout lead it does
become<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:10.220> bit<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.610> diuretic<00:02:11.989> after<00:02:12.989> it's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
become a bit of a diuretic after it's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.080 
become a bit of a diuretic after it's
flowered

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
flowered

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.140 
flowered
and<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:15.260> can<00:02:15.470> also<00:02:15.680> be<00:02:16.129> a<00:02:16.400> bit<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.879> a<00:02:16.940> laxative

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and it can also be a bit of a laxative

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.850 
and it can also be a bit of a laxative
so<00:02:17.780> after<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.830> flowered<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:20.860> wouldn't

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
so after it's flowered I wouldn't

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.140 
so after it's flowered I wouldn't
suggest<00:02:21.950> eating<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.519> unless<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.849> want<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
suggest eating it unless you want it to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.220 
suggest eating it unless you want it to
really<00:02:23.300> clean<00:02:23.569> yourself<00:02:23.930> out<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.510> I've<00:02:27.080> got<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
really clean yourself out so I've got a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.220 
really clean yourself out so I've got a
mild<00:02:27.500> sedative<00:02:27.860> effect<00:02:28.489> as<00:02:29.420> well<00:02:29.629> after<00:02:29.930> it's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
mild sedative effect as well after it's

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.979 
mild sedative effect as well after it's
loud<00:02:30.410> boom<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.120> young<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.629> spring

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
loud boom when it's young in the spring

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.449 
loud boom when it's young in the spring
like<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.489> very<00:02:34.870> tasty<00:02:35.870> very<00:02:36.459> healthy

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
like this it's very tasty very healthy

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.000 
like this it's very tasty very healthy
and<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.920> grows<00:02:40.720> everywhere<00:02:41.720> we<00:02:42.470> call<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.830> cut

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and it grows everywhere we call it a cut

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.680 
and it grows everywhere we call it a cut
and<00:02:43.099> come<00:02:43.250> again<00:02:43.280> part<00:02:43.819> because<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.629> said

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
and come again part because as I said

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.509 
and come again part because as I said
you<00:02:44.840> don't<00:02:44.989> really<00:02:45.170> want<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.500> after<00:02:46.130> it's

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
you don't really want it after it's

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.720 
you don't really want it after it's
flowered<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:48.709> grows<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.099> almost<00:02:49.340> every
