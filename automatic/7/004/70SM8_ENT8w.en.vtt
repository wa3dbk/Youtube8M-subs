00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.140 
you are what you do sure I'm a
neurologist<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.770> I've<00:01:10.310> been<00:01:10.520> practicing

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150

in North Dakota for about 13 years
so<00:01:14.990> neurologists<00:01:15.770> see<00:01:15.920> patients<00:01:16.159> that<00:01:16.490> have<00:01:16.850> a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
so neurologists see patients that have a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.550 
so neurologists see patients that have a
variety<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.390> different<00:01:17.750> brain<00:01:17.930> conditions

watch his power I had received a phone
call<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.530> neurosurgeon<00:01:28.280> had<00:01:28.460> just<00:01:28.640> seen

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850

a<00:01:31.460> 26<00:01:31.970> year<00:01:32.210> old<00:01:32.300> young<00:01:32.540> woman<00:01:32.870> and<00:01:33.080> she<00:01:33.520> had

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
a 26 year old young woman and she had

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.730 
a 26 year old young woman and she had
her<00:01:35.060> knee<00:01:35.120> aid<00:01:35.390> her<00:01:35.720> brain<00:01:35.930> had<00:01:36.140> herniated

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
her knee aid her brain had herniated

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.010 
her knee aid her brain had herniated
right<00:01:37.160> before<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.580> eyes<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.060> doctors<00:01:38.480> the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
right before the eyes of the doctors the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.050 
right before the eyes of the doctors the
pressure<00:01:39.350> had<00:01:39.710> built<00:01:39.920> from<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.490> benign<00:01:41.030> tumor

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
pressure had built from a benign tumor

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.500 
pressure had built from a benign tumor
that<00:01:41.780> was<00:01:41.930> obstructing<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.710> blood

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
that was obstructing the blood

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.450 
that was obstructing the blood
circulation<00:01:44.510> and<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.620> when<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> person

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
circulation and so when a person

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.640 
circulation and so when a person
herniates<00:01:47.090> their<00:01:47.390> brain<00:01:47.660> swells<00:01:48.200> and

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
herniates their brain swells and

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.620 
herniates their brain swells and
compresses<00:01:49.370> and<00:01:49.610> there's<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.880> lack<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.180> blood

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
compresses and there's a lack of blood

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.980 
compresses and there's a lack of blood
flow<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:51.350> creates<00:01:51.740> brain<00:01:52.730> death<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.300> so

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
flow and it creates brain death and so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.970 
flow and it creates brain death and so
the<00:01:54.140> neurosurgeon<00:01:54.800> had<00:01:55.070> seen<00:01:55.730> this<00:01:55.940> woman<00:01:56.300> and

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
the neurosurgeon had seen this woman and

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.190 
the neurosurgeon had seen this woman and
had<00:01:57.980> declared<00:01:58.520> her<00:01:58.670> brain<00:01:58.700> dead<00:01:58.930> but<00:01:59.930> they

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
had declared her brain dead but they

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.890 
had declared her brain dead but they
needed<00:02:00.590> me<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.860> come<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.580> do<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.150> second

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
needed me to come in and do a second

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
needed me to come in and do a second
confirmatory<00:02:03.650> examination<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.820> he<00:02:05.810> was<00:02:06.050> just

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
confirmatory examination and he was just

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.279 
confirmatory examination and he was just
devastated<00:02:07.550> because<00:02:07.730> it<00:02:08.360> was<00:02:08.629> a<00:02:08.659> young<00:02:09.229> woman

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
devastated because it was a young woman

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.100 
devastated because it was a young woman
that<00:02:09.590> had<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> benign<00:02:10.580> tumor<00:02:10.879> that<00:02:11.810> if<00:02:11.959> they

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that had a benign tumor that if they

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.960 
that had a benign tumor that if they
would<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:12.319> been<00:02:12.470> able<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.920> catch<00:02:13.129> it<00:02:13.400> 30

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
would have been able to catch it 30

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.270 
would have been able to catch it 30
minutes<00:02:14.060> earlier<00:02:14.750> she<00:02:15.349> would<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.650> fine<00:02:15.920> and

minutes earlier she would be fine and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.180 
minutes earlier she would be fine and
instead<00:02:17.209> here<00:02:17.480> she<00:02:17.659> was<00:02:17.840> brain-dead<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.650> and
