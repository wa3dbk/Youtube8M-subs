00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
towards back end it all lapsed often a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.040 
towards back end it all lapsed often a
couple<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.910> tackles<00:02:55.120> i'm<00:02:55.420> sure<00:02:55.599> that<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.900> one

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
couple of tackles i'm sure that the one

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.900 
couple of tackles i'm sure that the one
retired<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.560> would<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.680> little<00:02:56.980> bit<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.670> part

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
retired that would a little bit but part

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.570 
retired that would a little bit but part
from<00:02:58.030> that

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
from that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.700 
from that
what<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.720> way<00:02:59.870> through<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.380> that's<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
what all the way through and that's the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.680 
what all the way through and that's the
disappointing<00:03:00.920> for<00:03:01.490> us<00:03:01.580> they<00:03:02.150> can<00:03:02.330> go<00:03:02.420> as<00:03:02.510> far

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
disappointing for us they can go as far

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.420 
disappointing for us they can go as far
as<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:02.870> want<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.110> go<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.890> crowd<00:03:04.160> sing
