a<00:00:29.400> look

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.369 

here<00:00:32.879> we<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.809> fire<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:33.989> thing<00:00:34.140> up

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
here we are I just fire that thing up

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.299 
here we are I just fire that thing up
because<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.489> cold<00:00:35.789> and

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
because it's cold and

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.799 
because it's cold and
it's<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.460> cold<00:00:38.640> outside<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> keys

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it's not cold outside but then the keys

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.280 
it's not cold outside but then the keys
go<00:00:40.110> thinking<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.040> she's<00:00:41.219> still<00:00:41.370> hazing<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.760> bit

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
go thinking so she's still hazing a bit

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.450 
go thinking so she's still hazing a bit
you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> awesomeness<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.309> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you can see the awesomeness that is this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.350 
you can see the awesomeness that is this
machine<00:00:46.160> she's<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> whole<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.640> she<00:00:47.790> runs<00:00:47.940> good

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
machine she's a whole but she runs good

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639 
machine she's a whole but she runs good
I<00:00:48.390> put<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:48.809> motor<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.230> her

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I put a new motor in her

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
I put a new motor in her
now<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.519> cylinder<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.570> pouring

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
now this cylinder right here is pouring

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.610 
now this cylinder right here is pouring
fluid<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.680> let<00:00:53.220> me<00:00:53.309> demonstrate

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.280 

relieving<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.280> hydraulic<00:01:00.760> unit

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.470 

but<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:04.040> can<00:01:04.190> see<00:01:04.400> there's<00:01:04.940> running<00:01:05.300> all

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
but you can see there's running all

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.370 
but you can see there's running all
down<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:07.520> as<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.330> go<00:01:08.570> more<00:01:08.750> fresh<00:01:08.990> potatoes

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
down and as you go more fresh potatoes

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.870 
down and as you go more fresh potatoes
you<00:01:09.530> start<00:01:09.770> pouring<00:01:09.950> out<00:01:10.130> faster<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.700> faster

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
you start pouring out faster and faster

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.980 
you start pouring out faster and faster
and<00:01:11.330> basically<00:01:12.250> hydraulic<00:01:13.250> foods<00:01:13.460> expensive

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
and basically hydraulic foods expensive

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.690 
and basically hydraulic foods expensive
so<00:01:14.990> expensive<00:01:15.620> hydraulic<00:01:16.100> boots<00:01:16.280> no<00:01:16.460> good

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so expensive hydraulic boots no good

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.700 
so expensive hydraulic boots no good
that's<00:01:17.510> what<00:01:17.600> I'm<00:01:17.690> gonna<00:01:17.780> do<00:01:17.990> I'm<00:01:18.350> gonna<00:01:18.440> yank

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.890 
going to do is not even remove this from
machine<00:01:42.490> because<00:01:43.490> like<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:44.390> fitting<00:01:44.750> right

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
machine because like this fitting right

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.430 
machine because like this fitting right
here<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.470> welded<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.580> cylinder<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:48.290> as

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
here is welded to the cylinder and as

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.800 
here is welded to the cylinder and as
you<00:01:48.619> can<00:01:48.710> see<00:01:48.950> these<00:01:49.100> hoses<00:01:49.400> got<00:01:50.390> plenty<00:01:50.690> of

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
you can see these hoses got plenty of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.380 
you can see these hoses got plenty of
play<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.040> think<00:01:52.220> what<00:01:52.490> I'm<00:01:52.580> going<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.759> do<00:01:53.000> is

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.550 
these are just G grooves so as I said
that<00:03:35.700> one<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.180> shaft<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.230> will<00:03:37.470> be

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that one on the shaft and this will be

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.190 
that one on the shaft and this will be
threaded<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> end<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.960> this<00:03:39.960> is<00:03:40.020> what

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
threaded on the end of it this is what

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.650 
threaded on the end of it this is what
grabs<00:03:40.440> all<00:03:40.620> your<00:03:40.770> fluid<00:03:41.160> Cloutier<00:03:42.030> goes<00:03:42.450> into

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
grabs all your fluid Cloutier goes into

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.210 
grabs all your fluid Cloutier goes into
the<00:03:42.780> top<00:03:42.959> towards<00:03:43.230> my<00:03:43.320> finger<00:03:43.650> or<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.890> bottom

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the top towards my finger or the bottom

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.650 
the top towards my finger or the bottom
towards<00:03:44.430> my<00:03:44.520> thumb<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.090> pushes<00:03:45.270> one<00:03:45.480> way

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
towards my thumb and it pushes one way

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.060 
towards my thumb and it pushes one way
up<00:03:45.810> or<00:03:45.959> down<00:03:46.110> just<00:03:46.140> whichever<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.890> flute

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
up or down just whichever way the flute

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.699 
up or down just whichever way the flute
kicks<00:03:47.310> in<00:03:47.490> so<00:03:48.450> as<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.020> see<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.350> take<00:03:49.530> this

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
kicks in so as you can see you take this

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.460 
kicks in so as you can see you take this
out<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.190> if<00:03:50.520> you're<00:03:50.640> having<00:03:50.900> weak<00:03:51.900> cylinders
