00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.179
 at the club 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.930
 life together with people who were on 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:19.140

 on the crease was very second day 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.090
 there were black people who came from 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.090
 Belarus from Minsk because in Minsk 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.090
 gambling 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.770
 will be banned 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.079
 and there is no opportunity for guys to perform 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.020
 so the guys came here in Moscow and 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.500
 they agreed to a 3 meter pal 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 I know because we 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.330

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.680

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.100
 after the concert we were just going 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.110
 make a small flash mob with a big 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.110
 companies to sing songs 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.200
 16 17 hours 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.040
 I did not come to everybody from Minsk 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.659
 from Moscow to 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.610
 you are not going to be friends 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.590
 they all talked and they supported us 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.820
 it was very tonight 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.470
 great it was very cool everything was 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 cool thank you all 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.630
 the concert was excellent excellent excellent 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.630
 hit and you are all from Belarus to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.880
 a lot of people who just feel the same 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.060
 understand now we are reporting 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.329
 your shoot at almost 12 at night and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.649
 You will go there where you can go 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.299
 some songs that will not play on 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:57.140
 a concert that I would like to hear 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:02:10.970
 mountains album that some girls order 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:14.870
 cat it was great content was 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.819
 just gorgeous the only thing that was 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.290
 such a feeling that guys 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.349
 played a little non-stop 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.190
 non-stop always Sergey reads poetry and 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.349
 when anticipating some of their trades 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.069
 but there was a little bit of non-stop here 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.440
 non-stop and straight signs of recording songs 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.769
 for the song he read poetry 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.310
 but yes yes chat to communicate with people 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.620
 communicating with the audience but in general 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.980
 it was very very firewood very cool but 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.890
 even at the last lapis concert he 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.340
 I read a lot of poems and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.130
 and it was as though it was more like a 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.890
 the concert is just what it is now 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.330
 exactly in communication with 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.880
 public appearance from public with public 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.860
 probably so maybe this 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.670
 gross entity unlike entity 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.510
 Lapis in what he read nonetheless 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.340
 didn't read poems read poems were well 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.230
 communication with the public may be less than they 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.360
 on because on the site itself could not 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.800
 why already talked a lot at night 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.890
 talked a lot about his guys 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.709
 dawn guys about the success of what they 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.780
 have achieved there advanced here 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.730
 brilliant people they have that is which 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.410
 they came to us they were isolated 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.140
 athletes ingenious musicians 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.510
 brilliant man bass player who came 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.800
 left and then came back after two weeks and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.800
 he has already surrendered parties 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.840
 since he communicated with the people we 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.000
 mean that there was no such thing 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.220
 just some kind of poetic but 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:01.900
 it was anyway it was it was 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:05.760
 very much like the sound I do not know 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.819
 guys sound much 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.099
 concerts 0 rub surrender stadium no 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:16.260
 I don't know the head of the club but I have the building 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:18.570
 time I often go to and all the time but not 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.900
 give here the sound leaves the best just 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.080
 when you have 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.400
 three or four musicians services by 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.060
 at least tatyana could calmly 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:40.500
 stand and talk and confess 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:43.100
 kiss it there I like all normal 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.740
 thousand as valuable everything is fine but 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.370
 of course I wanted more power more 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.380
 more more power more such 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.050
 bursting moments when the crowd behind apparently 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.050
 wanted more i was recently on 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.800
 sidorina can not hear yourself just hear 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.380
 collective hear music and and 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.400
 dissolve then eat we could 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.940
 talk and where did you stand on the transom 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.770
 close enough to the center in the center not 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.510
 left on the plan are pouring in as against 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.410
 the road to the left is somehow against whom 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.930
 mikhalko 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.070

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.370
