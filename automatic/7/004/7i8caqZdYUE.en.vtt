00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the MPT editor called mb c editor I'll

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.479 
the MPT editor called mb c editor I'll
link<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.780> description<00:01:01.140> below<00:01:01.489> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to do is make rideable blocks you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.870 
to do is make rideable blocks you
probably<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.810> how<00:01:09.990> or<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.010> case

so with this invention you can just make

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.319 
so with this invention you can just make
little<00:01:27.560> purely<00:01:28.560> aesthetic<00:01:29.040> rideable<00:01:30.030> blocks

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
little purely aesthetic rideable blocks

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.800 
little purely aesthetic rideable blocks
and<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.450> thing<00:01:33.659> it

requires is my car tracks I'll show you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.359 
requires is my car tracks I'll show you
how<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.420> again<00:01:36.600> MBTI<00:01:37.439> editing<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
how to make this again MBTI editing so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
how to make this again MBTI editing so
what<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> all

is first of all it's couldn't imagine it
is<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.250> minecart<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> block<00:01:46.590> display

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
is a minecart with with a block display

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
is a minecart with with a block display
that's<00:01:47.399> set<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.820> certain<00:01:48.360> offset<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.799> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that's set to a certain offset and it in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.710 
that's set to a certain offset and it in
like<00:01:50.220> riding<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.790> minecart<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.360> an

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
like riding this minecart is an

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.789 
like riding this minecart is an
invisible<00:01:52.110> i<00:01:52.680> sorry<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.770> let<00:01:55.770> me

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
invisible i sorry I think it's a let me

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.109 
invisible i sorry I think it's a let me
actually<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.369> make<00:01:56.490> sure<00:01:56.579> yeah<00:01:56.759> okay<00:01:56.790> that's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119

actually just make sure yeah okay that's
right<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.780> an<00:01:57.960> invisible<00:01:58.259> squid<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.189> then

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
right it's an invisible squid and then

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.149 
right it's an invisible squid and then
an<00:02:00.450> invisible<00:02:00.869> pig<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.439> has<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> saddle<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
an invisible pig that has a saddle on it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.910 
an invisible pig that has a saddle on it
okay<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.780> let<00:02:03.899> me<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.110> over<00:02:04.290> why<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.590> all

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
okay so let me go over why this all

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.029 
okay so let me go over why this all
works<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.610> first<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.990> minecart<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
works so first of all the minecart is

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
true that way you can't budget nor

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.809
