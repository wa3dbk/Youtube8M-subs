00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
in individual mode we get what seven

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
in individual mode we get what seven
modes<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.340> quite<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
modes here so you do get quite a lot of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
modes here so you do get quite a lot of
modes<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.930> I'll<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> campaign

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
modes in this and I'll see the campaign

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
modes in this and I'll see the campaign
is<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.950> basically<00:01:29.220> combining<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> these

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is just basically combining all of these

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.179 
is just basically combining all of these
modes<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.799> first<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> all

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
modes into one it's so first of all

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.340 
modes into one it's so first of all
let's<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:32.460> ahead<00:01:32.729> into<00:01:33.570> kite<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.200> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
let's go ahead into kite and see that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.289 
let's go ahead into kite and see that
one<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.070> says<00:01:35.250> infinity<00:01:35.790> most<00:01:35.939> let's<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.180> ahead

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
one it says infinity most let's go ahead

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.850 
one it says infinity most let's go ahead
into<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> first

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
into this and this is all just the first

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
into this and this is all just the first
basic<00:01:38.310> game<00:01:38.520> mode<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.869> see

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
basic game mode here and you can see

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.600 
basic game mode here and you can see
their<00:01:40.140> load<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.560> quickly<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.009> chief<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
their load very quickly on chief you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
their load very quickly on chief you
guys<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.119> show<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> guys<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> sound<00:01:42.780> pier

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
guys I can show you guys the sound pier

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
guys I can show you guys the sound pier
mine<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.890> show<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.369> my

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
mine will show up because of my

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.270 
mine will show up because of my
microphone<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> way<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
microphone is kind of out of the way but

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.770 
microphone is kind of out of the way but
okay<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.340> basically<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.000> Auto<00:01:48.420> pause

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
okay so basically we have Auto pause

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.210 
okay so basically we have Auto pause
here<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.680> when<00:01:49.950> you're<00:01:50.070> not

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
here and this is when you're not

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.920 
here and this is when you're not
actually<00:01:50.369> touching<00:01:50.700> any<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.390> joysticks

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
actually touching any of the joysticks

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.460 
actually touching any of the joysticks
or<00:01:52.110> online<00:01:52.500> online<00:01:53.009> on-screen<00:01:54.000> joysticks<00:01:54.630> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
or online online on-screen joysticks so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.690 
or online online on-screen joysticks so
you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.070> ahead<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.219> touch<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you can see we go ahead and touch one of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
you can see we go ahead and touch one of
them<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> game<00:01:57.240> book<00:01:57.450> game<00:01:57.810> begins<00:01:58.170> ever

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
them and the game book game begins ever

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.690 
them and the game book game begins ever
some<00:01:58.619> reason<00:01:58.920> when<00:01:59.040> I'll<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> sound

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
some reason when I'll get in the sound

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.999 
some reason when I'll get in the sound
so<00:02:00.000> doesn't<00:02:00.930> look<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.290> guys<00:02:01.590> can

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
so doesn't look like you guys can

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.069 
so doesn't look like you guys can
experience<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.060> full<00:02:03.299> definition<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.960> this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
experience the full definition of this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.899 
experience the full definition of this
game<00:02:04.320> anyway<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> sound<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.549> pretty<00:02:05.759> epic

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
game anyway the sound is pretty epic

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.429 
game anyway the sound is pretty epic
it's<00:02:06.360> definitely<00:02:06.659> half<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.020> game<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.350> you

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
it's definitely half of this game if you

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.680 
it's definitely half of this game if you
were<00:02:07.500> wearing<00:02:07.649> headphones<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.539> going

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
were wearing headphones then it's going

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.479 
were wearing headphones then it's going
to<00:02:09.780> sound<00:02:09.899> pretty<00:02:10.110> awesome<00:02:10.470> anyway<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:11.459> you

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
to sound pretty awesome anyway as you

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.100 
to sound pretty awesome anyway as you
can<00:02:11.760> see<00:02:11.940> straight<00:02:12.209> away<00:02:12.330> you're<00:02:12.900> probably

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
can see straight away you're probably

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.410 
can see straight away you're probably
think

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
think

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.930 
think
while<00:02:14.170> ripoff<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.920> geometry<00:02:15.430> wars<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.730> as<00:02:15.819> I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
while ripoff of geometry wars and as I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.479 
while ripoff of geometry wars and as I
said<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.630> pretty<00:02:16.930> much<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.110> just<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.890> remake<00:02:18.250> and

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
said it pretty much is just a remake and

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.199 
said it pretty much is just a remake and
they've<00:02:19.120> done<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.450> really<00:02:20.200> well<00:02:21.209> I've

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
they've done it really well I've

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.630 
they've done it really well I've
actually<00:02:22.630> only<00:02:23.140> played<00:02:23.680> geometry<00:02:24.160> wars<00:02:24.280> once

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
actually only played geometry wars once

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.490 
actually only played geometry wars once
or<00:02:24.790> twice<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.300> mourners<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.020> got<00:02:26.140> bored<00:02:26.349> as

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
or twice I mourners just got bored as

soon as I've played it basically this is
the<00:02:29.170> Infinity<00:02:29.680> motor<00:02:29.860> think<00:02:30.069> it's<00:02:30.160> called

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
the Infinity motor think it's called

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.470 
the Infinity motor think it's called
here<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.700> you're<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.880> going<00:02:31.030> around<00:02:31.209> like

shoot<00:03:33.579> as<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.239> said<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.570> is<00:03:34.630> apparent<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.320> some

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
shoot as I said this is apparent in some

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.240 
shoot as I said this is apparent in some
game<00:03:35.859> modes<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.340> basically<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.269> have<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.510> snake

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
game modes and basically we have a snake

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.789 
game modes and basically we have a snake
very<00:03:39.250> much<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.760> real<00:03:40.030> version<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.570> snake<00:03:40.840> kind

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
very much the real version of snake kind

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.949 
very much the real version of snake kind
of<00:03:41.920> remixed<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.519> bit<00:03:42.640> here<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.570> as<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.750> can<00:03:43.930> see

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
of remixed a bit here and as you can see

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.199 
of remixed a bit here and as you can see
you<00:03:44.049> have<00:03:44.170> this<00:03:44.410> laser<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.010> snake<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.640> you

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
you have this laser on the snake and you

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.449 
you have this laser on the snake and you
have<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.570> try<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.200> get<00:03:47.350> these<00:03:47.560> blocks<00:03:48.130> or

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
have to try and get these blocks or

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.460 
have to try and get these blocks or
enemies<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:49.180> drive<00:03:49.450> into<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.780> laser<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.260> now

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
enemies to drive into that laser and now

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.140 
enemies to drive into that laser and now
kill<00:03:50.739> them<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.310> obviously<00:03:51.640> don't<00:03:51.670> have<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> gun

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
kill them you obviously don't have a gun

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.490 
kill them you obviously don't have a gun
so<00:03:52.390> that's<00:03:52.540> why<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.690> laser<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.140> there<00:03:53.320> that's

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
so that's why that laser is there that's

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.020 
so that's why that laser is there that's
the<00:03:53.560> only<00:03:53.829> way<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.010> kill<00:03:54.280> them<00:03:54.459> apart<00:03:54.790> from<00:03:54.820> the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
the only way to kill them apart from the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.020 
the only way to kill them apart from the
bombs<00:03:55.329> up<00:03:56.019> here<00:03:56.319> although<00:03:57.310> for<00:03:57.459> some<00:03:57.579> reason<00:03:57.880> I

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
bombs up here although for some reason I

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.069 
bombs up here although for some reason I
think<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.269> couldn't<00:03:58.480> use<00:03:58.690> them<00:03:58.810> round

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
think you couldn't use them round

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.670 
think you couldn't use them round
enemies<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.620> don't<00:03:59.980> know<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.200> really<00:04:02.530> like

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
enemies I don't know so I really like

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.140 
enemies I don't know so I really like
this<00:04:02.799> game<00:04:02.980> style<00:04:03.310> there<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:03.609> a<00:04:03.640> couple<00:04:04.060> of

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
this game style there is a couple of

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.699 
this game style there is a couple of
others<00:04:04.359> like<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.630> where<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:04.900> can't<00:04:05.170> shoot<00:04:05.440> I

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
others like this where you can't shoot I

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.530 
others like this where you can't shoot I

limits to complete but the game modes
are<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.330> same<00:04:22.539> when<00:04:22.720> I'd<00:04:22.810> actually<00:04:22.960> rather

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
just giving me remixes of one we've

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.170 
just giving me remixes of one we've
already<00:04:29.140> played<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.770> my<00:04:30.490> second<00:04:30.880> favorite

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
already played so my second favorite

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.450 
already played so my second favorite
game<00:04:31.330> over<00:04:31.510> here<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.960> hammer<00:04:32.260> mode<00:04:32.500> and

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
game over here is the hammer mode and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.620 
game over here is the hammer mode and
this<00:04:33.610> one<00:04:33.730> is<00:04:33.820> pretty<00:04:34.000> cool<00:04:34.180> it's<00:04:34.360> definitely

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
this one is pretty cool it's definitely

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.570 
this one is pretty cool it's definitely
a<00:04:34.660> lot<00:04:34.780> harder<00:04:34.840> than<00:04:35.170> the<00:04:35.380> others<00:04:35.620> but<00:04:36.460> it's

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
a lot harder than the others but it's

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.920 
a lot harder than the others but it's
definitely<00:04:36.700> unusual<00:04:36.970> as<00:04:37.330> well<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:37.810> can

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
definitely unusual as well and you can

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.360 
definitely unusual as well and you can
see<00:04:38.050> again<00:04:38.350> we<00:04:38.530> can't<00:04:38.830> shoot<00:04:39.040> there's<00:04:39.250> no

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
see again we can't shoot there's no

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.190 
see again we can't shoot there's no
joystick<00:04:39.790> here<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.060> shoot<00:04:40.270> however<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.170> have

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
joystick here to shoot however we have

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.890 
joystick here to shoot however we have
this<00:04:41.470> hammer<00:04:41.910> or<00:04:42.910> basically<00:04:43.270> circle<00:04:43.750> that's

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
this hammer or basically circle that's

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900 
this hammer or basically circle that's
spinning<00:04:44.110> around<00:04:44.290> here<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:45.520> only<00:04:45.670> way<00:04:45.850> to

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
spinning around here and the only way to

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.490 
spinning around here and the only way to
kill<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.300> enemies<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:46.870> obvious<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.290> have<00:04:47.470> the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
kill the enemies is obvious you have the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.590 
kill the enemies is obvious you have the
bombs<00:04:47.770> as<00:04:48.010> well<00:04:48.160> up<00:04:48.250> there<00:04:48.310> but<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.300> have<00:04:49.420> to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
bombs as well up there but you have to

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.030 
bombs as well up there but you have to
try<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.080> swing<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:50.470> hammer<00:04:50.710> into<00:04:50.920> the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
try and swing this hammer into the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.030 
try and swing this hammer into the
enemy's<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.520> kill<00:04:51.700> them<00:04:52.620> as<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.740> said<00:04:53.860> it's

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
enemy's to kill them as I said it's

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.350 
enemy's to kill them as I said it's
definitely<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.430> hardest<00:04:54.580> because<00:04:54.880> even<00:04:55.270> if

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
definitely the hardest because even if

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.730 
definitely the hardest because even if
the<00:04:55.540> enemy's<00:04:55.870> actually<00:04:56.140> get<00:04:56.260> inside<00:04:56.560> the

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
the enemy's actually get inside the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.170 
the enemy's actually get inside the
hammer<00:04:56.950> it<00:04:57.190> still<00:04:57.400> doesn't<00:04:57.580> kill<00:04:57.820> them<00:04:57.940> so<00:04:58.090> you

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
hammer it still doesn't kill them so you

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.460 
hammer it still doesn't kill them so you
really<00:04:58.420> have<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.540> hit<00:04:58.750> and<00:04:58.870> dead<00:04:59.050> on<00:04:59.170> with<00:04:59.200> the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
really have to hit and dead on with the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.960 
really have to hit and dead on with the
hammer<00:04:59.650> something<00:05:00.040> else<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.370> found<00:05:00.550> out<00:05:00.820> i'm

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
hammer something else I found out i'm

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.520 
hammer something else I found out i'm
not<00:05:01.210> sure<00:05:01.390> if<00:05:01.450> this<00:05:01.540> is<00:05:01.600> apparent<00:05:02.110> in<00:05:02.170> all<00:05:02.440> the

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
not sure if this is apparent in all the

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.770 
not sure if this is apparent in all the
other<00:05:02.650> game<00:05:02.920> modes<00:05:03.100> i<00:05:03.370> died<00:05:03.820> there<00:05:04.060> but

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
other game modes i died there but

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.960 
other game modes i died there but
basically<00:05:05.080> when<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.320> hit<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.760> enemy<00:05:06.760> if

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
basically when you hit a enemy if

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.490 
basically when you hit a enemy if
there's<00:05:07.450> any<00:05:07.540> more<00:05:07.720> enemies<00:05:07.840> around<00:05:08.320> the

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
there's any more enemies around the

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.690 
there's any more enemies around the
enemy<00:05:08.800> even<00:05:08.980> if<00:05:09.160> you<00:05:09.250> didn't<00:05:09.430> hit<00:05:09.520> them

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
enemy even if you didn't hit them

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.070 
enemy even if you didn't hit them
they'll<00:05:09.880> still<00:05:10.090> exploded<00:05:10.600> so<00:05:10.780> it's<00:05:10.930> kind<00:05:11.050> of

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
they'll still exploded so it's kind of

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.720 
they'll still exploded so it's kind of
like<00:05:11.140> a<00:05:11.230> chain<00:05:11.470> reaction<00:05:11.620> go<00:05:12.490> through<00:05:12.670> the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
like a chain reaction go through the

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.100 
like a chain reaction go through the
options<00:05:12.880> quickly<00:05:13.480> as<00:05:13.570> well<00:05:13.750> this<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:13.990> pretty

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
options quickly as well this is pretty

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.290 
options quickly as well this is pretty
cool<00:05:14.230> you<00:05:14.410> have<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.650> option<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.370> kind<00:05:15.970> of<00:05:16.000> change

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
cool you have a option to kind of change

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.240 
cool you have a option to kind of change
the<00:05:16.450> dimensions<00:05:17.170> so<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.740> can<00:05:17.860> see<00:05:17.980> here<00:05:18.130> we

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
the dimensions so you can see here we

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.510 
the dimensions so you can see here we
have<00:05:18.370> freely<00:05:18.670> 3d<00:05:19.600> version<00:05:20.410> 2<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:21.070> D<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.460> then

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
have freely 3d version 2 to D and then

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.120 
have freely 3d version 2 to D and then
classic<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.510> have<00:05:23.200> this<00:05:23.350> on<00:05:23.470> freely<00:05:23.800> because<00:05:23.980> I

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
classic I have this on freely because I

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.350 
classic I have this on freely because I
think<00:05:24.280> it's<00:05:24.370> pretty<00:05:24.490> cool<00:05:24.700> so<00:05:25.000> when<00:05:25.270> you

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
think it's pretty cool so when you

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.120 
think it's pretty cool so when you
actually<00:05:25.750> changes<00:05:26.200> like<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.440> angle<00:05:26.590> when<00:05:27.040> you

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
actually changes like the angle when you

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.500 
actually changes like the angle when you
go<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.460> other<00:05:27.580> side<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.000> board<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.390> can

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
go to the other side of the board it can

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.850 
go to the other side of the board it can
also<00:05:28.630> put<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.140> freeview<00:05:29.470> second

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
also put it on the freeview second

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
also put it on the freeview second
version<00:05:30.010> not<00:05:30.280> quite<00:05:30.490> sure<00:05:30.520> what<00:05:30.790> the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
version not quite sure what the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.490 
version not quite sure what the
difference<00:05:30.970> is<00:05:31.300> but<00:05:31.690> on<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:31.990> do<00:05:32.230> see<00:05:32.440> that

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
difference is but on to do see that

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.020
