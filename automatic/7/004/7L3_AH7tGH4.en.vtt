00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.879
 then they are 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.849
 2 put two museums over 400 works 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.520
 An exhibition disturbance is one 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:38.750
 Great look over the collage as 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:40.910
 collage polyphony and cacophony 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.280
 Here are the collages themselves 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.989
 Language is not just the flood of images 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.610
 they are the voices that come together 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.330
 objects collages rattle pipes and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.330
 make a noise 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.030
 renewal and recycling collage 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.680
 Artists dig in the rubble of ours 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.290
 Everyday culture after the hidden 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.840
 appreciate for living from the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.440
 seemingly worthless design worlds 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.440
 from hungary 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.850
 in the thematic complex of unrest 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.439
 Children will be the artistic again 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 Credo for a criticism of the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.119
 socio-political relationship 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.920
 clearly and this exhibition has a lot 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.890
 many points at which this becomes clear 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.320
 Resistance and destruction of the agrarian of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.229
 me shoes 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.049
 Berlin plans the collage for the artist 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.049
 until today as a powerful weapon against 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.540
 destruction against war but also 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.540
 Counter propaganda and consumer terror 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.830
 space appropriations rare collage artist 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.590
 are the designers and builders 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.380
 new worlds averages create them 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.500
 new open spaces give you an unexpected view 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.360
 We open up and show realities 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.630
 have not seen the hidden before 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.630
 were 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.120
 collages allow escapes and dreams 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.960
 the artist's run away into 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.870
 a fantasy world that can be sweet 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:55.070
 but there is bittersweet 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:55.070
 exciting and strange baby
