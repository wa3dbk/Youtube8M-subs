00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.420 

so<00:00:08.500> this<00:00:09.219> is<00:00:09.400> what<00:00:09.580> happens<00:00:09.940> when<00:00:10.120> we<00:00:10.300> turn<00:00:10.540> on

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.880 

transfers<00:00:13.910> plane<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:14.420> my<00:00:14.540> question

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:14.890 
transfers plane so my question

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.190 
transfers plane so my question
now<00:00:15.160> is<00:00:15.720> once<00:00:16.720> we<00:00:16.930> get<00:00:17.200> to<00:00:17.470> this<00:00:17.680> point

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.440 

where<00:00:20.800> we've<00:00:20.920> timed<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:21.400> just<00:00:21.430> right<00:00:21.790> with

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
where we've timed it just right with

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.170 
where we've timed it just right with
just<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.930> amount<00:00:23.020> correct<00:00:23.890> amount<00:00:24.220> of<00:00:24.400> b1<00:00:24.820> or

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
just the amount correct amount of b1 or

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.540 
just the amount correct amount of b1 or
RF<00:00:25.570> power<00:00:25.840> so<00:00:26.680> that<00:00:26.710> we<00:00:27.010> rotate<00:00:27.430> our

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
RF power so that we rotate our

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.140 
RF power so that we rotate our
magnetization<00:00:28.170> exactly<00:00:29.170> 90<00:00:29.530> degrees<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:30.250> now

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
magnetization exactly 90 degrees and now

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.430 
magnetization exactly 90 degrees and now
I<00:00:31.180> shut<00:00:31.540> everything<00:00:31.810> off<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:35.170> now<00:00:35.260> I'm<00:00:35.350> just

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
I shut everything off so now I'm just

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.610 
I shut everything off so now I'm just
going<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:35.650> stop<00:00:36.010> now<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.870> thing<00:00:38.140> by<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.380> way

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
going to stop now one thing by the way

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.220 
going to stop now one thing by the way
that<00:00:38.800> we<00:00:38.890> could<00:00:39.100> do<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.750> could<00:00:40.870> have<00:00:40.930> our

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
that we could do is we could have our

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.620 
that we could do is we could have our
little<00:00:41.380> antenna<00:00:42.100> over<00:00:42.340> here<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:42.910> since<00:00:43.510> we

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
little antenna over here and since we

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.540 
little antenna over here and since we
have<00:00:43.809> net<00:00:44.050> transverse<00:00:44.620> magnetization<00:00:44.950> we<00:00:45.430> can

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
have net transverse magnetization we can

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.380 
have net transverse magnetization we can
measure<00:00:45.760> some<00:00:46.090> signal<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.760> what<00:00:48.970> I<00:00:49.000> want<00:00:49.300> to

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
measure some signal but what I want to

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.730 
measure some signal but what I want to
know<00:00:49.629> is<00:00:50.050> what<00:00:50.830> happens<00:00:51.340> at<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.700> point<00:00:52.740> so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
know is what happens at this point so

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.530 
know is what happens at this point so
I've<00:00:53.890> taken<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.430> magnetization<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.450> I've

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
I've taken this magnetization and I've

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.819 
I've taken this magnetization and I've
rotated<00:00:56.140> at<00:00:56.440> 90<00:00:56.800> degrees<00:00:57.130> and<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:59.079> took<00:00:59.260> energy

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
rotated at 90 degrees and it took energy

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.580 
rotated at 90 degrees and it took energy
to<00:00:59.950> get<00:01:00.070> there<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.750> I'm<00:01:01.900> now<00:01:02.079> going<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.380> say

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
to get there so I'm now going to say

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.950 
to get there so I'm now going to say
hands<00:01:03.070> off<00:01:03.220> we're<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.910> turn<00:01:04.119> off<00:01:04.330> not

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
hands off we're going to turn off not

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.490 
hands off we're going to turn off not
put<00:01:05.140> any<00:01:05.259> more<00:01:05.470> energy<00:01:05.650> into<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.130> system<00:01:07.500> so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
put any more energy into the system so

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.150 
put any more energy into the system so
what<00:01:08.710> happens<00:01:09.660> well<00:01:10.690> enter<00:01:11.320> any<00:01:11.910> system<00:01:12.910> right

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
what happens well enter any system right

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.020 
what happens well enter any system right
is<00:01:16.080> always<00:01:17.080> going<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:18.090> drive<00:01:19.530> towards<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
is always going to drive towards the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.800 
is always going to drive towards the
lowest<00:01:22.540> possible<00:01:22.780> energy<00:01:23.200> state<00:01:23.800> right<00:01:24.810> it's

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
lowest possible energy state right it's

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.779 
lowest possible energy state right it's
even<00:01:26.110> true<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.560> your<00:01:26.710> kitchen<00:01:26.890> right<00:01:27.490> if<00:01:27.700> you

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
even true of your kitchen right if you

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.669 
even true of your kitchen right if you
don't<00:01:27.940> work<00:01:28.090> hard<00:01:28.149> enough<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:28.899> keep<00:01:29.050> it<00:01:29.259> clean

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
don't work hard enough to keep it clean

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.410 
don't work hard enough to keep it clean
it<00:01:29.920> eventually<00:01:30.190> will<00:01:30.610> end<00:01:30.789> up<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.090> disarray

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
it eventually will end up in disarray

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.749 
it eventually will end up in disarray
that's<00:01:32.319> what<00:01:32.470> they<00:01:32.560> call<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.950> household

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
that's what they call the household

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.109 
that's what they call the household
depth<00:01:34.030> of<00:01:34.179> definition<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.869> entropy<00:01:35.429> so<00:01:36.429> but

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
depth of definition of entropy so but

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.389 
depth of definition of entropy so but
seriously<00:01:37.810> if<00:01:38.050> you<00:01:38.350> turn<00:01:38.679> this<00:01:38.890> off<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.160> you

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
seriously if you turn this off and you

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.740 
seriously if you turn this off and you
leave<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:39.729> alone<00:01:39.940> what's<00:01:40.209> going<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.390> happen

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
leave it alone what's going to happen

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.279 
leave it alone what's going to happen
now<00:01:41.340> well<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:43.090> are<00:01:43.240> going<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.750> end<00:01:44.020> up

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
now well we are going to end up

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.529 
now well we are going to end up
eventually<00:01:44.709> back<00:01:45.399> at<00:01:45.610> our<00:01:45.729> resting<00:01:46.209> state

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
eventually back at our resting state

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.809 
eventually back at our resting state
which<00:01:47.410> was<00:01:48.330> zero<00:01:49.330> degrees<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.920> some<00:01:51.220> excess

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
which was zero degrees with some excess

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.870 
which was zero degrees with some excess
amount<00:01:52.569> of<00:01:52.660> longitudinal<00:01:53.350> magnetization

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
amount of longitudinal magnetization

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.830 
amount of longitudinal magnetization
that's<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.090> easy<00:01:55.300> part

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
that's the easy part

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.070 
that's the easy part
so<00:01:56.470> my<00:01:56.800> real<00:01:56.979> question<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.729> how<00:01:58.479> do<00:01:58.539> we<00:01:58.690> get

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
so my real question is how do we get

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.499 
so my real question is how do we get
from<00:01:59.440> this<00:01:59.649> point<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.550> this<00:02:00.700> point<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.209> what

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
from this point to this point and what

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.320 
from this point to this point and what
happens<00:02:01.959> to<00:02:02.140> allow<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.649> happen<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.330> let's

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
happens to allow that to happen so let's

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.150 
happens to allow that to happen so let's
address<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.780> second<00:02:05.170> question<00:02:05.560> first<00:02:05.590> what

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
address the second question first what

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.350 
address the second question first what
has<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.580> happen<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:07.840> us<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:08.140> go<00:02:08.319> back<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.800> zero

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
has to happen for us to go back to zero

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.420 
has to happen for us to go back to zero
so<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.599> thing<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.840> has<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.290> happen<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:12.190> that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so the thing that has to happen is that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.210 
so the thing that has to happen is that
we<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.510> have<00:02:13.959> some<00:02:14.610> energy<00:02:17.220> transferred

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
we have to have some energy transferred

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.750 
we have to have some energy transferred
out<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.959> system<00:02:20.349> out<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.830> these<00:02:21.190> spins<00:02:21.580> it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
out of this system out of these spins it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.089 
out of this system out of these spins it
has<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.120> go<00:02:22.330> somewhere<00:02:22.810> else<00:02:22.959> right<00:02:23.890> energy

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
has to go somewhere else right energy

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.940 
has to go somewhere else right energy
always<00:02:24.670> has<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.000> conserved<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
always has to be conserved and the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.979 
always has to be conserved and the
system<00:02:27.310> can't<00:02:27.550> just<00:02:27.760> stay<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.450> static

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
system can't just stay in a static

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.660 
system can't just stay in a static
situation<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.829> we're<00:02:29.950> going<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.099> have<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.430> look

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
situation so we're going to have to look

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.460 
situation so we're going to have to look
at<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.030> potential<00:02:31.450> places<00:02:32.140> where<00:02:32.319> that

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
at the potential places where that

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.090 
at the potential places where that
energy

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
energy

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.500 
energy
go<00:02:33.580> first<00:02:34.210> of<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:35.070> secondly<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.760> might<00:02:37.030> think

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
go first of all secondly you might think

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.160 
go first of all secondly you might think
that<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:39.400> would<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:39.610> slowly<00:02:40.210> rotate<00:02:40.840> back

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
that you would just slowly rotate back

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.250 
that you would just slowly rotate back
the<00:02:41.650> way<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:41.800> came<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.510> reality<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.110> that

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the way you came but the reality is that

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.710 
the way you came but the reality is that
that's<00:02:44.590> not<00:02:44.740> what<00:02:45.010> happens<00:02:45.400> right<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.090> reality

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that's not what happens right in reality

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.220 
that's not what happens right in reality
it's<00:02:47.470> going<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.920> look<00:02:48.070> like<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:49.080> okay<00:02:50.080> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
it's going to look like this okay and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.920 
it's going to look like this okay and
the<00:02:50.860> reason<00:02:51.100> for<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:54.010> at<00:02:54.790> any<00:02:55.780> point

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
the reason for that is that at any point

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.690 
the reason for that is that at any point
in<00:02:56.410> time<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:57.130> point<00:02:58.000> along<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.600> curve<00:02:59.370> we<00:03:00.370> can

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
in time a point along this curve we can

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.120 
in time a point along this curve we can
define<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:03.310> magnetization<00:03:04.680> based<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.920> its

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
define the magnetization based on its

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.360 
define the magnetization based on its
two<00:03:06.310> components

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.830 

our<00:03:12.849> longitudinal<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.780> transverse

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
our longitudinal and transverse

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.890 
our longitudinal and transverse
component<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.830> magnetization<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:16.360> order<00:03:16.720> for

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
component of magnetization in order for

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.330 
component of magnetization in order for
us<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.080> rotate<00:03:17.890> 90<00:03:18.790> degrees<00:03:19.319> we<00:03:20.319> have<00:03:20.650> what's

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
us to rotate 90 degrees we have what's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.640 
us to rotate 90 degrees we have what's
essentially<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.680> progressive<00:03:24.030> symmetrical

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
essentially a progressive symmetrical

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.580 
essentially a progressive symmetrical
change<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:27.420> those<00:03:28.420> two<00:03:28.690> component<00:03:29.230> vectors

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
change in those two component vectors

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.650 
change in those two component vectors
right<00:03:30.160> one<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.640> them<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.880> shrinking<00:03:31.390> at<00:03:31.569> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
right one of them is shrinking at the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.120 
right one of them is shrinking at the
same<00:03:31.900> rate<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.410> other<00:03:32.560> one<00:03:32.800> is<00:03:32.920> growing

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
same rate that the other one is growing

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.690 
same rate that the other one is growing
and<00:03:33.519> that's<00:03:34.150> why<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:34.720> literally<00:03:35.110> rotate<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
and that's why we literally rotate the

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.050 
and that's why we literally rotate the
magnetization<00:03:37.150> down<00:03:37.690> like<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.819> in<00:03:39.819> order

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
magnetization down like this in order

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.570 
magnetization down like this in order
for<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.480> happen<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:41.650> rate<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:42.069> change

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
for that to happen the rate of change

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.460 
for that to happen the rate of change
along<00:03:43.239> each<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.540> those<00:03:43.840> two<00:03:43.989> component

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
along each of those two component

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.580 
along each of those two component
vectors<00:03:44.799> has<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.100> be<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.340> same<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:47.319> turns

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
vectors has to be the same and it turns

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.250 
vectors has to be the same and it turns
out<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.250> while<00:03:49.209> that's<00:03:49.450> true<00:03:49.600> when<00:03:50.110> you're

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
out that while that's true when you're

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.280 
out that while that's true when you're
dumping<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.830> energy<00:03:51.250> into<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.610> system<00:03:52.290> when

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
dumping the energy into the system when

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.640 
dumping the energy into the system when
you're<00:03:53.440> going<00:03:53.799> back<00:03:54.069> in<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.430> other<00:03:54.549> direction

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
you're going back in the other direction

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.470 
you're going back in the other direction
those<00:03:56.650> two<00:03:56.950> component<00:03:57.489> vectors<00:03:57.819> both<00:03:58.060> have<00:03:58.330> to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
those two component vectors both have to

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.720 
those two component vectors both have to
change<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.709> get<00:03:59.860> you<00:04:00.010> back<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.459> where<00:04:00.580> you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
change to get you back to where you

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.940 
change to get you back to where you
started<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.720> they<00:04:01.900> do<00:04:01.959> not<00:04:02.230> change<00:04:02.620> at<00:04:02.860> the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
started but they do not change at the

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.280 
started but they do not change at the
same<00:04:03.130> rate<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.599> reason<00:04:05.019> they<00:04:05.140> don't

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
same rate and the reason they don't

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.589 
same rate and the reason they don't
change<00:04:05.650> at<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.920> same<00:04:06.130> rate<00:04:06.489> is<00:04:06.760> because<00:04:07.480> they

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
change at the same rate is because they

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.350 
change at the same rate is because they
are<00:04:07.720> two<00:04:08.049> independent<00:04:08.640> processes<00:04:09.640> each

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
are two independent processes each

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.670 
are two independent processes each
relying<00:04:10.959> on<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.319> different<00:04:12.040> place<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.680> dump

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
relying on a different place to dump

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.500 
relying on a different place to dump
that<00:04:14.920> energy<00:04:16.470> okay<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:19.090> what<00:04:19.239> we're<00:04:19.419> going

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
that energy okay and so what we're going

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.659 
that energy okay and so what we're going
to<00:04:19.570> talk<00:04:19.840> about<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.470> this<00:04:20.709> process<00:04:21.100> called

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
to talk about is this process called

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.770 
to talk about is this process called
relaxation<00:04:22.770> which<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:24.039> going<00:04:24.729> back<00:04:24.970> from<00:04:25.510> this

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
relaxation which is going back from this

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.779 
relaxation which is going back from this
rotated<00:04:26.590> or<00:04:26.740> sometimes<00:04:27.039> called<00:04:27.100> excited

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
rotated or sometimes called excited

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.050 
rotated or sometimes called excited
state<00:04:28.200> which<00:04:29.200> requires<00:04:29.680> us<00:04:30.039> to<00:04:30.070> remove<00:04:30.820> energy

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
state which requires us to remove energy

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.550 
state which requires us to remove energy
from<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.539> system<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.050> put<00:04:32.229> it<00:04:32.320> someplace

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
from the system and put it someplace

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.180 
from the system and put it someplace
else

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
else

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.930 
else
and<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:34.090> turns<00:04:34.360> out<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:35.940> something

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
and it turns out that that is something

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.760 
and it turns out that that is something
that<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.330> governed<00:04:37.720> by<00:04:37.870> two<00:04:37.930> separate

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
that is governed by two separate

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.670 
that is governed by two separate
processes<00:04:39.300> one<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.450> which<00:04:40.600> describes<00:04:41.229> the

processes one of which describes the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.190
