00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.469
 new hairstyle idea they are 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.170
 super easy and quick to do for this 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.599
 been in fact you're going to see we're going 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.329
 just dress up your ponytail 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.560
 with a bow tie and more you 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.329
 do not need to have hair 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.649
 long also you have nothing for that 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.540
 to make a mini ponytail that 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.250
 get there it will be unique and you go 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.590
 need two small elastics 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.450
 with that in mind that you find a 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.730
 good everywhere but especially at claire's 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.960
 you can find multicolored or 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.850
 even the color of your hair 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.859
 which is rather not bad for what we 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.989
 will do today and then a little 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.719
 pinch a small and pang china 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.870
 so me as of work I will put to 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.460
 left and we'll take roughly 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.550
 behind the ear a small wick 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.949
 who do I do not know how to drown 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.390
 about as big as you reserved there 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.409

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.660

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.080
 leading in your ponytail so 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.930

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.560
