00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
remote play on the ps3 one of the things

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.939 
remote play on the ps3 one of the things
you<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.260> before<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> leave<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> house

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you do before you leave the house

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.269 
you do before you leave the house
actually<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.480> over<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> your<00:00:18.869> ps3<00:00:19.080> says<00:00:20.039> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
actually go over to your ps3 says that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.090 
actually go over to your ps3 says that
for<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> muscle<00:00:20.760> like<00:00:20.880> remote<00:00:21.180> play<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.100> this

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
for a muscle like remote play and this

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.759 
for a muscle like remote play and this
will<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.340> ready<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.180> sets<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> ps3

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
will be ready now so it sets up the ps3

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.470 
will be ready now so it sets up the ps3
so<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.250> seemed<00:00:26.369> basically<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> receiver<00:00:27.210> mode

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so it seemed basically a receiver mode

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
so it seemed basically a receiver mode
exactly<00:00:28.019> ok<00:00:28.289> exactly<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.949> it'll<00:00:29.340> it'll<00:00:29.550> give

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
exactly ok exactly and it'll it'll give

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
exactly ok exactly and it'll it'll give
you<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.480> know<00:00:30.510> indications<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.260> along<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
you you know indications all along the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
you you know indications all along the
way<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.189> or<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.520> play<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:32.969> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
way on how to do this or not play do it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
way on how to do this or not play do it
again<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.450> think<00:00:34.050> maybe<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> internet

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
again I think maybe it was the internet

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.470 
again I think maybe it was the internet
so<00:00:35.160> we'll<00:00:35.460> try<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:37.760> go<00:00:38.760> back<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> our

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
so we'll try that go back down to our

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.720 
so we'll try that go back down to our
Cena<00:00:39.989> public<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> how<00:00:44.040> much<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.340> much<00:00:44.460> tech

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
Cena public so how much how much tech

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.279 
Cena public so how much how much tech
savvy<00:00:45.000> would<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> say<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> requires<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
savvy would you say it requires to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
savvy would you say it requires to
really<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> stuff<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:48.000> pretty

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
really get the stuff going it's pretty

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.760 
really get the stuff going it's pretty
easy<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.750> mean<00:00:48.870> especially<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.559> there

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
easy I mean especially with this there

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
easy I mean especially with this there
are<00:00:49.829> lots<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.329> let<00:00:51.329> me<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.780> i<00:00:52.050> think

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
are lots of let me just back up i think

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
are lots of let me just back up i think
we<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> private<00:00:53.070> network<00:00:53.489> so

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
we have to go on the private network so

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.299 
we have to go on the private network so
there<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.300> lots<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.770> guides<00:00:55.770> along<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> way

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
there are lots of guides along the way

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
there are lots of guides along the way
there's<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.730> sorts<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.510> we've<00:00:57.809> got<00:00:57.960> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a couple times here trying to access the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.800 
a couple times here trying to access the
network<00:01:05.369> it'll<00:01:05.939> pop<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.390> messages

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
network it'll pop up with messages

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
so now we've got it running so now we're

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
so now we've got it running so now we're
actually<00:01:11.460> connecting<00:01:11.939> over<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.299> Internet<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
actually connecting over the Internet so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
actually connecting over the Internet so
you're<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.549> even<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you're actually this is not even the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.170 
you're actually this is not even the
cross<00:01:15.180> media<00:01:15.390> bar<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.140> PSP<00:01:16.439> exactly

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
cross media bar for this PSP exactly

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
cross media bar for this PSP exactly
this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> threes<00:01:18.780> crisis<00:01:19.290> appears<00:01:19.500> threes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this is threes crisis appears threes

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.560 
this is threes crisis appears threes
cross-media<00:01:20.310> bars<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.880> we're<00:01:21.330> looking<00:01:21.420> at

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
cross-media bars so we're looking at

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.090 
cross-media bars so we're looking at
some<00:01:21.750> photos<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.650> i<00:01:22.770> said<00:01:22.920> i<00:01:22.979> could

here's<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.540> trick<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> New<00:01:25.020> York<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.610> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
here's my trick to New York and and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
here's my trick to New York and and
we're<00:01:26.729> looking<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
we're looking at it you can also use the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.560 
we're looking at it you can also use the
slideshow<00:01:28.920> modes<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.340> most<00:01:30.150> reviewers<00:01:30.479> are

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
slideshow modes that most reviewers are

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
slideshow modes that most reviewers are
probably<00:01:30.840> familiar<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.829> ps3<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
probably familiar with on the ps3 and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.310 
probably familiar with on the ps3 and
play<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.540> we'll<00:01:33.630> launch<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
play them in here so we'll launch one of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.179 
play them in here so we'll launch one of
the<00:01:34.380> slideshows<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:36.680> get<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:38.009> as

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the slideshows and get that going as
