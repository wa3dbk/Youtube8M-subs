Korea<00:00:43.460> there's<00:00:44.460> various<00:00:44.910> ones<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> race

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
Korea there's various ones in the race

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
Korea there's various ones in the race
so<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> things<00:00:46.050> about<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> range<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so one of things about the range is it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430 
so one of things about the range is it
all<00:00:47.640> mixed<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.899> were<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> custom

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
all mixed up because there were a custom

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
all mixed up because there were a custom
shop<00:00:49.620> company<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.550> quite<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.120> confusing

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
shop company it's quite a confusing

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
shop company it's quite a confusing
range<00:00:52.320> certainly<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.160> us<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.640> our<00:00:53.820> head

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
range certainly for us to get our head

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
range certainly for us to get our head
round<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.420> you'll<00:00:54.809> find<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> bodies<00:00:55.500> have

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
round so you'll find that bodies have

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
round so you'll find that bodies have
borrowed<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.280> different<00:00:56.730> series<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.329> here

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
borrowed from different series for here

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and there and but it does kind of give

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.920 
and there and but it does kind of give
you<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> night<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> gives<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> different

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

you a night you can gives you different
options<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.649> sometimes<00:01:02.100> you'll<00:01:02.250> find<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
options and sometimes you'll find out I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.039

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
grain on it's a bit dull and boring so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
grain on it's a bit dull and boring so
they<00:01:39.509> either<00:01:39.659> something<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> finish<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.100> like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
they either something to finish it like

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
they either something to finish it like
this<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> wood<00:01:42.600> all

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
this so you can really see the wood all

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020 
this so you can really see the wood all
they<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> flare<00:01:43.979> maple<00:01:44.310> couple<00:01:44.670> come<00:01:44.909> on

they put a flare maple couple come on
serve<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.329> later<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.470> sectors<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
serve up later so that sectors are and

it's not cheap plastic no it's drink
passes<00:01:59.850> through<00:02:00.060> there<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.450> easily<00:02:00.719> it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
passes through there really easily it

sectors<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.040> machine<00:02:02.340> its<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.930> different

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
sectors on machine its this is different

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
sectors on machine its this is different
from<00:02:04.500> having<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> stock<00:02:05.250> machine<00:02:05.640> air<00:02:05.850> because

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
from having a stock machine air because

Schecter<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.540> been<00:02:06.659> making<00:02:06.810> these<00:02:07.110> parts

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
Schecter have been making these parts

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.910 
Schecter have been making these parts
for<00:02:07.649> years<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.670> they<00:02:08.789> know<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> good<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
for years so they know what a good and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160 
for years so they know what a good and
that<00:02:10.640> kind<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:10.849> cheap<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.300> stuff<00:02:11.510> by<00:02:11.690> putting

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
that kind of cheap and stuff by putting

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.589 
that kind of cheap and stuff by putting
their<00:02:12.620> own<00:02:12.800> brand<00:02:13.099> stuff<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:13.610> which<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.420> good

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
their own brand stuff on which is good

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.199 
their own brand stuff on which is good
so<00:02:14.840> that's<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.110> double<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.440> sixty<00:02:15.890> looks<00:02:16.209> well

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
so that's the double of sixty looks well

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.630 
so that's the double of sixty looks well
look<00:02:17.330> at<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.510> V<00:02:17.690> next<00:02:18.170> similar<00:02:19.099> in<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.400> it's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
look at the V next similar in that it's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.160 
look at the V next similar in that it's

most comfortable this has to play a
quite<00:02:31.340> often<00:02:31.580> but<00:02:32.060> you'll<00:02:32.510> find<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.020> is

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
quite often but you'll find that that is

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.020 
quite often but you'll find that that is
really<00:02:33.440> nice<00:02:33.739> nice<00:02:34.280> balance<00:02:34.819> when<00:02:34.970> you're

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
really nice nice balance when you're

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.910 
really nice nice balance when you're
actually<00:02:35.150> playing<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.750> again<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.620> fine

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
actually playing it again is that fine

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.040 
actually playing it again is that fine

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
we've got a sunset extreme here so this

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.420 
we've got a sunset extreme here so this
is<00:03:12.140> an<00:03:12.230> example<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.830> being<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.040> bus<00:03:13.220> with

is an example of it being a bus with

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.720 
is an example of it being a bus with
