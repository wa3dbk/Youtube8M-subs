awesome product I have to say it's a new
lens<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.800> Olympus<00:00:26.400> III<00:00:28.550> this<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.849> right

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
lens for my Olympus III this is right

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.069 
lens for my Olympus III this is right
now<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.140> using<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.460> pro<00:00:32.730> level<00:00:33.239> lens<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
now I'm using the the pro level lens the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.750 
now I'm using the the pro level lens the
14<00:00:34.620> 54<00:00:35.719> millimeter<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.230> f<00:00:37.410> 2.8<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.600> 3.5<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
14 54 millimeter it's f 2.8 to 3.5 and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.380 
14 54 millimeter it's f 2.8 to 3.5 and
so<00:00:41.760> that's<00:00:42.000> equivalent<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:43.010> 128<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> hundred

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
so that's equivalent to 128 to a hundred

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
so that's equivalent to 128 to a hundred
and<00:00:45.539> something<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.710> actually<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and something so I actually do get a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.799 
and something so I actually do get a
good<00:00:47.850> range<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.600> camera<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.800> 3.5

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
good range on this camera but the 3.5

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.270 
good range on this camera but the 3.5
aperture<00:00:51.809> end<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.949> too

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
aperture end of it is not too

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.660 
aperture end of it is not too
spectacular<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:54.360> concert<00:00:54.809> photography

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
is the 14 to 35 millimeter that's a more

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.469 
is the 14 to 35 millimeter that's a more
narrow<00:01:05.159> narrower<00:01:05.909> range<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.479> 2.0

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479

systems in the world so this is made in
Japan<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.070> let's<00:02:50.850> try<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.970> to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
Japan and let's try this on so so to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.600 
Japan and let's try this on so so to
compare<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.810> lenses<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> was

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
compare the lenses this is what I was
