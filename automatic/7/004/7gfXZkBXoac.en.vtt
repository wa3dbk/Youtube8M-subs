00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
at the Olympics even though you've had

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
at the Olympics even though you've had
them<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.759> cycling<00:01:24.540> champions<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:24.990> the

them in in will cycling champions in the
past<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> feel<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.610> you've<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
past so how do you feel now you've got a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.260 
past so how do you feel now you've got a
shot<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.689> three<00:01:28.020> different<00:01:28.170> events<00:01:29.060> which<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
shot at three different events which is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
shot at three different events which is
great<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.810> obviously<00:01:31.290> triples<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> workload

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
great but obviously triples the workload

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.210 
great but obviously triples the workload
no<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.150> said<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> real<00:01:34.680> change<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.040> work

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
no it said it is a real change of work

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
no it said it is a real change of work
low<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.579> terms<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> training<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
low in terms of the training I think the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.120 
low in terms of the training I think the
trainings<00:01:37.200> pretty<00:01:37.439> much<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> same<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.009> all

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
trainings pretty much the same for all

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
trainings pretty much the same for all
three<00:01:38.369> events<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> their<00:01:39.329> events<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.689> i

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
three events and and their events that i

you<00:01:42.240> know<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.600> three<00:01:43.079> quarters<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> year

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you know for three quarters of the year

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139 
you know for three quarters of the year
you're<00:01:44.280> working<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.820> those<00:01:44.939> through

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you're working for those through

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
you're working for those through
anywhere<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.960> last<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.470> towards

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
anywhere and then the last bit towards

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
anywhere and then the last bit towards
the<00:01:46.920> Olympics<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> specified

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the Olympics is just kind of specified

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
the Olympics is just kind of specified
just<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.530> three<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.430> it's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
just one out for three so I think it's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
just one out for three so I think it's
nice<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:50.970> more<00:01:51.180> opportunities<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
nice to have more opportunities and the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.389 
nice to have more opportunities and the
fact<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> events<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
fact that also one of the events is a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.590 
fact that also one of the events is a
team<00:01:53.610> event<00:01:53.640> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.119> something<00:01:54.329> I've<00:01:54.450> never

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
team event which is something I've never

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.040 
team event which is something I've never
done<00:01:54.720> before<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.890> seriously<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
done before really that seriously and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.350 
done before really that seriously and
it's<00:01:57.260> nice<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.710> do<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> team<00:01:58.580> event<00:01:58.730> it<00:01:59.030> brings<00:01:59.240> a

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
it's nice to do a team event it brings a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.940 
it's nice to do a team event it brings a
different<00:01:59.480> element<00:01:59.690> training<00:02:00.350> with<00:02:00.500> somebody

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
different element training with somebody

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.620 
different element training with somebody
and<00:02:01.220> together<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.090> an<00:02:02.180> event<00:02:02.360> rather<00:02:02.510> it

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
and together in an event rather it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.230 
and together in an event rather it
always<00:02:02.810> being<00:02:03.080> individual<00:02:03.920> sport<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:05.150> think

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
always being individual sport so I think

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.940 
always being individual sport so I think
that's<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.690> really<00:02:06.140> exciting<00:02:06.560> element<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:06.920> I

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's a really exciting element and I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.230 
that's a really exciting element and I
think<00:02:07.160> we've<00:02:07.250> got<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> good<00:02:07.490> chance<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.119> as

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
think we've got a good chance in it as

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.910 
think we've got a good chance in it as
well<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.020> think<00:02:09.260> it's<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.500> great<00:02:09.530> thing<00:02:09.860> for

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
well so I think it's a great thing for

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.770 
well so I think it's a great thing for

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
games over the last 12 months she

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.540 
games over the last 12 months she
couldn't<00:02:42.350> she<00:02:42.590> could<00:02:42.740> really<00:02:42.890> ask<00:02:43.070> any<00:02:43.340> more

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
couldn't she could really ask any more

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.460 
couldn't she could really ask any more
of<00:02:43.610> herself<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.180> she's<00:02:44.870> still<00:02:45.050> improving

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
of herself and she's still improving

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.280 
of herself and she's still improving
rapidly<00:02:45.770> so<00:02:46.510> we're<00:02:47.510> about<00:02:47.690> even<00:02:47.870> at<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
rapidly so we're about even at the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.200 
rapidly so we're about even at the
moment<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.770> its<00:02:48.950> fraction<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.670> second

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
moment like its fraction of a second

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.520 
moment like its fraction of a second
between<00:02:50.420> us<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> best<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.350> world

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
between us and the best in the world

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.930 
between us and the best in the world
right<00:02:51.830> now<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.250> really<00:02:52.280> think<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.760> we've

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
right now and I really think that we've

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.750 
right now and I really think that we've
got<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.330> capacity<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.980> really<00:02:55.190> move<00:02:55.460> on

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
got the capacity and to really move on

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.790 
got the capacity and to really move on
performance<00:02:56.210> forward<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.720> get<00:02:57.050> faster<00:02:57.590> so

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
performance forward and get faster so

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.400 
performance forward and get faster so
you<00:02:58.120> know<00:02:59.120> jess<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.600> doing<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.840> fantastic<00:02:59.990> job

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
shot at the world's last year but i

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.900 
shot at the world's last year but i
think<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.470> just<00:03:39.560> wasn't<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.190> wasn't<00:03:40.550> my<00:03:40.670> type

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
think it just wasn't it wasn't my type

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.160 
think it just wasn't it wasn't my type
of<00:03:41.090> her<00:03:41.150> but<00:03:41.360> she's<00:03:41.540> still<00:03:41.750> very<00:03:41.810> much

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
of her but she's still very much

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.720 
of her but she's still very much
interested<00:03:42.560> in<00:03:42.860> being<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.250> track<00:03:43.489> so

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
interested in being on the track so

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.580 
interested in being on the track so
everyone's<00:03:44.630> pushing<00:03:44.900> each<00:03:45.140> other<00:03:45.320> forward

everyone's pushing each other forward

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.680 
everyone's pushing each other forward
and<00:03:45.770> i<00:03:46.070> think<00:03:46.340> that's<00:03:46.730> what<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:46.910> want<00:03:47.120> exactly

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.690 
and i think that's what you want exactly
i<00:03:47.720> think<00:03:48.020> it<00:03:48.170> that's<00:03:48.650> what<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:48.860> need<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.250> cut

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
i think it that's what you need that cut

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.280 
i think it that's what you need that cut
competition<00:03:50.239> within<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.540> team's<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:50.870> really

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290

spur<00:03:51.560> people<00:03:51.950> on<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.190> get<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.370> best<00:03:52.459> out

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
spur people on to get the best out

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.550 
spur people on to get the best out
themselves<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.269> we're<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.570> really<00:03:53.780> lucky
