whatever you can stop it with and you
take<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.470> off<00:00:50.559> -<00:00:51.559> those<00:00:51.830> are<00:00:52.010> busted

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.210 

we're<00:01:41.620> at<00:01:41.740> risk<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:42.190> boring<00:01:42.640> video<00:01:43.770> yes<00:01:44.770> that's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
we're at risk of boring video yes that's

00:01:45.220 --> 00:02:01.640 
we're at risk of boring video yes that's
why<00:01:45.370> you<00:01:45.430> edit<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:59.010> hang<00:02:00.010> on<00:02:00.250> I

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
why you edit it so you just hang on I

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.390 
why you edit it so you just hang on I
just<00:02:02.650> loosened<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.490> these<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.250> have

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
just loosened all these up now you have

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.460 
just loosened all these up now you have
to<00:02:06.520> take<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.850> off<00:02:07.000> all<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.690> way<00:02:07.780> off<00:02:07.990> very

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
to take it off all the way off very

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.460 
to take it off all the way off very
simple<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.760> that's<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.810> wrong<00:02:10.990> way<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.230> do<00:02:11.440> it

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
simple and that's the wrong way to do it

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:21.540 
simple and that's the wrong way to do it
but<00:02:11.710> that's<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.070> way<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:15.280> last<00:02:15.730> bowl<00:02:20.550> then

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
but that's a way so the last bowl then

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:30.990 
but that's a way so the last bowl then
does<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.090> pull<00:02:22.300> off<00:02:22.950> sometimes<00:02:29.820> are<00:02:30.820> you

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
does it just pull off sometimes are you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.830 
does it just pull off sometimes are you
supposed<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.450> tap<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:37.090> tap<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:37.720> I'd

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
supposed to tap it can tap it but I'd

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.490 
supposed to tap it can tap it but I'd
recommend<00:02:37.990> getting<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:39.210> pry<00:02:40.210> bar<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.350> have

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
recommend getting a pry bar do you have

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.860 
recommend getting a pry bar do you have
a<00:02:41.530> pry<00:02:41.800> bar<00:02:41.830> right<00:02:42.640> there<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.150> big<00:02:43.300> long<00:02:43.600> one

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
a pry bar right there that big long one

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.650 
a pry bar right there that big long one
that's<00:02:44.650> yeah<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.610> then<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:46.090> from<00:02:46.300> side<00:02:46.630> to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
that's yeah and then go from side to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:03:06.000 
that's yeah and then go from side to
side<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:58.440> back<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.620> forth<00:02:59.760> very<00:03:00.760> good<00:03:05.010> so

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
side so back and forth very good so

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.400 
side so back and forth very good so
moving

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.050 

that<00:03:15.410> flight<00:03:15.710> is<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.100> flex<00:03:16.340> played<00:03:16.580> any<00:03:16.790> good

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
that flight is that flex played any good

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.930 
that flight is that flex played any good
yeah<00:03:17.720> looks<00:03:18.320> like<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.740> well<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:18.980> know<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.730> teeth

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
yeah looks like it well I know the teeth

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.160 
yeah looks like it well I know the teeth
rope<00:03:20.210> chewed<00:03:20.480> up<00:03:20.630> right<00:03:20.810> there

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
rope chewed up right there

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.770 
rope chewed up right there
yeah<00:03:21.350> what<00:03:21.650> about<00:03:21.830> over<00:03:21.980> here<00:03:22.720> right<00:03:23.720> there

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
yeah what about over here right there

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.070 
yeah what about over here right there
that's<00:03:24.260> kinda<00:03:24.590> what<00:03:24.710> I<00:03:24.800> was<00:03:24.920> wondering<00:03:26.080> like

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
that's kinda what I was wondering like

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.310 
that's kinda what I was wondering like
so<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.410> appears<00:03:27.950> if<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.430> spin<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:30.140> will

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
so it appears if you spin it it will

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.260 
so it appears if you spin it it will
come<00:03:30.530> on<00:03:35.020> you<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.800> that's<00:03:36.950> how<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.850> take<00:03:38.060> off

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
come on you and that's how you take off

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.820 
come on you and that's how you take off
a<00:03:38.540> flex<00:03:38.930> plate<00:03:39.290> on<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:40.660> 1966<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:42.050> 89

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
a flex plate on a 1966 to 89

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:51.070 
a flex plate on a 1966 to 89
without<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.910> proper<00:03:44.090> tools<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:50.600> red<00:03:50.780> button

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
without the proper tools the red button

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.430 
without the proper tools the red button
the<00:03:51.380> hour<00:03:51.470> but<00:03:51.920> just<00:03:52.130> push<00:03:52.310> home<00:03:52.550> or<00:03:52.790> walk

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
the hour but just push home or walk

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.990 
the hour but just push home or walk
pretty<00:03:54.440> straightforward<00:03:55.310> they<00:03:55.670> want<00:03:55.880> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
pretty straightforward they want the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.820 
pretty straightforward they want the
white<00:03:56.180> part<00:03:56.510> at<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.840> bottom<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.500> inch<00:03:57.650> and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
white part at the bottom of the inch and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.630 
white part at the bottom of the inch and
I<00:03:57.890> think<00:03:58.130> right<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.590> then<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:04.220> put<00:04:04.490> this

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
I think right and then you put this

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.340 
I think right and then you put this
piece<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:05.090> first<00:04:05.420> you're<00:04:05.720> gonna<00:04:05.870> try<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.110> mess

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
piece on first you're gonna try to mess

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.400 
piece on first you're gonna try to mess
with<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.800> putting<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.670> engines<00:04:08.000> dude

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
with the putting it on the engines dude

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:20.590 
with the putting it on the engines dude
that<00:04:09.410> would<00:04:09.530> be<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.860> wrong<00:04:10.100> way<00:04:19.239> so<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.299> what

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
that would be the wrong way so you what

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.720 
that would be the wrong way so you what
you'll<00:04:20.810> want<00:04:20.960> to<00:04:21.110> do<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.190> will<00:04:22.310> want<00:04:22.640> to

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
you'll want to do is you will want to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.550 
you'll want to do is you will want to
use<00:04:23.210> make<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.320> bottom<00:04:24.680> legs<00:04:24.920> level<00:04:26.410> with<00:04:27.410> the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
use make the bottom legs level with the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.390 
use make the bottom legs level with the
engine<00:04:29.980> cost<00:04:31.630> yeah

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
engine cost yeah

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.060 
engine cost yeah
like<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:36.200> then<00:04:36.410> you're<00:04:36.590> gonna<00:04:36.710> try<00:04:37.040> to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
like that and then you're gonna try to

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.280 
like that and then you're gonna try to
line<00:04:37.460> up<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.670> top<00:04:38.090> one<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:38.840> make<00:04:39.080> sure<00:04:39.110> that

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
line up the top one so make sure that

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.400 
line up the top one so make sure that
they'll<00:04:39.860> bolt<00:04:40.160> up<00:04:40.510> will<00:04:41.510> they<00:04:41.630> both<00:04:41.810> up<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.260> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
they'll bolt up will they both up to the
