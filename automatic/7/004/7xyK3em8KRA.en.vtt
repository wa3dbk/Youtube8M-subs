00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550 

nowadays<00:00:00.709> let's<00:00:01.709> see<00:00:01.949> where<00:00:02.159> they<00:00:02.340> come<00:00:02.580> from

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
nowadays let's see where they come from

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.900 
nowadays let's see where they come from
carbohydrates<00:00:04.560> provide<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.190> energy<00:00:05.339> for<00:00:05.790> the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
carbohydrates provide the energy for the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.450 
carbohydrates provide the energy for the
growing<00:00:06.150> plant<00:00:06.600> so<00:00:07.319> they<00:00:07.470> can<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.859> found<00:00:08.130> in

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
growing plant so they can be found in

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.450 
growing plant so they can be found in
the<00:00:08.639> starchy<00:00:09.150> portion<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.840> plant<00:00:10.280> they<00:00:11.280> also

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
the starchy portion of a plant they also

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.060 
the starchy portion of a plant they also
give<00:00:11.910> sweetness<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.690> fruits<00:00:13.019> vegetables<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
give sweetness to fruits vegetables and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.390 
give sweetness to fruits vegetables and
honey<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.639> at<00:00:15.599> last<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.260> find<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.949> refined

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
honey and at last you find the refined

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.750 
honey and at last you find the refined
variety<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.330> sweet<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.930> soft<00:00:19.289> drinks<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:20.609> it's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
variety in sweet and soft drinks so it's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.320 
variety in sweet and soft drinks so it's
a<00:00:20.850> very<00:00:20.880> large<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.689> heterogeneous<00:00:22.260> group

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
a very large and heterogeneous group

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.179 
a very large and heterogeneous group
when<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.480> talk<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:24.920> carbohydrates<00:00:25.920> we

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
when we talk about carbohydrates we

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.609 
when we talk about carbohydrates we
should<00:00:26.400> really<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> good<00:00:27.480> look<00:00:27.689> at<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
should really have a good look at the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.429 
should really have a good look at the
response<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.300> initiates<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> body

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
response that it initiates in the body

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.520 
response that it initiates in the body
so<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.759> context<00:00:33.660> when<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.320> talk

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so it is this context when we can talk

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.819 
so it is this context when we can talk
about<00:00:34.829> good<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.130> bad<00:00:35.340> carbohydrates<00:00:36.680> when<00:00:37.680> we

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
about good and bad carbohydrates when we

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.040 
about good and bad carbohydrates when we
eat<00:00:37.980> carbohydrates<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:39.360> get<00:00:39.570> broken<00:00:39.809> down

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
eat carbohydrates they get broken down

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.190 
eat carbohydrates they get broken down
to<00:00:40.770> smaller<00:00:41.129> units<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.140> going

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to smaller units and then we are going

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.529 
to smaller units and then we are going
to<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.620> absorbed<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> either<00:00:44.850> used<00:00:45.239> right

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
to be absorbed and either used right

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.130 
to be absorbed and either used right
away<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:46.200> put<00:00:46.590> away<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:46.950> later<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> when

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
away or put away for later use so when

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
away or put away for later use so when
we<00:00:49.289> talk<00:00:49.500> about<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:50.280> whole<00:00:50.520> process<00:00:50.850> we

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
we talk about this whole process we

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.939 
we talk about this whole process we
really<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> understand<00:00:52.620> how<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
really have to understand how the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.479 
really have to understand how the
hormone<00:00:53.610> insulin<00:00:53.789> works<00:00:55.250> insulin<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
hormone insulin works insulin is the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.970 
hormone insulin works insulin is the
hormone<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:57.270> plenty<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.289> hormone<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
hormone of plenty the hormone of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.389 
hormone of plenty the hormone of
abundance<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.789> prosperity<00:01:01.010> when<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.219> eat

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
abundance and prosperity when we eat

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.780 
abundance and prosperity when we eat
sugar<00:01:03.180> or<00:01:03.719> carbohydrate<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.739> any<00:01:04.890> form<00:01:05.280> then

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
sugar or carbohydrate in any form then

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.899 
sugar or carbohydrate in any form then
insulin<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> could<00:01:06.960> escort<00:01:07.470> glucose<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
insulin is could escort glucose the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.780 
insulin is could escort glucose the
smallest<00:01:09.390> unit<00:01:09.780> inside<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> cells<00:01:10.799> but

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
smallest unit inside the cells but

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.570 
smallest unit inside the cells but
that's<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.080> does<00:01:13.400> being<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that's not all that it does being the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.240 
that's not all that it does being the
hormone<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.299> abundance<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.170> also<00:01:16.590> helps

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
hormone of abundance it also helps

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
hormone of abundance it also helps
protein<00:01:17.759> synthesis<00:01:18.360> synthesis<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
protein synthesis synthesis which is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.640 
protein synthesis synthesis which is
very<00:01:19.799> good<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.180> also<00:01:21.540> helps<00:01:22.229> fat

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
very good but it also helps fat

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.010 
very good but it also helps fat
deposition<00:01:23.060> which<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.810> popular

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
deposition which is not a very popular

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.219 
deposition which is not a very popular
side<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.799> insulin<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> let's<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> look<00:01:28.110> at

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
side of insulin so let's have a look at

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
side of insulin so let's have a look at
the<00:01:28.409> body's<00:01:28.740> response<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.520> good<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> bad

sugary soft drink lots of insulin being

that<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.170> goes<00:02:37.379> below<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.069> starting<00:02:38.639> value

that it goes below the starting value

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.220 
that it goes below the starting value
causing<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.159> blood<00:02:41.430> sugar<00:02:41.670> low<00:02:42.030> which<00:02:42.930> means

causing a blood sugar low which means

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
causing a blood sugar low which means
more<00:02:43.530> hunger<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.340> then<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.329> stabilizes<00:02:46.250> what

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
more hunger and then it stabilizes what
