00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.629
 Talk about who's talking about the rogÃ©rio. 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.519
 d tech and today in bringing a video 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.110
 explanation of one of our products that 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.680
 is of 64 cross reminding that the rb tec is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.470
 official everton dealer at 64 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.750
 okay and all the products clips from the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 models of truth, we also 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.330
 works with is 64 plus 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.130
 but that cartridge issue that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.000
 needed to be coupled which bothers a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.890
 little 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 not to lose the aesthetics of the console 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.050
 imagine that 164 with eight cartridges in 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.410
 Up in has nothing to do 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.980
 there we brought the solution that is 64 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.329
 that does not need a cartridge attached and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.940
 they even have this 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.719
 this one here for you to put a 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.640
 cartridge 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.320
 but you will never need to open the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.460
 ok because it 's 64 from rb tec do not need 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.780
 I as I will demonstrate now here is from 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.930
 today not to lose the card of 64 is 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.930
 different from that is true and is on the side 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.299
 has that door that sbt also the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 memory card attached 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:24.360
 let's go the tests docked here in the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:28.310
 connected to the video screen . 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.079
