00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.920
 Good morning everyone and welcome from 

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:07.170
 new to my channel at least in spain- 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.349
 little by little the screens of 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.769
 lacquered aluminum bath or whatever 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.049
 glass or not sliding or not curved or 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.270
 straight but are still very common 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.970
 Straight or curved bath bars for 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.970
 put the bathroom curtains on 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.130
 bathtubs this is a curved model but today 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.460
 I come to show you how to repair this bar 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.890
 of bath straight the face in white and that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.530
 there are also in anodized aluminum in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 silver color the enormous advantage of this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.780
 type of bars for the bathroom curtain 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.700
 is that they are practically eternal is not 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.980
 obviously oxidized because they are made 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.750
 in lacquered aluminum or not 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.220
 and especially that you do not have to do 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.920
 holes and you can remove them and put 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.450
 when hell you want is trouble 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.090
 that you are seeing is about five years old 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.010
 and it is already as you see striped and with spots 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.629
 and then I will clean it with the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.910
 nothing zero and I'll leave it as new 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.100
 I will also teach you how to self 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 sustains and what is to be done 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 if you take the bar too much and then not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.340
 you can put it in because if you try 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 put upside down is the load that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 I assure we started 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.230
 I will try to restore it with this with 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.840
 steel wool is nothing zero of four 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.800
 zeros you can use the 30's just from 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.750
 four zeroes nor the 2001 the heel neither 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.870
 the zero even because you would stay 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.610
 radial Mars you see that I am also going to 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.210
 zoom in to make it look 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210
 louis how is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.380
 everything that is dirt the wool of 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.799
 steel is going to take it ahead and what 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.929
 will leave as new will not take away the 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.429
 blows that have scratches very 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.500
 deep will not take it away from you 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.909
 It seems that I've been lucky and it's going 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.630
 to be perfect because only 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.299
 dirt 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.290
 that has occurred according to normal use 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.080
 from the bar 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.300
 and finished cleaning the bar by removing 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.700
 the plugs you wear on the end 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 also, what a crap 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.500
 I leave it unedited because I want it 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.530
 you see a detail 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.140
 As you can see, the bar is running 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.340
 perfect as well as factory output and 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 it saves me a few euros 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.819
 but unfortunately there is one thing that 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.689
 will not be able to fix the wool of 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.689
 steel in this case 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.170
 I mean do not do to the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.940
 ampules that I have gone to paint in 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.940
 the end of the outer bar 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.020
 at this very moment I am cleaning 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.060
 that area and as you can see it does not remove the blister 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.100
 but neither does the enamel make you jump 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.360
 leaving you ugly the only thing he does is 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.550
 cleanse you in depth 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.380
 if I had not had those blisters in the 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.990
 repair I would have stayed 10 out of 10 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.150
 let's say you now have a 9 half over 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.319
 10 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.319
 this type of straight bars 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:08.900
 and I insist go from wall to wall 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:12.519
 they are tied by two rubber ends 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.519
 what are the stops let's say it like that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.400
 I will also clean 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.590
 one plus one has more diameter than another 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.340
 because when extendable this is requested 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.100
 technically as a straight bathroom rod 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.180
 100 millimeters and it 's specifically 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.840
 from number 2 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.120
 that will wear out at 216 from 93 to 216 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.330
 hours and it seems to me I do not remember very 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:46.380
 well so long ago you will not forget 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.840
 but then, as they are two parts 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.840
 this logically corresponds to this side 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.290
 and the center corresponds to the other side 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.150
 how this works because this has a 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.560
 pier inside 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.920
 It has a neighborhood inside I do not know if they are worth 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.980
 You see how it sounds 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.680
 then it is very well pushes the low 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.069
 against the walls and 6-0 holds already 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.069
 alone 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.410
 then you have to remove it 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.270
 you have to take it out a bit more 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.340
 example if the distance between walls is 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.680
 2 meters at 2 meters and 3 sacks 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.750
 centimeters and those 3 centimeters the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.730
 you have to push inwards not the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.680
 3 centimeters but what you can what 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.580
 put in place and when you release the dock 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.870
 pushes and self-holds eye trick and 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.260
 this is the reason 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:49.340
 video is that if you spend then equal 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.920
 you have no strength to put the bar and 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.290
 you have a problem I say 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.260
 the solution first thing is to remove the two 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.710
 plugs if you've gone 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.690
 is to remove both the two the two 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.470
 rubber plugs of both the two 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.910
 junteras 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.750
 and take it out completely 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.750
 in this sense 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:20.520
 now 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:24.540
 because he was going around home and not 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.680
 try never do not try to put it 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.130
 well because it 's a little eyelash 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.930
 here no bearing is pestaÃ±ita 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.130
 here this tab if it breaks you can 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.130
 throw him 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.340
 the whole gossip what you have to do 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.160
 what you have to do 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.260
 but beijing 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.860
 what you have to do is 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.219
 totally 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.710
 there it is not also to turn around 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.460
 the fine bar put it by the end that 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.460
 it does not have very well 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.440
 when he's there and talks, you pick him up 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:07.680
 the big plug in its place 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.680
 and the small cap in its place 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.330
 you have to you can take it out again 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.530
 as this is already fully operational 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.660
 again what we have to do 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.569
 is now to put the curtains and with their 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.940
 rings and we go to the bathroom 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.379
 this is the bathroom where I'm going to put it 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.690
 I insist on the enormous advantage of this type 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.190
 of bathroom bars for the curtain is that 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.990
 you do not need to make holes in 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.210
 walls since it does not have auto supports 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.669
 Holds but to put them you need 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.139
 as in this case that the two walls of 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.610
 the bathtub I want to say be between two 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.610
 walls facing each other 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.570
 Well, I'm not sure, but I 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.529
 I usually put it on top of the edge 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.390
 this 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:50.580
 ah 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.620
 and the curtain inside the left clear 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.090
 so that nothing comes out or because if 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.660
 not when you shower the water goes away 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.400
 popular, well, it's already placed 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:05.840
 as you see 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.840
 and it's very strong but it's so extreme 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.060
 I mean 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:15.030
 and it holds well we're pulling and now 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.780
 all you do is for that 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.780
 eternal 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.240
 good at the end as you see I had put it 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:29.539
 too low he was touching the part 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.610
 from below the bathtub eye tricks where 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:34.820
 the plastic ends up being able then 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:38.660
 what I have done has been as you see 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:41.090
 raise it a few inches and here 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.810
 until the same side and now only 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.710
 is to put the door 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.110
 and even the bathroom in favor 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.760
 Well, nothing, I say goodbye, I hope that 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.100
 someone has served as an orientation 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.650
 if it's been like this and you want to see this guy 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.630
 of videos to subscribe and run like 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.350
 Item' 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.470
 and that gives pleasure and shares do not be 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.470
 selfish
