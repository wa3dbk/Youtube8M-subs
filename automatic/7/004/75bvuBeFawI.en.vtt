00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.700
 new technique sloth video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.290
 the chrome browser for ios annoys me 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 since some days I should be 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.849
 please finally make the latest update 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 there are two new features and the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.450
 I definitely need number one 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.340
 translate 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.109
 okay that can be here and there completely 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 it is usually annoying to be useful 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.189
 but he and most disable it 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.400
 synonymous jerk but the main feature 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.560
 data usage reduce the android 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.470
 Fraction has known it for a long time 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.079
 this function for quite some time and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.059
 she's also on ios now and google 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.000
 advertise with reduce yours 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.500
 data usage up to 50 percent and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.579
 We want to fix that now 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.780
 debug 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.399
 I have the app now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.379
 updated and if you then chrome 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.640
 starts then does not come new window 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.809
 Congratulations for being here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.050
 the new functions 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.020
 there would have to look for yourself because in the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.000
 Settings are now the option 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.059
 Bandwidth and there are also 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.800
 Reduce data usage like that and if I do 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.780
 the now activate because there are still 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 times the hint if this function 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.310
 activated is used the chrome 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.799
 server from google to visited pages 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.720
 to download the download ssl 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.850
 and incognito pages are of it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.070
 except, therefore, who is afraid now again 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.369
 before passwords or anything else has or 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.540
 the lottery lottery pages surfing behavior 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.340
 You can keep track of it honestly 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.500
 industry already such a google product 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.229
 and then they do not need extra 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
 still to compress the data to 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.689
 so to speak, your visited pages 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.549
 ranzukommen 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.159
 these data are anyway if you do 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.530
 activated have already been sent to google 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.479
 means for us now we can 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.670
 just that compression stool 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.079
 use and I hope so now 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.180
 Just a round 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.600
 Of course I'll do it wlan before 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600
 out 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.140
 so now I am on one 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.030
 English side and now comes here 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.410
 Below is the new feature this page 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.370
 in English in the following language 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.960
 translate german 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.310
 no and now he asks me too 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.430
 English translate or just this 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.900
 translate english pages 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.310
 Now we have the language out and 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.250
 hopefully never will 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.959
 asked her that way and a few minutes later 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.940
 may have seen i have engineering 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.790
 sloth twitter and search from surfed 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.980
 and have already saved six percent 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.070
 normally I would have 45 megabytes 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.209
 now consumes 4.2 mb 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.190
 I'll say a little more 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.880
 more surfing we might come to 10 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.709
 percent 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.750
 and I guess that's the one 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.989
 or others then quite interesting 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.180
 if he has much data in the browser 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.620
 if somebody exacerbates you if you are 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.230
 only pictures with whatsapp back and forth 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.989
 send or google hangout video chats 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.550
 then make use of his data 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.430
 of course, nothing is reduced in the browser 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.530
 but who keeps a lot in the browser around with it 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.180
 surfing in google chrome also wants 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.209
 if someone only a small 300 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.330
 megabyte package has that comes with it 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.880
 as far as 10 330 mw and more even if 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.430
 is only 6 percent then should be considered 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.200
 we still felt that 300 18 mb 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.200
 which one then has for free disposal 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.360
 So the whole works I recommend 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.580
 Just turn it on and 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.780
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.780
 and until the next video
