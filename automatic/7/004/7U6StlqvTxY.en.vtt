can even stand still and the barrel is
actually<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.150> good<00:01:27.330> used<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
actually really good used so this is

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
actually really good used so this is
maybe<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> first<00:01:30.030> instruction<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
maybe the first instruction we have in a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
maybe the first instruction we have in a
sly<00:01:31.290> cooper<00:01:31.470> game

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
sly cooper game

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140 
sly cooper game

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
and this disguise is actually really

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.950 
and this disguise is actually really
good<00:01:38.920> because<00:01:39.100> in<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.970> can't<00:01:40.600> actually

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
good because in it you can't actually

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.510 
good because in it you can't actually
get<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.590> can't<00:01:44.770> get<00:01:44.890> spot<00:01:45.130> by<00:01:45.250> flashlight

codes if you stand still so that's

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.120 
codes if you stand still so that's
