00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
definitely that was my goal

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.060

conditionings<00:01:06.090> never<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.500> problem<00:01:07.860> for

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
conditionings never really a problem for

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.350 
conditionings never really a problem for
me<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> could<00:01:08.549> eat<00:01:08.640> whatever<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
me I could eat whatever I want the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
me I could eat whatever I want the
offseason<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.560> stay<00:01:10.830> about<00:01:11.100> eight<00:01:11.400> percent

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
offseason and I stay about eight percent

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.570 
offseason and I stay about eight percent
year<00:01:12.030> round<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.040> conditioning<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.130> easy<00:01:14.280> for

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
year round so conditioning is easy for

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.690 
year round so conditioning is easy for
me<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.119> filling<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.540> frame<00:01:16.700> eight

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
me it's just filling out my frame eight

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
me it's just filling out my frame eight
a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.210> more<00:01:18.420> try<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.200> least<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.590> mean

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
a little bit more try to at least I mean

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.570 
a little bit more try to at least I mean
that's<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> hardest<00:01:20.280> part

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that's the hardest part

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.789 
that's the hardest part
and<00:01:20.790> definitely<00:01:21.750> train<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> little<00:01:22.470> heavier

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
and definitely train a little heavier

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.950 
and definitely train a little heavier

my<00:01:47.189> size<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.640> me<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.000> looks<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> haven't

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
my size to me it looks and I haven't

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.670

seen<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.960> scale<00:01:49.229> yet<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.470> looks<00:01:49.500> like

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
seen you on a scale yet it looks like

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
seen you on a scale yet it looks like
you've<00:01:49.799> put<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.040> almost<00:01:50.340> ten<00:01:50.490> pounds<00:01:50.790> since

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
you've put on almost ten pounds since
last<00:01:51.119> year<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.140> guessing<00:01:52.369> from

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
last year that's what I'm guessing from

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
last year that's what I'm guessing from
I<00:01:53.790> try<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> scale<00:01:54.869> too<00:01:55.020> much

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
I try not to get on the scale too much

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.980 
I try not to get on the scale too much
because<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.649> me<00:01:55.920> my<00:01:56.210> metabolism<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.479> fast

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
because for me my metabolism so fast

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.050 
because for me my metabolism so fast
that<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.619> dropped<00:01:59.219> weight<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.700> not<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that I dropped weight like it's not that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
that I dropped weight like it's not that
I<00:02:00.149> emailed<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.320> freaking<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.860> when<00:02:02.549> we

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
I emailed you freaking out when we

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.310 
I emailed you freaking out when we
started<00:02:02.939> rotating<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.509> fats<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.140> man<00:02:04.290> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
started rotating the fats as like man I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.139 
started rotating the fats as like man I
dropped<00:02:04.619> five<00:02:04.829> pounds<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.520> seven<00:02:05.969> days

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
don't realize you've never really done a

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.740 
don't realize you've never really done a
lot<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.280> national<00:02:48.459> level<00:02:48.910> show<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.570> North

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
lot of national level show so the North

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.170 
lot of national level show so the North
American<00:02:50.170> was<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.380> first<00:02:50.620> view<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.940> is

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
American was the first view this is

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.820 
American was the first view this is
really<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.510> not<00:02:52.630> an<00:02:52.810> uncalled<00:02:53.200> for<00:02:53.260> step<00:02:53.620> it's

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
really is not an uncalled for step it's

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.050 
really is not an uncalled for step it's
actually<00:02:54.160> probably<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.489> good<00:02:54.610> step<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.030> that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
actually probably a good step in that

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.400 
actually probably a good step in that
now<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.360> judges<00:02:55.720> are<00:02:55.780> gonna<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.080> good<00:02:56.290> look

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
now the judges are gonna get a good look

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.229 
now the judges are gonna get a good look
at<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.650> definitely<00:02:57.340> that's<00:02:57.730> what<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.000> wanted

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
at you definitely that's what I wanted

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.270 
at you definitely that's what I wanted
to<00:02:58.330> do<00:02:58.420> last<00:02:59.110> year<00:02:59.290> but<00:02:59.770> when<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.980> Arnold

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
to do last year but when the Arnold

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.220 
to do last year but when the Arnold
amateur<00:03:00.670> came<00:03:00.910> up<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.330> thought<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:02.050> would<00:03:02.200> be

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
amateur came up I thought that would be
