extremely lucky or some of the people
who<00:03:47.230> created<00:03:47.500> Trey<00:03:48.010> art<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.340> obviously<00:03:48.640> okay

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
who created Trey art and obviously okay

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.330 
who created Trey art and obviously okay
but<00:03:49.060> those<00:03:49.660> people<00:03:49.870> are<00:03:50.049> really<00:03:50.290> lucky<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.069> I

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
but those people are really lucky and I

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.420 
but those people are really lucky and I
doubt<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.850> their<00:03:52.030> KD

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
doubt that their KD

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.880 
doubt that their KD
and<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.329> their<00:03:54.569> win-loss<00:03:54.810> shows<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.769> they

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
and or their win-loss shows that they

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.830 
and or their win-loss shows that they
can<00:03:56.069> do<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.430> every<00:03:56.760> single<00:03:56.939> match<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.510> is

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
can do that every single match it is

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.270 
can do that every single match it is
great<00:03:58.079> that<00:03:58.109> they<00:03:58.319> can<00:03:58.469> do<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.829> thing<00:03:59.040> once

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
great that they can do that thing once

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.039 
great that they can do that thing once
in<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.519> while<00:03:59.700> but<00:04:00.329> it's<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:00.599> something<00:04:00.840> that

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
in a while but it's not something that

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.599 
in a while but it's not something that

not the smartest decisions that you can
make<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:07.439> that's<00:04:08.310> pretty<00:04:08.609> much<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:09.209> whole

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
make so that's pretty much the whole
