a little bit you can change the size so
we'll<00:01:10.600> put<00:01:10.870> it<00:01:10.960> back<00:01:11.200> time<00:01:11.440> back<00:01:11.920> down<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.280> 1

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.850 
we'll put it back time back down to 1
times<00:01:12.730> so<00:01:13.660> this<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.020> default<00:01:14.350> size<00:01:14.590> it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
times so this is the default size it's

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
it's not necessarily lazy because not

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's not necessarily lazy because not
all<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.870> time<00:01:44.050> when<00:01:44.230> I'm<00:01:44.320> working<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.920> my

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
computer or doing something on my

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.340 
computer or doing something on my
computer<00:01:46.510> doesn't<00:01:46.990> mean<00:01:47.230> i'm<00:01:47.320> doing

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
computer doesn't mean i'm doing

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.470 
computer doesn't mean i'm doing
something<00:01:47.640> that's<00:01:48.640> really<00:01:48.790> useful<00:01:49.000> but<00:01:49.420> it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
something that's really useful but it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.060 
something that's really useful but it
just<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.810> feel<00:01:49.960> like<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.290> should<00:01:50.860> be<00:01:50.890> doing

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
just I feel like I should be doing

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.380 
just I feel like I should be doing
something<00:01:51.370> while<00:01:51.760> I'm<00:01:51.909> taking<00:01:52.270> in

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
something while I'm taking in

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.899 
something while I'm taking in
information<00:01:52.690> from<00:01:53.470> things<00:01:54.010> like<00:01:54.100> podcasts<00:01:54.430> so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
information from things like podcasts so

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.399 
information from things like podcasts so
this<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.210> another<00:01:55.390> way<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.659> expand<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.380> that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
this is another way to expand on that

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.360 
this is another way to expand on that
with<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.270> get<00:01:58.600> information<00:01:59.370> you

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
with this you can get information you

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.100 
with this you can get information you
know<00:02:00.490> all<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.880> world<00:02:01.180> news<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.780> if<00:02:01.870> there's

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
Jazeera English is pretty good even when

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.830 
Jazeera English is pretty good even when
it's<00:05:18.889> blown<00:05:19.130> up<00:05:19.310> quite<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> bit<00:05:19.760> this<00:05:20.389> channel

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
it's blown up quite a bit this channel

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.629 
it's blown up quite a bit this channel
we're<00:05:21.050> seeing<00:05:21.350> a<00:05:21.410> lot<00:05:21.440> of<00:05:21.590> motion<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.370> stuff

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
we're seeing a lot of motion and stuff

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.430 
we're seeing a lot of motion and stuff
so<00:05:22.790> that's<00:05:22.940> why<00:05:23.090> it's<00:05:23.120> pretty<00:05:23.389> bad<00:05:23.630> but<00:05:23.930> i'll

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
so that's why it's pretty bad but i'll

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.780 
so that's why it's pretty bad but i'll
go<00:05:24.560> ahead<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:24.770> put<00:05:24.979> that<00:05:25.010> back<00:05:25.310> down<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.760> the

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
go ahead and put that back down to the

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.159 
go ahead and put that back down to the
normal<00:05:26.419> size<00:05:28.479> other<00:05:29.479> cool<00:05:29.660> features<00:05:29.690> they

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
normal size other cool features they

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.200 
normal size other cool features they
have<00:05:30.440> this<00:05:30.650> like<00:05:31.010> little<00:05:31.160> round<00:05:31.550> table<00:05:31.970> here

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
have this like little round table here

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.850 
have this like little round table here
so<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.810> can<00:05:32.930> flip<00:05:33.169> through<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.560> different

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
so you can flip through the different

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.219 
so you can flip through the different
channels<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:34.490> if<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.479> find<00:05:35.660> something<00:05:35.960> you

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
will automatically connect to that this

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.700 
will automatically connect to that this

to<00:06:08.539> take<00:06:08.870> in<00:06:09.080> media<00:06:09.440> i<00:06:09.500> think<00:06:09.860> i<00:06:09.979> made<00:06:10.820> a

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
to take in media i think i made a

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.640 
to take in media i think i made a
twitter<00:06:11.060> post<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:11.660> said<00:06:11.870> that<00:06:12.500> this

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
twitter post and said that this

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.379 
twitter post and said that this
application<00:06:13.400> has<00:06:13.430> made<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:14.060> so<00:06:14.180> that<00:06:14.210> i<00:06:14.360> don't

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
application has made it so that i don't

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.029 
application has made it so that i don't
really<00:06:14.750> even<00:06:14.900> have<00:06:15.169> to<00:06:15.289> watch<00:06:15.470> TV<00:06:15.740> anymore

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
really even have to watch TV anymore

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.520 
really even have to watch TV anymore
it's<00:06:16.430> another<00:06:16.610> step<00:06:17.419> away<00:06:17.570> from<00:06:17.720> TV<00:06:18.260> because

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
it's another step away from TV because

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.560 
it's another step away from TV because
it<00:06:19.280> seems<00:06:19.490> like<00:06:19.550> every<00:06:19.850> day<00:06:20.000> we<00:06:20.180> get<00:06:20.300> another

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
it seems like every day we get another

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.440 
it seems like every day we get another
form<00:06:21.350> of<00:06:21.470> media<00:06:21.710> through<00:06:22.150> internet<00:06:23.150> streaming

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
form of media through internet streaming

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.390 
form of media through internet streaming
so<00:06:23.720> this<00:06:23.870> is<00:06:23.960> just<00:06:24.080> another<00:06:24.320> way<00:06:24.530> to<00:06:24.560> get<00:06:25.250> your

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
so this is just another way to get your

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.860 
so this is just another way to get your
information<00:06:25.639> while<00:06:26.030> you're<00:06:26.150> doing<00:06:26.270> work<00:06:26.570> or

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
information while you're doing work or

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.659 
information while you're doing work or
whatever<00:06:27.440> you're<00:06:27.800> doing<00:06:28.070> on<00:06:28.160> your<00:06:28.280> computer

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
whatever you're doing on your computer

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.460 
whatever you're doing on your computer
so<00:06:28.850> it's<00:06:29.030> a<00:06:29.090> pretty<00:06:29.389> nice<00:06:29.660> application<00:06:30.229> like<00:06:30.380> I

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
so it's a pretty nice application like I

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.210 
so it's a pretty nice application like I
said<00:06:30.740> multi-platform<00:06:31.729> they<00:06:32.180> have<00:06:32.300> an<00:06:32.450> app<00:06:32.599> for
