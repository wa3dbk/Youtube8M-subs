00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
to turn over and it was a little

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
and when brandon morris comes back and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.640 
and when brandon morris comes back and
think<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.710> adds<00:01:56.920> another<00:01:57.130> dimension<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.820> it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650
