00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.730
 let's start with the lic 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.939
 from here 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.870
 let's start by grabbing here 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.810
 two laps 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.800

 two laps 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.680

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.229
 the mooring 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.229
 to put the knife 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.780
 the knife 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.780
 it has to be 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.960
 tip 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.960
 spur rise 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.530
 and so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530
 and we started 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.810
 to kill her 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.010
 he took off 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.290
 next to each other 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.400
 for this stage 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.400
 the spur 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.110
 [Music] 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.700
 and here we can the spur 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.090
 that taught 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.090
 with more 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 leg of the rooster the cane 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.610
 tying 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.349
 we are going to come back 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.660
 long steps 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 and here we are going to 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.280
 be a cross below the legs of 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.280
 the knife 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.780
 down 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.230
 under 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.700
 in the knife 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.700
 of the legs of a low 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.120
 we cover that crossing 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.730
 side by side 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.360
 to achieve 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.360
 layers 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.280
 Crusaders 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.620
 what 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:36.540
 and long steps 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.540
 until you get to the legs again 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.800
 below 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.880
 here 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.510
 here for camos 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.549
 we go back to look 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.820
 we leave this knot 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.490
 and to be able to grab it 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.490
 finish 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.530
 cut us 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.120
 and here we paste 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.470
 we cut here with scissors 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.240
 the surplus between the excess thread 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.800
 and we wait 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.380
 we have our razor network 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.600
 always moves 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.600
 and if the knife would remain 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.810
 with cutting her 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.810
 no no no
