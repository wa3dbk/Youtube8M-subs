C card
you<00:01:55.840> know<00:01:55.930> fluorocarbon<00:01:56.610> definitely

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
you know fluorocarbon definitely

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.850 
you know fluorocarbon definitely
recommend<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.090> for<00:01:58.120> crankbaits<00:01:58.690> it's<00:01:59.620> got

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
recommend it for crankbaits it's got

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.969 
recommend it for crankbaits it's got
less<00:02:00.310> stretched<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.820> mono<00:02:01.320> its<00:02:02.320> abrasion

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
less stretched in mono its abrasion

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.830 
less stretched in mono its abrasion
resistant<00:02:03.520> more<00:02:04.000> abrasion<00:02:04.390> resistant

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
resistant more abrasion resistant

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.870 
resistant more abrasion resistant
resistant<00:02:05.440> than<00:02:05.530> breed<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.580> gives<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.850> a

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
resistant than breed and it gives you a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.749 
resistant than breed and it gives you a
just<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.420> little<00:02:07.450> bit<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.900> give<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:09.369> sinks

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
just a little bit of give and it sinks

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.820 
just a little bit of give and it sinks

for crank position for crank leads I use

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:31.260 
for crank position for crank leads I use
a<00:02:22.090> slower<00:02:23.050> reel<00:02:23.550> I'll<00:02:24.550> use<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> 5<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.390> 1<00:02:28.800> 5<00:02:30.270> that's

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
a slower reel I'll use a 5 to 1 5 that's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:44.030 
a slower reel I'll use a 5 to 1 5 that's
my<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:31.959> my<00:02:32.110> crank<00:02:33.390> some<00:02:34.390> guys<00:02:34.630> go<00:02:34.810> faster<00:02:34.870> I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.680 

stick<00:02:45.040> with<00:02:45.070> 5<00:02:45.400> 1<00:02:47.400> gives<00:02:48.400> me<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> nice<00:02:48.790> slow

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
stick with 5 1 gives me a nice slow

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.380 
stick with 5 1 gives me a nice slow
retrieve<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.989> runs<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.380> crank<00:02:53.620> bait<00:02:54.269> right<00:02:55.269> at

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
retrieve it runs the crank bait right at

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.630 
retrieve it runs the crank bait right at
the<00:02:55.480> perfect<00:02:55.840> speed<00:03:00.660> myself<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.310> know<00:03:03.400> that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
the perfect speed myself and I know that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.110 
the perfect speed myself and I know that
I<00:03:03.670> tend<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.060> reel<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.140> too<00:03:05.530> fast

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.880 

so<00:03:10.120> for<00:03:10.630> crank<00:03:10.840> baits<00:03:11.049> I'll<00:03:11.200> go<00:03:11.350> 5<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.739> 1

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
so for crank baits I'll go 5 to 1

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.440 
so for crank baits I'll go 5 to 1
because<00:03:12.070> I'm<00:03:12.280> always<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.700> superfast

natural pattern this year this is a

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.969 
natural pattern this year this is a
perch<00:05:00.330> pattern<00:05:00.750> for<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.050> pin<00:05:01.229> Jack<00:05:01.410> 200<00:05:01.889> and

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
perch pattern for the pin Jack 200 and

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.540 
perch pattern for the pin Jack 200 and
that's<00:05:02.099> what<00:05:02.280> we<00:05:02.370> used<00:05:02.639> for<00:05:02.760> our<00:05:02.970> review<00:05:04.550> it's

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
that's what we used for our review it's

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.430 
that's what we used for our review it's
a<00:05:05.669> it's<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:06.030> perfect<00:05:06.539> bait<00:05:06.720> for<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:07.050> lake<00:05:07.229> that

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
a it's a perfect bait for the lake that

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.560 
a it's a perfect bait for the lake that
we're<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:07.710> right<00:05:07.740> now<00:05:08.210> because<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.389> red

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
we're in right now because of the red

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.810 
we're in right now because of the red
eye<00:05:09.599> there's<00:05:10.199> a<00:05:10.260> lot<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.590> there's<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.580> lot<00:05:11.639> of

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
eye there's a lot of there's a lot of

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.550 
eye there's a lot of there's a lot of
rock<00:05:12.060> bats<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.570> this<00:05:12.660> lake<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.349> red<00:05:13.530> eye

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
rock bats in this lake so the red eye

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.219 
rock bats in this lake so the red eye
will<00:05:13.889> mimic<00:05:14.240> one<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.419> forages<00:05:15.930> for<00:05:15.960> the

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
will mimic one of the forages for the

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.550 
will mimic one of the forages for the
bass<00:05:16.729> also<00:05:17.729> it's<00:05:17.910> got<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.120> perch<00:05:18.630> pattern<00:05:19.020> so

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
bass also it's got a perch pattern so

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.070 
bass also it's got a perch pattern so
that's<00:05:20.099> another<00:05:20.340> that's<00:05:20.910> another<00:05:21.510> bait<00:05:21.840> fish

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
that's another that's another bait fish

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.589 
that's another that's another bait fish
in<00:05:22.919> this<00:05:23.099> lake<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:23.789> this<00:05:24.000> is<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> great<00:05:24.930> color

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
in this lake so this is a great color

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.689 
in this lake so this is a great color
this<00:05:27.599> lake<00:05:27.810> has<00:05:28.020> clear<00:05:28.440> water<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.979> visibility
