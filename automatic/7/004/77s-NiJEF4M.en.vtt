you

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.140 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.420 

okay<00:00:15.140> so<00:00:15.200> let<00:00:15.440> me<00:00:15.530> see<00:00:15.680> if<00:00:15.770> I<00:00:15.830> can<00:00:15.980> explain<00:00:16.219> this

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
okay so let me see if I can explain this

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.310 
okay so let me see if I can explain this
a<00:00:16.490> little<00:00:16.760> bit<00:00:16.970> what<00:00:17.240> my<00:00:17.390> idea<00:00:17.720> is<00:00:17.869> here<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:18.260> I

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
a little bit what my idea is here and I

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.339 
a little bit what my idea is here and I
think<00:00:18.380> it's<00:00:18.710> going<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:19.040> work<00:00:19.840> I'm<00:00:20.840> thinking

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
think it's going to work I'm thinking

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.500 
think it's going to work I'm thinking
I'm<00:00:21.500> going<00:00:21.680> to<00:00:21.830> hollow<00:00:22.099> out<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.760> seats<00:00:23.090> here

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
I'm going to hollow out the seats here

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.820 
I'm going to hollow out the seats here
and<00:00:24.070> use<00:00:25.070> those<00:00:25.340> for<00:00:25.700> my<00:00:26.000> processor<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.680> my

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
and use those for my processor and my

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.029 
and use those for my processor and my
electrical<00:00:28.369> stuff<00:00:28.759> relays<00:00:29.740> barrier<00:00:30.740> strips

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
electrical stuff relays barrier strips

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.080 
electrical stuff relays barrier strips
things<00:00:32.029> like<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:34.370> wanted<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.820> be<00:00:34.970> able

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
things like that and I wanted to be able

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.140 
things like that and I wanted to be able
to<00:00:35.239> put<00:00:35.449> this<00:00:35.809> amp<00:00:36.170> on<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.530> back<00:00:36.710> seat<00:00:37.010> but<00:00:37.850> I'm

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
to put this amp on the back seat but I'm

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.970 
to put this amp on the back seat but I'm
struggling<00:00:38.660> with<00:00:38.840> space<00:00:39.350> as<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:39.739> can<00:00:39.769> imagine

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
struggling with space as you can imagine

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.090 
struggling with space as you can imagine
in<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.790> car<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.290> isn't<00:00:42.290> really<00:00:42.590> built<00:00:42.830> for

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
in a car that isn't really built for

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.060 
in a car that isn't really built for
this<00:00:43.330> so<00:00:45.790> my<00:00:46.790> thought<00:00:47.120> was<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.720> hinge<00:00:48.589> a<00:00:48.800> board

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
this so my thought was to hinge a board

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.820 
this so my thought was to hinge a board
or<00:00:49.430> something<00:00:50.180> as<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.170> can<00:00:51.320> see<00:00:51.500> I've<00:00:51.620> done

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
or something as you can see I've done

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.490 
or something as you can see I've done
that<00:00:51.979> here<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:53.860> allow<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:54.920> amp<00:00:55.640> rack<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.690> move

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
that here and allow the amp rack to move

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.829 
that here and allow the amp rack to move
up<00:00:58.600> with<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.140> seat<00:01:01.089> I'm<00:01:02.089> going<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.540> have<00:01:02.690> to

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
up with the seat I'm going to have to

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.160 
up with the seat I'm going to have to
build<00:01:03.019> some<00:01:03.350> kind<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.799> rail<00:01:04.040> system<00:01:04.930> here<00:01:05.930> or

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
build some kind of a rail system here or

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.910 
build some kind of a rail system here or
just<00:01:07.130> make<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.520> wider<00:01:07.850> or<00:01:08.320> I'm<00:01:09.320> not<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.560> hundred

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
just make it wider or I'm not a hundred

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.560 
just make it wider or I'm not a hundred
percent<00:01:10.070> sure<00:01:10.520> how<00:01:10.729> I'm<00:01:10.850> going<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.180> do<00:01:11.360> that

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
percent sure how I'm going to do that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.149 
percent sure how I'm going to do that
yet

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
yet

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.609 
yet
but<00:01:13.729> this<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.240> kind<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.900> premise<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.500> it's

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
but this is kind of the premise and it's

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.130 
but this is kind of the premise and it's
kind<00:01:15.799> of<00:01:15.830> hard<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.130> do<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.400> with<00:01:16.580> one<00:01:16.760> hand

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
kind of hard to do this with one hand

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.760 
kind of hard to do this with one hand
but<00:01:18.520> as<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.880> seat<00:01:20.119> goes<00:01:20.359> up<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:21.200> can<00:01:21.409> see<00:01:21.619> this

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
but as the seat goes up you can see this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.590 
but as the seat goes up you can see this
here<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.969> seat<00:01:23.180> goes<00:01:23.420> up<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:25.100> does<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.600> rack

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
here the seat goes up so does the rack

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.399 
here the seat goes up so does the rack
slide<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:28.390> then<00:01:29.390> as<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.750> seat<00:01:29.990> goes<00:01:30.020> back

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
slide and then as the seat goes back

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.569 
slide and then as the seat goes back
down<00:01:30.939> it<00:01:31.939> would<00:01:32.270> then<00:01:32.509> slide<00:01:33.259> back<00:01:33.649> down<00:01:34.070> as

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
down it would then slide back down as

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.800 
down it would then slide back down as
well<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.960> problem<00:01:36.560> with<00:01:37.310> just<00:01:38.270> doing<00:01:38.539> it<00:01:38.689> this

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
well the problem with just doing it this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.090 
well the problem with just doing it this
way<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:39.049> because<00:01:39.799> of<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.969> angle<00:01:41.509> as<00:01:41.719> you<00:01:42.710> can

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
way is because of the angle as you can

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.039 
way is because of the angle as you can
see<00:01:43.340> where<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.670> seat<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.090> there<00:01:44.539> that's

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
see where the seat is that there that's

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.219 
see where the seat is that there that's
the<00:01:45.259> angle<00:01:45.649> which<00:01:46.249> takes<00:01:46.579> it<00:01:46.729> past<00:01:46.969> 90<00:01:47.899> degrees

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
the angle which takes it past 90 degrees

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.200 
the angle which takes it past 90 degrees
and<00:01:48.789> then<00:01:50.439> so<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.710> amp<00:01:51.979> rack<00:01:52.249> has<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.759> shift

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
and then so the amp rack has to shift

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.230 
and then so the amp rack has to shift
forward<00:01:53.899> like<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.729> there's<00:01:55.729> nothing<00:01:56.090> really

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
forward like this there's nothing really

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.749 
forward like this there's nothing really
to<00:01:56.450> stop<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:56.810> from<00:01:56.990> from<00:01:57.530> hitting<00:01:58.130> up<00:01:58.369> against

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
to stop it from from hitting up against

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.789 
to stop it from from hitting up against
the<00:02:00.280> sub<00:02:01.280> enclosure<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.840> that's<00:02:03.319> why<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.560> have

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
the sub enclosure so that's why I have

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.740 
the sub enclosure so that's why I have
to<00:02:03.920> figure<00:02:04.219> out<00:02:04.369> some<00:02:04.640> way<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:06.460> put<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.609> on<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
to figure out some way to put it on the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.740 
to figure out some way to put it on the
seat<00:02:09.020> here<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:10.880> has<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.180> go<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.480> far

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
seat here and it just has to go this far

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.020 
seat here and it just has to go this far
so<00:02:12.170> it's<00:02:12.590> not<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.040> big<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.580> deal<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.819> don't

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
so it's not that big of a deal I don't

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.290 
so it's not that big of a deal I don't
believe<00:02:15.880> let's<00:02:16.960> fold<00:02:17.960> this<00:02:18.170> forward

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
believe let's fold this forward

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.850 
believe let's fold this forward
and<00:02:21.880> move<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.910> seed<00:02:23.330> up<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:24.530> kind<00:02:24.770> of

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
and move the seed up and you can kind of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.630 
and move the seed up and you can kind of
get<00:02:25.010> an<00:02:25.130> idea<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:27.560> actually<00:02:27.980> does<00:02:28.160> go<00:02:28.340> all<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
get an idea it actually does go all the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.270 
get an idea it actually does go all the
way<00:02:28.670> up<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.380> would<00:02:30.530> have<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.680> be<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> full

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
way up so it would have to be a full

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.670 
way up so it would have to be a full
rail<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:32.150> that's<00:02:32.810> kind<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.170> where<00:02:33.320> it'll<00:02:33.500> be

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
rail but that's kind of where it'll be

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.880 
rail but that's kind of where it'll be
in<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.460> back<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.320> kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.590> see<00:02:36.740> this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
in the back you can kind of see this

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.720 
in the back you can kind of see this
distance<00:02:37.160> here<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.790> then<00:02:38.660> would<00:02:39.730> ultimately

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
distance here and then would ultimately

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.680 
distance here and then would ultimately
slide<00:02:41.630> up<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.920> seat<00:02:43.130> does<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:44.480> seeds

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
slide up as the seat does the seeds

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.370 
slide up as the seat does the seeds
going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.050> be<00:02:45.140> actuated<00:02:45.710> so<00:02:46.100> it'll<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.490> at<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
going to be actuated so it'll go at a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.130 
going to be actuated so it'll go at a
reasonable<00:02:48.380> pace<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.880> then<00:02:50.180> these<00:02:50.540> two<00:02:50.840> seeds

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
reasonable pace and then these two seeds

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.810 
reasonable pace and then these two seeds
will<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:52.300> connected<00:02:54.640> somehow

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
will be connected somehow

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.060 
will be connected somehow
and<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.630> they'll<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:57.080> slide<00:02:57.410> up<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.740> down<00:02:57.800> as

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
and so they'll all slide up and down as

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.180 
and so they'll all slide up and down as
one<00:02:58.250> seat<00:02:58.490> so<00:02:59.390> that's<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.260> idea<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.100> to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
one seat so that's the idea it's have to

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.340 
one seat so that's the idea it's have to
figure<00:03:01.400> out<00:03:01.460> how<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.610> make<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.940> work

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
figure out how to make it work

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.290 
figure out how to make it work
but<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.040> think<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:04.610> what<00:03:04.850> I'm<00:03:04.940> going<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.120> go

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
but I think that's what I'm going to go

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.170 
but I think that's what I'm going to go
with<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.750> could<00:03:06.380> also<00:03:06.710> somehow<00:03:07.190> again<00:03:07.880> if<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.120> can

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
with I could also somehow again if I can

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.990 
with I could also somehow again if I can
figure<00:03:08.450> out<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.690> way<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.370> keep<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.490> on<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.730> seat

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
figure out a way to keep it on the seat

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.710 
figure out a way to keep it on the seat
and<00:03:11.560> slide<00:03:12.560> up<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:12.890> down<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.520> was<00:03:14.450> also

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
and slide up and down I was also

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.810 
and slide up and down I was also
thinking<00:03:14.750> maybe<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.740> just<00:03:15.950> did<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.960> Plexiglas

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
thinking maybe if I just did a Plexiglas

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.570 
thinking maybe if I just did a Plexiglas
boat<00:03:19.820> instead<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.720> board<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.620> could<00:03:22.310> do<00:03:22.400> that

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
boat instead of a board I could do that

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.970 
boat instead of a board I could do that
and<00:03:22.820> mount<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.210> amp<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:24.530> would<00:03:24.650> just<00:03:24.830> be<00:03:24.950> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and mount the amp it would just be a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.390 
and mount the amp it would just be a
matter<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.310> how<00:03:25.490> to<00:03:25.550> hide<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.910> wires<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:27.400> big

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
matter of how to hide the wires so big

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.120 
matter of how to hide the wires so big
things<00:03:28.610> coming<00:03:30.010> they'll<00:03:31.010> be<00:03:31.190> more<00:03:31.790> soon<00:03:33.130> but

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
things coming they'll be more soon but

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.240 
things coming they'll be more soon but
until<00:03:34.160> then<00:03:35.350> think<00:03:36.350> about<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.010> I'm<00:03:37.070> also

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
until then think about that and I'm also

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.940 
until then think about that and I'm also
open<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.790> suggestions<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.540> we'll<00:03:39.500> see<00:03:39.709> what

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
open to suggestions and we'll see what

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.700 
open to suggestions and we'll see what
we<00:03:40.070> can<00:03:40.250> make<00:03:40.459> work
