one of the coolest fighting games out
there<00:00:33.079> it's<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.260> old-school<00:00:34.559> 2d<00:00:35.040> fighting

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

pretty<00:00:40.110> much<00:00:40.200> these<00:00:40.379> churches<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.860> based<00:00:41.010> off

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
pretty much these churches are based off

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.819 
pretty much these churches are based off
to<00:00:41.370> look<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> video<00:00:41.969> game<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.559> pretty

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
to look up the video game this is pretty

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.139 
to look up the video game this is pretty
much<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.250> come<00:00:44.430> packaged<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> these

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
much how they come packaged and these

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.420 
much how they come packaged and these
little<00:00:45.420> clear<00:00:45.890> containers<00:00:46.890> which<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
little clear containers which is the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.029 
little clear containers which is the
figure<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:48.960> story<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> picture<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
figure and a little story and picture on

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.200 
figure and a little story and picture on
the<00:00:50.100> back<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.820> kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> boring

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the back I think it's kind of boring

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.840 
the back I think it's kind of boring
just<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.350> front<00:00:52.680> boring<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> figures

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
just this front boring like the figures

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
just this front boring like the figures
in<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.120> takes<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> space<00:00:54.989> sig

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
in there takes up a lot of space sig

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.420 
in there takes up a lot of space sig
alert<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:55.590> artwork<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.070> something<00:00:56.340> on

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
alert is more artwork or something on

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
alert is more artwork or something on
this<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.510> even<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> big<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
this so I'm not even a big kind of the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.950 
this so I'm not even a big kind of the
case<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.500> either<00:00:58.760> um<00:00:59.760> my<00:01:00.270> biggest<00:01:00.629> gripe<00:01:00.840> with

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
case in either um my biggest gripe with

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.319 
case in either um my biggest gripe with
these<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.910> any<00:01:03.090> peg

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
these is that they don't have any peg

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.670 
these is that they don't have any peg
holes<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> bottom<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
holes on the bottom so if you have a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.679 
holes on the bottom so if you have a
fast<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.790> can't<00:01:06.030> use<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
fast and you can't use it you have the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.050 
fast and you can't use it you have the
really<00:01:07.080> position<00:01:07.500> these<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.460> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
really position these in the good way so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.340 
really position these in the good way so
that<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.240> don't<00:01:09.330> fall<00:01:09.570> down<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:10.020> isn't

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that they don't fall down which isn't

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
that they don't fall down which isn't
easy<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.240> spread<00:01:12.240> his

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
easy because you have to like spread his

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420 
easy because you have to like spread his
arms<00:01:12.540> wide<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.049> far<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.290> legs<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.740> what's<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
arms wide as far as legs and what's the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370 
arms wide as far as legs and what's the
point<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> being<00:01:14.790> nice<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> articulate<00:01:16.229> if

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
point of being nice to articulate if

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.630 
point of being nice to articulate if
that's<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> best<00:01:16.830> pose<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that's the best pose you can get you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.969 
that's the best pose you can get you
know<00:01:17.670> she<00:01:17.790> doesn't<00:01:18.030> fall<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:18.590> with<00:01:19.590> his<00:01:19.710> arms

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
know she doesn't fall down with his arms

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.399 
know she doesn't fall down with his arms
spread<00:01:20.100> open<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.600> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.869> defeats<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
spread open so that kind of defeats the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
spread open so that kind of defeats the
purpose<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.950> having<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.400> articulation<00:01:23.640> it's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
purpose of having good articulation it's

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
purpose of having good articulation it's
the<00:01:24.270> only<00:01:24.450> pose<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the only pose you can have is that to
