00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.260
 hello good comes if you use a new 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.420
 word teacher video the page 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.919
 today we have thousands of exercises for 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.019
 try and get very good grades in 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.929
 math physics chemistry for let's 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.280
 do this exercise exercise 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.170
 complicated complicadillo but they are 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.210
 those that I like me 6 if you do others 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.710
 but they are what I like because 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.869
 are problems that we are going to 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.400
 work with letters we have to go 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.769
 getting used to it if you are not 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.269
 accustomed to working little by little with 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.099
 letters at the beginning may seem like a lot 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.230
 harder but then once they 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.370
 we take the quiet that costs to catch 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.440
 the tranquillo for once we put 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.570
 the tranquillo like it more because 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.090
 we make mistakes calculated for it 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.680
 for example this exercise man does not 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.020
 I do without calculator but practically 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.329
 I do not have to use it the only day 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.399
 brown for calculators and how good is 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.899
 something that takes away from me, then we have 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.460
 to go little by little 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.519
 removing fear come all of us go to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 they say the mass of the moons 0 0 12 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.230
 times the mass of the earth the radius 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.629
 moles 0.27 the radius of the earth the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 average distance between 660 centers 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.790
 battles radios 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.799
 section to calculate the large sidewalk sector 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.860
 lunar officer is to say the seriousness of the 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.270
 moon and sec sees at what point 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.460
 intermediate between the earth and the moon it 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.440
 balance the forces that both exert 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.509
 on a body of dough in cadiz the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.340
 scheme is one that good then like 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.710
 the first long exercise to do the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.170
 paragraph a and then in the next video 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.270
 I'm going to do paragraph b remember that 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.860
 always there you have the link of the blog 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.720
 where we have developed 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.180
 we have announced all of these 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.229
 exercises of all subjects is worth what 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.789
 you can follow the list of 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.250
 reproduction and give the little button of me 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.980
 like that he had told us in this 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.350
 video how rare is this greater life 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.450
 then let's go then we give ourselves 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.760
 they say the mass of the moon 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.570
 ml more to the moon say it's 0.0 12 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.659
 times the mass of the earth s 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.300
 then the ray of the moon on the moon is 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.290
 0 27 times the radius of the earth is worth and 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.840
 Then they also tell you that the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.660
 Earth distance the moon equals 63 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.430
 with times the radius of the earth good 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.290
 that what the statement of the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.750
 problem already tells us calculate the severity 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.019
 from the surface one the tier of the moon 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.660
 well now the moon will be equal to ag 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.700
 mass of the moon split as it says 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.190
 Surface the radius of the moon to 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.040
 square well up there, right is true 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.330
 ie is equal to g if the mass 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.099
 moon but the program tells us that the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.250
 mass the moon is 00 12 00 12 times the 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.650
 mass of the earth split the radius of the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.140
 square moon meaning 0.27 13 097 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.900
 for the earth 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.180
 let's see below up we're not going to 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.940
 attack from below as we have a product 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.670
 squared we square 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.650
 all the products would be 0.27 at 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.530
 square by rt 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.540
 well then let's continue now what are we going to 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.820
 do I'm going to get this out of here I'm going to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.730
 mark in green for ahead 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.380
 this here and here we're going to 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.980
 pull forward to see if you see 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:21.480
 something that is to say would be 0 012 match 0.27 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.780
 squared x 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.940
 by the mass of the earth split the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.849
 radius of the earth squared and that we 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.010
 we realize account knowing that this 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.440
 of here that is is the seriousness of the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.319
 true earth and how much will it degrade to 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.870
 earth 98 then the solution that is 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.810
 this from here by the tier the earth 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.200
 say this from here by 9.8 and so on 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.819
 nice and fun we have been this 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.910
 problem 0.27 squared by 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:57.180
 9.8 we take the calculator from my medium 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.590
 1.61 in meters second match to 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.150
 square because we are calculating a 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.799
 Gravity measured in meters accuracy 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.829
 in agreement you have seen how we have 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.319
 worked we have developed with lyrics 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.510
 until the end meet with the stands 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.609
 the earth this is a classic to do this 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.709
 until you get to like the land worth 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.850
 then all over the world your notes 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.639
 that puts classic 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.440
 and in the next good exercise it 's more 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.260
 difficult to be then let's do 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.199
 a special video just for the bm I put 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.490
 good and it does not honor me anymore and we're going to 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.729
 for the next at the beginning come 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.729
 we see
