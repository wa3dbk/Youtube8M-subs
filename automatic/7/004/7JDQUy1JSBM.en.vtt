how<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:19.400> works<00:00:19.580> this<00:00:20.269> part<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:20.750> drill<00:00:20.929> is

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
how it works this part of the drill is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.410 
how it works this part of the drill is
called<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.439> Chuck<00:00:21.830> these<00:00:22.250> jaws<00:00:22.670> inside<00:00:23.240> the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
called the Chuck these jaws inside the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.660 
called the Chuck these jaws inside the
tip<00:00:23.660> hold<00:00:23.929> the<00:00:24.080> bit<00:00:24.289> in<00:00:24.500> place<00:00:24.830> as<00:00:25.099> you<00:00:25.160> loosen

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
tip hold the bit in place as you loosen

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.640 
tip hold the bit in place as you loosen
or<00:00:26.119> tighten<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.630> Chuck<00:00:26.840> a<00:00:27.080> drill<00:00:27.470> with<00:00:27.589> a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
or tighten the Chuck a drill with a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.890 
or tighten the Chuck a drill with a
keyless<00:00:28.130> chuck<00:00:28.160> tightens<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.119> loosens<00:00:29.179> by

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
keyless chuck tightens and loosens by

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.720 
keyless chuck tightens and loosens by
twisting<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.529> collar<00:00:30.769> with<00:00:31.070> your<00:00:31.220> hand

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
twisting the collar with your hand

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.580 
twisting the collar with your hand
it<00:00:31.820> makes<00:00:32.119> changing<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.750> bits<00:00:32.960> quick<00:00:33.380> and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
it makes changing the bits quick and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.310 
it makes changing the bits quick and
easy<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.370> keyed<00:00:34.820> Chuck<00:00:35.120> requires<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.690> key<00:00:36.080> to

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
easy a keyed Chuck requires a key to

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.600 
easy a keyed Chuck requires a key to
tighten<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:36.800> bit<00:00:37.010> in<00:00:37.220> place

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
tighten the bit in place

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.580 
tighten the bit in place
it<00:00:38.030> holds<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:38.480> bit<00:00:38.690> in<00:00:38.780> place<00:00:38.930> with<00:00:39.320> more

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
it holds the bit in place with more

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.070 
it holds the bit in place with more
force<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.160> this<00:00:40.670> type<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.120> drill<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.570> usually

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
force so this type of drill is usually

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.890 
force so this type of drill is usually
used<00:00:42.290> on<00:00:42.470> heavier<00:00:42.950> duty<00:00:43.340> jobs<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:44.330> change<00:00:44.660> the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
used on heavier duty jobs to change the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
bit twist the collar to open the jaws

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.180 
bit twist the collar to open the jaws
wide<00:00:47.120> enough<00:00:47.450> to<00:00:47.810> slide<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.350> bit<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:48.800> then

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
wide enough to slide the bit in then

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.010 
wide enough to slide the bit in then
twist<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.850> opposite<00:00:50.270> direction<00:00:50.420> to
