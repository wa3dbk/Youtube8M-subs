00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
on Google and I searched frozen and I

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.090 
on Google and I searched frozen and I
put<00:00:39.700> images<00:00:39.850> then<00:00:40.390> I<00:00:40.660> just<00:00:40.930> chose<00:00:41.230> these<00:00:41.620> here

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
put images then I just chose these here

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.710 
put images then I just chose these here
you<00:00:42.280> can<00:00:42.430> choose<00:00:42.640> whichever<00:00:43.030> ones<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:43.420> like

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
you can choose whichever ones you like

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.080 
you can choose whichever ones you like
and<00:00:43.960> then<00:00:44.560> I<00:00:44.829> transferred<00:00:45.100> them<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.670> an

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
and then I transferred them to an

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.139 
and then I transferred them to an
editing<00:00:46.510> program<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.820> helped<00:00:48.820> me<00:00:48.910> size

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
editing program that helped me size

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.479 
editing program that helped me size
these<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:50.290> roughly<00:00:50.710> around<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:51.130> two<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.460> a

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
these to roughly around to two and a

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.700 
these to roughly around to two and a
half<00:00:51.640> inches<00:00:52.120> because<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:53.020> cookie<00:00:53.290> cutter<00:00:53.500> is

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
half inches because the cookie cutter is

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.280 
half inches because the cookie cutter is
three<00:00:54.100> inches<00:00:54.520> so<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.540> image<00:00:55.809> has<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.170> be

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
three inches so the image has to be

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.770 
three inches so the image has to be
smaller<00:00:56.770> because<00:00:57.130> also<00:00:57.700> remember<00:00:58.329> we<00:00:58.450> have<00:00:58.600> to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
smaller because also remember we have to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.020 
smaller because also remember we have to
put<00:00:58.930> our<00:00:59.020> border<00:00:59.469> around<00:00:59.649> it<00:01:00.070> so<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.640> have<00:01:01.000> to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
put our border around it so you have to

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.610 
put our border around it so you have to
have<00:01:01.270> enough<00:01:01.570> room<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.960> can't<00:01:02.350> make<00:01:02.530> your

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
have enough room you can't make your

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.100 
have enough room you can't make your
picture<00:01:02.980> too<00:01:03.219> big<00:01:03.520> or<00:01:03.969> else<00:01:04.210> um<00:01:04.449> it'll<00:01:04.750> take<00:01:04.930> up

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
picture too big or else um it'll take up

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.469 
picture too big or else um it'll take up
the<00:01:05.290> entire<00:01:05.590> cookie<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.159> then<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.459> won't<00:01:06.670> be

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
the entire cookie and then you won't be

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.139 
the entire cookie and then you won't be
able<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.959> put<00:01:08.439> your<00:01:08.619> border<00:01:09.459> and<00:01:09.670> if<00:01:09.789> you<00:01:09.939> do

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
able to put your border and if you do

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.389 
able to put your border and if you do
put<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.869> border<00:01:11.289> you're<00:01:11.560> going<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.039> go<00:01:12.189> over

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
put the border you're going to go over

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.730 
put the border you're going to go over
your<00:01:12.759> picture<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.630> that's<00:01:14.109> why<00:01:14.319> I<00:01:14.350> want<00:01:14.619> to

and<00:02:15.610> how<00:02:15.850> far<00:02:16.210> out<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.570> go<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.740> I'm<00:02:18.010> gonna<00:02:18.220> make

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
and how far out to go so I'm gonna make

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.840 
and how far out to go so I'm gonna make
a<00:02:18.460> dot<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:20.200> my<00:02:20.320> edible<00:02:20.590> marker<00:02:21.160> at<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.610> end

a dot with my edible marker at the end

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.010 
a dot with my edible marker at the end
of<00:02:22.480> each<00:02:23.250> corner<00:02:24.250> there<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.630> will<00:02:25.840> give

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
of each corner there so this will give

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.430 
of each corner there so this will give
me<00:02:26.260> sort<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.160> guideline<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.940> how<00:02:28.870> far<00:02:29.200> out<00:02:29.410> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
me sort of a guideline to how far out to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.130 
me sort of a guideline to how far out to
go<00:02:29.800> with<00:02:29.950> my<00:02:30.100> icing<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.150> when<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.450> peel<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.960> off

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
so what I'm going to do is just type the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.310 
so what I'm going to do is just type the
border<00:04:03.640> here<00:04:03.910> I'm<00:04:04.269> probably<00:04:04.570> gonna<00:04:04.840> be<00:04:05.049> in<00:04:05.200> the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
border here I'm probably gonna be in the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.910 
border here I'm probably gonna be in the
way<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.120> squeeze<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.500> pull<00:04:08.739> down

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
way so I just squeeze and pull down

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.699 
way so I just squeeze and pull down
squeeze<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.150> pull<00:04:10.360> down<00:04:10.540> squeeze<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.560> pull

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
squeeze and pull down squeeze and pull

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.819 
squeeze and pull down squeeze and pull
down<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.739> pretty<00:04:14.739> big<00:04:15.070> consistency

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
down this is a pretty big consistency

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.580 
down this is a pretty big consistency
probably<00:04:17.829> thicker<00:04:18.130> than<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.549> one<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:18.760> used<00:04:19.590> at

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
probably thicker than the one I used at

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.879 
probably thicker than the one I used at
the

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
the

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.080 
the
I'm<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.280> white<00:04:21.519> one<00:04:22.860> because<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.280> want<00:04:24.699> to
