00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.190 
dribble El Shaarawy will be the better
the<00:01:29.880> better<00:01:30.060> option<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the better option but if you like the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.550 
the better option but if you like the
skill<00:01:31.500> lamella<00:01:32.159> definitely<00:01:32.960> he<00:01:33.960> has<00:01:34.170> really

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
skill lamella definitely he has really

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
skill lamella definitely he has really
good<00:01:34.680> shot<00:01:34.920> power<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.430> long<00:01:35.729> shots<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
good shot power and long shots this is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
good shot power and long shots this is
fake<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.200> his<00:01:37.350> in-game<00:01:37.650> stats<00:01:37.920> his

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
fake when in his in-game stats his

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
fake when in his in-game stats his
shooting<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> powered

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
shooting is really on the powered

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
shooting is really on the powered
because<00:01:40.170> when<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.710> using<00:01:41.040> him<00:01:41.159> he<00:01:41.280> seemed

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
because when I was using him he seemed

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.069 
because when I was using him he seemed
to<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.700> much<00:01:41.909> better<00:01:41.970> shooting<00:01:42.689> than<00:01:42.869> El

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
to have much better shooting than El

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:43.670 
to have much better shooting than El
Shaarawy

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
Shaarawy

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920 
Shaarawy
so<00:01:44.070> shooting<00:01:44.759> wise<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.450> scoop<00:01:45.689> turn

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so shooting wise you can just scoop turn

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.690 
so shooting wise you can just scoop turn
defenders<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> shot<00:01:47.549> because

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
defenders and then take a shot because

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.999 
defenders and then take a shot because
he<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.450> awesome<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.049> coin<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.560> his

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
he is so awesome to coin with his

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
he is so awesome to coin with his
dribbling<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.850> good<00:01:51.030> his<00:01:51.390> finishing

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
dribbling is really good his finishing

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.270 
dribbling is really good his finishing
is<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.229> good<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.470> well<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> didn't<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.070> no

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
is really good as well I didn't have no

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
is really good as well I didn't have no
problem<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.880> his<00:01:54.000> finishing<00:01:54.479> eye<00:01:54.630> he<00:01:55.020> pretty

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
problem of his finishing eye he pretty

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
problem of his finishing eye he pretty
much<00:01:55.350> finished<00:01:55.649> most<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.219> things<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.610> tried

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
much finished most of the things I tried

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.719 
much finished most of the things I tried
to<00:01:57.030> finish<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.420> him<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> box<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> most<00:01:59.640> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
to finish with him in the box so most of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
to finish with him in the box so most of
the<00:01:59.820> time<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.299> won't<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.570> no<00:02:00.869> problems<00:02:01.320> with

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the time you won't have no problems with

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.080 
the time you won't have no problems with
his<00:02:01.560> finishing<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.399> moving<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> his

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
his finishing now moving on to his

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.300 
his finishing now moving on to his
disadvantages<00:02:03.899> he<00:02:04.079> has<00:02:04.320> medium<00:02:04.829> attacking

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
disadvantages he has medium attacking

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
disadvantages he has medium attacking
and<00:02:05.520> low<00:02:05.640> defensive<00:02:06.119> work<00:02:06.299> rate<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:06.930> means

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and low defensive work rate which means

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.199 
and low defensive work rate which means
he<00:02:07.380> will<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.619> al<00:02:07.890> positioned<00:02:08.520> occasionally

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
he will be al positioned occasionally

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.570 
he will be al positioned occasionally
and<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.440> annoying<00:02:10.800> quite<00:02:11.250> quickly

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and this can get annoying quite quickly

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.940 
and this can get annoying quite quickly
and<00:02:11.940> he<00:02:12.510> has<00:02:12.660> free<00:02:12.959> star<00:02:13.230> wafer<00:02:13.650> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and he has free star wafer and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.589 
and he has free star wafer and
really<00:02:14.280> shows<00:02:14.490> on<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> pitch<00:02:14.970> because<00:02:15.330> every

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
really shows on the pitch because every

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.270 
really shows on the pitch because every
time<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> take<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> show<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.470> his<00:02:16.590> right<00:02:16.770> foot<00:02:16.800> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
time I take a show of his right foot it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370 
time I take a show of his right foot it
is<00:02:17.670> most<00:02:17.880> likely<00:02:18.120> gonna<00:02:18.330> be<00:02:18.450> off<00:02:18.750> target<00:02:19.290> -

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
is most likely gonna be off target -

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.960 
is most likely gonna be off target -

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.090 
he scored me and 14 goes in seven games
I<00:02:30.209> think<00:02:30.270> somewhere<00:02:30.780> around<00:02:30.870> there<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.319> I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
I think somewhere around there and I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.670 
I think somewhere around there and I
think<00:02:32.340> he<00:02:32.670> was<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:34.020> all<00:02:34.290> over<00:02:34.319> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
think he was just really all over the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.710 
think he was just really all over the
pitch<00:02:34.890> he<00:02:35.130> was<00:02:35.310> defenders<00:02:36.180> were<00:02:36.300> struggling

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
pitch he was defenders were struggling

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.380 
pitch he was defenders were struggling
to<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:37.050> him<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.890> dribbling<00:02:38.430> he's<00:02:38.700> really

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
to get him the dribbling he's really

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.990 
to get him the dribbling he's really
good<00:02:39.569> as<00:02:39.720> well<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.709> good<00:02:41.489> as<00:02:41.640> team

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
