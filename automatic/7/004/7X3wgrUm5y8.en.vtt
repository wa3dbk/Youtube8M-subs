 for 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.989
 few weeks of being attentive to the content of your interest section 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.879
 technology and telecommunications 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.089
 with a server and telmo 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.739
 let's comment on interesting cooper themes 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.549
 the first of these issues refers to how difficult to update a 

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:23.419
 computer 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.599
 generally people think they updated computer only 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.539
 It requires some changes and that the computer is maintained 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.820
 updated is made to your name iphone update of a computer 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.590
 is not so linear since when you buy a computer 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.240
 under the latest technology available in the market at two years and that 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.780
 computer is obsolete 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 starting from there the vast majority of people do not acquire in the last 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.130
 computer technology available in the market means that the level 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.160
 of obsolescence is much greater and updating a computer has two 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.170
 key components that make this update process difficult 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.820
 First is the fact that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.960
 you have to analyze the model under the motherboard that where the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.540
 processors or the processor and the memory this processor and memory in 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.480
 occasions when you want to change one generation to another you can not do it in 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.930
 the same place therefore you have to change the model and to do that 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.180
 change it is necessary to see if the new one goes back to the most modern that is going to 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.150
 provide greater speed and power your computer fits within the record 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.540
 standing and that's a problem 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 and the other element and maybe the most sensitive is that when you put on 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.330
 calculate everything you need to invest engdahl delegate burned crazy efe 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.690
 copier decided to divide his general computer a new one to the title 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.860
 of positives 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.750
 relevant to be a man or an update to your machine when you 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.320
 calculates realizes that it is practically the same or more expensive 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.200
 make such a plan therefore you have to analyze carefully at the time of one 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.170
 to be a man of your machine to see if it's worth it and not much more 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.170
 annoying expensive obinna carry out that update 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.190
 the last topic that we are going to share with you is referred to arly falcon 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.209
 sector related to educational informatics educational informatics is 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.830
 the synergy that exists between information technologies 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.230
 telecommunications and education as we can incorporate the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.239
 technology to the educational process at all levels from the process 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.240
 initial until the university level applies the concept known as and 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.130
