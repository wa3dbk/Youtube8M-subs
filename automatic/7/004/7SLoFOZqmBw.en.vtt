dead<00:00:22.060> miracles<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:24.100> wall<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.610> then<00:00:24.939> we'll

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
dead miracles on the wall and then we'll

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.530 
dead miracles on the wall and then we'll
have<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.599> number<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:26.279> pressed<00:00:27.279> cuttings<00:00:27.970> taken

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
have a number of pressed cuttings taken

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.609 
have a number of pressed cuttings taken
from<00:00:30.060> those<00:00:31.060> very<00:00:31.419> plants<00:00:31.930> that<00:00:32.079> you<00:00:32.230> can<00:00:32.410> see

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
from those very plants that you can see

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.830

on the wall into your book so there's a

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.050

Craig Venters new life form and i made

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.139 
Craig Venters new life form and i made
so<00:01:32.409> light<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:32.680> then<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.340> question<00:01:33.759> was<00:01:33.909> what

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
so light and then the question was what

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.600 
so light and then the question was what
do<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.299> want<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.540> grow<00:01:34.720> out<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.259> soil<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
do you want to grow out of the soil and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.670 
do you want to grow out of the soil and
and<00:01:37.270> we<00:01:37.390> literally<00:01:37.899> had<00:01:38.079> a<00:01:38.110> kind<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.409> round

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
and we literally had a kind of round

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.010 
and we literally had a kind of round
robin<00:01:39.189> you<00:01:39.399> know<00:01:39.490> what's<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.149> best<00:01:40.270> plant<00:01:40.840> in

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
robin you know what's the best plant in

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.179 
robin you know what's the best plant in
the<00:01:41.110> world<00:01:41.200> what's<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.799> most<00:01:41.979> interesting

that relationship of how materially the

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.170 
that relationship of how materially the
marangos<00:03:31.090> connect<00:03:31.689> to<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.959> world<00:03:32.109> obviously
