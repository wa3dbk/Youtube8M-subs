this<00:00:20.880> package<00:00:21.240> was<00:00:21.480> working<00:00:21.750> out<00:00:21.840> pretty<00:00:21.990> well

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
this package was working out pretty well

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.650 
this package was working out pretty well
I<00:00:22.529> mean<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.550> turn<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.090> off<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
I mean I can just turn it off and it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870 
I mean I can just turn it off and it
looks<00:00:24.869> okay<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:26.039> nice<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.670> not

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
looks okay it's nice because it's not

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.740 
looks okay it's nice because it's not
isn't<00:00:27.599> move<00:00:28.050> or<00:00:28.260> feel<00:00:28.410> cheap<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.660> got<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
isn't move or feel cheap so got the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.560 
isn't move or feel cheap so got the
white<00:00:30.869> fans<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> front<00:00:32.270> got<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.390> water

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
white fans in the front got my water

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.040 
white fans in the front got my water
cooling<00:00:33.930> set<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.090> my<00:00:36.090> whole<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.809> reason

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
cooling set up and my whole the reason

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.510 
cooling set up and my whole the reason
why<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.230> took<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.469> long<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.430> was

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
why it took so long is because I was

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.889 
why it took so long is because I was
waiting<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.390> piece<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.430> this

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
waiting on this piece right here this

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.130 
waiting on this piece right here this
mr.<00:00:43.550> pump<00:00:44.550> front<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.210> guess<00:00:45.360> you'd<00:00:45.570> call<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
mr. pump front I guess you'd call it is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.670 
mr. pump front I guess you'd call it is
an<00:00:46.920> alpha<00:00:47.129> cool<00:00:47.460> product<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.149> enables<00:00:48.680> your

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
pump to pump down this way and out the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.299 
pump to pump down this way and out the
front<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.780> particular<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.860> d5

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
front because this particular the the d5

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.900 
front because this particular the the d5
pumps<00:00:56.789> pump<00:00:57.780> from<00:00:58.109> normally<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
pumps pump from normally this way and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.020 
pumps pump from normally this way and
then<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.800> device<00:01:02.160> enables<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> go

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
then up but this device enables it to go

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
then up but this device enables it to go
whichever<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.870> please<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.700> have

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
whichever way you please so now I have

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
whichever way you please so now I have
it<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> pump<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.200> runs<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it going for the pump it runs to that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
it going for the pump it runs to that
tube<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.369> tube<00:01:08.400> goes<00:01:08.939> all<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
tube the tube goes all the way up so you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.660 
tube the tube goes all the way up so you
can<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.590> right<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.250> goes<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.610> way

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
can see right there it goes all the way

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.859 
can see right there it goes all the way
up<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> rat<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.640> comes<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.939> goes

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
up into the rat up there comes down goes

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.740 
up into the rat up there comes down goes
into<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> CPU<00:01:16.619> comes<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.880> dumps<00:01:18.540> into<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
into the CPU comes out dumps into the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.140 
into the CPU comes out dumps into the
reservoir<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> do

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
reservoir and there you have it so we do

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.179 
reservoir and there you have it so we do
have<00:01:21.330> quite<00:01:21.689> some<00:01:22.020> good<00:01:22.200> flow<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.100> my

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.300 

BIOS<00:01:56.540> do<00:01:56.780> look<00:01:56.930> good<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.470> I'd<00:01:57.650> like<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:58.070> sleeve

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
BIOS do look good and I'd like to sleeve

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.530 
BIOS do look good and I'd like to sleeve
this<00:01:58.580> ring<00:01:58.880> these<00:01:59.450> in<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:01.300> ring<00:02:02.300> able<00:02:02.480> to

some<00:02:02.720> plug<00:02:02.900> back<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.380> really<00:02:03.590> don't

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
some plug back because I really don't

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.270 
some plug back because I really don't
mean<00:02:03.920> front<00:02:04.490> audio<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:06.470> do<00:02:06.620> that<00:02:06.770> right<00:02:06.920> now

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.550 

already<00:02:12.150> looking<00:02:12.420> cleaner<00:02:15.170> eventually<00:02:16.170> again

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
already looking cleaner eventually again

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.730 
already looking cleaner eventually again
I<00:02:16.710> want<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> build<00:02:17.100> like<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> shroud<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:18.090> this

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
I want to build like a shroud for this

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.960 
I want to build like a shroud for this
and<00:02:19.740> maybe<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> cut<00:02:20.640> out<00:02:20.670> or

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
and maybe have like a cut out or

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.060 
and maybe have like a cut out or
something<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.360> this

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
something like this

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.470 
something like this
and<00:02:23.070> kind<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.300> then

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
and kind of like right here and then

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.110 
and kind of like right here and then
carbon-fiber<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.470> make<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.830> look<00:02:25.950> nice<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:29.120> want

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
carbon-fiber it make it look nice I want

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.970 
carbon-fiber it make it look nice I want
to<00:02:30.240> get<00:02:30.360> another<00:02:30.630> one<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.990> these<00:02:31.110> cards<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
to get another one of these cards and I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.670 
to get another one of these cards and I
mean<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.570> don't<00:02:33.570> know<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:33.870> that's<00:02:34.020> gonna<00:02:34.110> be

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
mean I don't know what that's gonna be

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.110 
mean I don't know what that's gonna be
and<00:02:34.770> they<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.340> wouldn't<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> black

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and they probably wouldn't have a black

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.110 
and they probably wouldn't have a black
backplate<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> while<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.820> maybe<00:02:38.970> I'll

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
backplate on for a while so maybe I'll

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.790 
backplate on for a while so maybe I'll
order<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.420> back<00:02:39.630> plate<00:02:39.930> now<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.500> sit<00:02:40.770> on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
order a back plate now and just sit on

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.670 
order a back plate now and just sit on
it<00:02:40.890> not<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> bad<00:02:42.090> idea<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.720> will<00:02:42.990> be<00:02:43.140> putting<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.560> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it not a bad idea I will be putting in a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.300 
it not a bad idea I will be putting in a
physics<00:02:44.100> card<00:02:44.780> relatively<00:02:45.780> soon<00:02:46.310> probably

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
physics card relatively soon probably

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.350 
physics card relatively soon probably
not<00:02:47.400> from<00:02:47.490> 95/60<00:02:48.240> see<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.209> would

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
not from 95/60 see I have but that would

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.470 
not from 95/60 see I have but that would
be<00:02:51.390> permanent<00:02:51.930> that's<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:53.330> me<00:02:54.330> and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
be permanent that's just for me and

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.330 
be permanent that's just for me and
victim<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.740> physics<00:02:56.070> cards

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
victim because we like physics cards

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.480 
victim because we like physics cards
because<00:02:56.520> we're<00:02:56.700> weird<00:02:58.070> let's<00:02:59.070> go<00:02:59.190> ahead<00:02:59.280> and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
because we're weird let's go ahead and

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.430 
because we're weird let's go ahead and
take<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> look<00:02:59.820> at<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.000> top<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440

for<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> tea<00:03:11.870> well<00:03:12.870> because<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.140> had<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.590> one

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
for a tea well because I had this one

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.000 
for a tea well because I had this one
sitting<00:03:14.190> around<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.520> doing<00:03:14.670> anything<00:03:15.150> I

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
sitting around not doing anything I

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.990 
sitting around not doing anything I
didn't<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.220> need<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.730> tea

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
didn't really need a for a tea

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.210 
didn't really need a for a tea
I<00:03:18.209> might<00:03:18.540> put<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.110> eventually<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:20.010> if<00:03:20.130> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I might put one in eventually but if I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.350 
I might put one in eventually but if I
put<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> 480<00:03:20.880> in<00:03:21.120> its<00:03:21.630> gonna<00:03:21.900> like<00:03:22.610> smash<00:03:23.610> into

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
put a 480 in its gonna like smash into

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.120 
put a 480 in its gonna like smash into
the<00:03:24.480> side<00:03:24.720> over<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.530> I'm<00:03:25.620> not<00:03:25.800> gonna<00:03:25.980> be

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
the side over here and I'm not gonna be

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.550 
the side over here and I'm not gonna be
able<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.310> put<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.670> fitting<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.320> which<00:03:28.320> would

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
able to put this fitting on which would

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.500 
able to put this fitting on which would
ruin<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.370> whole<00:03:29.850> thing<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:32.030> mean<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.120> guess<00:03:33.150> I

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
ruin the whole thing so I mean I guess I

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.660 
ruin the whole thing so I mean I guess I
could<00:03:33.570> have<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.260> run<00:03:34.530> over<00:03:34.920> there<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.430> then

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
could have it run over there and then

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.940 
could have it run over there and then
come<00:03:35.880> out<00:03:35.910> there<00:03:36.390> that's<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.019> possibility<00:03:37.500> and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
come out there that's a possibility and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.259 
come out there that's a possibility and
I<00:03:38.070> might<00:03:38.280> play<00:03:38.459> with<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> future<00:03:39.090> but

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
I might play with that in the future but

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.590 
I might play with that in the future but
rods<00:03:40.260> are<00:03:40.440> kind<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.650> expensive<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:42.120> had<00:03:42.450> this

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
rods are kind of expensive so I had this

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.990 
rods are kind of expensive so I had this
laying<00:03:42.840> around<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.530> does<00:03:43.739> work<00:03:43.950> well<00:03:44.160> my<00:03:44.640> temps

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
laying around it does work well my temps

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.259 
laying around it does work well my temps
are<00:03:45.120> quite<00:03:45.390> good<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:46.190> might<00:03:47.190> put<00:03:47.489> some<00:03:47.519> causes

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
are quite good I might put some causes

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.070 
are quite good I might put some causes
on<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.630> rather<00:03:49.049> than<00:03:50.150> these<00:03:51.150> white<00:03:51.360> LEDs<00:03:51.750> ones

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
on it rather than these white LEDs ones

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080 
on it rather than these white LEDs ones
although<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.100> white<00:03:53.250> LED<00:03:53.549> does<00:03:53.730> look<00:03:53.940> pretty

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
although the white LED does look pretty

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.479 
although the white LED does look pretty
good<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.690> have<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.140> say<00:03:55.320> looks<00:03:55.799> blue<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.130> camera

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
good I have to say looks blue on camera

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.830 
good I have to say looks blue on camera
but<00:03:56.610> is<00:03:56.730> white<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:57.000> real<00:03:57.150> life<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:59.690> if<00:04:00.690> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
but is white in real life and if you
