in<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.859> clutch<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:05.590> believe<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.890> was<00:01:07.070> a

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
in the clutch I believe that was a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.940 
in the clutch I believe that was a
little<00:01:07.399> higher<00:01:07.610> I'm<00:01:08.090> not<00:01:08.270> sure<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:09.680> at<00:01:09.920> a

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
little higher I'm not sure I'm at a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.420 
little higher I'm not sure I'm at a
lower<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:10.399> slightly<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:12.110> believe<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:13.220> is

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
lower to slightly I believe this is

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.380 
lower to slightly I believe this is
slightly<00:01:13.670> lower<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.000> was<00:01:17.180> definitely

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
slightly lower and this was definitely

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.810 
slightly lower and this was definitely
higher<00:01:17.810> I<00:01:18.229> had<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.619> lower<00:01:18.890> because<00:01:19.369> he's<00:01:19.549> really

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
higher I had a lower because he's really

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.870 
higher I had a lower because he's really
not<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.270> fast<00:01:20.570> not<00:01:20.960> with<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.380> ball<00:01:21.820> not<00:01:22.820> the

Kobe I think he should be somewhere
between<00:02:00.490> 96<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.690> 97<00:02:03.030> why<00:02:04.030> cuz<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.570> don't<00:02:04.630> know<00:02:04.810> I

just feel like oh he's just a little

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.340 
just feel like oh he's just a little
better<00:02:07.090> than<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.570> part<00:02:07.810> right<00:02:08.020> now<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.709> that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
better than the part right now and that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.699 
better than the part right now and that
overall<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.590> 97<00:02:12.250> for<00:02:12.459> me<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:13.030> would

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
overall is 97 for me but it would

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.850 
overall is 97 for me but it would
mislead<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:15.070> Kobe<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.230> did<00:02:17.440> because

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
mislead you for Kobe this I did because

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.820

it'll<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:23.019> 93<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:24.100> should<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.310> five<00:02:24.640> bars

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
it'll be 93 you should have five bars

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.380 
it'll be 93 you should have five bars

they're not six fighting they keep going

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.770 
they're not six fighting they keep going
and<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:31.180> should<00:02:31.330> be<00:02:31.360> 80

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
and this should be 80

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
and this should be 80
don't<00:02:32.709> let<00:02:32.920> 2k<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.640> he<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.030> still<00:02:34.269> don't

but<00:02:36.220> um<00:02:36.840> let<00:02:37.840> me<00:02:37.870> think<00:02:37.989> anything<00:02:38.680> I'll<00:02:38.829> reduce

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
but um let me think anything I'll reduce

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.789 
but um let me think anything I'll reduce
toward<00:02:41.970> they<00:02:42.970> had<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.360> on<00:02:43.480> Baldy<00:02:43.690> high<00:02:44.140> like

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
toward they had it on Baldy high like

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.979 
toward they had it on Baldy high like
high<00:02:45.190> 80s<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.880> think<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.180> slightly<00:02:46.450> lower<00:02:46.690> he

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
high 80s I think is slightly lower he

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.330 
high 80s I think is slightly lower he
doesn't<00:02:47.230> really<00:02:47.380> stay<00:02:47.650> with<00:02:47.799> people<00:02:47.950> anymore

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
doesn't really stay with people anymore

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.850 
doesn't really stay with people anymore
like<00:02:48.730> he<00:02:48.850> used<00:02:49.090> to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
like he used to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.680 
like he used to
and<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:50.980> think<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.489> 99<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.000> lowered<00:02:52.600> her

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
and I think this is 99 I lowered her

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.780 
and I think this is 99 I lowered her
slightly<00:02:52.959> because<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.829> had<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.310> even<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.670> was

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
slightly because I had to even I was

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.440 
slightly because I had to even I was
over<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.120> believe<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.870> 99<00:02:56.350> then<00:02:56.739> he's<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:56.860> 98<00:02:57.430> 97

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
over I believe it's 99 then he's a 98 97

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.850 
over I believe it's 99 then he's a 98 97

as<00:05:28.620> his<00:05:28.770> offense<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.490> he<00:05:29.699> would<00:05:29.849> probably<00:05:30.060> be

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
as his offense that he would probably be

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.689 
as his offense that he would probably be
the<00:05:30.389> best<00:05:30.570> in<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.780> league<00:05:30.930> right<00:05:31.169> now<00:05:34.699> amazing

the best in the league right now amazing

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.230 
the best in the league right now amazing
insistency<00:05:36.389> with<00:05:36.570> his<00:05:36.720> jump<00:05:36.960> shot<00:05:37.910> very<00:05:38.910> fast

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
insistency with his jump shot very fast

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.360 
insistency with his jump shot very fast
great<00:05:42.240> vertical<00:05:43.520> yeah

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
great vertical yeah

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.420 
great vertical yeah
that's<00:05:47.370> what<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.580> did<00:05:47.819> for<00:05:47.849> dirt<00:05:48.150> loose<00:05:49.099> dirt<00:05:50.099> I

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
that's what I did for dirt loose dirt I

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.710 
that's what I did for dirt loose dirt I
think<00:05:50.669> he<00:05:50.759> was<00:05:50.849> 88

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
think he was 88

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.439 
think he was 88
I<00:05:51.750> had<00:05:52.259> a<00:05:52.289> lower<00:05:52.620> his<00:05:52.889> overall<00:05:53.039> slightly<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.939> 85

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
I had a lower his overall slightly to 85

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.129 
I had a lower his overall slightly to 85
I<00:05:55.580> honestly<00:05:56.580> don't<00:05:56.789> think<00:05:56.939> he<00:05:57.210> has<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.360> 99

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
I honestly don't think he has a 99

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.770 
I honestly don't think he has a 99
mid-range<00:05:58.710> I<00:05:59.039> could<00:05:59.189> see<00:05:59.340> 94<00:06:01.189> because<00:06:02.569> 99<00:06:03.569> is

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
mid-range I could see 94 because 99 is

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.700 
mid-range I could see 94 because 99 is
ridiculous

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
ridiculous

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.740 
ridiculous
that's<00:06:04.889> saying<00:06:05.189> he's<00:06:05.669> never<00:06:06.030> gonna<00:06:06.270> miss<00:06:06.569> that

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
that's saying he's never gonna miss that

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.350 
that's saying he's never gonna miss that
shot<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.379> know<00:06:08.189> he<00:06:08.400> had<00:06:08.550> to<00:06:08.580> miss<00:06:08.819> that<00:06:09.000> shot<00:06:09.180> at

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
shot I know he had to miss that shot at

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.170 
shot I know he had to miss that shot at
least<00:06:09.449> once<00:06:09.569> this<00:06:10.050> year<00:06:10.789> that's<00:06:11.789> the<00:06:11.909> same

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
least once this year that's the same

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.330 
least once this year that's the same
reason<00:06:12.389> why<00:06:12.689> I<00:06:12.719> can't<00:06:13.050> get<00:06:13.139> Colby<00:06:13.560> a<00:06:13.590> 99<00:06:14.129> for

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
reason why I can't get Colby a 99 for

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.920 
reason why I can't get Colby a 99 for
mid-range<00:06:14.520> he's<00:06:14.939> missed<00:06:15.180> plenty<00:06:15.389> mid-range

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
mid-range he's missed plenty mid-range
