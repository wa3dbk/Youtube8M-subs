hey folks Matt promoting the image back

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.079 
hey folks Matt promoting the image back
with<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.149> Canon<00:00:04.020> 60d<00:00:04.460> portrait<00:00:05.460> lens<00:00:05.700> kit

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
with the Canon 60d portrait lens kit

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.720 
with the Canon 60d portrait lens kit
again<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.290> could<00:00:07.560> be<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:07.919> any<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.370> DX

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
again this could be for any of the DX

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.520 
again this could be for any of the DX
cameras<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.540> 550d<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:11.000> 670<00:00:12.000> any<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
cameras so the 550d the 670 any of the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.070 
cameras so the 550d the 670 any of the
DX<00:00:13.889> cameras<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.030> basically<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:15.960> we're

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
DX cameras and basically what we're

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.050 
DX cameras and basically what we're
gonna<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.920> go<00:00:17.160> through<00:00:17.190> what<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> need<00:00:17.910> for

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
gonna do is go through what you need for

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.359 
gonna do is go through what you need for
a<00:00:18.119> portrait<00:00:18.539> lens<00:00:18.840> kit<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.470> basically<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
a portrait lens kit and basically you

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.550 
a portrait lens kit and basically you
can<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.970> very<00:00:21.330> cheaply<00:00:21.840> by<00:00:22.140> building

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
can do this very cheaply by building

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
can do this very cheaply by building
around<00:00:22.920> primes<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.560> first<00:00:25.560> off<00:00:25.939> it's<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.090> no

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
around primes so first off it's a no

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.040 
around primes so first off it's a no
brainer<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.320> an<00:00:28.439> 85<00:00:28.800> millimeter<00:00:29.580> lens

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
brainer to get an 85 millimeter lens

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.299 
brainer to get an 85 millimeter lens
beautiful<00:00:31.050> compression<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:32.009> 85

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
beautiful compression on an 85

beautiful compression on an 85
millimeter<00:00:32.880> lens<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> sense<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
millimeter lens in the sense of it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.020 
millimeter lens in the sense of it
really<00:00:34.350> makes<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> nice<00:00:34.860> portrait<00:00:35.370> lens<00:00:35.610> 85

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
really makes a nice portrait lens 85

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.880 
really makes a nice portrait lens 85
millimeter<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> classic<00:00:37.230> portrait<00:00:37.500> length

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
millimeter is a classic portrait length

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
millimeter is a classic portrait length
for<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:39.120> shooting<00:00:39.480> portraits<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.440> you're

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
for for shooting portraits so you're

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.770 
for for shooting portraits so you're
gonna<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> go<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.850> canon<00:00:42.270> 85mm

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
gonna want to go with the canon 85mm

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.369 
gonna want to go with the canon 85mm
meter<00:00:43.170> f-18<00:00:43.860> excellent<00:00:44.670> choice<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.930> would

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
meter f-18 excellent choice or I would

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.190 
meter f-18 excellent choice or I would
suggest<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.890> Sigma<00:00:47.370> 85<00:00:47.879> millimeter<00:00:48.329> f-14

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
suggest the Sigma 85 millimeter f-14

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560 
suggest the Sigma 85 millimeter f-14
again<00:00:49.980> an<00:00:50.129> excellent<00:00:50.460> choice<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.090> very<00:00:51.300> close

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
again an excellent choice and very close

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.229 
again an excellent choice and very close
in<00:00:51.750> price<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> Canon<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.430> f-14

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
in price to the Canon but you get f-14

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.650 
in price to the Canon but you get f-14
so<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> lot<00:00:54.899> faster<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.629> actually<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so it's a lot faster and actually I

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.209 
so it's a lot faster and actually I
shouldn't<00:00:57.870> say<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.289> close<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> price<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
shouldn't say very close in price it's a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.549 
shouldn't say very close in price it's a
fair<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.640> more<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> f-14<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.989> nice<00:01:01.260> if

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
fair bit more but the f-14 is nice if

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.680 
fair bit more but the f-14 is nice if
you're<00:01:02.070> saving<00:01:02.370> money<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> f-18<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
you're saving money the f-18 on the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.440 
you're saving money the f-18 on the
Canon<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> good<00:01:04.589> route<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> go<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.519> still

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Canon is a good route to go and still

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
Canon is a good route to go and still
very<00:01:06.479> quick<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.110> f-18<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.860> very<00:01:08.130> nice

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
very quick at f-18 and very nice

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.330 
very quick at f-18 and very nice
performing<00:01:09.000> lens<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.650> 85

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
performing lens so there we have the 85

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
performing lens so there we have the 85
millimeter<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> prime<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.439> you're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
millimeter as a prime and then you're

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.940 
millimeter as a prime and then you're
gonna<00:01:13.680> want<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> choose<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.860> bit

on the on the budget II side the Canon
35<00:04:02.610> millimeter<00:04:03.000> f2<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.750> great<00:04:04.050> choice<00:04:04.320> and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
35 millimeter f2 is a great choice and

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.800 
35 millimeter f2 is a great choice and
then<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:05.610> can<00:04:05.760> also<00:04:05.880> look<00:04:06.150> at<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.390> 28

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
then you can also look at the 28

throw<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> 50mm<00:04:13.170> f-18<00:04:13.890> just<00:04:14.070> because<00:04:14.250> it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
throw in the 50mm f-18 just because it

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.460 
throw in the 50mm f-18 just because it
hardly<00:04:14.790> cost<00:04:14.970> anything<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:15.540> tack<00:04:15.930> sharp<00:04:16.230> and
