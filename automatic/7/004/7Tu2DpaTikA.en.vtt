compounds that are used to copy the
fence<00:00:40.110> parts<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.680> built<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.100> options<00:00:41.610> for

fence parts have built in options for

fence parts have built in options for
transferring<00:00:42.390> materials<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> only<00:00:44.040> work

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
transferring materials but the only work

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.139 
transferring materials but the only work
with<00:00:44.670> materials<00:00:44.820> applied<00:00:45.480> using<00:00:45.930> ice<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
with materials applied using ice so the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
with materials applied using ice so the
first<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> use<00:00:49.620> ice<00:00:49.860> trees<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
first thing to do is to use ice trees to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
first thing to do is to use ice trees to
apply<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.850> material<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> polygons<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
apply the material to the polygons of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
apply the material to the polygons of
the<00:00:52.620> fence<00:00:52.800> parts

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.930 

there's<00:01:04.140> only<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.530> material<00:01:05.070> used<00:01:05.550> by<00:01:05.729> all

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
there's only one material used by all

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.420 
there's only one material used by all
parts<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> fence<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.130> need<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
parts of the fence so we just need to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:21.520 
parts of the fence so we just need to
add<00:01:08.550> it<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> materials<00:01:09.390> attribute

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.670 

then<00:01:22.190> we<00:01:22.790> need<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.000> set<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.450> material<00:01:23.960> ID<00:01:24.110> so

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
then we need to set the material ID so

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.789 
then we need to set the material ID so
that<00:01:24.710> all<00:01:25.010> polygons<00:01:25.610> use<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.119> material<00:01:26.799> set

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
that all polygons use this material set

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.130 
that all polygons use this material set
the<00:01:27.920> material<00:01:28.369> ID<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.820> one<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.540> use<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.900> first

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the material ID to one to use the first

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.350 
the material ID to one to use the first
material<00:01:30.500> in<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.950> materials<00:01:31.430> array<00:01:31.700> instead

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
material in the materials array instead

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.830

of<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.659> material<00:01:33.110> applied<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.650> object

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
normally is true is driven by a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.910 
normally is true is driven by a
condition<00:01:38.090> on<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.300> polygons<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.680> in<00:01:39.800> this

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
condition on the polygons but in this

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.899 
condition on the polygons but in this
case<00:01:40.159> set<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:40.909> true<00:01:41.119> for<00:01:41.570> all<00:01:41.720> polygons<00:01:42.909> now

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
case set it to true for all polygons now

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.370 
case set it to true for all polygons now
we<00:01:43.970> need<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.360> do<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> same<00:01:44.630> for<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.229> other

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
we need to do the same for the other

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.100 
we need to do the same for the other
parts<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.890> fence<00:01:46.509> right<00:01:47.509> click<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:47.869> the

however the original fence rail uses a

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.300 
however the original fence rail uses a
different<00:03:56.940> projection<00:03:57.570> name<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:58.980> need<00:03:59.220> to

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
different projection name so you need to

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.860 
different projection name so you need to
change<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.670> source<00:03:59.970> projection<00:04:00.480> name<00:04:00.660> to

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
change the source projection name to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.220 
change the source projection name to
match<00:04:01.970> alternatively<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.480> could<00:04:03.690> rename<00:04:04.050> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
match alternatively you could rename the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.210 
match alternatively you could rename the
source<00:04:04.440> projection<00:04:04.980> instead<00:04:06.440> so<00:04:07.440> far<00:04:07.740> we've

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
source projection instead so far we've

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.950 
source projection instead so far we've
transferred<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.880> materials<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.600> texture

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
transferred the materials and texture

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.720 
transferred the materials and texture
coordinates<00:04:10.380> from<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.590> fence<00:04:10.860> parts<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.640> the

coordinates from the fence parts to the

coordinates from the fence parts to the
complete<00:04:12.060> fence<00:04:12.350> in<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.500> next<00:04:13.680> video<00:04:13.830> we'll

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
complete fence in the next video we'll

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.789 
complete fence in the next video we'll
use<00:04:14.760> eyes<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.300> make<00:04:15.480> some<00:04:15.690> adjustments<00:04:16.290> like

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
use eyes to make some adjustments like

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.560 
use eyes to make some adjustments like
getting<00:04:17.160> rid<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.549> repeating<00:04:18.030> pattern<00:04:18.060> in

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
getting rid of the repeating pattern in

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.320 
getting rid of the repeating pattern in
the<00:04:18.600> fence<00:04:18.870> panels
