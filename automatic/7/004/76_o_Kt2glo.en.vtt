00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.040 
this is a triose one-step trap machine
it's<00:01:13.049> from<00:01:13.860> laymen's<00:01:14.399> and<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.689> been<00:01:15.840> around

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
it's from laymen's and it's been around

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.660 
it's from laymen's and it's been around
for<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> long<00:01:16.440> time<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.039> trap<00:01:17.250> machine<00:01:17.369> has

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
for a long time this trap machine has

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.700 
for a long time this trap machine has
probably<00:01:17.909> been<00:01:18.000> around<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.539> 50<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.200> 60<00:01:19.679> years

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
probably been around for 50 or 60 years

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
probably been around for 50 or 60 years
and<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.490> basically<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.179> step<00:01:21.539> trap<00:01:21.869> machine

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and it's basically a step trap machine

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.059 
and it's basically a step trap machine
which<00:01:22.500> allows<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:23.610> trap<00:01:24.030> shooter<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:25.560> throw<00:01:26.039> a

which allows the trap shooter to throw a

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.580 
which allows the trap shooter to throw a
clay<00:01:26.520> target<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> air<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.869> his<00:01:28.050> foot<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
clay target in the air with his foot and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
clay target in the air with his foot and
then<00:01:28.770> fire<00:01:29.069> the<00:01:29.369> weapon<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> saw<00:01:30.420> me

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
then fire the weapon and you saw me

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.380 
then fire the weapon and you saw me
doing<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.789> few<00:01:32.819> minutes<00:01:33.270> ago

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
doing that just just a few minutes ago

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.570 
doing that just just a few minutes ago
and<00:01:33.690> it<00:01:33.750> works<00:01:33.929> fairly<00:01:34.440> well<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.250> throw

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
and it works fairly well it will throw

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.600 
and it works fairly well it will throw
singles<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.330> doubles<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> very<00:01:37.770> solid

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
singles or doubles it's a very solid

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.419 
singles or doubles it's a very solid
construction<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.509> at<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:41.039> point<00:01:41.310> in

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
construction and at at this point in

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.609 
construction and at at this point in
time<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.149> it<00:01:42.270> down<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> ground<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
time we have it down in the ground and I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.199 
time we have it down in the ground and I
won't<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.950> ahead<00:01:44.069> and<00:01:44.369> pull<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.580> up<00:01:44.789> for<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
won't go ahead and pull it up for you

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.279 
won't go ahead and pull it up for you
and<00:01:45.959> show<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.549> basically<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.959> looks

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
and show you basically how that looks

00:01:49.289 --> 00:02:02.469 
and show you basically how that looks
not<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.580> ground

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.630 

so<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.350> basically<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so as you can see it basically is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.809 
so as you can see it basically is
three-legged<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.799> has<00:02:08.069> points<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
three-legged and it has points on the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.660 
three-legged and it has points on the
front<00:02:09.090> legs<00:02:09.330> which<00:02:09.630> go<00:02:10.110> into<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.679> ground<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
front legs which go into the ground the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
front legs which go into the ground the
back<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> long<00:02:12.810> straight<00:02:13.230> piece<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
back just is a long straight piece and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.420 
back just is a long straight piece and
it<00:02:13.890> has<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> step<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.349> back<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.130> what

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
it has a step on the back of it and what

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.750 
it has a step on the back of it and what
happens<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.120> when<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.480> push<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.930> step<00:02:19.260> down

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
happens is when you push that step down

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.080 
happens is when you push that step down
and<00:02:20.760> I'll<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.540> ahead<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:22.110> that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and I'll have go ahead and have that

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:33.170 
and I'll have go ahead and have that
demonstrated<00:02:30.140> okay<00:02:31.170> Nets<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.830> push<00:02:32.610> down<00:02:32.640> it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
demonstrated okay Nets is push down it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.740 
demonstrated okay Nets is push down it
releases<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:35.280> thrower<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.420> spring

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
releases the thrower and the spring

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.110 
releases the thrower and the spring
swings<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.620> around<00:02:37.709> throwing<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.640> your<00:02:38.880> tart

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
swings it around throwing out your tart

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.600 
swings it around throwing out your tart
your<00:02:39.599> clay<00:02:39.780> target<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.739> will<00:02:40.830> do<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.250> or

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
your clay target so it will do one or

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.870 
your clay target so it will do one or
two<00:02:42.200> clays<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.620> will<00:02:43.769> do<00:02:43.890> them<00:02:43.980> stacked<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.849> top

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
two clays it will do them stacked on top

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180 
two clays it will do them stacked on top
of<00:02:45.150> each<00:02:45.299> other<00:02:45.540> or<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.080> will<00:02:46.200> do<00:02:46.349> them<00:02:46.530> side<00:02:47.160> by

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
of each other or it will do them side by

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.759 
of each other or it will do them side by
side<00:02:47.400> seeing<00:02:48.090> them<00:02:48.330> right<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.080> left<00:02:49.319> or

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
side seeing them right to left or

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.319 
side seeing them right to left or
together<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.440> quite<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> bit<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.940> features<00:02:53.940> on

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
together so quite a bit of features on

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.069 
together so quite a bit of features on
this<00:02:54.560> considering<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.860> don't<00:02:56.099> have<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
this considering that you don't have a

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.809 
this considering that you don't have a
any<00:02:58.079> kind<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.349> power<00:02:58.620> source<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.280> operates<00:02:59.670> on

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
any kind of power source it operates on

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.210 
any kind of power source it operates on
its<00:02:59.970> own<00:03:00.120> power<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:01.110> light<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.829> not<00:03:01.890> very

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
its own power it's light it's not very

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.220 
its own power it's light it's not very
heavy<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.790> easy<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.150> pick<00:03:03.360> up<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.660> carry<00:03:03.750> and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
heavy it's easy to pick up and carry and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.830 
heavy it's easy to pick up and carry and
move<00:03:04.380> around<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.730> does<00:03:06.000> shake<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.359> little<00:03:06.690> bit

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
move around it does shake a little bit

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.289 
move around it does shake a little bit
when<00:03:07.079> you<00:03:07.170> step<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.430> takes<00:03:09.180> a

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
when you step on it so it is takes a

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.420 
when you step on it so it is takes a
little<00:03:09.540> bit<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.720> getting<00:03:09.900> used<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.319> when<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
little bit of getting used to when you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.550 
little bit of getting used to when you
you're<00:03:11.940> trying<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.390> shoot<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.900> step<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.319> it<00:03:13.350> at

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
you're trying to shoot and step on it at

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.430 
you're trying to shoot and step on it at
the<00:03:13.680> same<00:03:13.890> time<00:03:14.450> again<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.600> saw<00:03:15.840> me<00:03:16.019> do<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.380> a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440

the<00:04:53.710> fact<00:04:53.950> that<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.250> get<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.430> clay<00:04:54.760> thrower

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
the fact that you get a clay thrower

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.510 
the fact that you get a clay thrower
that<00:04:55.780> will<00:04:55.930> actually<00:04:56.110> not<00:04:56.770> only<00:04:56.890> throw<00:04:57.250> one

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
that will actually not only throw one

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.670 
that will actually not only throw one
clay<00:04:57.850> but<00:04:58.240> it'll<00:04:58.360> throw<00:04:58.480> two<00:04:58.630> clay<00:04:59.140> targets

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
clay but it'll throw two clay targets

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.530 
clay but it'll throw two clay targets
and<00:04:59.830> also<00:04:59.980> throw<00:05:00.430> them<00:05:00.550> on<00:05:00.640> top<00:05:00.670> of<00:05:01.120> each<00:05:01.270> other

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
and also throw them on top of each other

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.590 
and also throw them on top of each other
or<00:05:02.500> they'll<00:05:03.040> throw<00:05:03.400> them<00:05:03.550> out<00:05:03.700> right<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.390> left

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
or they'll throw them out right to left

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.960 
or they'll throw them out right to left
so<00:05:04.900> that's<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.320> pretty<00:05:05.650> good<00:05:06.100> value<00:05:06.400> for<00:05:06.850> what

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
so that's a pretty good value for what

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.580 
so that's a pretty good value for what
you<00:05:07.120> get<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.540> appears<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:07.960> be<00:05:08.020> very<00:05:08.110> solid

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
you get it appears to be very solid

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.920 
you get it appears to be very solid
