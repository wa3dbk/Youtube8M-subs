00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you and I know these are painful because

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.279 
you and I know these are painful because
you<00:00:23.619> maybe<00:00:24.220> if<00:00:24.400> dated<00:00:24.699> for<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:24.939> while<00:00:25.119> and<00:00:25.509> maybe

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
you maybe if dated for a while and maybe

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.349 
you maybe if dated for a while and maybe
you're<00:00:26.409> not<00:00:26.439> ready<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.980> use<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.519> the<00:00:27.909> c-word

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
you're not ready to use the the c-word

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.769 
you're not ready to use the the c-word
the<00:00:28.720> commitment<00:00:29.230> word<00:00:29.380> yet<00:00:29.739> but<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:31.630> you're

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
the commitment word yet but but you're

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.920 
the commitment word yet but but you're
wondering<00:00:32.140> if<00:00:32.290> it<00:00:32.439> has<00:00:32.880> potential<00:00:33.880> for<00:00:34.690> that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
wondering if it has potential for that

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.500 
wondering if it has potential for that
and<00:00:35.380> these<00:00:36.310> are<00:00:36.460> three<00:00:36.820> pretty<00:00:37.300> good

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
and these are three pretty good

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.780 
and these are three pretty good
indicators<00:00:38.110> that<00:00:38.140> it<00:00:38.830> may<00:00:39.070> not<00:00:39.280> at<00:00:39.520> least<00:00:39.670> not

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
indicators that it may not at least not

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.690 
indicators that it may not at least not
now<00:00:40.240> it<00:00:40.810> hasn't<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.770> potential<00:00:42.250> for<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.520> and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
now it hasn't the potential for it and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.160 
now it hasn't the potential for it and
the<00:00:43.060> first<00:00:43.270> one<00:00:43.420> is<00:00:43.540> when<00:00:43.720> he<00:00:43.810> says<00:00:44.020> it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
the first one is when he says it

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.740 
the first one is when he says it
outright<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:46.090> gonna<00:00:46.210> think<00:00:46.540> that's

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
outright and you're gonna think that's

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.460 
outright and you're gonna think that's
crazy

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
crazy

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.060 
crazy
