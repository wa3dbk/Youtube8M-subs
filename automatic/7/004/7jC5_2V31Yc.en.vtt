 I know more than it is who kill me 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.660
 but in any case they circled me 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.610
 believe I took a gust 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.190
 are we going to send a sin because 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.790
 I'm pissed off I was trying 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.420
 to write years I was trying 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.620
 to write when the words mathieu g and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.820
 I was writing quickly 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.829
 because I was writing 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.420
 and then when I saw that I was like 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.920
 shot I did escape the blow 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.570
 I tried to fight back but it was 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.480
 too fast 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.010
 yeah ben me me me but there was a 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.530
 little I did not want to say better a little 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.630
 we were recalibrated to the spoon between 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.459
 the episode 3 the episode 4 of the blow I am 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.880
 am married fashion I went down there he 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.829
 There were plenty of people to to to 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.540
 forest and suddenly ben I started my 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.680
 intro I did not even have time to finish 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.900
 my company completely 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.480
 she had required to attack me 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.220
 and after jade is pursued after I get 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.900
 I am devoted and then here is anyway 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.480
 we did more than a few season 1 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.680
 yes there were more subscribers and that's 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.390
 from his life easy to find them I 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.470
 found here with french this mode too 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.689
 it was very good the hand not been 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.430
 excellent from the manna world 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.750
 but absolutely I thank Mexico 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.950
 who made the moderator during the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.099
 last three episodes because without 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.230
 him I think it would have been thanks to 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.030
 ma said when also for for the player 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.010
 thanks to crystal serve for the server 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.379
 who held to who held contrary to 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.230
 last season we had to postpone 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.879
 yeah and it worked very well even the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.470
 only small concern of viewers and 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.269
 the break and take for me I 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.079
 found a horse at the beginning and the me 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.079
 poking Czech 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.720
 just so it was pretty 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.000
 problematic but the viewer who has 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.800
 asked a few small worries actually I 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.020
 the problem of the viewer is that if 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.240
 it had been individual, that is to say that 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.090
 if everyone was not at the same 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.890
 time in the viewer stuff for getting 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.870
 turn into a spectator well 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.060
 would have walked but there we do as we 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.120
 kill people at the same time eh ben he 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.500
 was two in the room that transcribes 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.810
 turn them into spectator and suddenly 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.490
 not have fun shit and at first 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.570
 I saw guys with potions so 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.300
 I wondered what, oh yes, that's it 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.040
 pressure per month is precisely a 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.790
 moment I cheated a bit so 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.800
 besides, I want to tell him 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.390
 weezer x 85 a little dedication to him 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.460
 since I took a potion of 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.510
 poison so instinctively I got 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.020
 morgue and modern were dating a 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.790
 spectator 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.170
 in fact it was a real man became 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.210
 suddenly after I die you put in 0 and 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.950
 I defend them it's I'm sorry for 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.020
 him so really sorry for any 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.820
 way I did not go into play after at we 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.000
 have esteemed had asked I believe that 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.460
 I even received after the portel rodez 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.410
 ducasse to him in any case short if not the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.430
 season was very very good just a 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.350
 little problem of food at first 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.730
 that you very quickly settled my faith yes there 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.310
 had a klei problem too I had to 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.750
 to make a global nut orders that's 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.540
 not easy to foresee everything a fake well 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.130
 the fight but it was mostly 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.390
 had no moderator of the coup I was 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.830
 obliged to manage all this so I 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.020
 made small ellipses in some 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.130
 very close episodes finally me I did 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.240
 a big ellipses actually I pressed 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.590
 on the string rice key so I'm going 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.160
 skip half of my episode 2 but 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.890
 think not otherwise the season was 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.070
 excellent and I see we can not 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.840
 probably only expect excellent 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.760
 season 3 and season 3 will be suddenly 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.600
 better prepared since we have 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.060
 better what we have to do 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.500
 we were very well prepared but he 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.590
 there are things that we could not 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.780
 predict when when you make a server 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.640
 with more than 150 people it's enough 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.110
 complicated to handle any case anyway 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.760
 thank you for coming here I hope there 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.510
 it's up to the aura more no it's finally 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.950
 personally I 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.610
 especially broke out yeah me too 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.830

 this second season is there I saw 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.639
 a good you make you catch up but 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.919
 at one point I put a sack to 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.270
 the forest there was a group of 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.260
 people but I too have not seen 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.030
 wrong in the forest that's why I 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.160
 stay next to the forest yeah ben I 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.919

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.550
