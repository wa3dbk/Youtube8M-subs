before<00:01:40.829> half-time<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:41.729> frustrating<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
before half-time how frustrating is that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
before half-time how frustrating is that
a<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.409> does<00:01:43.590> show<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.220> been<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a bit does show that it's been a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
a bit does show that it's been a
relatively<00:01:45.000> equal<00:01:45.600> match<00:01:45.780> my<00:01:46.079> opponent

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
relatively equal match my opponent

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
relatively equal match my opponent
having<00:01:46.829> slightly<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> upper<00:01:47.640> hand<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> in

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
having slightly the upper hand and in

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.230 
having slightly the upper hand and in
the<00:01:48.930> second<00:01:49.350> half<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.820> what

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the second half I don't know really what

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.830 
the second half I don't know really what
happened<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.040> went<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
happened but I just went to it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.770 
happened but I just went to it
really<00:01:55.439> went<00:01:55.799> badly<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.640> me<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.570> good

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
really went badly for me and the good

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
really went badly for me and the good
thing<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.829> I've<00:01:58.920> scored<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.399> goal

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
thing is we know that I've scored a goal

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.670 
thing is we know that I've scored a goal
with<00:01:59.729> Suarez<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.450> two<00:02:00.689> shots<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.409> bank

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
with Suarez that's two shots in the bank

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649 
with Suarez that's two shots in the bank
and<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.430> could<00:02:02.610> possibly<00:02:02.969> lose<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.540> those

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and we could possibly lose one of those

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270 
and we could possibly lose one of those
shots<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.229> lose<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.439> game<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
shots if we lose this game well as you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.679 
shots if we lose this game well as you
can<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.610> we're<00:02:05.790> gonna<00:02:05.880> lose<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.299> game<00:02:06.509> this

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
can see we're gonna lose this game this

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
can see we're gonna lose this game this
is<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.200> well<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.649> far<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.580> going

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
is not going well so far so we are going

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
is not going well so far so we are going
to<00:02:08.910> definitely<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.539> least<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.959> shot<00:02:09.989> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
to definitely get at least one shot on

to definitely get at least one shot on
the<00:02:10.440> target<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.310> least<00:02:11.520> there's<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:11.879> going<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the target at least there's not going to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.230 
the target at least there's not going to
be<00:02:12.150> none<00:02:12.540> which<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.989> good

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
be none which is good

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.600 
be none which is good
my<00:02:13.870> defenders<00:02:14.350> screw<00:02:14.590> up<00:02:14.740> right<00:02:14.950> there<00:02:15.190> he

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
my defenders screw up right there he

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.400 
my defenders screw up right there he
gets<00:02:15.790> through<00:02:16.030> again<00:02:16.330> he<00:02:16.540> scores<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> easiest

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
gets through again he scores the easiest

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.470 
gets through again he scores the easiest
goal<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.740> he's<00:02:17.830> had<00:02:17.950> all<00:02:17.980> game<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.550> honestly<00:02:19.210> I

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
goal that he's had all game I honestly I

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.180 
goal that he's had all game I honestly I
couldn't<00:02:20.170> get<00:02:20.380> an<00:02:20.470> opportunity<00:02:20.710> like<00:02:21.040> that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
couldn't get an opportunity like that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.160 
couldn't get an opportunity like that
against<00:02:21.670> him<00:02:21.790> he<00:02:21.970> had<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> very<00:02:22.390> solid<00:02:22.690> defense

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
against him he had a very solid defense

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.900 
against him he had a very solid defense
i<00:02:23.290> think<00:02:23.500> his<00:02:23.590> defense<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.040> league<00:02:24.400> won<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
i think his defense was league won the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.790 
i think his defense was league won the
french<00:02:25.210> league<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:26.050> everything<00:02:26.290> seemed<00:02:26.710> to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
french league but everything seemed to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.500 
french league but everything seemed to
be<00:02:26.920> working<00:02:27.160> for<00:02:27.700> him<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.270> my

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
be working for him like that my

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.090 
be working for him like that my
defenders<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.080> running<00:02:29.500> into<00:02:29.770> each<00:02:29.800> other

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
defenders of running into each other

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.220 
defenders of running into each other
after<00:02:30.490> he's<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:30.820> hit<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.390> craziest<00:02:31.930> shot

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
after he's just hit the craziest shot

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.930 
after he's just hit the craziest shot
you'll<00:02:32.380> ever<00:02:32.530> see<00:02:32.740> off<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.070> bar<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.790> it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
you'll ever see off the bar it's just it

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.970

didn't seem to be going in the back of
the<00:02:37.990> net<00:02:38.140> when<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.320> did<00:02:38.500> get<00:02:38.650> through<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.400> that

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
the net when I did get through but that

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.920 
the net when I did get through but that
is<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.700> luck<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.180> draw<00:02:40.360> with<00:02:40.630> FIFA

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
is the luck of the draw with FIFA

is the luck of the draw with FIFA
sometimes<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.650> doesn't<00:02:41.830> happen<00:02:42.010> for<00:02:42.460> you

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
sometimes it just doesn't happen for you

sometimes it just doesn't happen for you
I<00:02:42.790> would<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.210> expected<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.720> one<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.080> go<00:02:44.170> in

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
I would have expected that one to go in

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.500 
I would have expected that one to go in
the<00:02:44.350> back<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.710> net<00:02:44.920> but<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.610> be<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.820> doesn't

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the back of the net but so be it doesn't

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.660 
the back of the net but so be it doesn't
really<00:02:46.780> matter<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.290> lose<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> game<00:02:47.830> 5<00:02:48.310> one

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.580 
really matter we lose the game 5 one
that's<00:02:48.940> my<00:02:49.060> biggest<00:02:49.360> defeat<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:49.960> a<00:02:50.050> long<00:02:50.290> time

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that's my biggest defeat in a long time

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.190 
that's my biggest defeat in a long time
in<00:02:51.160> any<00:02:51.580> FIFA<00:02:52.030> game<00:02:52.060> i<00:02:52.270> don't<00:02:52.570> typically<00:02:52.960> lose

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
in any FIFA game i don't typically lose

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.020 
in any FIFA game i don't typically lose
by<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.740> many<00:02:53.980> goals<00:02:54.250> we've<00:02:54.490> got<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.820> goal

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
by that many goals we've got one goal

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.150 
by that many goals we've got one goal
with<00:02:55.180> Suarez<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.020> we<00:02:56.140> have<00:02:56.260> got<00:02:56.290> one<00:02:56.650> shot<00:02:56.980> on

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
which is pretty solid we then it's

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.840 
which is pretty solid we then it's
pretty<00:04:11.500> much<00:04:11.620> straightaway<00:04:11.920> get<00:04:12.640> through

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
one that was the chance which really

would have put me ahead in this game and
made<00:05:28.300> things<00:05:28.569> a<00:05:28.690> lot<00:05:28.840> easier<00:05:28.900> as<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.680> turns<00:05:29.919> out

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159

say<00:05:43.389> and<00:05:43.900> we're<00:05:44.080> now<00:05:44.199> for<00:05:44.500> two<00:05:44.650> down<00:05:44.949> I<00:05:45.250> then

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
say and we're now for two down I then

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.399 
say and we're now for two down I then
get<00:05:45.819> very<00:05:46.060> one-on-one<00:05:46.569> I<00:05:46.750> missed<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.169> chance

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
get very one-on-one I missed the chance

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.379 
get very one-on-one I missed the chance
how<00:05:47.830> cutting<00:05:48.250> is<00:05:48.400> that<00:05:48.580> we<00:05:48.729> then<00:05:48.880> play<00:05:49.090> another

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
how cutting is that we then play another

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.089 
how cutting is that we then play another
ball<00:05:49.659> through<00:05:49.960> one-on-one<00:05:50.229> with<00:05:50.590> cuadrado

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
ball through one-on-one with cuadrado

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.219 
ball through one-on-one with cuadrado
I'm<00:05:51.460> expecting<00:05:52.270> that<00:05:52.419> to<00:05:52.479> be<00:05:52.599> a<00:05:52.690> goal<00:05:52.990> but<00:05:53.139> he

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
I'm expecting that to be a goal but he

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.439 
I'm expecting that to be a goal but he
gets<00:05:53.440> two<00:05:53.710> defenders<00:05:54.159> back<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.699> manages<00:05:55.330> to

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
gets two defenders back and manages to

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.320 
gets two defenders back and manages to
defend<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.990> and<00:05:56.650> in<00:05:56.949> the<00:05:56.979> end<00:05:57.099> I'm<00:05:57.490> beaten<00:05:58.000> by<00:05:58.300> a

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
defend it and in the end I'm beaten by a

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330 
defend it and in the end I'm beaten by a
better<00:05:58.569> opponent<00:05:59.500> I<00:05:59.620> think<00:05:59.889> I<00:06:00.009> think<00:06:00.250> he

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
better opponent I think I think he

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.790 
better opponent I think I think he
actually<00:06:00.370> did<00:06:00.940> deserve<00:06:01.840> to<00:06:02.139> lose<00:06:02.289> that<00:06:02.529> game

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
actually did deserve to lose that game

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.290 
actually did deserve to lose that game
in<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.039> end<00:06:03.159> but<00:06:03.310> don't<00:06:03.490> worry<00:06:03.669> we<00:06:03.849> scored<00:06:04.120> one

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
in the end but don't worry we scored one
