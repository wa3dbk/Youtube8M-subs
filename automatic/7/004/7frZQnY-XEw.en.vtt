00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
back in and that way the meat itself

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.929 
back in and that way the meat itself
will<00:01:20.759> pull<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.210> straight<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
will pull just straight out like that so

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.070 
will pull just straight out like that so
and<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> good<00:01:24.689> indication

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and that's how that's a good indication

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
and that's how that's a good indication
to<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> steam<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> lobster<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.759> long<00:01:26.909> as

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
to that you steam the lobster as long as

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
to that you steam the lobster as long as
you<00:01:27.180> needed<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> meat<00:01:28.110> stays<00:01:28.380> solid

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you needed when the meat stays solid

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.800 
you needed when the meat stays solid
like<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:28.979> after<00:01:29.490> its<00:01:29.610> chilled<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.600> there's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
like this after its chilled so there's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.859 
like this after its chilled so there's
one<00:01:31.020> claw<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> easiest

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
one claw there and that's the easiest

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.319 
one claw there and that's the easiest
way<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.829> far<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.340> goes<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.000> guy<00:01:36.150> had

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
had to use a little bit more force

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.970 
had to use a little bit more force
because<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.480> was<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.600> thicker<00:02:56.930> cloth<00:02:57.230> we'll

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
because it was a thicker cloth we'll

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.380 
because it was a thicker cloth we'll
come<00:02:58.160> back<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.550> show<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.730> how<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.030> get<00:02:59.270> the
