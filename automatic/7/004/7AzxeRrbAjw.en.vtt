 wait until the end of the tour to 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.970
 reveal why I'm going to make a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.160
 great as a recipe for this episode right 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.590
 you have heard of the description 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.990
 Cost mothers like us just 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.850
 see the room of the course I had this idea is 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.500
 precisely because this writer so 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.940
 famous write a book that even calls 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.550
 lost time 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.080
 this book was divided into seven volumes 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.270
 he had the great idea to write this 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.940
 romance is just one day when he 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.310
 tasted a tea with a large and several 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.470
 ideas and various memories of his childhood 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.020
 came to your head then when people 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.360
 that there is a cost margin 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.390
 because we eat something that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.970
 brings back to childhood the past that 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.680
 brings this nostalgic thought so it is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.060
 This, we're going back to the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.250

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.230
 mix the sugar with the eggs and beat 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.890
 well until there are no more Brazil 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.890
 of subject 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.620
 to give a special moist air I'll 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.540
 put some lemon scraps here 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.640
 but you can use something else like 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.060
 Vanilla essence or else leave without 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.060
 same 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:32.040
 I also put a pinch of salt 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:35.870
 to enhance the flavor the yeast time 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.870
 then I add the flour gradually 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 the amount of the ingredients a bit 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.330

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.910
 when everything is incorporated into people 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.510
 puts the melted butter also 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.510
 a little bit 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.330
 the dough should look good and 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.920
 homogeneous 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.230
 then we'll take it to the refrigerator for 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.730
 at least two hours 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.400

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.040

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.380

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.650
