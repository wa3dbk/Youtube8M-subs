00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the mid body and legs and get some easy

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.130 
the mid body and legs and get some easy
kills<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.330> catch<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.689> after<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.990> round

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
kills they will catch on after a round
or<00:01:10.290> two<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> usually<00:01:10.799> works<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> pubs<00:01:11.549> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
or two but it usually works in pubs so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.230 
or two but it usually works in pubs so
definitely<00:01:12.330> check<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.689> spot<00:01:13.080> out<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.380> well<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
definitely check that spot out as well I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.149 
definitely check that spot out as well I
think<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.720> end<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:15.960> using<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.409> spot<00:01:16.710> honestly

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
think I end up using that spot honestly

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010 
think I end up using that spot honestly
almost<00:01:17.640> every<00:01:18.060> round<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:18.990> reason

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
almost every round and for some reason

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.749 
almost every round and for some reason
they<00:01:19.500> don't<00:01:19.710> learn<00:01:19.950> they're<00:01:20.430> either<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.880 
mention that this was kind of like match
before<00:01:32.579> I'd<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.450> had<00:01:33.570> experience<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
before I'd really had experience in the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
before I'd really had experience in the
game<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.369> much<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.820> mean<00:01:35.939> I'm<00:01:36.030> level<00:01:36.329> 47<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
game so much I mean I'm level 47 but

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.690 
game so much I mean I'm level 47 but
still<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.770> feeling<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> didn't<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
still was feeling like I didn't have a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.749 
still was feeling like I didn't have a
good<00:01:39.329> grasp<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> use<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.130> things<00:01:41.460> in

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
good grasp on what to use so things in

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.660 
good grasp on what to use so things in
here<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.950> XO<00:01:43.950> ping<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.430> stuff<00:01:44.549> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
here like the XO ping and stuff like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
here like the XO ping and stuff like
that<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.060> tend<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> use<00:01:45.689> anymore<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that I don't tend to use anymore so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690 
that I don't tend to use anymore so
don't<00:01:46.320> necessarily<00:01:46.799> copy<00:01:46.979> me<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.490> as

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
don't necessarily copy me on that as

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.190 
don't necessarily copy me on that as
well<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.060> tend<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> run<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:48.930> bit<00:01:49.110> more

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
well as I tend to run a little bit more

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
well as I tend to run a little bit more
heavy<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> killstreaks<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
heavy on the killstreaks now so there is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.780 
heavy on the killstreaks now so there is
definitely<00:01:52.350> stuff<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.009> learned<00:01:53.220> even<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
definitely stuff to be learned even on a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
definitely stuff to be learned even on a
10<00:01:54.030> ml<00:01:54.240> game<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.860> would<00:01:56.040> have

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
10 ml game I think that if I would have

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.560 
10 ml game I think that if I would have
had<00:01:56.280> some<00:01:56.490> different<00:01:56.790> perks<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.149> maybe<00:01:57.329> had<00:01:57.479> an

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
had some different perks on maybe had an

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810 
had some different perks on maybe had an
extra<00:01:57.810> attachment<00:01:58.439> had<00:01:58.680> something<00:01:59.430> different

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
extra attachment had something different

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.730 
extra attachment had something different
some<00:01:59.969> more<00:02:00.060> killstreaks<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.380> made

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
some more killstreaks it would have made

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.630 
some more killstreaks it would have made
this<00:02:01.920> an<00:02:02.100> even<00:02:02.430> easier<00:02:02.670> game<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.360> us<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> win

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
this an even easier game for us to win

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.590 
this an even easier game for us to win
one<00:02:05.640> thing<00:02:05.790> I've<00:02:05.880> been<00:02:06.000> talking<00:02:06.329> about<00:02:06.420> as

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
one thing I've been talking about as

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
one thing I've been talking about as
well<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:07.020> advanced<00:02:07.350> warfare<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.429> game

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
well for advanced warfare is the game

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.669 
well for advanced warfare is the game
types<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.479> they're<00:02:09.810> such<00:02:10.110> small<00:02:10.379> maps

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
types because they're such small maps

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.430 
types because they're such small maps
and<00:02:11.069> because<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.030> XO's<00:02:12.390> movements<00:02:13.260> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and because the XO's movements be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.420 
and because the XO's movements be
you<00:02:13.500> really<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.040> around<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> maps

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you really get you around the maps

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.520 
you really get you around the maps
quicker<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.060> feel<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:15.750> team<00:02:15.990> deathmatch<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
quicker I feel like team deathmatch and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.780 
quicker I feel like team deathmatch and
search<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.830> asteroid<00:02:17.100> game<00:02:17.430> types<00:02:17.640> that

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
search and asteroid game types that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.500 
search and asteroid game types that
really<00:02:18.000> shine<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.100> especially

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
really shine in this and especially

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.060 
really shine in this and especially
ranked<00:02:21.510> play<00:02:21.690> ranked<00:02:22.050> plays<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.500> v4<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.890> that

ranked play ranked plays for v4 and that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.530 
ranked play ranked plays for v4 and that
slows<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.730> game<00:02:23.820> down<00:02:23.880> even<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.300> little<00:02:24.450> bit

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
slows the game down even a little bit

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.100 
slows the game down even a little bit
further<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:25.620> you've<00:02:25.860> ever<00:02:26.010> played<00:02:26.250> 6v6

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
like that on this game it just gets

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.120 
like that on this game it just gets
ridiculous<00:02:32.280> because<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.390> spawn<00:02:34.170> spam

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
ridiculous because it's just spawn spam

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.950 
ridiculous because it's just spawn spam
the<00:02:35.280> objective<00:02:35.730> spawn<00:02:36.120> spam<00:02:36.450> be<00:02:36.570> objective

the objective spawn spam be objective

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.120 
the objective spawn spam be objective
and<00:02:37.140> doesn't<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:37.680> feel<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:37.920> there's

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and doesn't really feel like there's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.860 
and doesn't really feel like there's
much<00:02:38.250> strategy<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.180> turns<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.840> be

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
much strategy to it it turns out to be

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.020 
much strategy to it it turns out to be
you<00:02:40.560> know<00:02:40.650> whichever<00:02:40.920> team<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.790> like

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
you know whichever team can just like

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.700 
you know whichever team can just like
lock<00:02:42.390> down<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.780> area<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.170> little<00:02:43.320> bit<00:02:43.410> better

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
lock down the area a little bit better

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.160 
lock down the area a little bit better
but<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:45.000> ends<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.540> being<00:02:45.570> really<00:02:45.930> hectic

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
but it ends up being really hectic

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.740 
but it ends up being really hectic
especially<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:46.950> randoms<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.580> prefer<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.360> game

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
especially with randoms I prefer a game

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.640 
especially with randoms I prefer a game
where<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:48.960> can<00:02:49.080> have<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> little<00:02:49.380> bit<00:02:49.500> more

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
where I can have a little bit more

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.960 
where I can have a little bit more
control<00:02:49.980> as<00:02:50.190> an<00:02:50.280> individual<00:02:50.670> player

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
control as an individual player

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.070 
control as an individual player
especially<00:02:51.360> while<00:02:51.690> I'm<00:02:51.720> playing<00:02:51.960> with

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
especially while I'm playing with

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.130 
especially while I'm playing with
randoms<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:53.540> Search<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.600> Destroy<00:02:54.690> team

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
randoms like now Search and Destroy team

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.510 
randoms like now Search and Destroy team
deathmatch<00:02:55.500> definitely<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.310> going

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
deathmatch definitely have that going

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.400 
deathmatch definitely have that going
for<00:02:56.670> them<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.360> still<00:02:57.570> play<00:02:57.720> fairly<00:02:58.080> fast

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
for them and they still play fairly fast

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.340 
for them and they still play fairly fast

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the small maps also a little quick tip

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.410 
the small maps also a little quick tip
for<00:03:05.580> those<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.760> guys<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.030> haven't<00:03:06.180> played

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
for those you guys that haven't played

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.840 
for those you guys that haven't played
this<00:03:06.570> yet<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.960> think<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.620> plant<00:03:08.220> time<00:03:08.460> is<00:03:08.640> 5

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
this yet I think the plant time is 5

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.900 
this yet I think the plant time is 5
seconds<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:10.070> diffuse<00:03:11.070> time<00:03:11.310> insurgent

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
seconds and the diffuse time insurgent

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.890 
seconds and the diffuse time insurgent
story<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.330> it's<00:03:12.450> seven<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> half

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
story I think it's seven and a half

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.900 
story I think it's seven and a half
which<00:03:13.830> really<00:03:14.070> threw<00:03:14.310> me<00:03:14.340> off<00:03:14.550> guard<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
which really threw me off guard the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.100 
which really threw me off guard the
first<00:03:15.090> couple<00:03:15.330> games<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.600> played<00:03:15.810> because<00:03:15.990> I

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
first couple games I played because I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.479 
first couple games I played because I
expected<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.770> five<00:03:17.010> like<00:03:17.280> previous

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
expected it to be five like previous

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.699 
expected it to be five like previous
Call<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.850> Duty's<00:03:18.180> but<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.050> definitely<00:03:19.200> not

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
Call of Duty's but it is definitely not

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.410 
Call of Duty's but it is definitely not
it's<00:03:19.950> much<00:03:20.130> longer<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.030> have<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.360> be

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
it's much longer so you have to be

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.610 
it's much longer so you have to be
prepared<00:03:21.630> for<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.050> when<00:03:22.230> you're<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.500> for

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
prepared for that when you're going for

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.050 
prepared for that when you're going for
the<00:03:22.650> diffuse<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:23.550> make<00:03:23.700> sure<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.030> use

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the diffuse and really make sure to use

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.940 
the diffuse and really make sure to use
good<00:03:24.480> time<00:03:24.750> management<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.380> don't<00:03:25.680> run

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
good time management so you don't run

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.570 
good time management so you don't run
out<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.160> time<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.459> defuse<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> little<00:03:29.430> bit

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
out of time to defuse it is a little bit

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.890 
out of time to defuse it is a little bit

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
kind of sucks I was worried going into

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.160 
kind of sucks I was worried going into
this<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.239> oh<00:03:45.300> really<00:03:45.660> we're<00:03:45.780> already<00:03:45.930> two

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
this that oh really we're already two

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.650 
this that oh really we're already two
down<00:03:46.380> we're<00:03:47.010> probably<00:03:47.459> gonna<00:03:47.820> lose<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.330> and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
down we're probably gonna lose this and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.540 
down we're probably gonna lose this and
that<00:03:48.900> means<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.590> I'm<00:03:49.830> gonna<00:03:50.010> take<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.250> loss

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
that means that I'm gonna take a loss

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.370 
that means that I'm gonna take a loss
for<00:03:50.880> something<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.660> was<00:03:51.780> already<00:03:52.019> half<00:03:52.170> over

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380

before<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.860> joined<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.700> there's<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.940> little<00:03:54.030> bit

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
before I joined so there's a little bit

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.820 
before I joined so there's a little bit
of<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.630> problem<00:03:54.870> i<00:03:55.080> hope<00:03:55.170> they<00:03:55.350> fix<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.709> later

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
of a problem i hope they fix that later

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.810 
of a problem i hope they fix that later
on<00:03:56.010> him<00:03:56.250> maybe<00:03:57.000> if<00:03:57.420> they<00:03:57.600> were<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:58.050> just<00:03:58.820> make

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
on him maybe if they were to just make

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.910 
on him maybe if they were to just make
it<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.060> people<00:04:00.110> had<00:04:01.110> an<00:04:01.260> incentive<00:04:01.709> not<00:04:01.739> to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
it so people had an incentive not to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.440 
it so people had an incentive not to
leave<00:04:02.280> like<00:04:02.610> if<00:04:02.700> they<00:04:02.790> were<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.000> get<00:04:03.120> punished

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
leave like if they were to get punished

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.540 
leave like if they were to get punished
if<00:04:03.570> they<00:04:03.690> did<00:04:03.870> leave<00:04:04.019> maybe<00:04:04.350> thinks<00:04:05.340> i'm<00:04:05.430> not

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
if they did leave maybe thinks i'm not

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.690 
if they did leave maybe thinks i'm not
sure<00:04:05.820> if<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.120> get<00:04:06.650> just<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.739> regular<00:04:07.920> loss<00:04:08.340> or

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
sure if you get just a regular loss or

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.100 
sure if you get just a regular loss or
what<00:04:08.940> but<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.420> should<00:04:09.510> give<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:09.690> maybe<00:04:09.870> like<00:04:10.050> a

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
what but it should give you maybe like a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.600 
what but it should give you maybe like a
loss<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.709> half<00:04:10.920> or<00:04:11.190> something<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.519> you

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
loss and a half or something if you

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.400 
loss and a half or something if you
leave<00:04:11.850> because<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.810> little<00:04:12.930> bit<00:04:13.050> lame<00:04:13.260> to

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
leave because it is a little bit lame to

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.039 
leave because it is a little bit lame to
have<00:04:13.500> people<00:04:13.739> joining<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.400> progress<00:04:15.049> and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.770 
but it seemed to be very unbalanced you
had<00:04:29.460> people<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.880> were<00:04:29.940> coming<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.389> that<00:04:30.540> were

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
had people that were coming in that were

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.290 
had people that were coming in that were
like<00:04:30.960> level<00:04:31.320> six<00:04:31.680> or<00:04:31.860> seven<00:04:32.190> I<00:04:32.280> think<00:04:32.310> they're

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
like level six or seven I think they're

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.879 
like level six or seven I think they're
coming<00:04:33.480> in<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:33.900> low<00:04:34.080> with<00:04:34.230> no<00:04:34.410> mics<00:04:34.650> they

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
coming in so low with no mics they

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.500 
coming in so low with no mics they
weren't<00:04:35.100> very<00:04:35.160> good<00:04:35.340> players<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:36.000> then<00:04:36.419> you

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
weren't very good players and then you

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.030 
weren't very good players and then you
were<00:04:36.600> also<00:04:36.930> going<00:04:37.110> up<00:04:37.290> against<00:04:37.680> people<00:04:38.010> who

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
were also going up against people who

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.640 
were also going up against people who
were<00:04:38.550> full<00:04:39.360> teams<00:04:39.600> of<00:04:39.780> four<00:04:40.020> like<00:04:40.290> second

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
were full teams of four like second

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.200 
were full teams of four like second
prestige<00:04:40.830> already<00:04:41.520> like<00:04:41.669> two<00:04:41.820> days<00:04:41.970> in<00:04:42.120> the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
prestige already like two days in the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.830 
prestige already like two days in the
game<00:04:42.389> and<00:04:43.820> would<00:04:44.820> just<00:04:45.030> trounce<00:04:45.419> pretty<00:04:45.750> much

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
game and would just trounce pretty much

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.860 
game and would just trounce pretty much
any<00:04:46.050> team<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.590> so<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:47.120> guess<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.300> solution<00:04:48.720> is

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
any team and so I guess the solution is

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.060 
any team and so I guess the solution is
you<00:04:49.169> just<00:04:49.350> want<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.530> have<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.680> better<00:04:49.830> team

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
you just want to have a better team

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.620 
you just want to have a better team
yourself<00:04:50.490> probably<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.090> know<00:04:51.120> go<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.510> with

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
yourself probably you know go in with

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.300 
yourself probably you know go in with
team<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.960> four<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.350> that<00:04:52.740> makes<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:53.070> so<00:04:53.190> you're

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
team of four and that makes it so you're

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.710 
team of four and that makes it so you're
going<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.490> lose<00:04:53.580> less<00:04:53.820> often<00:04:54.060> that's<00:04:54.480> pretty

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
going to lose less often that's pretty

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.659 
going to lose less often that's pretty
obvious<00:04:54.870> but<00:04:55.350> I<00:04:55.770> wish<00:04:55.980> there<00:04:56.220> was<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> way<00:04:56.639> for

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
obvious but I wish there was a way for

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.780 
obvious but I wish there was a way for
it<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.169> maybe<00:04:58.169> determine<00:04:58.710> based<00:04:58.830> on<00:04:59.040> skill<00:04:59.520> as

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
it to maybe determine based on skill as

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.400 
it to maybe determine based on skill as
well<00:05:00.270> when<00:05:00.540> you're<00:05:00.660> being<00:05:00.840> ranked<00:05:01.169> in<00:05:01.260> these

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
well when you're being ranked in these

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.290 
well when you're being ranked in these
because<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:02.310> can<00:05:02.490> get<00:05:02.700> kind<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:02.910> an<00:05:02.970> unlucky

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
because you can get kind of an unlucky

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.120 
because you can get kind of an unlucky
streak<00:05:03.600> or<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.960> lucky<00:05:04.350> streak<00:05:04.590> which<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.950> have

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
have a lucky streak it doesn't really

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.730

got lucky with the match and it felt

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.920 
got lucky with the match and it felt
somewhat<00:05:22.740> similar<00:05:23.010> when<00:05:23.130> we<00:05:23.220> lost<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.090> wish

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
somewhat similar when we lost so I wish

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
somewhat similar when we lost so I wish
that<00:05:25.110> there<00:05:25.169> was<00:05:25.290> more<00:05:25.350> skill<00:05:25.770> based

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
that there was more skill based

most of the grenades in this game are

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.500 
most of the grenades in this game are
very<00:05:43.470> bad<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.430> mean<00:05:44.700> you<00:05:45.150> have<00:05:45.240> to<00:05:45.300> have<00:05:45.419> your

very bad I mean you have to have your

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.850 
very bad I mean you have to have your
grenade<00:05:45.750> right<00:05:45.900> next<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.470> them<00:05:46.560> in<00:05:46.620> order<00:05:46.740> to

grenade right next to them in order to
get<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:46.979> kill<00:05:47.250> it<00:05:47.550> doesn't<00:05:48.210> do<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.390> lot<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.720> splash

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
get a kill it doesn't do a lot of splash

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.390 
get a kill it doesn't do a lot of splash
damage<00:05:49.229> or<00:05:49.410> anything<00:05:49.530> like<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:49.770> but<00:05:50.250> I<00:05:50.310> do

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
damage or anything like that but I do

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.830 
damage or anything like that but I do
feel<00:05:50.700> like<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.970> flash<00:05:51.150> grenades<00:05:51.539> since<00:05:51.750> you

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
feel like the flash grenades since you

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.779 
feel like the flash grenades since you
can<00:05:51.990> air<00:05:52.260> burst<00:05:52.470> them<00:05:52.650> are<00:05:52.800> very<00:05:53.220> very<00:05:53.490> useful

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
can air burst them are very very useful

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.040 
can air burst them are very very useful
so<00:05:54.120> definitely<00:05:54.419> take<00:05:54.479> advantage<00:05:54.570> of<00:05:54.900> those

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
so definitely take advantage of those

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.900 
so definitely take advantage of those
also<00:05:55.620> you<00:05:55.860> can<00:05:56.039> use<00:05:56.070> them<00:05:56.280> almost<00:05:56.430> as<00:05:56.639> little

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
also you can use them almost as little
