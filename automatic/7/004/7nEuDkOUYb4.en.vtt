00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.910
 hello friends a follower of my channel 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.890
 who lives in the united kingdom 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.410
 I asked to see if we could do the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.090
 of oatmeal with chocolate to please her 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.580
 today we are going to make some muffins 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.020
 chocolate regions let's start 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.720
 we will need the ingredients 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.590
 following the flour previously 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.990
 we have drawn chocolate pearls 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.829
 sunflower oil 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.650
 eggs 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.440
 sugar 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.140
 noooo 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 chemical yeast and a tablespoon 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.540
 of sugary vanilla 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.260
 first 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.260
 the eggs 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 and the sugar 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.369
 also the sugary drink 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.810
 we will start easy in slow motion 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.030
 now we will add the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.830
 the tapes is like oil 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.740
 and we will do it 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.689
 when you see that I have that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.280
 consistency like the little bubbles now 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.210
 we will add the chemical yeast 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.210
 to the flour 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.920
 and now if we put it in a couple or three 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.920
 of times 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.920
 stirring with a spatula 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 we add the rest of the day already with a 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.600
 manual beater has been better 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.410
 and now we will add 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.410
 chocolate legs 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.720
 we will continue doing 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.800
 now we have spent the mixture 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.640
 in a pastry bag 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.250
 and we will make the molds and I put 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.750
 like it's paper inside a mold 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.069
 silicone 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.249
 this is why 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.629
 do not expand and sugar up if you do not 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.920
 you have it, nothing happens, you can 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.920
 use only paper 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.410
 good and now we have reserved a little 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.610
 of chocolate pearls that we will put 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.610
 a few above 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.430
 ace 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.970
 we only need to put them in the oven 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.710
 180 degrees 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.710
 for not up and down 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:58.170
 of the stick 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.170
 it comes out clean we have our candles 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.340
 good friends here we have the cupcakes 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.519
 or chocolate shopping muffins 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.739

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.739
