00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.950

 to help a crashed motorcyclist 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.020
 we had time to stabilize the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.970

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.689

 less pain condition and transport 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 minutes until the ambulance arrives in this 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.850

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 vehicles arrive on average 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.369
 it takes a little more than eight minutes to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 get to the accident site 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.340
 now 16 bikes to cover the entire 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.360
 S達o Paulo and 32 men who take 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.399

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.950
 each bike has a different equipment 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.590

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.210

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.690
 ae 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.660
 he arrived fast at the beat site the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.640
 car is over the entrance to a store 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.590
 furniture and a lamp post 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.260
 the driver was aware without 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.660
 injuries but the pressure was there in 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.360
 heights and lowering the Antarctic village and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.730
 He gave a blackout disappeared and then think 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.680
 total pressure 17 by 12 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.270
 although the damage has been great not 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.420
 generated no victim now to return to the 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.910
 base hope that nothing else happens 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.050
 with the bikes they use the work a lot 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.610
 of firefighters as we have seen but still 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.550
 so their average speed in the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.010
 congested traffic is only 34 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.350
 miles per hour ana paula and boy 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.520
 Even the bikes can not ride faster. 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.150
 in this congestion in s達o paulo 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.150
