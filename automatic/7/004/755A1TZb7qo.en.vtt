00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 need everyone guys here would be called 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 come here on my second channel or 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.340
 john and games for an unboxing indeed 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.469
 I think this is my first video 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.200
 unboxing on the second channel anyway 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.490
 just talk and we do say 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 what is today's task ie 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.619
 see together tichitt octane siem storm 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.570
 then cooler master this video 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.820
 boys consists of two components 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.500
 first the keyboard that looks like 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 be really very crap and that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.230
 we will see shortly is obviously 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.330
 even a mouse 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.579
 think that the mouse apparently 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.480
 let's say he has a life cycle of 10 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.760
 millions of clicks 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.790
 let's see if you have lighting 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.710
 as well as the keyboard and the three different ones 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.719
 there are even 7 illuminations I see 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 the red one the blue the green the yellow 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.260
 therefore different colors that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 will therefore make our desk a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.250
 nice little tamarra and it never hurts and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.379
 above all we also see a little 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 keyboard yes the layout is Italian e 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.760
 what I was checking and for 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.410
 rest should be there then oh well I think 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.719
 different 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 let's say dedicated multimedia keys e 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.619
 little things like that we're going to do 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.750
 today and mostly a simple unboxing 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.640
 to show you the keyboard since they are 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 sure that many of you could 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.060
 interesting I hope that everything is 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.530
 simple because the boys assure you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 that in the position in which they are re 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 moment could all fall from one 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.290
 moment to another particular the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 microphone that you don't see now 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.490
 and here we are what we find ourselves 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.180
 in front we immediately find the keyboard and the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.549
 mouse 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.619
 so we can see them immediately 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 We also begin to take off a little 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.579
 let's say all the kids really cables 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.439
 very difficult for me 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.710
 and here our mouse are 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.380
 obviously protected by some stuff 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.570
 and here he is guys this really is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.000
 cazzutissimo maybe I'll show you 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.460
 a little more closely with the hope that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.159
 enlightenment does its duty and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.420
 this as you can see is a joe 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.380
 there seems to me like the band of 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.000
 transformers 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.490
 that I know bubble bo something like that 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.649
 and guys think these two eyes 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.329
 then they will light up once they do 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.490
 obviously you will have connected the mouse to the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.840
 pc let's now pass the keyboard 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.210
 let's see what else the company is there 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.750
 no I don't think there is anything else 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.670
 guys instead there is the manual of so 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.690
 Quick start even if I don't think we could 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.519
 define it as such 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.920
 however it goes well we are explained 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.349
 again the features let's say of 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.110
 these two products therefore we advance and 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.060
 here our keyboard looks like 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.400
 be really fuckin 'guys 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.900
 miseriaccia slut if it is a zoe Ã¨ purpose 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.610
 yet there are 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.680
 The boys then this keyboard is 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.420
 seems to be really very very cool 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.069
 as I said before there are also gods 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.870
 multimedia keys that are in fact 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.849
 these here to make a real one 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.650
 review I should try it for a while longer 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.519
 of time therefore these are mine 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.519
 impressions 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.590
 so it feels like the material 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.150
 the bar is really very good 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.560
 spacer I do n't know why 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.569
 seems to be a little bigger than 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.040
 usually and I believe that could do 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.019
 comfortable then there is a rather fact 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.849
 detail used for the keys 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.370
 let's see if I can show you in 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.140
 somehow I obviously believe that this 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.879
 it will not be possible and in any case me 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.519
 really like them so we say these 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.170
 aesthetic features on the side 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.970
 I don't know if you can even notice that 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.549
 show a little more closely there are 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.470
 let's say jagged edges say so 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.480
 we want to define them and therefore everything 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.940
 let's say a keyboard much more 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.340
 there are also futuristic behind 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.470
 obviously the worries they allow us 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.170
 to keep the keyboard higher 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.959
 finally guys I connected the mouse 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.120
 to the computer and watch that cool 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.569
 I don't think I need to add anything else 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.220
 because it's something absolutely epic 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.230
 really hit me big in the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.090
 beautiful then give the devil for 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.340
 itself also the actual touch to the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.989
 mouse is really not bad at all so 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.150
 even the wheel looks pretty good 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.980
 reliable i'm more used to if not 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.870
 mistake the king with you should be the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.579
 mouse derartu of the master or better of the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.620
 d series is in store that I own 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.389
 so I'll have to get used to it, though 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.340
 anyway it really looks pretty good 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.260
 now we live the keyboard and here it is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.910
 my friends as you can see a lot 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.709
 pussy and if I'm not wrong you can 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.569
 also change colors quickly 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.859
 there should be a rate and here it is more 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.700
 I found the boys believed in the 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.590
 network 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.170
 however it is this peak but you see the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.569
 colorings if I can enter 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.819
 in the frame they are different then 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.680
 we have a green then what is a 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.930
 purplish or something like that are a bit 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.340
 colorblind is therefore not that it succeeds in 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.290
 distinguish this beautiful colors 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.090
 it should be a mystery but maybe 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.500
 correct me you trust me more than you 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.110
 which of course my view is 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.540
 blue that comes out recognize it is now direct 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.340
 a joseph gain was blue blue cross not 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.470
 I'm from tonic on these colors anyway 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.270
 apart from these bullshit guys it seems to me 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.090
 a really good keyboard especially 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.680
 for the price that is around 50 euros 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.840
 however, count in the package 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.490
 also included the mouse I have there 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.650
 shown earlier that turns into 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.820
 it will really transform an ethical thing 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.979
 I look forward to using this 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.750
 new top ten kit on my new computer 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.250
 from gaming that I've taken over 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.500
 computer and thank you of course 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.360
 because it has also honored this kit 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.860
 the preferred ones are more than positive for the 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.840
 mouse and keyboard saw their 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.610
 price so I'll let you know maybe more 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.590
 in detail in the future how I find myself 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.300
 since we will have to say let us do some 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.889
 plus a real gazzoli experience i hope 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.360
 this video you enjoyed I remember 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.740
 to leave even a like and 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.240
 subscribe to the channel if you don't have it 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.630
 still I leave here in the boys at 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.960
 next 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.960
 Hello
