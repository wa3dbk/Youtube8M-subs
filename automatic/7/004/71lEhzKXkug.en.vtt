00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.399
 they hello how are you greetings for 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.399
 all of me 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.559
 I hope you are super well and I hope 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.720
 also like this video because 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.550
 Many of you have asked me 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.890
 because I have one higher than the other 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.780
 and how do I do it to make up for 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.390
 that look a little bit more couples 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.530
 even and similar that can be ok 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.680
 before I start I want you to remember 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.419
 that I have a video of how to make my 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.520
 eyebrows I made here I leave the image 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.820
 to click and take them to the 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.710
 video link but I also want 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.920
 tell them that in that video I tell them a 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.070
 little bit about the eyebrows that the eyebrows 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.010
 says they are more non-twin sisters for 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.860
 so it is impossible that we have the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.660
 identical eyebrows very similar and yes 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.570
 but there may be cases like mine that 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.340
 the difference is not so light so 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.739
 I am going to tell you what I have done 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.270
 during this time to match the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.100
 but also before I start I want 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.440
 tell them what happened to them months 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.020
 when I was about four years old 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.210
 with my cousin and we were playing with a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.880
 horn that has as a square base 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 and very sharp then on that basis came 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.220
 the horn thing is I get up and I 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.490
 it hurt the eyebrow is this scar that 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.260
 I have as of here until here which already 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.530
 I did not grow back vellitos ni 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.000
 nothing then made my eyebrows do not 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.910
 I imagine that I have some nerve or 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.040
 Something like that would not look much more 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.810
 raised this was the one that had a lot 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.980
 very much raised but good as 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.650
 I was really small, I did not 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.050
 mattered over the years as 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.760
 also already know is very concerned that 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.590
 until that I have been lucky that they are only 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.440
 two scars on my eyebrows because I 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.050
 it was falling down me and hurting me but 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.750
 good going back to the topic this was the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.210
 second scar that I have was 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.650
 running around playing soccer I slipped and I 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.800
 I hit the sidewalk 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.870
 the thing is that he made my party like 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.300
 that looked a little more down 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.240
 and my eyebrow then more down then 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.910
 if it was like that very marked this is 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.680
 He ate very high and is very low when 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.050
 I started with this from the videos was when 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.240
 I realized and I began to notice a lot 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.000
 the difference of my eyebrows then 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 I decided to do this in the dry where I have 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 the scar on the eyelid 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.650
 what I do is depilate on the part of 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.830
 down my brow with this I get my 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.770
 eyelid looks wider and my eyebrows are 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.620
 see more raised since it is what you see 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.990
 below and at the time of makeup 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.600
 applied the shadow by the top 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.050
 to get even more effect of the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.050
 eyebrow raised 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.420
 unlike the dry where I have the 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:52.000
 scar that crosses my entire eyebrow and the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.069
 which looks more raised what I do is 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.590
 depilate at the top to 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.049
 get it to look down already the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.560
 time to apply makeup what 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.439
 I do is apply it from the bottom 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.980
 obviously opposed to what I did with my 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.980
 another eyebrow 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.100
 the thing is that if they realize in my 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.160
 Previous videos have improved a lot and 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.530
 already notice much more couples 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.870
 I really did it daring I did not go with 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.550
 someone who is specialize my eyebrows already 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.110
 that is not the same as what I tell them 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.450
 what are the points that should 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.320
 continue to make up your eyebrows here you 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.270
 they measure you put templates they put 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.540
 as well as what balanced if you start 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.870
 I did not do it alone because 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.760
 I'm so daring but if you have 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.360
 this problem well I recommend that you 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.760
 go with someone specialized in eyebrows 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.459
 well that's what happened to my saga 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.140
 I wanted to share them and also I do not know 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.910
 lose the video of how the maquillo 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.800
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.540

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.069
