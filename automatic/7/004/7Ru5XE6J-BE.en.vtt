themselves<00:01:08.700> against<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> supernatural<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
themselves against the supernatural so I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
themselves against the supernatural so I
guess<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.490> kids<00:01:11.700> wrap<00:01:12.000> themselves<00:01:12.270> in
