Hatter<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.609> duck<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.390> today<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> wanted<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
Hatter if duck on and today I wanted to

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.220 
Hatter if duck on and today I wanted to
take<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> look<00:00:22.769> at<00:00:22.949> pH<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.660> saltwater

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
take a look at pH and the saltwater

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.029 
take a look at pH and the saltwater
aquarium<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.430> very<00:00:27.140> complex<00:00:28.140> subject<00:00:28.619> as

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
aquarium it's a very complex subject as

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
aquarium it's a very complex subject as
far<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.340> saltwater<00:00:29.670> aquariums<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:31.050> I'm

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
far as saltwater aquariums go but I'm

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
far as saltwater aquariums go but I'm
going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.380> show<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> some<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> things

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
going to show you some of the things

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.610 
going to show you some of the things
that<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.910> test<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:34.200> pH<00:00:34.469> my

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
that I do when I test for my pH my

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
that I do when I test for my pH my
aquariums

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.740 

all<00:00:49.750> right<00:00:49.900> so<00:00:50.050> I'm<00:00:50.110> going<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.320> do<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:51.720> pH<00:00:52.720> test

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
all right so I'm going to do a pH test

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.430 
all right so I'm going to do a pH test
on<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:54.100> Nano<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:55.660> going<00:00:55.840> to<00:00:55.900> take<00:00:56.050> some<00:00:56.230> water

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
on the Nano I'm going to take some water

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.020 
on the Nano I'm going to take some water
from<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.710> top<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.190> aquarium<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.760> from

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
from the top of the aquarium and from

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
from the top of the aquarium and from
the<00:00:58.120> bottom<00:00:58.770> using<00:00:59.770> the<00:01:00.460> ultimate<00:01:00.820> reef<00:01:01.150> tool

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the bottom using the ultimate reef tool

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.490 
the bottom using the ultimate reef tool
turkey<00:01:03.430> baster<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.269> we'll<00:01:05.050> see<00:01:05.229> how<00:01:05.350> we're

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
turkey baster and we'll see how we're

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
turkey baster and we'll see how we're
doing

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.990 

I'm<00:01:13.720> going<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.020> do<00:01:14.110> one<00:01:14.320> from<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.530> top<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.130> don't

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
I'm going to do one from the top I don't

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480 
I'm going to do one from the top I don't
suspect<00:01:16.330> where<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:17.289> is<00:01:17.740> only<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.039> five<00:01:18.310> gallon

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
suspect where this is only a five gallon

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.359 
suspect where this is only a five gallon
aquarium<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.119> there's<00:01:19.300> going<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.479> be<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:19.660> huge

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
aquarium that there's going to be a huge

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:29.940 
aquarium that there's going to be a huge
difference<00:01:21.369> in<00:01:23.160> pH<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:28.119> worth<00:01:28.950> for

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
difference in pH but it's worth for

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.810 
difference in pH but it's worth for
conversation<00:01:30.610> sake<00:01:31.410> one<00:01:32.410> two<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:35.399> four<00:01:36.399> and

between<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.230> 7.8<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.490> 8.0<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.440> test

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
between the 7.8 in the 8.0 on the test

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.970 
between the 7.8 in the 8.0 on the test
the<00:02:29.330> top<00:02:29.570> water<00:02:29.810> sample<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> little<00:02:30.890> bit

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the top water sample is a little bit

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.070 
the top water sample is a little bit
lighter<00:02:31.190> than<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.670> bottom<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.990> aquarium

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
lighter than the bottom of the aquarium

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.270 
lighter than the bottom of the aquarium
sample<00:02:34.210> but<00:02:35.210> in<00:02:35.480> any<00:02:35.960> case<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:37.040> know<00:02:37.160> I'm

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
sample but in any case you know I'm

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.000 
sample but in any case you know I'm
definitely<00:02:37.870> outside<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.140> range<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.830> I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
definitely outside of the range that I

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.770 
definitely outside of the range that I
would<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.520> be<00:02:40.700> for<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.420> saltwater

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
would like to be for a saltwater

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.710 
would like to be for a saltwater
aquarium<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.700> there's<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.790> lot<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.360> different

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
aquarium and there's a lot of different

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.110 
aquarium and there's a lot of different
ways<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:45.860> can<00:02:45.950> go<00:02:46.160> about<00:02:46.310> correcting

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
ways that you can go about correcting

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:07.920 
ways that you can go about correcting
this
