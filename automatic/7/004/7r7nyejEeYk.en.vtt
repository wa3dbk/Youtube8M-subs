knife<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> box<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.869> comes<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.349> built

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
knife that the box that comes in built

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.659 
looks of the 0 560 but a couldn't afford
it<00:04:37.979> because<00:04:38.100> this<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.550> cheaper<00:04:39.030> or<00:04:39.210> B<00:04:40.669> you

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
it because this is cheaper or B you

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.700 
it because this is cheaper or B you
didn't<00:04:41.850> want<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.060> size<00:04:42.270> which<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:42.840> mean<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.200> lot

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
didn't want the size which I mean a lot

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.260 
didn't want the size which I mean a lot
of<00:04:43.860> people<00:04:44.100> like<00:04:44.250> smaller<00:04:44.520> nitrate<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:44.970> see

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
of people like smaller nitrate you see

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.860 
of people like smaller nitrate you see
so<00:04:45.570> this<00:04:46.200> is<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:47.030> excuse<00:04:48.030> me<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.660> is

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
so this is a excuse me this is

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.140 
so this is a excuse me this is
definitely<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.470> better<00:04:50.100> more<00:04:50.400> practical

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
definitely a better more practical

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.880 
definitely a better more practical

Max got black wash and this isn't

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.279 
Max got black wash and this isn't
titanium<00:05:21.340> that's<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:21.970> only<00:05:22.150> problem<00:05:22.300> but<00:05:23.050> to

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
titanium that's the only problem but to

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.499 
titanium that's the only problem but to
keep<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.590> price<00:05:23.889> lower<00:05:24.220> which<00:05:25.150> isn't<00:05:25.330> that

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
keep that price lower which isn't that

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.290 
keep that price lower which isn't that
much<00:05:25.780> lower<00:05:25.990> right<00:05:26.380> now<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:27.280> can<00:05:27.430> get<00:05:29.729> 0-5<00:05:30.729> 60s

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
much lower right now you can get 0-5 60s

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.480 
much lower right now you can get 0-5 60s
for<00:05:31.539> 200<00:05:32.080> bucks<00:05:32.259> on<00:05:32.530> Amazon<00:05:33.039> I<00:05:33.220> know<00:05:33.280> there

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
for 200 bucks on Amazon I know there

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.589 
for 200 bucks on Amazon I know there
used<00:05:33.639> to<00:05:33.759> be<00:05:33.819> more<00:05:34.150> but<00:05:34.960> this<00:05:35.860> is<00:05:35.919> only<00:05:36.300> $144<00:05:37.300> so

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
used to be more but this is only $144 so

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.360 
used to be more but this is only $144 so
it's<00:05:37.720> only<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.930> $50<00:05:38.319> price<00:05:38.650> point<00:05:38.919> but<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.310> mean

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
it's only a $50 price point but I mean

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.249 
it's only a $50 price point but I mean
guess<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.270> is<00:05:40.389> a<00:05:40.419> lot<00:05:40.659> of<00:05:40.780> money<00:05:40.900> it's<00:05:41.139> not

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
guess that is a lot of money it's not

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.839 
guess that is a lot of money it's not
that<00:05:41.560> much<00:05:41.770> smaller<00:05:42.159> but<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.490> doesn't<00:05:42.729> have

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
that much smaller but it doesn't have

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.240 
that much smaller but it doesn't have
that<00:05:42.909> titanium<00:05:43.360> either<00:05:44.849> so<00:05:45.849> and<00:05:46.949> big<00:05:47.949> thing

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
that titanium either so and big thing

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.480 
that titanium either so and big thing
this<00:05:48.490> knife<00:05:48.729> is<00:05:49.740> assisted<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:51.009> said<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.400> the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
this knife is assisted and said to the

this knife is assisted and said to the
bearings<00:05:52.000> at<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.419> zero<00:05:52.930> 560<00:05:53.500> ran<00:05:53.680> on<00:05:53.880> PC<00:05:54.880> and

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
bearings at the zero 560 ran on PC and

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.999 
bearings at the zero 560 ran on PC and
says<00:05:55.419> no<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:55.960> doesn't<00:05:56.229> say<00:05:56.289> speed<00:05:56.560> safe<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:56.919> the

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
says no it doesn't say speed safe on the

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.580 
says no it doesn't say speed safe on the
knife<00:05:57.190> but<00:05:57.930> so<00:05:58.930> that's<00:05:59.080> one<00:05:59.259> thing<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.500> can

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590

knife but so that's one thing you can
see<00:05:59.919> right<00:06:00.069> here<00:06:00.419> there<00:06:01.419> is<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.720> resistance

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
see right here there is the resistance

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.499 
see right here there is the resistance
to<00:06:02.380> close<00:06:02.770> you<00:06:03.099> can<00:06:03.250> do<00:06:03.430> cyst<00:06:03.729> it<00:06:03.880> it<00:06:04.090> does<00:06:04.300> have

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
to close you can do cyst it it does have

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:10.230 
to close you can do cyst it it does have
a<00:06:04.539> a<00:06:06.599> d-10<00:06:07.599> role<00:06:07.889> so<00:06:08.889> you<00:06:08.919> can<00:06:09.310> de<00:06:09.580> assist<00:06:09.940> it<00:06:10.120> if
