 we have lost another opportunity as human beings and have to read everything 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.070
 this time because I don't have to forget anything so we lost a 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.690
 opportunity to change the vivisection law 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.860
 choosing to walk the path of civilization of dignity for protection 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.970
 of rights 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.930
 of our animals but also of our own rights is our health

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.280
 with vivisection 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.970

 top 100 million animals tell us a beautiful fairy tale there is that 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.250
 vivisection is useful for scientific progress but the truth why a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.990
 favor of vivisection, there are only simple weak economic joys 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.520

 yes yes chemical going even in our health this is one thing 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 important that very often we don't know 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 we are not cats carnia birds god how beautiful I do not feel so

 and tested on the animals medications you stay with us 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.159
 it has no scientific value because every species possesses

 a different DNA a topina 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.880
 a different physiology and biochemistry for which the final data does not 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.280
 can be transferred from a species

 expressed in irreversible damage to human beings this vivisection serves 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.830
 especially to increase the revenues of pharmaceutical companies what is the year

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.310
