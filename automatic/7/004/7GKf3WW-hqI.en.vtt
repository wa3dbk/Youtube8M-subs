716<00:01:07.890> um<00:01:09.080> acrylics<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.380> don't<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.220> want<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
716 um acrylics I don't really want to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
716 um acrylics I don't really want to
stretch<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.850> acrylics<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.780> ears<00:01:13.020> I've

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
stretch with acrylics but my ears I've

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
stretch with acrylics but my ears I've
had<00:01:13.740> double<00:01:14.040> zero<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.790> while<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.720> I'll

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
had double zero in for a while so I'll

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
had double zero in for a while so I'll
link<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.680> ear<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:16.920> I've<00:01:17.310> never<00:01:17.460> reacted<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
link my ear like I've never reacted to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240 
link my ear like I've never reacted to
acrylic<00:01:18.479> anyway<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.350> should<00:01:19.890> probably<00:01:19.920> be

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
acrylic anyway so I should probably be

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
acrylic anyway so I should probably be
fine<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.710> if<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> watch<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.040> videos<00:01:23.189> before

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
fine so if you watch my videos before

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.020 
fine so if you watch my videos before
you<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> left<00:01:24.420> here's<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.750> Battier<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
you know I left here's my Battier so
we're<00:01:27.030> gonna<00:01:27.119> start<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:28.200> right<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
we're gonna start there all right I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.460 
we're gonna start there all right I
don't<00:01:29.009> want<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> hold<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.549> off<00:01:29.820> too<00:01:30.060> much<00:01:30.470> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
don't want to hold this off too much it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.069 
don't want to hold this off too much it
might<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> little<00:01:31.979> red<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.659> put<00:01:33.900> some

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
might be a little red because I put some

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.569 
might be a little red because I put some
tape<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.619> couple<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.860> days<00:01:34.979> ago<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> I'm

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
tape on it a couple of days ago and I'm

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.749 
tape on it a couple of days ago and I'm
in<00:01:35.759> swim<00:01:36.060> class<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:37.130> yeah<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.369> irritates

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
in swim class and yeah it just irritates

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.899 
in swim class and yeah it just irritates
my<00:01:39.119> ear<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.450> bit<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:43.670> no<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> actually

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
my ear a little bit but no I actually

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
my ear a little bit but no I actually
find<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> easier<00:01:45.659> sometimes<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.350> like

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
find it easier sometimes to just like

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
find it easier sometimes to just like
push<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> through<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> front<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
push it through the front because the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.380 
push it through the front because the
tape<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> made<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> floor<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.890> big<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> have

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
tape is made the floor so big so have

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.810
