 nl company started 12 years 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.900
 back the decision to create it was given to us not 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.689
 just the country was a crisis people did not want 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.480
 believes in nothing was enough 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.970
 communication experience and money to create such 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.340
 global project all we had 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.890
 it's a great desire to create 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.829
 really strong company with us 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.710
 There was a strong friendship and principles that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.540
 we would not change for any money 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.110
 the company was born hard but with a big 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 love and now 12 years later when

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.640
 could dream i still believe that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.920
 those principles that we laid when 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 creating a company is the most important thing 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.730
 crucial role 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.820

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.759
 really need a panel for people 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.180

 the whole company develops when we

 mercedes and finally the most important thing when 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.430
 we started the company there was not one 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.219
 man then appeared first second 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.799
 their third was a bit and they didn't have 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:13.560
 reasons to trust us we did not do 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.229
 at that time there was not a single story 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.930
 success that could be proud of and 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.030

 today these people came to en el 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.590
 and it took place not 510 people 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.889

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.050

 because the whole system works for him 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.639
 en el about which I already spoke 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.009

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.349
