discussing with him entry points that

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.980 
discussing with him entry points that
stuff<00:00:17.800> into<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:18.070> market<00:00:18.430> but<00:00:18.610> the<00:00:18.840> thing<00:00:19.840> that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
stuff into the market but the thing that

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.480 
stuff into the market but the thing that
came<00:00:20.170> across<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.650> most<00:00:20.800> were<00:00:21.130> somehow

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
came across the most were somehow

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.900 
came across the most were somehow
jumping<00:00:22.060> he<00:00:22.180> was<00:00:22.360> and<00:00:22.770> I<00:00:23.770> said<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.670> him<00:00:24.789> well

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
jumping he was and I said to him well

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.330 
jumping he was and I said to him well
you<00:00:25.000> know<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.180> markets<00:00:25.510> bullying<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.250> he

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
you know the markets bullying it and he

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.939 
you know the markets bullying it and he
said<00:00:27.520> well<00:00:27.550> what<00:00:27.760> does<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:27.939> mean<00:00:28.060> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
said well what does that mean and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.750 
said well what does that mean and
basically<00:00:29.949> what<00:00:30.189> I<00:00:30.220> was<00:00:30.340> trying<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.580> say<00:00:30.699> it

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
basically what I was trying to say it

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.330 
basically what I was trying to say it
was<00:00:31.140> very<00:00:32.140> often<00:00:32.379> people<00:00:32.500> can<00:00:32.739> pick<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.070> right

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
was very often people can pick the right

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.390 
was very often people can pick the right
point<00:00:33.970> to<00:00:34.300> get<00:00:34.449> involved<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.960> market<00:00:35.400> and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
point to get involved in the market and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.850 
point to get involved in the market and
you<00:00:37.000> know<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.330> is<00:00:37.839> probably<00:00:38.199> a<00:00:38.500> net<00:00:38.710> positive

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
you know that is probably a net positive

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.100 
you know that is probably a net positive
position<00:00:39.280> they've<00:00:39.729> got<00:00:39.909> but<00:00:40.030> they<00:00:40.180> have<00:00:40.930> this

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
position they've got but they have this

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.619 
position they've got but they have this
amazing<00:00:41.409> propensity<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.460> create<00:00:43.150> a<00:00:43.180> loss<00:00:43.449> out

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
amazing propensity to create a loss out

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.719 
amazing propensity to create a loss out
of<00:00:43.780> that<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.199> it's<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.040> way<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.430> market

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
of that and it's the way that the market

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.509 
of that and it's the way that the market
works<00:00:45.909> that<00:00:46.449> does<00:00:46.629> that<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.199> it's<00:00:48.010> typically

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
works that does that so it's typically

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.039 
works that does that so it's typically
pretty<00:00:48.879> rare<00:00:49.210> for<00:00:49.239> you<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.659> open<00:00:49.839> a<00:00:49.930> position

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
pretty rare for you to open a position

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.710 
pretty rare for you to open a position
and<00:00:50.379> for<00:00:50.589> it<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.739> go<00:00:50.830> permanently<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.600> the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
and for it to go permanently in the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.360 
and for it to go permanently in the
direction<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.170> which<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.440> wish<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:54.250> know

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
direction in which you wish you know

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.049 
direction in which you wish you know
that's<00:00:54.610> not<00:00:55.650> impossible<00:00:56.650> but<00:00:57.100> it's<00:00:57.280> just<00:00:57.580> you

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
that's not impossible but it's just you

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.479 
that's not impossible but it's just you
know<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:59.260> it's<00:00:59.559> not<00:00:59.619> particularly<00:01:00.070> common

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
know it's it's not particularly common

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.549 
know it's it's not particularly common
and<00:01:01.420> what<00:01:01.540> tends<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.809> happen<00:01:01.869> is<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.229> market

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
and what tends to happen is the market

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.079 
and what tends to happen is the market
starts<00:01:03.040> moving<00:01:03.339> your<00:01:03.430> direction<00:01:03.640> pulls<00:01:03.940> back

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
starts moving your direction pulls back

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.369 
starts moving your direction pulls back
a<00:01:04.150> bit<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.420> then<00:01:04.570> goes<00:01:04.750> in<00:01:04.930> your<00:01:05.019> direction

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
a bit and then goes in your direction

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.080 
a bit and then goes in your direction
again<00:01:05.560> pulls<00:01:05.770> back<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.010> bit<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.369> then<00:01:06.549> you<00:01:06.760> know

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
again pulls back a bit and then you know

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.399 
again pulls back a bit and then you know
so<00:01:07.240> it's<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.450> jagged<00:01:07.810> line<00:01:07.840> it's<00:01:08.229> not<00:01:08.380> a

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
so it's a jagged line it's not a

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.160 
so it's a jagged line it's not a
straight<00:01:08.710> line<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:09.100> don't<00:01:09.250> sort<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.789> know

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
straight line you don't sort of you know

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.630 
straight line you don't sort of you know
see<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.289> market<00:01:11.649> you<00:01:12.039> click<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.340> button<00:01:12.549> and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
see the market you click the button and

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.800 
see the market you click the button and
then<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.820> market<00:01:13.060> does<00:01:13.180> exactly<00:01:13.600> what<00:01:13.719> you

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
then the market does exactly what you

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.080 
then the market does exactly what you
want<00:01:14.219> so<00:01:15.219> I<00:01:15.250> said<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.490> me<00:01:15.609> oh<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.759> market<00:01:16.030> is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
want so I said to me oh the market is

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.330 
want so I said to me oh the market is
bullying<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.719> you<00:01:17.530> know<00:01:17.649> whipsawing<00:01:18.130> in

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
bullying you and you know whipsawing in

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.740 
bullying you and you know whipsawing in
the<00:01:18.399> market<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:18.820> quite<00:01:19.060> common<00:01:19.359> in<00:01:19.509> all

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
the market is quite common in all

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.190 
the market is quite common in all
markets<00:01:20.399> but<00:01:21.399> it's<00:01:22.270> your<00:01:22.539> ability<00:01:22.780> to

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
markets but it's your ability to

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.429 
markets but it's your ability to
tolerate<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:24.240> pullback<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:26.109> often<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
tolerate a pullback that is often the

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.029 
tolerate a pullback that is often the
key<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.829> a<00:01:27.100> successfully<00:01:27.820> positive<00:01:28.420> trade<00:01:29.039> so

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
key to a successfully positive trade so

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.190 
key to a successfully positive trade so
one<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.659> issues<00:01:31.659> they<00:01:31.810> have<00:01:31.960> there<00:01:32.109> is

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
one of the issues they have there is

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.440 
one of the issues they have there is
time<00:01:32.439> if<00:01:32.649> you've<00:01:32.740> got<00:01:32.859> 30<00:01:33.100> seconds<00:01:33.520> left<00:01:33.700> then

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
time if you've got 30 seconds left then

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.840 
time if you've got 30 seconds left then
your<00:01:34.920> profits<00:01:35.920> will<00:01:35.979> be<00:01:36.100> small<00:01:36.399> but<00:01:36.579> so<00:01:36.729> will

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
your profits will be small but so will

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.090 
your profits will be small but so will
your<00:01:36.969> losses<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.560> basically<00:01:38.859> you're<00:01:39.039> looking

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
your losses so basically you're looking

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.709 
your losses so basically you're looking
for<00:01:39.310> must<00:01:39.460> big<00:01:39.640> run-up<00:01:39.820> with<00:01:40.060> 30<00:01:40.270> seconds<00:01:40.659> to

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
for must big run-up with 30 seconds to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.980 
for must big run-up with 30 seconds to
go<00:01:40.899> you're<00:01:41.619> probably<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:42.219> going<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.520> get<00:01:42.729> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
go you're probably not going to get it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.109 
go you're probably not going to get it
but<00:01:43.990> likewise<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.619> know<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.369> propensity<00:01:45.850> for

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
but likewise you know the propensity for

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.700 
but likewise you know the propensity for
the<00:01:46.329> price<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.719> move<00:01:46.899> dramatically<00:01:47.439> against

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
the price to move dramatically against

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.620 
the price to move dramatically against
your<00:01:47.829> property<00:01:48.100> isn't<00:01:48.219> so<00:01:48.429> much<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:49.479> if<00:01:49.539> you

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
your property isn't so much but if you

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
your property isn't so much but if you
extend<00:01:49.990> over<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.229> much<00:01:50.380> longer<00:01:50.710> time<00:01:50.859> period

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
extend over a much longer time period

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.520 
extend over a much longer time period
and<00:01:52.479> then<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.719> chance<00:01:52.929> of<00:01:53.049> getting<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.380> really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and then the chance of getting a really

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.349 
and then the chance of getting a really
really<00:01:53.799> good<00:01:53.950> trade<00:01:54.219> now<00:01:54.609> increases<00:01:55.240> because

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
really good trade now increases because

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.630 
really good trade now increases because
obviously<00:01:55.569> it<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:55.929> go<00:01:56.049> much<00:01:56.229> further<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.490> of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
obviously it can go much further but of

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.139 
obviously it can go much further but of
course<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.630> know<00:01:58.749> on<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.350> run<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.969> price

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
course you know on that run the price

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.669 
course you know on that run the price
was<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:01.479> exact<00:02:01.749> around<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.170> little<00:02:02.259> bit<00:02:02.469> and

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
was the exact around a little bit and

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.370 
was the exact around a little bit and
the<00:02:03.340> problem<00:02:03.609> is<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:03.969> that<00:02:03.999> you<00:02:04.780> find<00:02:05.049> yourself

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the problem is is that you find yourself

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.230 
the problem is is that you find yourself
getting<00:02:05.499> into<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.889> situation<00:02:06.520> where<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.939> move

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
getting into the situation where a move

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.389 
getting into the situation where a move
in<00:02:07.450> your<00:02:07.569> favor<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.990> see<00:02:08.259> as<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.380> positive<00:02:08.619> and

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
in your favor you see as a positive and

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.980 
in your favor you see as a positive and
I<00:02:09.460> move<00:02:09.640> against<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.300> see<00:02:10.479> as<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.600> negative

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
I move against you you see as a negative

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.559 
I move against you you see as a negative
and<00:02:11.710> one<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> issues<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.940> that

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
and one of the issues with that is that

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.140 
and one of the issues with that is that
you'll<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:15.090> constant

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
you'll have this constant

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.699 
you'll have this constant
flipping<00:02:16.540> mindset<00:02:16.959> especially<00:02:17.049> clicking<00:02:17.650> on

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
flipping mindset especially clicking on

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.160 
flipping mindset especially clicking on
very<00:02:17.920> short<00:02:18.129> timescales<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.900> you're<00:02:19.989> sort<00:02:20.079> of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
very short timescales so you're sort of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.300 
very short timescales so you're sort of
thing<00:02:20.290> at<00:02:20.379> all<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> good<00:02:20.920> trade<00:02:21.099> no<00:02:21.250> it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
thing at all this is a good trade no it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.220 
thing at all this is a good trade no it
isn't<00:02:21.489> yes<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.760> notice<00:02:22.150> as<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.659> and<00:02:23.140> it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
isn't yes it is notice as it is and it

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.140 
isn't yes it is notice as it is and it
would<00:02:23.349> just<00:02:23.379> drive<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.920> completely<00:02:24.430> mental

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
would just drive you completely mental

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.380 
would just drive you completely mental
so<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.900> better<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.290> look<00:02:26.769> at<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.129> position

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
so it's better to look at a position

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.880 
so it's better to look at a position
over<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> longer<00:02:28.659> term<00:02:28.930> time<00:02:29.409> period<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:29.829> say

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
over a longer term time period and say

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.940 
over a longer term time period and say
well<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.099> is<00:02:30.159> what<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.430> expected<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
well this is what I expected to do you

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.649 
well this is what I expected to do you
know<00:02:33.069> are<00:02:33.280> there<00:02:33.549> things<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.120> confirm

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
know are there things here that confirm

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.509 
know are there things here that confirm
that<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.049> going<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.379> happen<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.859> then<00:02:36.400> if

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
that that is going to happen and then if

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.210 
that that is going to happen and then if
that<00:02:36.989> situation<00:02:37.989> breaks<00:02:38.470> down<00:02:38.709> then<00:02:39.099> that's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
that situation breaks down then that's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.920 
that situation breaks down then that's
the<00:02:39.400> point<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.760> queue<00:02:39.909> at<00:02:40.030> which<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.569> exit

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the point of the queue at which you exit

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.420 
the point of the queue at which you exit
but<00:02:41.019> if<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.290> price<00:02:41.739> just<00:02:41.950> moves<00:02:42.189> back<00:02:42.400> a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
but if the price just moves back a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.589 
but if the price just moves back a
little<00:02:42.579> bit<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:42.939> perhaps<00:02:43.030> moves<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.480> into

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
little bit and perhaps moves you into

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.869 
little bit and perhaps moves you into
slightly<00:02:43.840> negative<00:02:44.349> territory<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.760> then

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
slightly negative territory and then

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.069 
slightly negative territory and then
doesn't<00:02:46.209> necessarily<00:02:46.599> mean<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.959> have

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
doesn't necessarily mean that you have

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.619 
doesn't necessarily mean that you have
to<00:02:47.200> cut<00:02:47.379> out<00:02:48.060> you're<00:02:49.060> going<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.209> be<00:02:49.299> looking<00:02:49.540> at

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
to cut out you're going to be looking at

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.030 
to cut out you're going to be looking at
what<00:02:49.750> happens<00:02:49.959> over<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.170> next<00:02:50.379> few<00:02:50.620> seconds

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
what happens over the next few seconds

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.680 
what happens over the next few seconds
it's<00:02:51.129> not<00:02:51.280> over<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.549> next<00:02:51.819> few<00:02:52.030> milliseconds

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
it's not over the next few milliseconds

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.809 
it's not over the next few milliseconds
and<00:02:52.900> one<00:02:53.859> of<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.040> suggestions<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.609> makes

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
and one of the suggestions that I makes

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.390 
and one of the suggestions that I makes
this<00:02:54.970> guy<00:02:55.150> was<00:02:55.510> why<00:02:55.810> don't<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.230> slow<00:02:57.069> down<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
this guy was why don't you slow down the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.129 
this guy was why don't you slow down the
refresh<00:02:57.790> because<00:02:58.030> if<00:02:58.299> you're<00:02:58.420> looking<00:02:58.510> at

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
refresh because if you're looking at

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.660 
refresh because if you're looking at
refreshing<00:02:59.590> at<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.799> highest<00:03:00.129> speed<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.579> know

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
refreshing at the highest speed you know

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.979 
refreshing at the highest speed you know
the<00:03:00.819> activity<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.329> going<00:03:01.389> to<00:03:01.510> go<00:03:01.599> did<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.870> did

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the activity is going to go did you did

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.449 
the activity is going to go did you did
you<00:03:02.109> did<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.349> did<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:03.159> that's<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.400> to

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
you did you did you and that's going to

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.740 
you did you did you and that's going to
force<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:03.849> hand<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.209> you're<00:03:04.329> a<00:03:04.359> little<00:03:04.659> bit

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
force your hand if you're a little bit

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.569 
force your hand if you're a little bit
jumping<00:03:05.079> you're<00:03:05.260> gonna<00:03:05.379> be<00:03:05.500> go<00:03:05.590> look<00:03:05.799> look<00:03:06.340> and

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
jumping you're gonna be go look look and

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.520 
jumping you're gonna be go look look and
jumping<00:03:07.510> all<00:03:07.629> over<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:07.810> place<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.230> saying

jumping all over the place in saying

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.699 
jumping all over the place in saying
what<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.889> mean<00:03:09.010> where<00:03:10.319> whereas<00:03:11.319> if<00:03:11.439> you<00:03:11.500> take<00:03:11.650> a

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
what I mean where whereas if you take a

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.649 
what I mean where whereas if you take a
longer<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.310> slower<00:03:12.519> refresh<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.239> fact<00:03:13.480> you

longer and slower refresh in fact you

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.970

because<00:03:42.010> it's<00:03:42.129> bad<00:03:42.310> position<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:43.840> fact

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
because it's bad position but in fact

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.080 
because it's bad position but in fact
you<00:03:44.500> know<00:03:44.620> taking<00:03:45.159> a<00:03:45.220> slightly<00:03:45.459> broader<00:03:45.699> view

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
you know taking a slightly broader view

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.719 
you know taking a slightly broader view
and<00:03:46.299> not<00:03:46.419> being<00:03:46.629> so<00:03:46.810> jumpy<00:03:47.220> if<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.340> works<00:03:48.489> quite

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:48.729 
and not being so jumpy if it works quite

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.280 
and not being so jumpy if it works quite
well<00:03:48.760> especially<00:03:49.150> over<00:03:49.449> longer<00:03:49.629> time<00:03:49.720> periods

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
well especially over longer time periods

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.740 
well especially over longer time periods
but<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:51.129> you<00:03:51.220> are<00:03:51.370> jumpy<00:03:51.819> then<00:03:52.269> what<00:03:52.449> you'll<00:03:52.599> do

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
but if you are jumpy then what you'll do

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.930 
but if you are jumpy then what you'll do
is<00:03:52.900> you'll<00:03:53.019> sort<00:03:53.199> of<00:03:53.229> cut<00:03:53.799> your<00:03:54.010> profits<00:03:54.699> and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
is you'll sort of cut your profits and

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.240 
is you'll sort of cut your profits and
you'll<00:03:55.720> increase<00:03:56.409> the<00:03:56.590> number<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:56.829> losses<00:03:57.129> you

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
you'll increase the number of losses you

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.099 
you'll increase the number of losses you
take<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.669> it's<00:03:57.819> like<00:03:57.940> all<00:03:58.120> it's<00:03:58.419> gone<00:03:58.599> up<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.780> bit

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
take is it's like all it's gone up a bit

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.809 
take is it's like all it's gone up a bit
that's<00:03:59.409> great<00:03:59.769> it's<00:03:59.979> coming<00:04:00.220> back<00:04:00.250> or<00:04:00.579> I'll

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
that's great it's coming back or I'll

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.360 
that's great it's coming back or I'll
take<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.440> or<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.620> goes<00:04:02.769> against<00:04:03.099> you<00:04:03.220> and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
take that or it goes against you and

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.890 
take that or it goes against you and
you'll<00:04:03.459> think<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.639> better<00:04:03.790> cut<00:04:04.000> out<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.750> wall

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
you'll think I better cut out the wall

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.180 
you'll think I better cut out the wall
actually<00:04:05.049> happen<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.799> know<00:04:05.889> you're<00:04:06.099> in

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
actually happen is you know you're in

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.439 
actually happen is you know you're in
profit<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:06.699> comes<00:04:06.879> back<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.269> then<00:04:07.359> it

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
profit and it comes back and then it

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.210 
profit and it comes back and then it
goes<00:04:07.479> back<00:04:07.780> up<00:04:07.930> again<00:04:08.169> and<00:04:08.349> you<00:04:08.919> know<00:04:09.040> you're

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
goes back up again and you know you're

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.770 
goes back up again and you know you're
the<00:04:09.699> original<00:04:09.909> entry<00:04:10.329> point<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.629> probably

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
the original entry point is probably

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.599 
the original entry point is probably
correct<00:04:11.169> it's<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:11.769> taking<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.370> slightly

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
correct it's just taking a slightly

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.599 
correct it's just taking a slightly
meandering<00:04:13.150> path<00:04:14.129> and<00:04:15.129> the<00:04:15.250> problem<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:15.549> the

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
meandering path and the problem is the

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.029 
meandering path and the problem is the
market<00:04:15.760> will<00:04:16.030> bully<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.269> like<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:17.260> you

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
market will bully you like that so you

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.770 
market will bully you like that so you
know<00:04:18.159> there's<00:04:18.579> this<00:04:18.760> terrible<00:04:19.449> propensity

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
know there's this terrible propensity

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.300 
know there's this terrible propensity
for<00:04:20.019> people<00:04:20.590> who<00:04:20.680> are<00:04:20.769> just<00:04:20.919> starting<00:04:21.159> to

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
for people who are just starting to

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.279 
for people who are just starting to
trade<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.970> keep<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:22.360> taking<00:04:22.630> small<00:04:23.080> losses

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
trade to keep on taking small losses

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.110 
trade to keep on taking small losses
that<00:04:23.680> moves<00:04:23.979> up<00:04:24.159> to<00:04:24.310> much<00:04:24.490> much<00:04:24.700> bigger<00:04:24.849> ones

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
that moves up to much much bigger ones

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640 
that moves up to much much bigger ones
over<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.389> period<00:04:25.539> of<00:04:25.690> time<00:04:25.870> when<00:04:26.260> in<00:04:26.380> fact<00:04:26.500> they

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
over a period of time when in fact they

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.779 
over a period of time when in fact they
were<00:04:26.770> probably<00:04:26.950> right<00:04:27.190> in<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.400> first<00:04:27.580> place

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
were probably right in the first place

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:28.860 
were probably right in the first place
anyway

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
anyway

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.480 
anyway
so<00:04:29.440> yeah<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.680> made<00:04:29.860> me<00:04:29.949> slow<00:04:30.160> down<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
so yeah you made me slow down the
