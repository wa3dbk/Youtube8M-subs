00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.829
 is the end of the history of the 2000 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.380

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.440

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.050
 what would the story be the truth 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.269
 that I'm super super surprised 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.649

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.289
 incredible but good if you have the video 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.690

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.519
 of who are those eyes of these eyes 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.800
 they are from samantha vale this is the 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.720
 samantha room is worth exactly these 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.180
 they are zombies, these are two zombies 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.490
 to you this kid who is here is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.710
 straight mesma took away the end that is the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.120
 brother of that blanket is worth and here as 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.950
 You see, he puts the camera as if 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.610
 I was recording or something and as you see 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.210
 you have there the juve you do not have also the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 zombies as you can see they are several things 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.400
 and well, what would be the end of the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.340
 let's say that everything is a game 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 that none of this is real is it worth a 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.900
 I play everything and as you see in the windows 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.660
 if you notice, then you have there is the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.390
 teddy bear if you notice too there 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.570
 flash techniques I also stayed with that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.700
 is the dog as after it remains the same 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.940
 everything is the same and if you look 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 behind the door you have there what 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.790

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.710

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.090
 I know if excited the truth but the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.210
 true that is all because it has impacted me 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.900
 quite because I did not think it was 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.729
