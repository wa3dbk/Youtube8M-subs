00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
in this course we're going to be linking

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.390 
in this course we're going to be linking
to<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.930> custom<00:03:44.410> style<00:03:44.590> sheet<00:03:44.739> where<00:03:45.099> we'll<00:03:45.220> add

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
to a custom style sheet where we'll add

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.159 
to a custom style sheet where we'll add
all<00:03:45.430> kinds<00:03:45.609> of<00:03:45.910> custom<00:03:46.299> styles<00:03:46.690> we'll<00:03:47.049> go

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
all kinds of custom styles we'll go

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.629 
all kinds of custom styles we'll go
ahead<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.500> add<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.650> code<00:03:48.069> right<00:03:48.099> now<00:03:48.430> as

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
ahead and add that code right now as

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.979 
ahead and add that code right now as
well<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.269> we'll<00:03:49.419> say<00:03:49.629> link<00:03:50.109> href<00:03:50.980> equals<00:03:51.989> CSS

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
well so we'll say link href equals CSS

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.199 
well so we'll say link href equals CSS
slash<00:03:53.620> custom<00:03:54.280> dot<00:03:54.699> CSS<00:03:55.329> and<00:03:55.660> rel<00:03:56.530> equals

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
slash custom dot CSS and rel equals

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.640 
slash custom dot CSS and rel equals
stylesheet<00:03:58.209> again<00:03:58.419> all<00:03:59.079> right<00:03:59.290> so<00:03:59.530> that's

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
stylesheet again all right so that's

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.890 
stylesheet again all right so that's
calling<00:04:00.160> now<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.609> style<00:04:01.060> sheet<00:04:01.150> called<00:04:01.480> custom

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
calling now a style sheet called custom

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.770 
calling now a style sheet called custom
net<00:04:02.049> CSS<00:04:02.560> inside<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.459> CSS<00:04:03.970> folder<00:04:04.180> well<00:04:04.660> we

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
net CSS inside of the CSS folder well we

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.240 
net CSS inside of the CSS folder well we
don't<00:04:04.900> have<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.260> style<00:04:05.530> sheet<00:04:05.650> yet<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.220> I

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
don't have that style sheet yet so I

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.650 
don't have that style sheet yet so I
suppose<00:04:06.639> we<00:04:06.790> ought<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:06.940> go<00:04:07.120> ahead<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.510> create

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
suppose we ought to go ahead and create

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.199 
suppose we ought to go ahead and create
that<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.620> create<00:04:08.799> that<00:04:09.160> style<00:04:09.519> sheet<00:04:09.609> we'll

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
that so to create that style sheet we'll

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.229 
that so to create that style sheet we'll
just<00:04:10.449> go<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.629> file<00:04:10.989> new<00:04:11.530> file<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.239> sublime

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
just go to file new file and sublime

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.699 
just go to file new file and sublime
