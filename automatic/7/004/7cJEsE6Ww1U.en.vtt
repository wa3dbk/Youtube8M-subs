00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.559 
of like that and you're sort of gonna
keep<00:04:01.290> working<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.010> shading<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:03.180> make<00:04:03.209> it

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
keep working at the shading to make it

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.559 
keep working at the shading to make it
dark<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.230> make<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.470> appear<00:04:04.829> like<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.849> you<00:04:06.419> can

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
dark to make it appear like that you can

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.740 
dark to make it appear like that you can
even<00:04:06.720> use<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.340> very<00:04:08.340> tiny<00:04:08.760> amount<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.239> black<00:04:09.480> for

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
even use a very tiny amount of black for

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.300 
even use a very tiny amount of black for
this<00:04:09.900> but<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:10.290> want<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.500> be<00:04:10.620> very<00:04:10.799> clever<00:04:11.069> with

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
this but you want to be very clever with

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.289 
this but you want to be very clever with
that<00:04:11.519> because<00:04:11.699> you<00:04:11.849> don't<00:04:11.940> want<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.209> go

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
that because you don't want to go

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.810 
that because you don't want to go
overboard<00:04:16.070> we're<00:04:17.070> gonna<00:04:17.160> go<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.639> with<00:04:17.760> a

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
overboard we're gonna go in with a

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.349 
overboard we're gonna go in with a
sponge<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.750> some<00:04:19.109> liquid<00:04:19.380> latex<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:21.090> we're

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
sponge and some liquid latex and we're

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.270 
sponge and some liquid latex and we're
just<00:04:21.510> gonna<00:04:21.690> build<00:04:22.199> up<00:04:22.440> on<00:04:22.919> our<00:04:23.910> forehead

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.370 

liquid<00:04:29.280> latex<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.789> a<00:04:29.820> really<00:04:30.360> good<00:04:30.660> technique

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
liquid latex is a really good technique

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.189 
liquid latex is a really good technique
for<00:04:31.949> making<00:04:32.130> fake<00:04:32.580> skin<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:33.479> you<00:04:33.810> don't<00:04:33.960> have

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
for making fake skin if you don't have

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.080 
for making fake skin if you don't have
anything<00:04:34.680> else<00:04:34.979> besides<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.520> good<00:04:35.639> latex

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
anything else besides a good latex

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.330 
anything else besides a good latex
because<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.080> could<00:04:37.229> just<00:04:37.410> build<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.979> up<00:04:38.099> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
because you could just build it up and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.159 
because you could just build it up and
build<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.729> up<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.030> build<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.419> up<00:04:39.510> eventually

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
build it up and build it up eventually

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.550 
build it up and build it up eventually
it'll<00:04:40.740> dry<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.400> then<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.639> could<00:04:41.880> feel<00:04:42.150> out<00:04:42.330> it

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
it'll dry and then you could feel out it

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.879 
it'll dry and then you could feel out it
stir<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.710> up<00:04:43.979> just<00:04:44.789> put<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.479> few<00:04:46.050> layers<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.500> this

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
stir it up just put a few layers of this

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.560 
stir it up just put a few layers of this
on<00:04:47.099> let<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.550> dry<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.090> then<00:04:48.150> hit<00:04:48.419> it<00:04:48.449> with

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
on let it dry and then hit it with

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.600 
on let it dry and then hit it with
another<00:04:48.930> few<00:04:49.260> layers<00:04:49.470> well<00:04:50.039> inside<00:04:50.250> liquid

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
another few layers well inside liquid

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.589 
another few layers well inside liquid
latex<00:04:50.909> dries<00:04:51.330> we're<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:52.050> gonna<00:04:52.169> wanna<00:04:52.409> peel

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
so now they just did as I actually added

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:00.969 
so now they just did as I actually added
a<00:05:59.509> little<00:05:59.629> bit<00:05:59.840> of<00:05:59.930> black<00:06:00.110> free<00:06:00.440> makeup<00:06:00.800> to<00:06:00.949> the
