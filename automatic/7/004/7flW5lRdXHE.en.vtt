00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.119
 Hello everyone on my bank and good 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.669
 here we have a little nick using the 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.050
 tapping technique then well let's go 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.150
 to see a little what we have done here 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.599
 so that it serves you a little bit especially 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.910
 to switch between one string and another not 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.890
 because this one has one string is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.840
 quite effective there are times that it does not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.840
 life is not too complicated 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.010
 being on a string, they can be 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.600
 do very interesting things about the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.600
 extension to the right 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.079
 Well, maybe we have the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.570
 need or the desire to change 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.399
 strings to change the string there are 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.750
 various ways but what I have done in 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.219
 estelÃ­ what is doing with your hand 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.379
 left we will see a little what 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.329
 we have done the first part is the 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.309
 index or middle that does not matter as 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.000
 we are also going to use the medium but as 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.340
 I usually have a pretty finished nail 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.560
 the topic of finger picking, sometimes 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.630
 it's a bit annoying but good 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.509
 preferred of the index factors 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.039
 I tested here the finger to one of the hand 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.370
 left on the fifth fret of the 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.670
 rope unit 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.070
 and then with the right hand I'm going to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.210
 ride on the 12th fret of the first and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.210
 Then I want to make an ass 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.869
 tapas and then 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.510
 then the left hand will do 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.050
 hammer we are playing in the 5 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.740
 yes 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.310
 and hummer that's fine 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.310
 and after 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.170
 I come back doing asses 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.740
 it would be this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.490
 place done once as more slowly 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.510
 then it has been changing 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.640
 I have gone down to the level but the hand 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.640
 left keeps doing the same 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.440
 after that 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.990
 as he added the second for what I do is 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.980
 done 12 11 10 11 with the right hand on 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.980
 the last one is that of 11 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.569
 it's the left hand and the little finger that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.609
 they tap with their left hand 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.060
 on the second string on the eighth fret 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.060
 would not be 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.489
 from that of this also on the way to 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.480
 a girl that I do 12 with my finger 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.480
 index would stay 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.970
 and then with the same one today says 12 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.970
 the days 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.450
 three points in a row 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.450
 and I repeat from the beginning of space 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.690
 especially the part of the second string 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:36.160
 is also the little finger in 8 and 12 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.080
 with the index 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.860
 He placed my finger on the sixth fret 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.580
 ink to make each other six 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.580
 16 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.540
 I also take advantage of it is finger 3 that 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.040
 go up the seventh to the seventh fret the 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.460
 third rope the one that climbs doing 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:10.270
 also to the third string too 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.270
 and now again then the third 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.280
 now he touched with the index 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.100
 and then 25.1 are fret 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.100
 fifth of the third string 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.710
 nations neither backwards so the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.690
 third string I would stay like this three finger 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.690
 that goes up to the seventh fret of the third 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.860
 from the beginning it would be 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.240
 remember all continue 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.820
 it's just a very fast ball 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.030
 making hammer and quickly pull the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.030
 finger 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.820
 If you want me to tell you the truth I do not know 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.830
 how many times have I done it with the brush 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:22.570
 but then more or less and without doing 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.370
 nothing else with the right hand everyone is going to 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.740
 climb to the fourth fifth string fret 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.740
 is going to do a tapping but directly 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.000
 to the seventh or that would be 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.370
 keeping the seventh fret of the 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.370
 quarter 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.170
 we make a harmonic tap for mo'nique si 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.800
 you have never done is to give a blow 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.599
 just above the ripple 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.199
 so that the harmonic that 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.199
 would correspond 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.450
 that harmonic that corresponds to that point 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.450
 to be as dry 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.760
 yes i was 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.419
 now we play in 12 just above 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:19.230
 and then in 15 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:21.940
 I think not 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.310
 and finally 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.389
 The 17 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.389
 until 2012 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:36.210
 topics points the 14 also battery 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.210
 pretty cool too 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.080
 and 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.880
 is to experiment with that is good is that 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.490
 is the lic what you have seen 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.020
 principle and good then what I have 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.020
 commented the story was 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.600
 that rise that now it was very 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.380
 clean and very well connected when 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.380
 we use the left hand 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.290
 in Iquique city to second 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.290
 the third the third 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:14.520
 good if you have never done this 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:15.119
 I hope it helps you and good that 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.389
 You liked it 

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:17.389
 see you
