with this bag I purchased it as a bag

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.180 
with this bag I purchased it as a bag
that<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.660> can<00:02:14.930> take<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> car<00:02:15.890> with<00:02:16.160> me

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that I can take in the car with me

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.220 
that I can take in the car with me
because<00:02:16.670> we<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.540> three<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.200> half

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
because we do have a three and a half

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.830 
because we do have a three and a half
hour<00:02:18.590> drive<00:02:19.120> before<00:02:20.120> we<00:02:20.240> get<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.570> our<00:02:20.600> lake

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
hour drive before we get to our lake

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.810 
hour drive before we get to our lake
condo<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.920> thought<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.370> would<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.610> a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
condo so I thought this would be a

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.400
