00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 and when for the refraction of water ro 133 a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 formerly the wavelength of which is country 600 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.389
 per meter Vladimir wavelength 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:16.460
 need to determine what we will talk about 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.460
 pussy tasks here we have the surface of the water 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:29.670
 I will paint her there now 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:31.260
 we fall on her orange light in this 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:39.420
 water is some kind of indicator 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:43.140
 refraction n which is not 133 in general 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.379
 case wavelength related speed 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.770
 spreading light like art is not 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:56.460
 montana rivers like its speed green 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.829
 frequency if we consider the light in two 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.170
 In cases of air, the wavelength will be connected 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.059
 air speed and speed 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.159
 This whole because I think that these 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.869
 plans and air Zenica can hurt 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.700
 air as fast as light 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.150
 wakame 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:17.000
 therefore believes that it will now 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:23.310
 The light of the water is already a different speed 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.540
 water and all this will be with us so divide 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.130
 something is known that speed 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.439
 water spread 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 is related to the air removal rate 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.670
 ratio connected where to weave in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.470
 breaking by the way to fill 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 expression 2 9 multiply I remind you that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.840
 all this speed can not exceed 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 say light is easier to say so if you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.829
 do not remember the loan that it can us 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.740
 just you can understand that the ultimate 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.020
 speed must be mundane all therefore 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.570
 if we want to determine the ratio of the length 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.490
 waves in the water at the bottom of the wave 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.149
 air we will need to share in 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149
 h2o 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.510
 nation because the frequency that guests have 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.510
 us is reduced this turn 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.459
 let us write this will be unit 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.310
 Can I put this here us here 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:28.799
 In this mode, everyone stevie that is faithful to everyone 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:34.860
 water will be recorded as or air 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:38.790
 whether green torso and that 600 nanometers 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.790
 divide by 133 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.079
 it is here and a little rowing on will give 451 on 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.079
 meter 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.340
 with all this, it turns out that with 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.720
 relocating if we now look at 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:18.239
 this color is water 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:21.390
 to our eyes the pupils then our eye will lead 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.120
 blue light and here we quite chew 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.470
 that is, water becomes a pair of light 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:35.000
 blue because here we will have 600 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.000
 nanometers here we will have 450 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.269
 that's all thank you for your attention
