00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.240
 on the stand the face you have to fight 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.770
 to be able to approach the 4c ​​that comes 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.300

 a carbon hull that we see a small 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.920
 little further that is only 65 kg at 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.239

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.420
 horses and especially 350 of the m rate 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.670

 rice that appears on this car and 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.519
 which disconnects all the helpers 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.979
 electronic the car a report 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.409
 weight / power a balance of the masses
