crochet<00:01:25.270> cluster<00:01:25.479> before<00:01:26.289> it<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:27.249> simply

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
crochet cluster before it is simply

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.690

in<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.149> same<00:01:31.389> stitch<00:01:31.719> but<00:01:32.649> only<00:01:32.859> pulling

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
in the same stitch but only pulling

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.399 
in the same stitch but only pulling
through<00:01:33.609> two<00:01:33.819> of<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.060> loops<00:01:34.090> as<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:35.200> make

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
through two of the loops as you make

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.349 
through two of the loops as you make
your<00:01:35.439> stitches<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.369> then<00:01:36.520> pulling<00:01:36.999> through

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
your stitches and then pulling through

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.919 
your stitches and then pulling through
all<00:01:37.600> four<00:01:38.200> loops<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.740> your<00:01:38.770> hook<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.689> we're

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
all four loops on your hook and so we're

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.870 
all four loops on your hook and so we're
going<00:01:41.139> to<00:01:41.259> yarn<00:01:41.469> over<00:01:41.740> go<00:01:42.159> into<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.700> next

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
going to yarn over go into the next

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.349 
going to yarn over go into the next
chain<00:01:43.600> space<00:01:43.899> pull<00:01:44.649> up<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.950> loop<00:01:45.130> yarn<00:01:45.490> over<00:01:46.179> and

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
chain space pull up a loop yarn over and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.989 
chain space pull up a loop yarn over and
only<00:01:46.689> pull<00:01:47.079> through<00:01:47.319> two<00:01:47.590> loops<00:01:47.829> so<00:01:48.759> you'll

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
only pull through two loops so you'll

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.230 
only pull through two loops so you'll
leave<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.569> last<00:01:49.779> loop<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.350> your<00:01:50.380> hook<00:01:50.529> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
leave the last loop on your hook and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.899 
leave the last loop on your hook and
yarn<00:01:52.240> over<00:01:52.479> again<00:01:52.950> place<00:01:53.950> another<00:01:54.399> double

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
yarn over again place another double

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.870 
yarn over again place another double
crochet<00:01:55.389> stitch<00:01:55.749> in<00:01:56.079> that<00:01:56.409> chain<00:01:56.799> arc<00:01:57.159> only

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
crochet stitch in that chain arc only

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.969 
crochet stitch in that chain arc only
pulling<00:01:58.270> through<00:01:58.479> two<00:01:58.689> loops<00:01:58.929> we'll<00:01:59.649> do<00:01:59.829> this

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
pulling through two loops we'll do this

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.160 
pulling through two loops we'll do this
one<00:02:00.039> more<00:02:00.459> time<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.149> we'll<00:02:01.329> make<00:02:01.539> three<00:02:01.929> double

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
one more time so we'll make three double

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.910 
one more time so we'll make three double
crochet<00:02:02.859> for<00:02:03.429> each<00:02:03.639> double<00:02:04.119> crochet<00:02:04.569> cluster

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
crochet for each double crochet cluster

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.070 
crochet for each double crochet cluster
yarn<00:02:05.920> over<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.340> pull<00:02:06.579> through<00:02:07.029> two<00:02:07.420> loops<00:02:07.450> and

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
yarn over and pull through two loops and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.960 
yarn over and pull through two loops and
now<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.619> should<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:09.100> four<00:02:09.400> loops<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:09.910> your

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
now you should have four loops on your

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.710 
now you should have four loops on your
hook

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
hook

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.560 
hook
so<00:02:11.560> now<00:02:11.800> yarn<00:02:12.280> over<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.760> pull<00:02:13.030> through<00:02:13.480> all

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
so now yarn over and pull through all

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.130 
so now yarn over and pull through all
four<00:02:14.140> loops<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.460> secures<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.510> double

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
four loops and this secures this double

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.030 
four loops and this secures this double
crochet<00:02:17.650> cluster<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.760> see<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:20.040> so

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
crochet cluster that we can see here so

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.000 
crochet cluster that we can see here so
now<00:02:21.340> you'll<00:02:21.670> continue<00:02:22.540> by<00:02:23.320> making<00:02:24.310> two<00:02:24.700> chains

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
now you'll continue by making two chains

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.490 
now you'll continue by making two chains
skipping<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.190> next<00:02:27.640> stitch<00:02:27.940> under<00:02:28.630> your<00:02:29.200> work

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
skipping the next stitch under your work

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.580 
skipping the next stitch under your work
and<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.430> you'll<00:02:30.940> go<00:02:31.510> into<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.960> next<00:02:32.260> chain

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
and then you'll go into the next chain

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.650 
and then you'll go into the next chain
space<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.670> make<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.900> double<00:02:35.440> crochet<00:02:35.620> cluster

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
space and make a double crochet cluster

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.960 
space and make a double crochet cluster
this<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.930> good<00:02:38.170> practice<00:02:38.530> for<00:02:39.250> anyone<00:02:39.700> who's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
this is good practice for anyone who's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.720 
this is good practice for anyone who's
beginning<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.690> crochet<00:02:40.990> filet<00:02:41.770> crochet<00:02:41.800> or

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
beginning to crochet filet crochet or

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.010 
beginning to crochet filet crochet or
lace<00:02:43.720> crochet<00:02:44.670> now<00:02:45.670> we're<00:02:46.270> going<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.630> chain

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
lace crochet now we're going to chain

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.540 
lace crochet now we're going to chain
two<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:48.300> make<00:02:49.300> just<00:02:49.960> one<00:02:50.380> double<00:02:50.950> crochet

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
two and make just one double crochet

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.620 
two and make just one double crochet
stitch<00:02:51.970> into<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.780> next<00:02:53.610> chain<00:02:54.610> arc<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.300> we<00:02:55.450> can

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
stitch into the next chain arc so we can

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.140 
stitch into the next chain arc so we can
see<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.080> underneath<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.340> last<00:02:57.580> row<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.030> our

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
see that underneath the last row of our

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.510 
see that underneath the last row of our
work<00:02:58.480> where<00:02:59.290> there<00:02:59.560> are<00:02:59.710> double<00:03:00.040> crochet

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.100 
work where there are double crochet
stitches<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.360> then<00:03:01.510> double<00:03:01.930> crochet

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
stitches and then double crochet

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.720 
stitches and then double crochet
clusters<00:03:03.010> right<00:03:03.250> here<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:05.560> we're<00:03:06.550> going

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
clusters right here and so we're going

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.330 
clusters right here and so we're going
to<00:03:06.880> just<00:03:07.210> go<00:03:07.390> into<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.810> next<00:03:07.980> chain<00:03:08.980> arc

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
to just go into the next chain arc

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.510 
to just go into the next chain arc
skipping<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.210> stitch<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.380> make<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:12.100> double

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
skipping that stitch and make a double
crochet<00:03:12.700> chain<00:03:13.440> two<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:15.000> make<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.030> double

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
crochet chain two and make a double

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.979 
crochet chain two and make a double
crochet<00:03:16.720> cluster<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:17.950> next<00:03:18.640> chain<00:03:18.940> arc<00:03:19.300> so

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
crochet cluster in the next chain arc so

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.470 
crochet cluster in the next chain arc so
we're<00:03:20.260> alternating<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:21.610> double<00:03:22.000> crochet

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480
