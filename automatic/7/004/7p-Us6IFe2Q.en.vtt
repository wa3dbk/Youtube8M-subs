head but good news is it gets a lot

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.780 
head but good news is it gets a lot
better<00:04:58.200> at<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.620> base<00:04:58.770> goes<00:04:58.980> on<00:04:59.160> but<00:04:59.370> keep<00:04:59.640> in

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
better at the base goes on but keep in

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.120 
better at the base goes on but keep in
mind<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.510> reason<00:05:00.690> my<00:05:00.900> hair<00:05:01.170> is<00:05:01.410> heavy<00:05:01.860> is

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
mind the reason my hair is heavy is

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.150 
mind the reason my hair is heavy is
because<00:05:02.700> it's<00:05:03.180> long<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.560> thickness<00:05:04.590> is

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
because it's long and the thickness is

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.680 
because it's long and the thickness is
substantial<00:05:05.730> so<00:05:05.970> if<00:05:06.060> you<00:05:06.150> might<00:05:06.300> shoulder

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
substantial so if you might shoulder

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
it as you can see and then I do a bun

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.110 
it as you can see and then I do a bun
yes<00:06:59.230> this<00:06:59.470> looks<00:06:59.650> like<00:06:59.890> it<00:07:00.130> takes<00:07:00.340> a<00:07:00.610> lot<00:07:00.910> of

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
yes this looks like it takes a lot of

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.880 
yes this looks like it takes a lot of
work<00:07:01.300> white<00:07:01.630> actually<00:07:01.840> doesn't<00:07:02.290> you<00:07:02.530> get<00:07:02.680> used

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
work white actually doesn't you get used

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.620 
work white actually doesn't you get used
to<00:07:02.950> doing<00:07:03.130> this<00:07:03.310> maneuver<00:07:03.730> so<00:07:04.090> I<00:07:04.120> do<00:07:04.240> a<00:07:04.330> bun<00:07:04.600> on

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
to doing this maneuver so I do a bun on

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.090 
to doing this maneuver so I do a bun on
top<00:07:04.870> of<00:07:04.960> my<00:07:05.050> head<00:07:05.260> so<00:07:05.470> it<00:07:05.530> kind<00:07:05.740> of<00:07:05.770> just<00:07:05.920> sits

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
top of my head so it kind of just sits

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.400 
top of my head so it kind of just sits
there<00:07:06.250> and<00:07:06.580> to<00:07:06.970> secure<00:07:07.300> this<00:07:07.510> this<00:07:07.870> is<00:07:07.990> when<00:07:08.230> I

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
there and to secure this this is when I

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:14.580 
there and to secure this this is when I
use<00:07:08.710> the<00:07:08.860> tight<00:07:12.660> so<00:07:13.660> that<00:07:13.780> I<00:07:13.840> use<00:07:14.050> a<00:07:14.080> tight<00:07:14.350> to

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
use the tight so that I use a tight to

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.040 
use the tight so that I use a tight to
just<00:07:14.770> kind<00:07:15.010> of<00:07:15.070> put<00:07:15.850> everything<00:07:16.270> in<00:07:16.660> place<00:07:16.930> I

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
just kind of put everything in place I

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.590 
just kind of put everything in place I
was<00:07:17.110> like<00:07:17.170> a<00:07:17.290> hat<00:07:17.530> that<00:07:18.130> makes<00:07:18.370> sense<00:07:18.610> so<00:07:19.240> hold

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:19.600 
was like a hat that makes sense so hold

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.870 
was like a hat that makes sense so hold
in<00:07:19.810> place<00:07:20.080> with<00:07:20.860> the<00:07:20.950> type<00:07:21.160> and<00:07:21.370> this<00:07:21.490> keeps<00:07:21.760> it

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 
in place with the type and this keeps it

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.970 
in place with the type and this keeps it
secure<00:07:22.030> whilst<00:07:22.480> they<00:07:22.660> sleep<00:07:22.690> it's<00:07:23.230> heavy<00:07:23.710> but

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980 
secure whilst they sleep it's heavy but

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.190 
secure whilst they sleep it's heavy but
you<00:07:24.130> do<00:07:24.310> get<00:07:24.490> used<00:07:24.640> to<00:07:24.880> it<00:07:25.030> and<00:07:25.210> also<00:07:25.720> I<00:07:25.900> do<00:07:26.080> this

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.200 
you do get used to it and also I do this

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.750 
you do get used to it and also I do this
when<00:07:26.380> I<00:07:26.410> want<00:07:26.590> to<00:07:26.650> go<00:07:26.740> shower<00:07:26.980> because<00:07:27.280> locks

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
when I want to go shower because locks

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.170 
when I want to go shower because locks
aren't<00:07:28.210> fun<00:07:28.780> when<00:07:29.500> they<00:07:29.800> are<00:07:29.920> wet<00:07:30.130> but<00:07:30.490> yeah

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
aren't fun when they are wet but yeah

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.550 
aren't fun when they are wet but yeah
that's<00:07:31.300> pretty<00:07:31.420> much<00:07:31.630> the<00:07:31.960> maintenance<00:07:32.380> is

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 
that's pretty much the maintenance is

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.770 
that's pretty much the maintenance is
real<00:07:32.740> easy<00:07:32.950> and<00:07:33.340> so<00:07:33.640> I<00:07:33.670> hope<00:07:34.060> this<00:07:34.210> helps<00:07:34.660> if

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
real easy and so I hope this helps if

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.280 
real easy and so I hope this helps if
you're<00:07:35.200> thinking<00:07:35.620> of<00:07:35.740> getting<00:07:35.890> faux<00:07:36.130> locs
