00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330 
driving style and we knew it was there
to<00:01:15.869> take<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.710> made<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.130> nice

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

changes<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:17.939> qualifying<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:19.530> felt<00:01:19.830> good

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
changes for qualifying and it felt good

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.300 
changes for qualifying and it felt good
so<00:01:20.369> pleased<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> effort<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:22.170> train<00:01:23.130> at

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
so pleased with the effort a train at

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
so pleased with the effort a train at
the<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.549> end<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.880> we're<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.570> knew

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the very end you know we're up I knew

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.880 
the very end you know we're up I knew
where<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> pole<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:25.770> we'll

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
where the pole was and I think we'll

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190
