whatever<00:01:11.409> i<00:01:11.590> guess<00:01:11.770> you'd<00:01:11.920> keep<00:01:12.040> them<00:01:12.220> on<00:01:12.310> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
whatever i guess you'd keep them on the

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.890 
whatever i guess you'd keep them on the
trash<00:01:12.610> bins<00:01:12.909> that's<00:01:13.330> why<00:01:13.479> it's<00:01:13.600> good<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.840> have

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
trash bins that's why it's good to have

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.210 
trash bins that's why it's good to have
those<00:01:14.110> too<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:14.500> we're<00:01:14.590> going<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.830> build<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.070> few

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
those too so we're going to build a few

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.039 
those too so we're going to build a few
of<00:01:15.310> those<00:01:15.430> put<00:01:16.180> one<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.420> those<00:01:16.510> right<00:01:16.810> here

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
of those put one of those right here

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.910 
of those put one of those right here
actually<00:01:17.290> right<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:19.210> there<00:01:19.920> don't

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
actually right there right there don't

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.890 
actually right there right there don't
know<00:01:20.979> why<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.100> can<00:01:21.250> bug<00:01:21.369> trash<00:01:21.670> cans<00:01:22.060> on<00:01:22.299> slope

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
know why you can bug trash cans on slope

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.359 
know why you can bug trash cans on slope
surfaces<00:01:23.409> but<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.640> can't<00:01:24.939> build<00:01:26.130> inches<00:01:27.130> that

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
surfaces but you can't build inches that

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.330 
surfaces but you can't build inches that
doesn't<00:01:27.610> really<00:01:27.700> make<00:01:27.850> any<00:01:27.909> sense<00:01:29.130> also<00:01:30.130> what

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
doesn't really make any sense also what

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.859 
doesn't really make any sense also what
does<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.580> even<00:01:30.759> go<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.270> doesn't<00:01:31.600> go<00:01:31.810> to

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
does that even go to this doesn't go to

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.840 
does that even go to this doesn't go to
anything<00:01:32.140> he<00:01:32.979> work<00:01:33.130> as<00:01:33.220> I<00:01:33.340> walking<00:01:33.670> down<00:01:33.790> the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
anything he work as I walking down the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.810 
anything he work as I walking down the
like<00:01:35.250> remember<00:01:38.159> we're<00:01:39.159> gonna<00:01:39.250> build<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.640> to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
like remember we're gonna build that to

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.500 
like remember we're gonna build that to
this<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.540> then<00:01:40.990> ok<00:01:41.380> that's<00:01:41.590> what<00:01:41.710> we<00:01:41.829> do

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
this and then ok that's what we do

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.450 
this and then ok that's what we do
that's<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> well<00:01:43.830> we'll<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.250> this

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that's what was it well we'll do it this

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.980 
that's what was it well we'll do it this
way<00:01:44.670> we'll<00:01:45.150> make<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.300> little<00:01:45.510> bit<00:01:45.600> faster<00:01:47.990> so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
way we'll make a little bit faster so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.720 
way we'll make a little bit faster so
this<00:01:50.420> will<00:01:51.420> actually<00:01:51.660> go<00:01:52.080> here<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
this will actually go here and here and

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.710 
this will actually go here and here and
here<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.200> oh<00:01:55.350> no<00:01:55.560> holy<00:01:56.370> shit<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:57.030> think

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
I'd completely fucked myself there which

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.130 
I'd completely fucked myself there which
there's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> way<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.080> like<00:02:08.149> remove<00:02:12.140> there<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.290> go
