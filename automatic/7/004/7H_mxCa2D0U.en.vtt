00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.140 

okay<00:04:54.070> okay<00:04:55.070> here's<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.490> power<00:04:55.670> cable<00:04:56.000> it's

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
okay okay here's the power cable it's

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150 
okay okay here's the power cable it's
your<00:04:56.330> standard<00:04:56.720> power<00:04:57.350> cable<00:04:57.800> it's<00:04:57.950> not<00:04:58.130> a

your standard power cable it's not a

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.730 
your standard power cable it's not a
prioritized<00:04:58.910> power<00:04:59.150> cable<00:05:00.700> let<00:05:01.700> me<00:05:01.820> get<00:05:02.000> this

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.220 

it's<00:05:06.740> just<00:05:06.920> your<00:05:07.040> standard<00:05:07.280> one<00:05:07.640> my<00:05:08.330> antec
