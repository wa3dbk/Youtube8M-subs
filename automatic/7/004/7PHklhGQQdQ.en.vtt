pull him out into the field ok we have

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:50.620 
pull him out into the field ok we have
now<00:01:38.729> fills

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:05.600 

he's<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.930> there

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
do like the spring awakening I don't

00:02:40.130 --> 00:03:07.300 
do like the spring awakening I don't
know<00:02:40.220> why

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.690 

so<00:03:07.910> we<00:03:08.060> are<00:03:08.180> rinsing<00:03:08.810> very<00:03:09.140> well<00:03:09.440> with<00:03:10.340> still

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
so we are rinsing very well with still

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.680 
so we are rinsing very well with still
some<00:03:11.390> cells<00:03:11.660> left<00:03:11.900> at<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.410> bottom

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.690 

okay<00:03:18.690> guys<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:18.870> posite<00:03:19.860> little<00:03:20.130> interesting

okay guys now posite little interesting

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.540 
okay guys now posite little interesting
spin<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.270> Paul's<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.530> until<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
spin I Paul's it in until the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.740 
spin I Paul's it in until the
intermittent<00:03:24.150> spin<00:03:24.920> after<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.040> Rings<00:03:26.750> hey

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
intermittent spin after the Rings hey

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:37.440 
intermittent spin after the Rings hey
guys<00:03:27.959> are<00:03:28.170> draining<00:03:28.380> away<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.770> rinse<00:03:28.950> water

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.570 

and<00:03:38.020> hopefully<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.830> mission<00:03:39.250> won't<00:03:39.370> give<00:03:39.550> me

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
and hopefully the mission won't give me

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.089 
and hopefully the mission won't give me
any<00:03:39.790> balancing<00:03:40.420> Oh<00:03:45.540> countless<00:03:46.540> met<00:03:47.410> people

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
any balancing Oh countless met people

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.309 
any balancing Oh countless met people
could<00:03:48.250> be<00:03:48.400> saying<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:49.120> me<00:03:49.360> could<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.110> please

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
could be saying to me could you please

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.220 
could be saying to me could you please
go<00:03:50.500> drier<00:03:50.890> than<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.370> now<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.510> didn't<00:03:52.780> ask<00:03:52.840> for

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
go drier than you now we didn't ask for

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.470 
go drier than you now we didn't ask for
a<00:03:53.319> washer-dryer<00:03:53.830> welding<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.150> washing

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
a washer-dryer welding on to the washing

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.070 
a washer-dryer welding on to the washing
machine<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.890> if<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.610> drop<00:03:57.880> if<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.599> can<00:03:58.840> guess

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
machine so if the drop if you can guess

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.449 
machine so if the drop if you can guess
that<00:03:59.110> needs<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.980> be<00:04:00.069> dragged<00:04:00.630> then<00:04:01.630> how<00:04:02.590> do<00:04:03.280> our

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
that needs to be dragged then how do our

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.870 
that needs to be dragged then how do our
record<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.269> don't

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
record I don't

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.850 
record I don't
and<00:04:06.880> I've<00:04:07.600> used<00:04:07.840> all<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:10.200> programs<00:04:11.200> except

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
and I've used all the programs except

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.010 
and I've used all the programs except
full<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.430> hand<00:04:12.610> wash<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.120> next<00:04:13.390> time<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.600> wash

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
full and hand wash the next time I wash

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.819 
full and hand wash the next time I wash
my<00:04:14.370> jumper<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:16.030> delicate<00:04:16.570> jumper<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.200> know

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
my jumper that delicate jumper I know

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:42.050 
my jumper that delicate jumper I know
john<00:04:18.160> wall<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:21.280> then

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.409 

let's<00:04:42.750> see<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.350> balancing<00:04:43.950> crap<00:04:44.220> pause<00:04:45.060> into

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
let's see the balancing crap pause into

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.629 
let's see the balancing crap pause into
a<00:04:45.450> spinning<00:04:45.960> world<00:04:46.200> distribute<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.460> other

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
a spinning world distribute the other

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.550 
a spinning world distribute the other
way<00:04:47.880> undergoing<00:04:48.240> an<00:04:48.419> interest<00:04:48.780> in<00:04:49.110> shortly

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
way undergoing an interest in shortly

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.909 
way undergoing an interest in shortly
machine<00:04:50.250> goes<00:04:50.700> into<00:04:51.090> distribution<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:52.169> then

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
machine goes into distribution and then

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.310 
machine goes into distribution and then
cuts<00:04:53.220> back<00:04:53.370> down<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:54.300> imbalance<00:04:56.750> let's<00:04:57.750> see<00:04:57.870> if

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
cuts back down to imbalance let's see if

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.300 
cuts back down to imbalance let's see if
we'll<00:04:58.560> both<00:04:58.740> at<00:04:58.950> this<00:04:59.100> time<00:05:00.830> no

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
we'll both at this time no

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:22.900 
we'll both at this time no
I<00:05:04.419> think<00:05:05.419> this<00:05:05.510> is<00:05:05.570> it<00:05:05.810> guys<00:05:08.530> here<00:05:09.530> for<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.860> spin

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:36.080 

no<00:05:23.510> water<00:05:23.810> causes<00:05:25.900> imbalance

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.370 

very<00:05:36.750> very<00:05:36.960> imbalance

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
very very imbalance

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:53.629 
very very imbalance
not<00:05:40.010> very<00:05:40.370> very<00:05:40.730> good<00:05:41.030> kind<00:05:41.690> of<00:05:41.750> balanced

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:06:04.830 

we<00:05:54.210> gotta<00:05:54.389> stop<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.139> into<00:05:55.319> a<00:05:55.349> spinning

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.500 

so<00:06:05.470> now<00:06:05.680> accelerating<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.820> spin<00:06:07.060> speed<00:06:09.510> after

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
so now accelerating the spin speed after

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.420 
so now accelerating the spin speed after
the<00:06:10.630> first<00:06:10.870> rinse<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:11.590> where<00:06:12.130> we<00:06:12.400> are
