 subordinate rating and all polls 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.830
 used as a trump war Tymoshenko 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.750
 for example, promises to take the Crimea and and requires 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 dismissal of the defense minister president 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.189

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 for regional and foreign 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.550
 Poroshenko's journalists wanted to start 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.050
 tradition of us hymn but after the first 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.730
 chord and president ukrainian 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 journalists have already put a hand on their hearts 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.899
 the continuation has not sounded 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 Poroshenko immediately goes to the main thing 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.960
 on Sunday promised to submit 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.680

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.750
 priorities are our priorities 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.630
 anti-corruption form update 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.439
 judicial reform reform 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.010
 law enforcement 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.570
 decentralization and reform 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.390

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.720
 security and defense reform 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.380
 the doors of the European Union are open for us i 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.270
 convinced 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.479
 open door voice 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.439
 Europe sounds louder and louder 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.390
 but European perspectives 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.610
 journalists were less interested today 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 almost all questions about the situation in the Donbas 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.990
 Why is the prisoner exchange going so slowly 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.299
 and that with special status for the southeast 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.490
 pageant meets no law 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.860
 Donbassâ€™s special status is not and will not be 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 talk about broad local government and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.689
 . and if the new maidan asks 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.240
 President Poroshenko I joke 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.369
 I get super, I personally consider it as a member 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.780
 first and second maidan that maidan and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.540
 does not decorate Ukraine 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.240
 I exclude that the Maidan in Ukraine will be but 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.350
 they will be with a positive goal 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.460
 Ukrainian President asks and in 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.679
 relationship with the Russian leader 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.910
 Poroshenko said that he and Putin in 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.319
 the next three weeks are required 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.180
 will meet and is already being worked out 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.760
 negotiation program and military assistance 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.260
 Ukraine from abroad in the morning on the site 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.510
 presidential administration published 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.069
 decree of urgent measures to protect and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.040
 strengthening defenses 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.989
 the type of items classified as remaining 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.700
 amaze with the belligerence of the commission 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.980
 Cabinet to work without delay 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.320

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.150

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.000
 uk for military supplies 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.220
 temporarily close all checkpoints on 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.870
 border with Russia but a overlap 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.450
 Poroshenko's borders at a press conference 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.440
 today did not ask more controversy caused 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.630
 lustration law 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.940
 as they are called the feeling of power about those 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.160
 who was connected to the old typewriter mode 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.230
 promised not to sign right away and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.300
 carefully study the project that 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.519
 The deputies were pleased, but is it important ? 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.160
 radicals presidential signature if 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.790
 they have long been satisfied with their lustration 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.790
 everywhere 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.650
 so Ukrainian patriots in Cherkasy 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.640
 sent to the garbage bin deputy 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.790
 regional 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.500
 would send 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.660
 communist deputy trash cans hall 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.780
 meeting of the radicals brought with a stock 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.280
 there are direct threats to withdraw from the election 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.750
 law and superior for so long 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.180
 tell ukrainian today 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.660
 President in Kiev to these people and definitely not 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.700
 need 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.380
 Poroshenko also believes that the main 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.570
 illustration is coming 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.640
 parliamentary elections they seem anyone 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.710
 want to see Ukrainians in power and 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.660
 how aggressively now infected 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.730
 militarists appeals Yulia Tymoshenko 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.770
 continues active attack on 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.470
 the Department of Defense is already a letter 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.230
 Poroshenko and and the party wrote the Minister 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.450
 you are guilty of the deaths of hundreds of soldiers and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.910
 shames the whole army illiterate to 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.300
 general statements tai chan 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.100
 full Ukraine at a time when all 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.170
 country urgently needs strong weapons 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.790
 our ministry of defense sells it 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.920
 weapons to the left we won't it 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.810
 hush up now affairs transferred to 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.850
 the attorney general I will bring this to 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.770
 logical end because it's 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.320
 looks like looting like corruption 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.140
 on the blood and prevent this can not we all 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.370
 we believe and want to live in a new way because the phrase 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.870
 live in a new way 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.120
 This Tymoshenko took from the election 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.820
 Poroshenko campaigns billboards 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.190
 his opponents still remember 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.470
 After all, to live in a new way of Ukraine if it became 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.540
 not exactly as Kiev wanted 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.670
 Khreshchatyk just $ 5 again blocked 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.430
 without Kharkov, the center of the Ukrainian capital 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.870
 forced to get up in traffic after 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.910
 Poroshenko press conferences where 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.040
 Ukrainian President slippery and poke 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.180
 investigation of the tragedy in the Odessa house 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.400
 unions May 2 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.380
 Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs in a hurry with the official 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.360
 Investigation statement completed at 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.800

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.070
 declared wanted but brave 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.710
 by police numbers 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.140
 it remains unclear the main thing so who and why 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.860
 burned alive people in the Odessa house 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.360
 unions 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.590
