00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 yes , I speak again 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.210
 drive the French heavy helmut 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.139
 enk mx 50 120 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.020
 As you can see , this is a typical one 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 The French Tower was added to this 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.990
 reinforced armored vehicle he was 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 Built in 1950 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 and he has a 120mm car unfortunately can 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.640
 without in it when he has finished loading 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.050
 Empire grenades in the magazine or in the car 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 loading mechanism ready 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.790
 and he is a heavy heavy though 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.539
 to fight with him directly at the beginning 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.860
 that is not advisable 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.840
 You have to support him as a bit 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.160
 play from the second row once 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.230
 after the other on the case 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 throw out magazine dodge after 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 long maybe for a job 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.520
 reappear and the enemy 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.520
 then he does his damage 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.670
 you have as many magazines as possible 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.870
 thrown out, say, then fired 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.870
 Did you help a lot? 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.260
 Well that was just a critical hit 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.720
 but gold production or similar 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.160
 I did not want to shoot then 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.910
 maybe that would not be critical 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.910
 been hit 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.430
 I use the favor of the hour and 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.680
 loud times the magazine back to good there 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.780
 I would have a grenade good now 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.520
 can accommodate the last one out 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.500
 magazine 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.110
 but you do not always know who when 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.240
 where it appears you have to go 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.660
 decide and load as a precaution 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.120
 was 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.880
 what good is it if after this right here 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.990
 beautiful enemies stand in front of you and you 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.990
 only has a grenade 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.780
 yes I said you should not 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 beat I'm going to talk straight 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.690
 that is the t 43 English 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:42.810
 I should measure myself with the x3 10 90 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.810
 can 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.020
 also, he must have a grenade 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.520
 we still 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:59.720
 before I say I have one more 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:01.670
 grenade as a reserve then we go 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.970
 Back again and lay to show that 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.620
 We also give the team that idea to me 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.620
 have that interfere with forward 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.570
 if you are partial in such a moment 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.460
 after loading would have wanted to plan afterwards 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.960
 shows it in the cinema twice 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.750
 It does not always help every now and then 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.030
 Now maybe the enemy is focused 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.830
 to kill and storm forward though 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.810
 then I do not have to complain 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.070
 leave behind that it is called why 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.610
 Did not you come forward? 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.610
 and helped 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.360
 si 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.930
 I would have left two grenades like that 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.930
 again after 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.290
 switched off 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.540
 yes, such a quick shot that has nothing 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.450
 that means quick shot I had yes 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.930
 time but I worked sloppily 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.850
 and I load again for the last one 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.830
 magazine that I still have with the 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.170
 normal armor-piercing ammunition 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.870
 then there is just gold ammo for 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.080
 an opponent and when I'm desperate 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.730
 I would have four grenades with me 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.430
 I have these grenades here for 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.520
 the case that you are at a great distance 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.800
 must exclude on one or 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.450
 if i marie our one cap circle 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.950
 7 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:36.940
 It is important to me that I care for everyone 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.940
 set the opponent to zero 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.180
 if it someday no longer works 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.380
 normal ammunition for that is with me 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.380
 never thought 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:13.229
 Well, I would not have run any more 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.680
 managed because we could hear here 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.680
 already tilted 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:33.490
 and yes the keb points simply 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:35.740
 join in and they are now too 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.380
 that we have been worth a class of 2 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.849
 the performance 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:47.650
 then the second best in the team gives way 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:48.940
 2528 fans score four kills I have 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.330
 twelve shots fired 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.630
 10 direct hits 9 effective hits and 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.759
 that was as mentioned in then 2528 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.199
 damage points gave two hits 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.449
 of course that was also true then 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:04.000
 This holds paper 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:07.229
 panzer the french here is just one 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.180
 patent not so wrong one says that 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.229
 harm hold potential I have 560 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.630
 have to plug in 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.229
 Three enemies discovered four enemies 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.599
 damaged four opponents then killed 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:24.460
 damage by player support 642 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:28.780
 and 41 more conquest points I have 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.580
 thanks to premium 42,000 taken since I 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.310
 only normal ammunition shot 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:38.190
 no gold medicine is scarce 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:44.370
 25,000 credits remained over exactly 24 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:47.320
 1872 without premium would then be ten 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:51.460
 1864 loans remained so short 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:55.210
 11,000 credit also not nice or not 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:58.150
 be nice after all because not everyone 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.530
 gaming almost 11,000 credits 

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.039
 takes over the area 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:06.250
 that's not bad then see 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:09.969
 we also have the experience points 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:13.630

 premium or wish you a lot of fun 

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.469
