Red<00:00:38.610> Cliffs<00:00:38.879> back<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.540> functioning<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
Red Cliffs back one is functioning as it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.250 
Red Cliffs back one is functioning as it
should<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> moment<00:00:41.100> though<00:00:41.390> we<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.989> lot

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
should at the moment though we got a lot

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
should at the moment though we got a lot
more<00:00:43.290> room<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.620> improvement<00:00:44.219> which<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
more room for improvement which is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.209 
more room for improvement which is
probably<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> way<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.649> probably<00:00:46.980> good

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
probably in a way that's probably good

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
probably in a way that's probably good
because<00:00:47.550> we've<00:00:48.090> got<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> big<00:00:48.629> games<00:00:48.809> coming

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
because we've got the big games coming

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.420 
because we've got the big games coming
up<00:00:49.200> now<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
up now and you know I think the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.760 
up now and you know I think the
pressures<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.879> us<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.180> perform<00:00:51.539> properly<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
pressures on us to perform properly and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
pressures on us to perform properly and
nothing<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> you've<00:00:54.360> got

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
nothing we can we can do it you've got

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.790 
nothing we can we can do it you've got
to<00:00:54.570> improve<00:00:54.870> quickly<00:00:55.079> though<00:00:55.350> haven't<00:00:55.620> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to improve quickly though haven't you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
to improve quickly though haven't you
well<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.670> only<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:57.270> things<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.629> simple

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

or<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:20.759> they're<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> difference

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
or do you think they're a difference

or do you think they're a difference
though

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
though

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.320 
though
well<00:01:22.920> obviously<00:01:23.280> can't<00:01:23.729> give<00:01:23.880> too<00:01:24.030> much<00:01:24.150> away

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
well obviously can't give too much away

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
well obviously can't give too much away
but<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> few<00:01:25.350> differences<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:26.040> know

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
but there are a few differences we know

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
but there are a few differences we know
how<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> type<00:01:26.520> brother

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
how to type brother

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
how to type brother

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and we're working here to practice well

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.900 
and we're working here to practice well
it<00:01:31.110> seems<00:01:31.350> Mitch<00:01:31.560> Brennan<00:01:31.920> could<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.250> fit<00:01:32.730> for

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
it seems Mitch Brennan could be fit for

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.220 
it seems Mitch Brennan could be fit for
this<00:01:32.970> afternoon's<00:01:33.510> match<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.050> will

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
this afternoon's match and that will

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.690 
this afternoon's match and that will
make<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.530> fairly<00:01:34.740> powerful<00:01:35.040> Red<00:01:35.490> Cliff

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
this afternoon how do you think they can

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.690 
this afternoon how do you think they can
perform<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.440> obviously<00:02:01.979> yeah<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.580> when

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
perform and obviously yeah like it when

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
perform and obviously yeah like it when
it's<00:02:02.820> through<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.030> forge<00:02:03.270> well<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.410> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's through the forge well I think that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.990 
it's through the forge well I think that
says<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.100> strongest<00:02:05.520> point<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.820> their

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
says it's a strongest point is their

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.790 
says it's a strongest point is their
forward<00:02:06.300> packing<00:02:06.630> there<00:02:06.840> our<00:02:07.110> castle<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.560> more

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
forward packing there our castle is more

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.820 
forward packing there our castle is more
Johnny<00:02:08.100> barber<00:02:08.459> would<00:02:08.580> change<00:02:09.030> their<00:02:09.240> tactics

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
Johnny barber would change their tactics

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.230 
Johnny barber would change their tactics
nearly<00:02:10.830> their<00:02:11.400> back<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:11.700> does<00:02:11.850> look<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> lot

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
nearly their back one does look a lot

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.910 
nearly their back one does look a lot
stronger<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.020> they've<00:02:13.440> shown<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:13.770> here

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
stronger so but they've shown all here

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.560 
stronger so but they've shown all here
that<00:02:14.040> their<00:02:14.160> forward<00:02:14.430> Packers<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:15.300> being

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
that their forward Packers is being

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.850 
that their forward Packers is being
dominant<00:02:15.840> location<00:02:16.380> reason<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:16.740> I've

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
dominant location reason what I've

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.680 
dominant location reason what I've
changed<00:02:17.310> though<00:02:17.910> today<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.300> valleys

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
changed though today I think valleys

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.970 
changed though today I think valleys
their<00:02:18.840> techniques<00:02:19.230> after<00:02:19.500> watching<00:02:19.620> Ricky

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
their techniques after watching Ricky

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.440 
their techniques after watching Ricky
play<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> other<00:02:20.370> night<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> need<00:02:20.850> gas<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
play the other night I need gas it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.790 
play the other night I need gas it
seemed<00:02:21.600> pretty<00:02:21.750> simple<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.260> pretty<00:02:22.440> obvious

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
seemed pretty simple or pretty obvious

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.890 
seemed pretty simple or pretty obvious
once<00:02:23.670> Emily<00:02:23.910> could<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.120> torn<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.420> turn<00:02:24.600> turned

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
once Emily could be torn to turn turned

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.970 
once Emily could be torn to turn turned
their<00:02:25.020> forwards<00:02:25.290> around<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.709> much<00:02:25.830> as

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
their forwards around as much as

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.440 
their forwards around as much as
possible<00:02:26.400> trying<00:02:26.580> there<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.270> would<00:02:27.360> be

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
possible trying there that would be

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.360 
possible trying there that would be
tiebreaker<00:02:27.870> forwards<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.470> they're<00:02:29.100> trying

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
tiebreaker forwards and they're trying

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.199 
tiebreaker forwards and they're trying
to<00:02:29.400> take<00:02:29.520> advantage<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.000> situation

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
to take advantage of that situation

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.180 
to take advantage of that situation
there<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.110> think<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> advent<00:02:31.860> of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
there but I think with the advent of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.190 
there but I think with the advent of
Richmond<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.790> back<00:02:32.880> into<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.209> side<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.630> with

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
Richmond and back into the side and with

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.240 
Richmond and back into the side and with
John<00:02:34.350> Murray<00:02:34.560> Bay<00:02:34.739> they're<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> wings

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
John Murray Bay they're in the wings

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.920 
John Murray Bay they're in the wings
bellies<00:02:35.970> approved<00:02:36.269> all<00:02:36.420> year<00:02:36.570> they're<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.840> a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
bellies approved all year they're just a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.210 
bellies approved all year they're just a
bit<00:02:37.050> slow<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> backline<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.130> this

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
bit slow in the backline I think this

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.560 
bit slow in the backline I think this
extra<00:02:38.700> speed<00:02:38.940> there<00:02:39.120> might<00:02:39.269> be<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.540> bit

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
extra speed there might be just a bit

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.840 
extra speed there might be just a bit
too<00:02:39.810> much<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:40.170> Billy's<00:02:40.459> Kevin<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.580> think

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
too much for Billy's Kevin do you think

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.430 
too much for Billy's Kevin do you think
Red<00:02:42.239> Cliff<00:02:42.420> will<00:02:42.540> play<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> similar<00:02:43.110> style<00:02:43.290> of

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
Red Cliff will play a similar style of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.900 
Red Cliff will play a similar style of
football<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.190> Wednesday<00:02:44.760> night

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
football for that of Wednesday night

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.970 
football for that of Wednesday night
yeah<00:02:45.810> well<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.049> think<00:02:46.350> I'll<00:02:46.470> play<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
yeah well I think I'll play for the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.860 
yeah well I think I'll play for the
Fords<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.880> they<00:02:48.030> keep<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.330> pressure<00:02:48.570> on<00:02:48.750> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
Fords and if they keep the pressure on I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.630 
Fords and if they keep the pressure on I
reckon<00:02:49.290> those<00:02:49.440> correct<00:02:49.920> valleys<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
reckon those correct valleys up the
