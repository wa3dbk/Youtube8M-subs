them but if you go over to all and let's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.860 
them but if you go over to all and let's
let's<00:02:40.230> say<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.440> wanted<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.150> disabled<00:02:42.150> Asus<00:02:42.630> my

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
let's say I wanted to disabled Asus my

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.690 
let's say I wanted to disabled Asus my
water<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.860> don't<00:02:43.920> even<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
water and I don't even know what the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.480 
water and I don't even know what the
heck<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.480> would<00:02:45.990> tap<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
heck that is I would tap on that and it

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.400 
heck that is I would tap on that and it
gives<00:02:47.790> me<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.060> option<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.780> stop<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.230> or

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
gives me the option to for stop it or

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.310 
gives me the option to for stop it or
disabled<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.610> would<00:02:50.790> hit<00:02:50.940> disable<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
disabled so I would hit disable if you

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.170 
disabled so I would hit disable if you
disable<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.860> built-in<00:02:53.220> app<00:02:53.460> other<00:02:53.730> apps<00:02:53.970> made
