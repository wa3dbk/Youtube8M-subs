00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
actually looked for a couple more of

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.790 
actually looked for a couple more of
these<00:05:53.570> because<00:05:53.780> I<00:05:53.870> wanted<00:05:54.170> many<00:05:54.500> different

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
these because I wanted many different

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.130
