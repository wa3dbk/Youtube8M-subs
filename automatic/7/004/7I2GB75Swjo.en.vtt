00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.640 
angle on it which is you know that's
that's<00:02:21.360> pretty<00:02:21.570> much<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> only<00:02:21.989> model<00:02:22.500> doing

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
that's pretty much the only model doing

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.590 
that's pretty much the only model doing
that<00:02:22.890> at<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.100> point<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.489> time<00:02:23.640> right

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
that at this point in time right

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.830 
yeah and and this will pull up as much
as<00:02:30.110> any<00:02:30.320> Floyd<00:02:30.740> on<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:32.120> know<00:02:32.240> that<00:02:32.390> has<00:02:32.570> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
as any Floyd on you know that has the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.280 
as any Floyd on you know that has the
what<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> call<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.710> ashtray<00:02:34.190> recess<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
what I call the ashtray recess on it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.710 
what I call the ashtray recess on it
without<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.590> recess<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:37.880> visually<00:02:38.420> I

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
without the recess and I just visually I

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.140 
without the recess and I just visually I
think<00:02:39.620> that's<00:02:40.010> identified<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.790> somebody

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
think that's identified with somebody

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.360 
think that's identified with somebody
else<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.810> like<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.590> top<00:02:42.830> mount<00:02:43.130> and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
else and I like I like the top mount and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.210 
else and I like I like the top mount and
and<00:02:43.550> but<00:02:44.240> there's<00:02:44.420> another<00:02:44.720> reason<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.950> makes

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
and but there's another reason it makes

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.610 
and but there's another reason it makes
the<00:02:46.400> guitar<00:02:46.600> infinitely<00:02:47.600> more<00:02:48.080> comfortable

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the guitar infinitely more comfortable

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.290 
the guitar infinitely more comfortable
to<00:02:48.770> play<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.550> does<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.030> lifts<00:02:50.270> the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
to play it really does it lifts the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.970 
to play it really does it lifts the
strings<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.750> little<00:02:50.780> bit<00:02:51.080> off<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.350> body<00:02:51.560> we<00:02:51.830> can

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
strings a little bit off the body we can

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.810 
strings a little bit off the body we can
raise<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.370> pickups<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:53.120> bit<00:02:54.550> but<00:02:55.550> we

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
raise the pickups a little bit but we

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.800 
raise the pickups a little bit but we
also<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.270> longer<00:02:57.100> spring<00:02:58.100> block<00:02:58.570> which<00:02:59.570> is

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
also have a longer spring block which is

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.350 
also have a longer spring block which is
a<00:02:59.900> longer<00:03:00.410> lever<00:03:00.620> which<00:03:01.100> actually<00:03:01.640> loosens

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
a longer lever which actually loosens

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.670 
a longer lever which actually loosens

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
I think that the ml has become an iconic

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.590 
I think that the ml has become an iconic
guitar<00:03:27.530> kind<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.040> like<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:29.210> Fender

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
guitar kind of like the Fender

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.230 
guitar kind of like the Fender
Stratocaster<00:03:30.170> or<00:03:30.800> less<00:03:31.100> fall<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.030> ml

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
guitar alive and I think that coupled

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.720 
guitar alive and I think that coupled
with<00:03:41.270> buddy's<00:03:41.950> innovations<00:03:42.950> such<00:03:43.280> as<00:03:43.340> you

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
with buddy's innovations such as you

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.400 
with buddy's innovations such as you

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.900 
just very different from anything we
build<00:03:54.890> 24-fret

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.810 
and I think that players when they
picked<00:03:57.830> this<00:03:57.920> up<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.220> feel<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.580> they're<00:03:58.730> gonna

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
picked this up and feel it they're gonna

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.400 
picked this up and feel it they're gonna
see<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.270> difference<00:03:59.300> on<00:03:59.780> this<00:03:59.930> guitar<00:04:00.080> you
