00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
none of the nails have lifted I did spot

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.549 
none of the nails have lifted I did spot
it's<00:00:48.879> probably<00:00:49.239> about<00:00:49.329> two<00:00:49.629> months<00:00:49.989> after<00:00:50.140> we

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
it's probably about two months after we

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.619 
it's probably about two months after we
had<00:00:50.769> moved<00:00:50.949> in<00:00:51.159> one<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.149> nails<00:00:52.329> right

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
had moved in one of the nails right

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.840 
had moved in one of the nails right
along<00:00:52.960> here<00:00:53.350> had<00:00:53.530> popped<00:00:53.739> up<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.129> I<00:00:54.640> just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
along here had popped up and I just

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.460 
along here had popped up and I just
hammered<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:55.420> back<00:00:55.570> in<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.019> I<00:00:56.140> have<00:00:56.259> never

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
hammered it back in and I have never

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.070 
hammered it back in and I have never
noticed<00:00:56.949> another<00:00:57.460> nail<00:00:57.759> move<00:00:58.180> whatsoever<00:00:58.780> and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
noticed another nail move whatsoever and

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.350 
noticed another nail move whatsoever and
have<00:00:59.890> been<00:01:00.009> totally<00:01:00.250> fine<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.790> boards<00:01:01.180> have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
have been totally fine the boards have

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.869 
have been totally fine the boards have
stayed<00:01:02.019> in<00:01:02.320> position<00:01:03.189> as<00:01:03.369> the<00:01:03.519> seasons

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
stayed in position as the seasons

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.929 
stayed in position as the seasons
changed<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.600> humidity<00:01:05.110> changed<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.939> think

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
changed and humidity changed I think

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.850 
changed and humidity changed I think
that's<00:01:07.119> part<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:07.659> due<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.020> how<00:01:08.200> many<00:01:08.409> nails<00:01:08.650> we

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
that's part and due to how many nails we

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.649 
that's part and due to how many nails we
put<00:01:09.070> in<00:01:09.189> it<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.460> was<00:01:09.579> thousands<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.270> thousands

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
put in it it was thousands and thousands

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.990 
put in it it was thousands and thousands
of<00:01:10.720> nails<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:12.009> glue<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.670> fact<00:01:12.909> that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
of nails and the glue and the fact that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.850 
of nails and the glue and the fact that
it's<00:01:13.210> plywood<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:14.170> know<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:14.320> mean<00:01:14.500> it's<00:01:14.650> apply

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
it's plywood you know I mean it's apply

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.260 
it's plywood you know I mean it's apply
because<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.310> has<00:01:15.430> multiple<00:01:15.640> plies<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.000> I

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
because it has multiple plies and I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.060 
because it has multiple plies and I
don't<00:01:16.659> quite<00:01:16.869> remember<00:01:17.049> offhand<00:01:17.439> now<00:01:17.829> if<00:01:17.890> it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
don't quite remember offhand now if it's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.609 
don't quite remember offhand now if it's
three<00:01:18.369> ply<00:01:18.579> or<00:01:18.850> five<00:01:19.060> ply<00:01:19.390> probably<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.439> should

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
three ply or five ply probably we should

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.100 
three ply or five ply probably we should
watch<00:01:20.770> my<00:01:21.040> videos<00:01:21.759> I<00:01:21.880> made<00:01:22.030> before<00:01:22.149> anyway<00:01:22.990> you

of stuff this is a really cool way to go

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.820 
of stuff this is a really cool way to go
they've<00:01:43.600> held<00:01:43.870> up<00:01:43.990> really<00:01:44.200> well<00:01:44.350> especially

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.000 
this room because this one gets a lot of
a<00:01:47.740> beat-down<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.659> my<00:01:49.840> drum<00:01:50.140> room<00:01:50.350> now<00:01:50.590> and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
a beat-down it is my drum room now and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.670 
a beat-down it is my drum room now and
we<00:01:51.190> work<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.520> projects<00:01:51.970> in<00:01:52.090> here<00:01:52.510> so<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.080> do<00:01:53.200> put

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
we work on projects in here so I do put

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.500 
we work on projects in here so I do put
drop<00:01:53.920> cloths<00:01:54.190> here<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:54.760> finishing<00:01:55.390> on

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
drop cloths here and I do finishing on

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.109 
drop cloths here and I do finishing on
projects<00:01:56.220> painting<00:01:57.220> sometimes<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:57.850> drop

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
projects painting sometimes I drop

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.910 
projects painting sometimes I drop
things<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.130> will<00:02:00.280> leave<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> dent<00:02:00.909> like

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
things and it will leave a dent like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.109 
things and it will leave a dent like
right<00:02:02.920> here<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.159> dropped<00:02:03.460> something<00:02:03.610> super

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
right here I dropped something super

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.580 
right here I dropped something super
super<00:02:04.270> heavy<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.659> think<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.990> was<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> corner<00:02:05.470> of

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
super heavy I think that was a corner of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.649 
super heavy I think that was a corner of
a<00:02:05.680> really<00:02:05.950> big<00:02:06.100> dresser<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:07.119> can<00:02:07.210> see<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.450> left

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
a really big dresser you can see it left

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.399 
a really big dresser you can see it left
a<00:02:07.780> dent<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.489> just<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.539> know<00:02:10.569> rolling<00:02:11.140> things

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
a dent but just you know rolling things

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:12.929 
a dent but just you know rolling things
on<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.769> or<00:02:11.890> dragging<00:02:12.340> or<00:02:12.459> whatever<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:12.819> not

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
on it or dragging or whatever it's not

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.130 
on it or dragging or whatever it's not
too<00:02:13.060> big<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.269> deal<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.450> course<00:02:13.689> I<00:02:13.750> wouldn't<00:02:13.900> drag

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
too big a deal of course I wouldn't drag

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.270 
too big a deal of course I wouldn't drag
anything<00:02:14.349> sharp<00:02:14.739> because<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.099> would<00:02:15.250> just

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
anything sharp because that would just

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.089 
anything sharp because that would just
scrape<00:02:15.760> up<00:02:15.939> that<00:02:16.209> polyurethane<00:02:16.900> oh<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
scrape up that polyurethane oh and

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.220 
scrape up that polyurethane oh and
speaking<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.430> polyurethane<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.209> believe<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
speaking of polyurethane I believe the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.860 
speaking of polyurethane I believe the
Sun<00:02:20.590> has<00:02:21.040> somewhat<00:02:21.819> neutralized<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.659> color

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
Sun has somewhat neutralized the color

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.780 
Sun has somewhat neutralized the color
out<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.110> little<00:02:23.439> bit

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
out a little bit

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.000 
out a little bit
I'm<00:02:24.239> trying<00:02:24.510> member<00:02:24.750> now<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.349> washed<00:02:25.739> out

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
I'm trying member now if it washed out

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.849 
I'm trying member now if it washed out
even<00:02:26.340> more<00:02:26.370> or<00:02:26.969> if<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.209> darkened<00:02:27.750> up<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.140> was

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
even more or if it darkened up I was

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.679 
even more or if it darkened up I was
thinking<00:02:29.219> it<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.670> slightly<00:02:30.150> darken

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
thinking it was going to slightly darken

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.300 
thinking it was going to slightly darken
with<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.049> Sun<00:02:31.290> but<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.680> seems<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:32.129> maybe

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
with the Sun but it seems like maybe

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.240 
with the Sun but it seems like maybe
actually<00:02:33.030> or<00:02:33.900> no<00:02:34.109> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.530> was<00:02:34.920> thinking<00:02:35.159> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
actually or no I think I was thinking it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.740 
actually or no I think I was thinking it
was<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.579> wash<00:02:35.819> out<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.329> become<00:02:36.719> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
was going to wash out and become a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.720 
was going to wash out and become a
little<00:02:36.989> paler<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.310> Sun<00:02:38.519> has

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
little paler but I think the Sun has

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.000 
little paler but I think the Sun has
darkened<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.629> that's<00:02:40.260> probably<00:02:40.560> due<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
darkened it so that's probably due to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.490 
darkened it so that's probably due to
the<00:02:41.459> polyurethane<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.480> put<00:02:42.689> on<00:02:42.780> top<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.409> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the polyurethane I put on top and I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.869 
the polyurethane I put on top and I
didn't<00:02:43.709> use<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.950> water<00:02:44.129> base<00:02:44.340> because<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.790> had

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
didn't use the water base because I had

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.360 
didn't use the water base because I had
read<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.510> may<00:02:45.720> possibly<00:02:46.290> rust<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.040> screw

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
read that it may possibly rust the screw

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.879 
read that it may possibly rust the screw
or<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.760> nail<00:02:48.209> heads<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:49.500> didn't<00:02:49.769> want

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
or the nail heads and I didn't want

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.979 
or the nail heads and I didn't want
anything<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.879> that<00:02:50.939> to<00:02:51.209> happen<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.689> I<00:02:51.750> don't

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
anything like that to happen but I don't

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.780 
anything like that to happen but I don't
know<00:02:52.079> if<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.319> really<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:52.739> or<00:02:52.859> not<00:02:53.010> so

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
know if that really would or not so

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.390 
know if that really would or not so
that's<00:02:54.090> why<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.359> use<00:02:54.510> polyurethane<00:02:55.129> one<00:02:56.129> change

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
that's why I use polyurethane one change

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.890 
that's why I use polyurethane one change
I<00:02:56.519> would<00:02:56.579> do<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:57.090> when<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.299> made<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.599> video<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
I would do is when I made the video I

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.390 
I would do is when I made the video I
showed<00:02:58.139> you<00:02:58.170> how<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.470> put<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.159> I<00:02:59.189> just

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
showed you how I put it on and I just

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.819 
showed you how I put it on and I just
had<00:02:59.549> like<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> an<00:03:00.379> applicator<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.470> was<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.769> a

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
had like a an applicator that was like a

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.619 
had like a an applicator that was like a
pad<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.519> kind<00:03:02.669> of<00:03:02.760> like<00:03:02.909> rubbed

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
pad that I just kind of like rubbed

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.599 
pad that I just kind of like rubbed
against<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.560> probably<00:03:04.859> if<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.310> did<00:03:05.489> it

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
against it and I probably if I did it

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.270 
against it and I probably if I did it
nowadays<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.269> would<00:03:07.139> use<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> roller<00:03:07.680> with<00:03:08.250> a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
nowadays I would use a roller with a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.740 
nowadays I would use a roller with a
clear<00:03:08.609> coat<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.909> put<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.269> think<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.659> would

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
clear coat to put it on I think it would

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.140 
clear coat to put it on I think it would
put<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.079> little<00:03:10.319> faster<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.120> probably<00:03:12.120> a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
put it on a little faster and probably a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.240 
put it on a little faster and probably a
little<00:03:12.359> thicker<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.650> anyway<00:03:13.829> they<00:03:13.980> fill<00:03:14.129> up

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
little thicker but anyway they fill up

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.860 
little thicker but anyway they fill up
great<00:03:14.519> they<00:03:14.730> still<00:03:14.939> keep<00:03:15.090> their<00:03:15.269> shine<00:03:15.540> just

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
great they still keep their shine just

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.470 
great they still keep their shine just
like<00:03:15.989> new<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:17.129> don't<00:03:17.370> wear<00:03:17.609> shoes<00:03:17.909> in<00:03:18.389> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
like new we don't wear shoes in the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.899 
like new we don't wear shoes in the
house<00:03:18.659> we<00:03:19.019> do<00:03:19.139> wear<00:03:19.319> just<00:03:19.560> socks<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.189> we<00:03:20.760> don't

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
house we do wear just socks and we don't

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.220 
house we do wear just socks and we don't
have<00:03:21.000> any<00:03:21.150> kids<00:03:21.299> or<00:03:21.480> pets<00:03:21.659> so<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.109> would

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
have any kids or pets so that would

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.069 
have any kids or pets so that would
probably<00:03:22.409> help<00:03:22.650> them<00:03:22.859> last<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.220> lot<00:03:23.310> longer<00:03:23.370> too

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
probably help them last a lot longer too

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.509 
probably help them last a lot longer too
I've<00:03:25.079> had<00:03:25.290> people<00:03:25.439> ask<00:03:25.680> questions<00:03:26.129> about<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
I've had people ask questions about the

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.449 
I've had people ask questions about the
gaps<00:03:26.840> they<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:27.989> not<00:03:28.139> got<00:03:28.349> any<00:03:28.560> bigger<00:03:28.859> or<00:03:29.190> any

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
gaps they have not got any bigger or any

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.649 
gaps they have not got any bigger or any
smaller<00:03:29.849> they've<00:03:30.120> pretty<00:03:30.299> much<00:03:30.359> stayed

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
smaller they've pretty much stayed

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.750 
smaller they've pretty much stayed
exactly<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.169> same<00:03:31.409> yes<00:03:32.099> they<00:03:32.280> do<00:03:32.340> get<00:03:32.609> some

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
exactly the same yes they do get some

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.610 
exactly the same yes they do get some
things<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.150> them<00:03:33.329> every<00:03:34.049> once<00:03:34.199> while<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.470> see

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
things in them every once while you see

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.899 
things in them every once while you see
a<00:03:34.650> little<00:03:34.799> pebble<00:03:35.099> or<00:03:35.340> something<00:03:35.579> like<00:03:35.669> that

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
a little pebble or something like that

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.659 
a little pebble or something like that
really<00:03:36.720> easy<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.169> clean<00:03:37.290> though<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:38.099> normally

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
really easy to clean though we normally

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.759 
really easy to clean though we normally
every<00:03:39.329> time<00:03:39.449> we<00:03:39.569> clean<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.959> always<00:03:40.229> sweep<00:03:40.470> and

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
every time we clean we always sweep and

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.339 
every time we clean we always sweep and
we'll<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.400> do<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.519> really<00:03:41.970> light<00:03:42.180> wet<00:03:43.139> mop

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
we'll I just do a really light wet mop

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.520 
we'll I just do a really light wet mop
like<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:44.389> like<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.419> Swiffer<00:03:45.870> mop<00:03:46.019> where<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.349> just

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
like a like a Swiffer mop where you just

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.659 
like a like a Swiffer mop where you just
you<00:03:46.650> know<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.129> got<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.310> little<00:03:47.400> trigger

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
you know it's got the little trigger

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:48.920 
you know it's got the little trigger
thing<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.389> just<00:03:48.599> spray<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> little

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
thing on it and you just spray a little

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.619 
thing on it and you just spray a little
bit<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:49.979> you<00:03:50.069> mop<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.250> big<00:03:50.519> area<00:03:50.729> and<00:03:51.150> we

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
bit and then you mop a big area and we

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.479 
bit and then you mop a big area and we
try<00:03:51.810> not<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.049> get<00:03:52.139> too<00:03:52.290> much<00:03:52.319> on<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.919> then

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
try not to get too much on it and then

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.159 
try not to get too much on it and then
everyone's<00:03:53.909> well<00:03:54.090> we<00:03:54.269> run<00:03:54.449> a<00:03:54.479> vacuum<00:03:54.690> cleaner

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
everyone's well we run a vacuum cleaner

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.050 
everyone's well we run a vacuum cleaner
if<00:03:55.379> we<00:03:55.530> notice<00:03:55.799> any<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.220> gaps<00:03:56.430> having<00:03:57.000> a

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
if we notice any of the gaps having a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.849 
if we notice any of the gaps having a
little<00:03:57.239> too<00:03:57.359> much<00:03:57.510> stuff<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.709> really

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
little too much stuff but it really

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.399 
little too much stuff but it really
doesn't<00:03:59.129> add<00:03:59.849> up<00:03:59.909> that<00:04:00.479> much<00:04:00.780> at<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.049> we're

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
doesn't add up that much at all we're

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.800 
doesn't add up that much at all we're
gonna<00:04:01.590> done<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:01.919> few<00:04:02.010> times<00:04:02.159> really<00:04:02.810> as

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
gonna done that a few times really as

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.390 
gonna done that a few times really as
for<00:04:04.169> getting<00:04:04.260> water<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.799> them<00:04:05.159> I've<00:04:05.250> seen

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
for getting water on them I've seen

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.920 
for getting water on them I've seen
someone<00:04:05.609> ask<00:04:05.849> if<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.150> delaminate<00:04:06.720> yeah<00:04:06.900> I

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
someone ask if it delaminate yeah I

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.960 
someone ask if it delaminate yeah I
think<00:04:07.079> plywood<00:04:07.590> would<00:04:07.739> ding<00:04:07.919> delaminate<00:04:08.760> head

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
think plywood would ding delaminate head

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.569 
think plywood would ding delaminate head
a<00:04:09.000> ton<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.239> water<00:04:09.479> like<00:04:10.169> if<00:04:10.349> you<00:04:10.439> had<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:11.069> leaky

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
a ton of water like if you had a leaky

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.189 
a ton of water like if you had a leaky
window<00:04:11.939> like<00:04:12.239> this<00:04:12.389> big<00:04:12.629> window<00:04:12.959> back<00:04:13.169> there

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
window like this big window back there

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.890 
window like this big window back there
used<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.859> be<00:04:14.000> leaky<00:04:15.000> before<00:04:15.389> we<00:04:15.540> swapped<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
used to be leaky before we swapped it

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.259 
used to be leaky before we swapped it
out<00:04:15.959> for<00:04:16.139> this<00:04:16.199> new<00:04:16.380> one<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.269> flooring

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
out for this new one and the flooring

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.819 
out for this new one and the flooring
underneath<00:04:18.539> was<00:04:18.900> really<00:04:19.139> rotten<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:19.680> if<00:04:19.739> you

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
underneath was really rotten so if you

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.499 
underneath was really rotten so if you
have<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.949> leaky<00:04:20.250> window<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:21.060> know<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.299> could<00:04:21.449> be

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
have a leaky window you know it could be

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:22.640 
have a leaky window you know it could be
an<00:04:21.599> issue<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:21.959> that's<00:04:22.109> something<00:04:22.349> you<00:04:22.409> got<00:04:22.500> to

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
an issue but that's something you got to

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.399 
an issue but that's something you got to
fix<00:04:22.770> anyway<00:04:23.150> if<00:04:24.150> your<00:04:24.300> house<00:04:24.419> floods<00:04:24.780> sure<00:04:25.139> but

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
fix anyway if your house floods sure but

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.170 
fix anyway if your house floods sure but
I<00:04:25.440> think<00:04:25.530> any<00:04:25.919> wood<00:04:26.159> would<00:04:26.789> probably<00:04:27.060> get

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
I think any wood would probably get

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.420 
I think any wood would probably get
screwed<00:04:27.449> up<00:04:27.509> if<00:04:27.690> your<00:04:27.840> house<00:04:27.960> flooded<00:04:28.409> as<00:04:29.159> for

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
screwed up if your house flooded as for

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.100 
screwed up if your house flooded as for
installing<00:04:29.849> it<00:04:29.970> in<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.150> kitchen<00:04:30.509> I<00:04:30.630> still<00:04:30.930> don't

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
installing it in a kitchen I still don't

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
installing it in a kitchen I still don't
think<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.440> would<00:04:31.590> do<00:04:31.770> that

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
think I would do that

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.010 
think I would do that
there's<00:04:33.580> just<00:04:33.700> too<00:04:33.910> much<00:04:34.060> gunk<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.750> could

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
there's just too much gunk that could

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.730 
there's just too much gunk that could
get<00:04:35.230> in<00:04:35.350> there

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
get in there

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.940 
get in there
I<00:04:35.770> really<00:04:36.520> like<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.820> VCT<00:04:37.350> tile<00:04:38.350> flooring<00:04:38.830> that

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
I really like the VCT tile flooring that

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.430 
I really like the VCT tile flooring that
we<00:04:39.100> did<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.580> even<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.450> even<00:04:40.780> though<00:04:41.290> it's

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
we did and even it even though it's

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.080 
we did and even it even though it's
glued<00:04:41.620> down<00:04:41.800> even<00:04:42.250> some<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.490> them<00:04:42.610> moved<00:04:42.790> I

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
glued down even some of them moved I

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.640 
glued down even some of them moved I
think<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.630> was<00:04:43.720> either<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:44.080> think<00:04:44.140> it's<00:04:44.410> this

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
think it was either I think it's this

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.800 
think it was either I think it's this
line<00:04:44.950> right<00:04:45.160> here<00:04:45.550> has<00:04:46.000> shifted<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.570> little<00:04:46.660> bit

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
line right here has shifted a little bit

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.210 
line right here has shifted a little bit
and<00:04:46.990> if<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.140> get<00:04:47.260> up<00:04:47.350> close<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.620> can<00:04:47.830> see<00:04:48.100> just

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
and if you get up close you can see just

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.340 
and if you get up close you can see just
a<00:04:48.370> little<00:04:48.550> bit<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.820> gap<00:04:49.030> but<00:04:49.720> once<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.200> did

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
a little bit of a gap but once it did

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.530 
a little bit of a gap but once it did
its<00:04:50.560> little<00:04:50.830> shift<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.370> turned<00:04:52.240> out<00:04:52.390> really

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
its little shift it turned out really

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.110 
its little shift it turned out really
well<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.990> let<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.010> plywood<00:04:54.340> themselves<00:04:54.940> the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
well to let the plywood themselves the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.970 
well to let the plywood themselves the
planks<00:04:55.450> themselves<00:04:55.600> have<00:04:56.260> held<00:04:56.560> up<00:04:56.710> really

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
planks themselves have held up really

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.300 
planks themselves have held up really
well<00:04:57.330> have<00:04:58.330> not<00:04:58.480> moved<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.680> heaven<00:04:59.980> bowed<00:05:00.160> or

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
well have not moved the heaven bowed or

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.460 
well have not moved the heaven bowed or
cut<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.940> thought<00:05:01.630> maybe<00:05:01.810> they<00:05:02.020> would<00:05:02.170> but<00:05:02.380> they

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
cut I thought maybe they would but they

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.290 
cut I thought maybe they would but they
haven't<00:05:02.830> but<00:05:03.370> I'm<00:05:03.460> pretty<00:05:03.610> sure<00:05:03.820> like<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.120> said

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
haven't but I'm pretty sure like I said

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.000 
haven't but I'm pretty sure like I said
because<00:05:04.660> they're<00:05:04.840> plywood<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.470> not<00:05:05.620> solid

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
because they're plywood and not solid

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.340 
because they're plywood and not solid
planks<00:05:06.400> think<00:05:07.030> solid<00:05:07.330> planks<00:05:07.690> are<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:07.870> lot<00:05:08.320> more

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
planks think solid planks are a lot more

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.940 
planks think solid planks are a lot more
reactive<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.460> humidity<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.560> season<00:05:11.560> changes

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
reactive to humidity and season changes

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.990 
reactive to humidity and season changes
and<00:05:12.100> things<00:05:12.190> like<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:13.350> let's<00:05:14.350> see<00:05:14.470> what<00:05:14.650> else

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
and things like that let's see what else

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.030 
and things like that let's see what else
over<00:05:16.000> here<00:05:16.030> when<00:05:16.810> we<00:05:16.960> had<00:05:17.200> moved<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.590> couch<00:05:17.770> at

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
over here when we had moved the couch at

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.220 
over here when we had moved the couch at
one<00:05:18.160> time<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.850> did<00:05:19.300> leave<00:05:19.480> an<00:05:19.570> imprint<00:05:19.930> but

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
one time it did leave an imprint but

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.720 
one time it did leave an imprint but
like<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.680> said<00:05:20.740> that's<00:05:21.040> going<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:21.220> happen<00:05:21.580> with

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
like I said that's going to happen with

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.900 
like I said that's going to happen with
a<00:05:22.110> softer<00:05:23.110> wood<00:05:23.260> like<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.560> pine<00:05:23.800> but<00:05:24.550> really

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
a softer wood like the pine but really

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.430 
a softer wood like the pine but really
they<00:05:25.030> filled<00:05:25.270> up<00:05:25.360> awesome<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:25.900> still<00:05:26.200> would<00:05:26.350> do

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
they filled up awesome I still would do

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.260 
they filled up awesome I still would do
them<00:05:26.620> again<00:05:26.920> I<00:05:27.160> think<00:05:27.730> if<00:05:27.850> we<00:05:27.940> ever<00:05:28.030> do<00:05:28.180> another

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
them again I think if we ever do another

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.700 
them again I think if we ever do another
house<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.840> would<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.200> would<00:05:29.380> probably<00:05:29.500> use

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
house I would I would probably use

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.900 
house I would I would probably use
plywood<00:05:29.920> again<00:05:30.250> maybe<00:05:30.430> in<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.640> different

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
plywood again maybe in a different

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.320 
plywood again maybe in a different
pattern<00:05:31.740> because<00:05:32.740> it<00:05:33.010> was<00:05:33.160> nailed<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.880> glued

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
pattern because it was nailed and glued

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.060 
pattern because it was nailed and glued
down<00:05:34.540> you<00:05:34.990> could<00:05:35.140> probably<00:05:35.290> do<00:05:35.500> crazy<00:05:35.770> stuff

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
down you could probably do crazy stuff

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.980 
down you could probably do crazy stuff
you<00:05:36.100> could<00:05:36.370> have<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:37.510> know<00:05:37.690> like

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
you could have you know like

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.080 
you could have you know like
checkerboard<00:05:38.590> or<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.310> could<00:05:39.430> even<00:05:39.550> if<00:05:39.970> you

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
checkerboard or you could even if you

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.240 
checkerboard or you could even if you
wanted<00:05:40.390> to<00:05:40.510> get<00:05:40.630> really<00:05:40.960> in-depth<00:05:41.260> like<00:05:41.560> you

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
wanted to get really in-depth like you

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.320 
wanted to get really in-depth like you
know<00:05:42.340> all<00:05:42.520> kinds<00:05:42.670> of<00:05:42.880> shapes<00:05:43.090> that<00:05:43.270> fit

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
know all kinds of shapes that fit

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.640 
know all kinds of shapes that fit
together<00:05:43.720> almost<00:05:43.870> like<00:05:44.020> a<00:05:44.110> puzzle<00:05:44.200> or

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
together almost like a puzzle or

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.470 
together almost like a puzzle or
something<00:05:44.680> like<00:05:44.920> that<00:05:44.980> maybe<00:05:45.700> a<00:05:45.820> bit<00:05:46.000> much<00:05:46.180> but

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
something like that maybe a bit much but

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.930 
something like that maybe a bit much but
it<00:05:46.750> could<00:05:46.900> be<00:05:46.990> kind<00:05:47.140> of<00:05:47.170> cool<00:05:47.700> anyway<00:05:48.700> yeah

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
it could be kind of cool anyway yeah

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.340 
it could be kind of cool anyway yeah
that's<00:05:49.120> how<00:05:49.210> they've<00:05:49.390> held<00:05:49.540> up<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.840> think

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
that's how they've held up I think

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.480 
that's how they've held up I think
they've<00:05:50.440> done<00:05:50.470> really<00:05:50.740> well<00:05:50.920> still<00:05:51.340> look

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
they've done really well still look

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.340 
they've done really well still look
really<00:05:51.760> great<00:05:51.850> sure<00:05:52.720> it's<00:05:52.870> not<00:05:53.020> everyone's

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
really great sure it's not everyone's

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.860 
really great sure it's not everyone's
cup<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.590> tea<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:53.860> nothing<00:05:54.520> is<00:05:54.730> and<00:05:55.030> I<00:05:55.660> think

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
cup of tea but nothing is and I think

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.030 
cup of tea but nothing is and I think
they're<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.020> lot<00:05:56.140> easier<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.620> maintain<00:05:56.770> than

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
they're a lot easier to maintain than

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.730 
they're a lot easier to maintain than
carpet<00:05:57.700> they<00:05:58.600> don't<00:05:58.780> smell<00:05:59.050> like<00:05:59.110> carpet<00:05:59.590> they

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
carpet they don't smell like carpet they

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.560 
carpet they don't smell like carpet they
don't<00:05:59.920> hold<00:06:00.010> the<00:06:00.190> gunk<00:06:00.370> like<00:06:00.550> carpet<00:06:01.000> you

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
don't hold the gunk like carpet you

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.940 
don't hold the gunk like carpet you
actually<00:06:01.990> know<00:06:02.110> if<00:06:02.230> you're<00:06:02.350> cleaning<00:06:02.590> them<00:06:02.800> or

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
actually know if you're cleaning them or

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.550 
actually know if you're cleaning them or
not<00:06:03.100> unlike<00:06:03.430> carpet<00:06:03.790> and<00:06:04.260> it<00:06:05.260> was<00:06:05.380> probably

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
not unlike carpet and it was probably

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.040 
not unlike carpet and it was probably
cheaper<00:06:06.100> than<00:06:06.220> carpet<00:06:06.490> too<00:06:06.640> so<00:06:06.970> anyway<00:06:07.660> there

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
cheaper than carpet too so anyway there

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.210 
cheaper than carpet too so anyway there
you<00:06:08.080> go<00:06:08.230> I<00:06:08.260> thought<00:06:08.470> give<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:08.740> an<00:06:08.800> update<00:06:08.920> one

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
you go I thought give you an update one

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.460 
you go I thought give you an update one
year<00:06:09.370> later
