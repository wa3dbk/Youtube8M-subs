 and because i have so much experience with the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.609

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.500
 growing up a milk cow many of 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 lot of big machines by the counter 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.130
 the daily make sure we with 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 we were supplied with food 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.370
 in the agricultural institute house 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
 riswick and we can go there ne 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.739
 Round and co here you see a fresh 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.539
 born calf we were lucky because that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.039
 is completely born the night before 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.260
 important for the little calves is the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.030
 first milk the mum stuck there 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 Every quantity of nutrients is as close as 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.920
 exchange in behind it cold Voeckler 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.699
 now gets so every day in the morning and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.710
 in the evening three liters of milk moment three 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.820
 liter that does not sound so much that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.820
 I drink easily 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.890
 three liters do not open again at once 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.479
 no case the whole procedure goes 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.759
 now about twelve weeks like that and 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.159
 After that , the calf may be solid food too 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.960
 for example, corn gras and 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.049
 fodder and the calves take like that 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.179
 every day up to 800 grams in age 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.070
 15 months is from the small calf 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.409
 A big beef has become time for the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.020
 looking for beautiful things in the life of the farmer 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.929
 from a catalog the suitable want 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.729
 for the winter with the artificial 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.530
 Fertilization can be so targeted by the farmer 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.020
 make breeding that animals long 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.670
 live healthy life and every amount of milk 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.920
 give that is in pregnant it takes 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.899
 nine months to the birth and with the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.240
 birth becomes a cow or a cow 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.410
 It will be hot milk produce 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.330
 Most cows will come with one 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.130
 milking machine communities two to three times 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.900
 Every day is then off to the way 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.590
 The machine creates about two liters 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.569
 per minute 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.880
 and the cows give on average per day 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.470
 I have about 30 liters of it with me 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.450
 always tried it myself and I know 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.610
 it yes from the training team with 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.610
 the hands just really not much 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.069
 that takes me too long to mine 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.900
 poor hurts he is just really good 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.390
 that the milking machine gives so much 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.310
 to produce milk a cow 70 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.780
 kilograms of food a day after 50 days 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.739
 It will be time to get pregnant again 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.690
 the last month of pregnancy 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.510
 the cow comes down a bit 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.290
 recovering is no milk has quasi 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.940
 a round wellness if the cow again 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.830
 has cut is called milk again 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.260
 produce and that's the way it always works 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.120
 takes live on in the life of the cow 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.019
 about five to seven years in the 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.450
 time gives a cow 30 to 50 thousand 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.980
 liter of milk and gets three to five 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.140
 you would have thought that offspring 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.700
 give the animals as much milk and how 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.170
 a lot of milk you drink so write us 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.519
 like to comment and forget 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.530
 not even to write purely what 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.410
 you are still so interested here it goes 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.330
 to the first episode and I will open now 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.720
 no case again three liters of milk 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.720
 drink
