00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
doing that is it destroys by eighty

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.359 
doing that is it destroys by eighty
percent<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> nutrients<00:01:04.140> same<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.220> with

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
percent of the nutrients same thing with

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
percent of the nutrients same thing with
it<00:01:05.909> gives<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> long<00:01:06.570> shelf<00:01:06.810> life<00:01:06.990> and

these are actually reusable bottles as

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.620 
these are actually reusable bottles as
well<00:04:54.450> they're<00:04:55.380> bpa-free<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.970> it's<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.300> size<00:04:57.510> of

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
well they're bpa-free so it's a size of

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.360 
well they're bpa-free so it's a size of
a<00:04:57.690> vitamin<00:04:58.169> water<00:04:58.380> bottle<00:04:58.770> but<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:58.950> vitamin

water bottle you cannot reuse or wash

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.570 
water bottle you cannot reuse or wash
because<00:05:02.910> if<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.270> do<00:05:03.620> any<00:05:04.620> heat<00:05:04.950> exposure<00:05:05.280> at

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
because if you do any heat exposure at

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.120 
because if you do any heat exposure at
all<00:05:05.700> you'll<00:05:06.300> actually<00:05:06.479> leaked<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.530> BP<00:05:08.100> a

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
all you'll actually leaked the the BP a

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.340 
all you'll actually leaked the the BP a
chemical<00:05:08.700> in<00:05:08.790> there<00:05:08.970> which<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:09.900> toxic

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
chemical in there which is a toxic

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.340 
chemical in there which is a toxic
chemical<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:11.570> actually<00:05:12.570> can<00:05:12.930> do<00:05:13.080> harm<00:05:13.290> to

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
chemical and actually can do harm to

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.170 
chemical and actually can do harm to
your<00:05:13.500> body<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.950> these<00:05:14.100> are<00:05:14.250> bpa-free<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.090> you

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
your body and these are bpa-free so you

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.510 
your body and these are bpa-free so you
can<00:05:15.300> actually<00:05:15.450> rewash<00:05:15.990> them<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:17.130> it's<00:05:17.370> no

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
can actually rewash them and it's no

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.950 
can actually rewash them and it's no
problem<00:05:17.880> at<00:05:17.940> all<00:05:18.000> so<00:05:18.300> that's<00:05:18.450> what<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:18.660> only

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
problem at all so that's what you only

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.060 
problem at all so that's what you only
encourages<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.560> do<00:05:19.710> rather<00:05:19.919> than

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
encourages you to do rather than

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.129 
encourages you to do rather than
throwing<00:05:20.400> away<00:05:20.639> all<00:05:20.850> these<00:05:21.330> plastic<00:05:21.780> bottles

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
throwing away all these plastic bottles

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.140 
throwing away all these plastic bottles
just<00:05:22.889> reuse<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.370> bottle<00:05:23.639> then<00:05:23.790> just<00:05:24.000> simply

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
just reuse the bottle then just simply

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.480 
just reuse the bottle then just simply
get<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:24.540> caps<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:25.050> blast<00:05:25.260> them<00:05:25.530> so<00:05:25.740> anyway<00:05:26.460> I

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490
