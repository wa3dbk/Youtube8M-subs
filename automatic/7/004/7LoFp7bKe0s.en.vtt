00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
if it's it should say third-person cage

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.180

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
big mw2 they took it out like that patch

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.369 
big mw2 they took it out like that patch
came<00:05:33.849> they<00:05:34.090> took<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.479> third<00:05:34.659> person<00:05:34.840> cage<00:05:35.169> was

to<00:05:35.500> me<00:05:35.590> people<00:05:35.770> boosting<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.300> yeah<00:05:37.839> basically

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
to me people boosting so yeah basically

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.439 
to me people boosting so yeah basically
i'll<00:05:38.800> show<00:05:38.949> you<00:05:39.009> what<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.279> is<00:05:39.370> it's<00:05:40.089> just<00:05:40.180> two

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
i'll show you what it is it's just two

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.990 
i'll show you what it is it's just two
people<00:05:40.560> if<00:05:41.560> they<00:05:41.830> took<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.159> out<00:05:42.279> because<00:05:42.669> of

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
people if they took it out because of

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.269 
people if they took it out because of
boosting<00:05:43.509> and<00:05:43.659> everything<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.139> so<00:05:44.979> I<00:05:45.009> think

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
boosting and everything and so I think

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.999 
boosting and everything and so I think
that's<00:05:45.639> why<00:05:45.789> but<00:05:46.060> yeah<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:47.379> they<00:05:47.560> took<00:05:47.800> that

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
that's why but yeah so they took that

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.939 
that's why but yeah so they took that
out<00:05:48.039> and<00:05:48.460> um<00:05:49.000> this<00:05:49.690> basically<00:05:49.900> go<00:05:50.500> back<00:05:50.529> on<00:05:50.919> it

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
out and um this basically go back on it

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.459 
out and um this basically go back on it
so<00:05:51.339> third<00:05:51.699> person<00:05:52.060> cage<00:05:52.240> match<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.750> basically

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469 
so third person cage match and basically

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.350 
so third person cage match and basically
you<00:05:53.710> can<00:05:53.860> play<00:05:54.009> with<00:05:54.129> anybody<00:05:54.460> with<00:05:54.789> Papa<00:05:55.089> said
