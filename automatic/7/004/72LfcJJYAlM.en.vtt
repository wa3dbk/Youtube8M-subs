00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.010
 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.660
 today brings a video by the time you already 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.650
 can see that it's going to be a video 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 fast 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 at first because we are saying tips 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 make-up and remember to spend 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 to make this kind videos you are watching 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.349
 with the title of quick tips 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.869
 pencil makeup in the eyes ian vaz 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.210
 encabula pistorius but I will be very 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.309
 more videos so quick tips like a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 product or other a technique and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.739
 physically it will be from there because I have 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.469
 very habit before bedtime 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.600
 being in the number was watching videos and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.079
 others in october october 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.390
 ian and do much this before bed and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.640
 I do not really like watching videos that are 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.059
 very complex to predict a very 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.980
 than 20 minutes I have 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.079
 that being with much time available 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.940
 which is often not the case and I 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.739
 I got to think with a part of mine. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 videos have this prayer 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.920
 so I thought it was a good idea to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.490
 continue with the videos I 'm 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.200
 do 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 but once in a while do one at a time 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.909
 so shorter as well express 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 for those who have little time like 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.320
 It happens to me to see the same 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.990
 orbit so I bring our 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.390
 first tip in makeup makeup I 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.000
 I do not know if we have to and are now without 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.340
 pencil is that in the water line of the eyes of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.860
 who looks has shadow but down here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.600
 I do not have to put you with 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.299
 a lot of people think I put there 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.060
 pistorius just put it and stay here 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.700
 a basic risk that does not make a joke 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.030
 no one at a step is weird that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.860
 it's education walks shade when smoking 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.810
 we do with four for much more 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.670
 time becomes much more beautiful because I go 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.740
 zoom in to see us then I will 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.500
 start the pencil 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 I tutored and returned in the areas 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.439
 poor because it is well pigmented and is very 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 very economical that I'm beautiful that I 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.250
 the master weave of dan in full color 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.110
 winer I want to make I'm going to pull the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.150
 the water line out with you 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.390
 You can see and I'll put 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.129
 the black pencil on the water line I know 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.290
 there are a lot of people put so department 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.060
 but this can be very dangerous because 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.400
 we get pencils in the eyeball 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.709
 can become extremely rigorous and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.530
 dangerous and ready 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.349
 this way we put pencil 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.109
 eyes so year and did not finance 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.569
 without hurting my eye and now I'm going to study 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.629
 apart size we might have 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.439
 to take off here is the water line of the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:49.730
 eyeball and move the movement in 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:52.940
 the whole line of eyes have a hundred percent 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.290
 It is likely that I will never 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.290
 what do you think the county is at once 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.680
 in when they mark and seek the eye 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.889
 this increase is the pencil that almost all the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.730
 people often use the 3 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:13.099
 1 and did not have that she was not going to the mother 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.590
 to be so manipulated in my idea 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.230
 too artificial because that 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.500
 same law as the beginning and end of the pencil 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.150
 1 and something tends to vote with 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.489
 much easier 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.199
 so now I 'm going to do it and I'll get it 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.459
 do not think so 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:33.949
 the boy's mother how are you going to see you? 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.949
 can use what you see fit and 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:40.430
 I'm going to use a black shadow and I'm going 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:43.669
 to use this black shadow is that 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.489
 palette the dynamics were you will see that 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:48.760
 she herself black black black is black mate 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.799
 but if I wanted I could use 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.829
 shadow on what to understand this disease 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.989
 and chestnut could be gained by an effect 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.760
 more natural there is also a shadow 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.870
 colored then can be the black shadow 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.510
 to go 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.229
 according to the black pencil and now the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.889
 that was led with paintbrush estva 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:13.690
 show the line of 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:16.010
 Eyelashes for passing my black shadow 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.919
 go to the corner 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:23.540
 Okay, and now, in the last step, what I'm going to do 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:30.140
 to do is to move away again and I will pass 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.830
 is the black pencil also had no 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.990
 Water 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.230
 This is who is going to make this this shadow 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.050
 that we just put here 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.240
 in the water line will the pencil stay and go 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.670
 make content much longer 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.500
 the waterproof pencils I already automatic 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.090
 improved much more time with the track 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.470
 normal but if you want it with a 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.690
 normal pencil and will not last much longer 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.980
 time if they come with the pencil to the test 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:01.670
 water and will last 1.1 million thy 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.800
 as you can by green law compare 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.440
 one eye with the other 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.440
 it seems that this already has another massively 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.510
 a much more elaborate makeup 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.330
 while it is much more basic to 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.480
 thing until you hurt another 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.950
 shadow cage here will notice itself while 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.420
 which take away this aspect much more 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.860
 formed even much sexier and so 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.020
 I think it gets much better 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.010
 often do not do this until they can 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.810
 do like the swab that does not take 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:38.060
 hardly any time is a minute and only 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:40.280
 smoking with the component then one with a 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.680
 brush alone or with a cotton swab 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.170
 can for a new car can spare for 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.170
 outside and a care inside closed the 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.910
 eye to transfer up and is 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.790
 now we have both eyes placed 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.550
 they are checking the makeup because 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.860
 much more worked much more sensual 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.320
 much more beautiful and does not take time 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.900
 none is so bad that we put can 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.960
 be the color of the pencil that we 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.940
 not so they can build on that as 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.340
 may also not have any type of 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.680
 relationship of course I did not put 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.710
 could have ended with a year as 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.960
 magic of the state but I always looked and 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.030
 because we are seeing is the cd already 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.440
 which has no mirror and is gaining by 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.910
 here to point things out because it was 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.010
 also what is where I'm at 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.250
 look to expand the exchange is 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.440
 here is a very quick tutorial with a 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.810
 tip that I hope for many of 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.720
 you are dominated and for others you 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.630
 be novelty 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.700
 December to remember and tomorrow to do 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.350
 your makeup and you too and put 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.850
 in practice this rich 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.310
 also forget about more tips and 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.690
 tricks can insert my facebook the 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.120
 my instagram 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.250
 I mean, remember that foolish side 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.470
 crazy in that I went back there all the information 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.720
 this video and know that I always have 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.120
 what is the urne that I am using 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.880
 What's the button taking out when I say 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.950
 in the video itself I thought 'all over the 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.660
 information so do not forget to 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.910
 to write here the channel that I am very 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.910
 happy an imaginary and the next biennium
