00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 here we have a sector in the hospital 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.779
 of the clinics that I can regret I can 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.420
 see my height and then I'll find out 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.710
 my mcs explaining in other words 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 that mile and they and it's a way let's 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.420
 say easy to calculate if the individual 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 are overweight or obese or have 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.189
 is malnourished and that is not the case 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.380
 then you lose the individual and see 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 High I can weigh myself clear. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.140
 and then I'm calculating one more step 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.800
 by step when I was going to c while 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.800
 gilberto baby 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.920

 young 60's and 80's have done all kinds 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.579
 of diets and I'm meaningful and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.610
 Then I'll tell you what I do. 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.170
 I eat well and I'm fat means that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 you played without we'll see now 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.399
 height 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 Then I'm going to share this bosom with Gilberto. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.110
 by the height of it and again by the height 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.000
 while 1 77 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 the 77 then gilberto has to proceed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.530
 tomorrow among 33 that promise us 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.939
 square 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.890
 Gilberto, I'll tell you something. 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.549

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 classified as obese because overweight 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.939
