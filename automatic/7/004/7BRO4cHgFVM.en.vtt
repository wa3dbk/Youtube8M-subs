00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
running on Android 4.4 KitKat I was too

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.590 
running on Android 4.4 KitKat I was too
surprised<00:00:29.029> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:31.790> see<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:33.270> connects

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
120 and running on 4.4 KitKat so I think

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010 
120 and running on 4.4 KitKat so I think
the<00:00:38.010> new<00:00:38.190> version<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.790> running<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.360> KitKat<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the new version is running on KitKat and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650 
the new version is running on KitKat and
under<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> storage<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.820> another<00:00:42.239> thing<00:00:42.510> I'd

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
under the storage that another thing I'd

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
under the storage that another thing I'd

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
ever dimension is this storage

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.500 
ever dimension is this storage
department<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.070> coming<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> 4gb

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
department it is not coming from the 4gb

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
department it is not coming from the 4gb
it<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> coming<00:00:49.289> they'll<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.680> go<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.950> space

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
it is coming they'll see to go to space

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.639 
it is coming they'll see to go to space
of<00:00:50.520> four<00:00:50.789> point<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.390> gb<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.500> internal<00:00:52.710> storage

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
of four point two gb of internal storage

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.920 
of four point two gb of internal storage
out<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> which<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.719> application

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
out of which you get an application

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.760 
out of which you get an application
storage<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.859> eight<00:00:59.550> nine<00:01:00.000> point<00:01:00.899> eight<00:01:01.530> nine

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
storage of eight nine point eight nine

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.759 
storage of eight nine point eight nine
gb<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.809> application<00:01:03.809> storage<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.470> mass

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
gb of application storage and a mass

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.899 
gb of application storage and a mass
storage<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.309> 5.2<00:01:06.030> heb<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> very<00:01:06.990> good

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
storage of 5.2 heb so it's a very good

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.780 
storage of 5.2 heb so it's a very good
consider<00:01:08.909> enterprise<00:01:09.439> it<00:01:10.439> also<00:01:10.710> supports<00:01:11.130> usb

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
consider enterprise it also supports usb

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.719 
consider enterprise it also supports usb
OTG<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.650> running<00:01:14.040> app<00:01:14.159> let's<00:01:14.490> go<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
OTG so it's running app let's go to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
OTG so it's running app let's go to
applications<00:01:15.540> let's<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.470> RAM<00:01:16.740> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
applications let's see how much RAM is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.030 
applications let's see how much RAM is
actually<00:01:17.460> running<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.170> total

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
actually running out of so is total

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.240 
actually running out of so is total
running<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> 504<00:01:24.810> mb<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.170> ram

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.530 

you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.760> phone<00:01:29.940> storage<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.540> 646<00:01:31.490> so

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
you can see the phone storage is 646 so

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
you can see the phone storage is 646 so
it's<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:33.660> nice<00:01:33.950> now<00:01:34.950> looking<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it's very nice now looking at the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
it's very nice now looking at the
benchmarks<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.300> actually<00:01:36.480> tried<00:01:36.900> several

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
benchmarks I actually tried several

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.500 
benchmarks I actually tried several
quadrant<00:01:38.190> standards<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.270> need<00:01:39.480> a

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
quadrant standards and as well as need a

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.360 
quadrant standards and as well as need a
mark<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.110> ensure<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.190> is<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
mark to ensure that what is the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.040 
mark to ensure that what is the
performance<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:42.000> will<00:01:42.120> look<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:45.690> in

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
performance we will look like so so in

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.270 
performance we will look like so so in
Quadrant<00:01:46.620> I<00:01:47.360> got<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> whopping<00:01:48.780> score<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.380> 85<00:01:49.980> 0

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
Quadrant I got a whopping score of 85 0

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.150 
Quadrant I got a whopping score of 85 0
2<00:01:50.460> which<00:01:50.730> is<00:01:50.760> very<00:01:51.120> nice<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:52.160> Japan

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
2 which is very nice of Japan

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.310 
2 which is very nice of Japan

Abed<00:02:17.130> will<00:02:17.310> increase<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.000> FPS<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.930> didn't

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
Abed will increase the FPS but it didn't

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.640 
Abed will increase the FPS but it didn't
so<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.250> stick<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.640> 52.7<00:02:21.600> FPS<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.440> as

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
so it's stick to 52.7 FPS we just as

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.960 
so it's stick to 52.7 FPS we just as
previous<00:02:23.220> as<00:02:24.530> any<00:02:25.530> jelly<00:02:25.710> bean<00:02:25.890> version<00:02:26.990> so
