the amount of buds coming on us on every
shoot<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.720> see<00:04:10.870> there<00:04:11.079> you<00:04:11.109> get<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.440> bunch<00:04:11.650> of

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
shoot you see there you get a bunch of

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.590 
shoot you see there you get a bunch of
flowers<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:12.549> it's<00:04:12.670> important<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.239> feed<00:04:13.450> them

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
flowers but it's important to feed them

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.150 
flowers but it's important to feed them
that's<00:04:13.989> critical<00:04:14.470> because<00:04:14.500> you're<00:04:14.769> expecting

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
that's critical because you're expecting

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.310 
that's critical because you're expecting
the<00:04:15.250> plant<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.670> grow<00:04:15.760> from<00:04:16.000> this<00:04:16.150> up<00:04:16.539> to<00:04:16.959> two<00:04:17.289> or

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
the plant to grow from this up to two or

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.390 
the plant to grow from this up to two or
three<00:04:17.470> feet

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
three feet

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.849 
three feet
no<00:04:19.000> it's<00:04:19.269> not<00:04:19.509> lots<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.989> nutrition<00:04:20.500> lots<00:04:20.739> of

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
no it's not lots of nutrition lots of

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.620 
no it's not lots of nutrition lots of
feeding<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:22.030> indeed<00:04:22.300> when<00:04:22.509> you're

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
feeding and and indeed when you're

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.900 
feeding and and indeed when you're
planting<00:04:22.870> new<00:04:23.110> roses<00:04:23.500> use<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.130> sea<00:04:24.550> mungus

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
planting new roses use the sea mungus

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.610 
planting new roses use the sea mungus
fertilizer<00:04:25.419> that's<00:04:25.930> important<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.410> get<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
fertilizer that's important to get the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.320 
fertilizer that's important to get the
roots<00:04:26.830> going<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.580> if<00:04:27.669> you're<00:04:27.789> planting<00:04:28.180> new

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
roots going so if you're planting new

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.090 
roots going so if you're planting new
roses<00:04:28.840> in<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.020> garden<00:04:29.050> use<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:29.889> particular

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
roses in the garden use this particular

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.400 
roses in the garden use this particular
fertilizer<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.090> then<00:04:31.360> once<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.780> month<00:04:31.930> use<00:04:32.229> the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
fertilizer and then once a month use the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.870 
fertilizer and then once a month use the
sudden<00:04:32.680> impact<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.220> that'll<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.699> keep

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
sudden impact and that'll really keep

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.580 
sudden impact and that'll really keep
them<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.300> think<00:04:34.479> it's<00:04:34.570> easy<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.110> grow<00:04:35.320> yes

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
them and I think it's easy to grow yes

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.379 
them and I think it's easy to grow yes
absolutely<00:04:36.130> as<00:04:36.430> long<00:04:36.610> as<00:04:36.729> you<00:04:36.820> feed<00:04:37.030> them<00:04:37.210> and

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
absolutely as long as you feed them and

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.520 
absolutely as long as you feed them and
as<00:04:37.509> long<00:04:37.630> as<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.810> use<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.930> little<00:04:38.229> bit<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.470> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
as long as you use a little bit of the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.260 
as long as you use a little bit of the
rule<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.770> clear<00:04:38.889> you'll<00:04:39.400> have<00:04:39.580> tremendous

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
rule is clear you'll have tremendous

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.580 
rule is clear you'll have tremendous
color<00:04:40.509> right<00:04:40.750> through<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.139> end<00:04:41.199> of<00:04:41.380> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.409 
color right through to the end of the
summer<00:04:41.800> they're<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.370> easy<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.669> grow<00:04:42.729> once<00:04:43.330> you

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
summer they're so easy to grow once you

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.219 
summer they're so easy to grow once you
put<00:04:43.539> them<00:04:43.660> into<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.810> garden<00:04:44.020> you're

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
literally when when they are flowering

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.870 
literally when when they are flowering
do<00:05:08.199> you<00:05:08.289> do<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.650> try<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:08.949> prune<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.490> back<00:05:09.669> then

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
do you do you try and prune it back then

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.640 
do you do you try and prune it back then
as<00:05:10.060> well<00:05:10.090> as<00:05:10.270> you<00:05:10.570> just<00:05:10.750> leave<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.139> when<00:05:11.320> when

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
as well as you just leave it when when

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.779 
as well as you just leave it when when
they're<00:05:11.800> flowering<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.250> flowering<00:05:12.520> begins

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
they're flowering the flowering begins

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.760 
they're flowering the flowering begins
to<00:05:12.910> go<00:05:13.030> over<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.419> can<00:05:13.449> deadhead<00:05:13.990> them<00:05:14.020> yes<00:05:14.500> so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
to go over you can deadhead them yes so

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.810 
to go over you can deadhead them yes so
you<00:05:14.830> do<00:05:14.979> know<00:05:15.130> something<00:05:15.160> about<00:05:15.610> the

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
you do know something about the

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.159 
you do know something about the
hardening<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:16.509> when<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.960> flower<00:05:17.139> is

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
hardening so when the flower is

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.719 
hardening so when the flower is
beginning<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.590> fade<00:05:17.770> just<00:05:17.889> cut<00:05:18.190> them<00:05:18.340> back<00:05:18.460> and

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
beginning to fade just cut them back and

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.310 
beginning to fade just cut them back and
that'll<00:05:19.060> encourage<00:05:19.300> new<00:05:19.599> roses<00:05:19.930> again<00:05:20.020> so

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
that'll encourage new roses again so

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.960 
that'll encourage new roses again so
maybe<00:05:20.470> in<00:05:20.620> July<00:05:20.889> and<00:05:21.070> August<00:05:21.160> tidy<00:05:21.669> them<00:05:21.880> up

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
maybe in July and August tidy them up

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.939 
maybe in July and August tidy them up
and<00:05:22.180> you'll<00:05:22.539> encourage<00:05:23.229> new<00:05:23.410> growth<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.889> new

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
and you'll encourage new growth and new

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.469 
and you'll encourage new growth and new
flowers<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.550> last<00:05:24.729> as<00:05:24.970> long<00:05:25.180> as<00:05:25.330> you're

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
flowers the last as long as you're

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.790 
flowers the last as long as you're
feeding<00:05:25.810> as<00:05:25.960> long<00:05:26.199> as<00:05:26.289> you're<00:05:26.440> feeding<00:05:26.620> the

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
feeding as long as you're feeding the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.350 
feeding as long as you're feeding the
roses<00:05:27.130> so<00:05:27.729> when<00:05:27.849> you<00:05:27.910> prune<00:05:28.090> them<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.300> the

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
roses so when you prune them in the
