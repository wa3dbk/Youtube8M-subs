the whole country used to be and how far
we've<00:02:41.569> come<00:02:41.599> when<00:02:42.290> we<00:02:42.379> think<00:02:42.409> of<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.860> old<00:02:43.010> west

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
we've come when we think of the old west

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.250 
we've come when we think of the old west
on<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.670> beginning<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.569> Industrial

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
on the beginning of the Industrial

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.470 
on the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution<00:02:45.340> we<00:02:46.340> get<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.519> concept<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.150> these

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
Revolution we get a concept that these

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.589 
Revolution we get a concept that these
two<00:02:47.810> timeline<00:02:48.500> are<00:02:48.739> far<00:02:49.370> apart<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.970> reality

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
two timeline are far apart in reality

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.170 
two timeline are far apart in reality
the<00:02:51.019> only<00:02:51.349> difference<00:02:51.769> is<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.190> location<00:02:52.579> so

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
the only difference is the location so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.089 
the only difference is the location so
with<00:02:53.359> red<00:02:53.569> dead<00:02:53.750> redemption<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.410> those<00:02:54.799> days

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
with red dead redemption to those days

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.000 
with red dead redemption to those days
we'll<00:02:55.579> have<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.879> whole<00:02:56.239> gasp<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.560> there's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
we'll have a whole gasp of that there's

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.229 
we'll have a whole gasp of that there's
still<00:02:58.099> no<00:02:58.340> release<00:02:58.519> date<00:02:58.640> for<00:02:58.909> red<00:02:59.209> dead
