systems<00:00:22.910> ok<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.810> again<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.160> open<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.490> up

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
systems ok so again if you open this up

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.370 
systems ok so again if you open this up
there<00:00:27.090> they're<00:00:27.420> actually<00:00:27.900> supports<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:29.070> GPU

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
there they're actually supports for GPU

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.000 
there they're actually supports for GPU
there<00:00:31.380> i<00:00:31.410> think<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:33.390> laura<00:00:34.170> rather<00:00:34.559> large

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there i think for and laura rather large

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.369 
there i think for and laura rather large
fans<00:00:35.760> inside<00:00:36.950> supporting<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> entire<00:00:38.879> system

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
fans inside supporting the entire system

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
fans inside supporting the entire system
ok<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.620> has<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.129> numerous<00:00:41.640> nut<00:00:41.879> drive<00:00:42.239> base<00:00:42.480> i

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
ok it has a numerous nut drive base i

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.960 
ok it has a numerous nut drive base i
think<00:00:42.960> i'd<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.200> six

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970
