than the original but I mean had some

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.990 
than the original but I mean had some
cool<00:00:21.960> facts<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.619> didn't<00:00:22.890> watch<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.039> 3d<00:00:23.789> version

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this version basically I think it's a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.370 
this version basically I think it's a
little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.040> weird<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.200> you<00:00:34.200> can

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
little bit weird that you can you can

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.250 
little bit weird that you can you can
kind<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.880> don't<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> hit<00:00:37.079> like

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
kind of like you don't have to hit like

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
kind of like you don't have to hit like
a<00:00:37.320> wall<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.680> anything<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:39.660> able

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
a wall or anything like that to be able

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
a wall or anything like that to be able
to<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.379> do<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
to you know you just do it up here in

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.200 
to you know you just do it up here in
the<00:00:45.469> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> sky<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.730> your<00:00:47.879> fun

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the in the sky when you have your fun

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.940 
the in the sky when you have your fun
thing<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.780> fly<00:00:48.989> around<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
thing and fly around you don't have to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
thing and fly around you don't have to
have<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.399> building<00:00:50.789> that's<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
have like a building that's kind of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.979 
have like a building that's kind of
weird<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:52.350> pretty<00:00:52.590> run<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.899> also<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> think

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
weird that's pretty run and also I think

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
weird that's pretty run and also I think
it<00:00:55.320> feels<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> performance<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.510> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it feels like the performance is kind of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
it feels like the performance is kind of
bad<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.469> you're<00:00:58.620> running<00:00:58.829> quick<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.309> this

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
bad when you're running quick in this

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.080 
bad when you're running quick in this
game<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> probably<00:01:02.640> feels

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
game and I think it probably feels

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
game and I think it probably feels
better<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> galaxy<00:01:04.019> s3<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.100> been

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
better or the galaxy s3 that I have been

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.920 
better or the galaxy s3 that I have been
