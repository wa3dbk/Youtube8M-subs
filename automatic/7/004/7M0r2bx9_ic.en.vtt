00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
utilities not having attribute
here's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.130> quick<00:00:32.430> comparison<00:00:33.050> queue<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
here's a quick comparison queue a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.340 
here's a quick comparison queue a
regular<00:00:34.890> Naga

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
regular Naga

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.090 
regular Naga
Pyrus<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.309> see<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.890> symbols<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
Pyrus as you can see the symbols on the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.700 
Pyrus as you can see the symbols on the
left<00:00:41.340> wing<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.879> regular<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.440> there

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
left wing of a regular one on here there

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
left wing of a regular one on here there
is<00:00:43.800> nothing<00:00:45.590> they<00:00:46.590> try<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> make<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.520> Naga<00:00:47.789> as

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
is nothing they try to make this Naga as

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
is nothing they try to make this Naga as
show<00:00:48.480> accurate<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.140> possible<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.629> guess<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
show accurate as possible so I guess it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.850 
show accurate as possible so I guess it
would<00:00:52.620> make<00:00:52.649> sense<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:54.230> QB<00:00:55.230> attribute<00:00:55.710> list

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
would make sense that QB attribute list

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.869 
would make sense that QB attribute list
because<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> show<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
because on the show that's what he is

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.859 
because on the show that's what he is
um<00:00:59.960> as<00:01:00.960> guys<00:01:01.410> 650<00:01:02.250> GS<00:01:04.939> pretty<00:01:05.939> basic<00:01:06.210> strong

things about the background video game
I've<00:01:57.020> been<00:01:57.080> playing<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.620> for<00:01:57.830> about<00:01:57.950> two<00:01:58.700> three

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
I've been playing it for about two three

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.900 
I've been playing it for about two three
hours<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.600> so<00:01:59.840> far<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.140> am<00:02:00.410> loving<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.130> was

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
hours and so far I am loving it I was

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.170 
hours and so far I am loving it I was
really<00:02:02.090> ticked<00:02:02.420> off<00:02:02.660> because<00:02:03.730> daily<00:02:04.730> reports

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
really ticked off because daily reports

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.100 
really ticked off because daily reports
showed<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.350> case<00:02:07.250> had<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> Wi-Fi<00:02:08.660> logo<00:02:08.930> on

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.590 
showed that the case had a Wi-Fi logo on
it<00:02:09.290> so<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.100> was<00:02:10.130> really<00:02:10.520> really<00:02:10.850> excited<00:02:11.180> that

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
it so I was really really excited that

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.550 
it so I was really really excited that
had<00:02:11.780> Wi-Fi<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.820> sadly<00:02:13.820> as<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.350> see

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
had Wi-Fi but sadly as you can see

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.180 
had Wi-Fi but sadly as you can see
there's<00:02:15.830> no<00:02:16.100> Wi-Fi<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:17.780> there<00:02:18.140> Wi-Fi<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.620> would

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
there's no Wi-Fi if there Wi-Fi it would

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
there's no Wi-Fi if there Wi-Fi it would
be<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.670> perfect<00:02:20.450> game<00:02:20.690> almost
