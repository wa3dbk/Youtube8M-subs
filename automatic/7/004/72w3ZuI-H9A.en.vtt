you know who you are dad no I didn't
know<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.070> was<00:02:22.190> possible

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
know that was possible

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.080

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
just to show that it's even possible

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:43.690 
just to show that it's even possible
because<00:02:27.790> people<00:02:28.790> are<00:02:28.880> gonna<00:02:29.000> rage<00:02:40.120> mm-hmm<00:02:42.700> is

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
because people are gonna rage mm-hmm is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.370 
because people are gonna rage mm-hmm is
about<00:02:44.150> scattered<00:02:44.450> well<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:44.989> put<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.230> around

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
about scattered well just put on around

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
about scattered well just put on around
the<00:02:45.560> mechanics<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.390> hope<00:02:47.390> they<00:02:47.510> make<00:02:47.540> cool

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the mechanics I hope they make cool

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.479 
the mechanics I hope they make cool
parkour<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.560> finally<00:02:48.829> know<00:02:48.980> what<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.280> want

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
parkour so I finally know what I we want

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.069 
parkour so I finally know what I we want
I<00:02:49.670> was<00:02:49.790> thinking<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.180> invisible<00:02:50.690> blocks

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
I was thinking that invisible blocks

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.990 
I was thinking that invisible blocks
would<00:02:51.350> be<00:02:51.440> cool<00:02:51.709> or<00:02:52.130> not<00:02:52.190> invisible<00:02:52.579> but

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
would be cool or not invisible but

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.259 
would be cool or not invisible but
changing<00:02:53.900> blocks<00:02:54.140> where<00:02:54.350> they<00:02:54.440> fade<00:02:54.680> out<00:02:55.269> look

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
changing blocks where they fade out look

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.900 
changing blocks where they fade out look
people<00:02:56.570> are<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.370> world<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.760> there's

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
people are in in my world and there's

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.370 
people are in in my world and there's
like<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> live<00:02:59.299> chat<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.600> haven't<00:02:59.900> been<00:03:00.049> reading

did the checkpoint yes yeah you can

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.750 
did the checkpoint yes yeah you can
build<00:03:06.230> your<00:03:06.320> own<00:03:06.410> game<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.920> all<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.519> core

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
build your own game and all the core

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.750 
build your own game and all the core
elements<00:03:08.180> are<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:08.630> easy<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.110> uh<00:03:11.590> felissa<00:03:12.760> left

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
elements are so easy to uh felissa left

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
elements are so easy to uh felissa left
right<00:03:15.700> see<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.180> parts<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.570> like<00:03:17.660> a

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
right see this is this parts just like a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.420 
right see this is this parts just like a
little<00:03:18.019> fall<00:03:18.260> mechanic<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.739> pretty<00:03:18.980> much<00:03:19.070> gank

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
little fall mechanic I pretty much gank

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.949 
little fall mechanic I pretty much gank
to<00:03:19.579> all<00:03:19.670> these<00:03:19.790> ideas<00:03:20.209> just<00:03:20.239> from<00:03:20.600> other<00:03:20.660> cool

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
to all these ideas just from other cool

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.620 
to all these ideas just from other cool
worlds<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:21.620> that's<00:03:22.400> also<00:03:22.579> why<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.910> ice<00:03:23.090> pvp

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
worlds and that's also why the ice pvp

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.199 
worlds and that's also why the ice pvp
place<00:03:23.870> was<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.170> don't<00:03:24.410> steal<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:25.209> because

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
place was I don't steal this because

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.259 
place was I don't steal this because
it's<00:03:26.359> just<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:26.780> an<00:03:26.959> exploding<00:03:28.269> not

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
it's just like an exploding not

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.060 
it's just like an exploding not
exploding<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:29.989> just<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.230> constantly<00:03:30.709> evolving

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
exploding but just a constantly evolving

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.039 
exploding but just a constantly evolving
community<00:03:31.579> still<00:03:31.930> easy<00:03:32.930> hey<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:34.540> don't<00:03:35.540> know<00:03:35.780> I

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
community still easy hey I don't know I

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.780 
community still easy hey I don't know I
shouldn't<00:03:36.560> show<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.920> dorne<00:03:37.250> I'm<00:03:37.370> watching

shouldn't show that dorne I'm watching

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.569 
shouldn't show that dorne I'm watching
 I'll<00:03:38.840> let<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.049> out<00:03:39.320> never<00:03:40.130> edited<00:03:40.489> it

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
 I'll let that out never edited it

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.260 
 I'll let that out never edited it
out<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:42.170> might<00:03:42.350> be<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.530> hardest<00:03:42.650> part<00:03:42.970> huh

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
out this might be the hardest part huh

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.470 
out this might be the hardest part huh
yeah<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.410> start<00:03:46.710> your<00:03:46.830> own<00:03:46.940> world<00:03:47.940> well

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
yeah if you start your own world well

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.970 
yeah if you start your own world well
you<00:03:48.510> need<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.780> get<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:49.020> hands<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.380> lock<00:03:49.650> but

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
you need to get your hands on a lock but

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.210 
you need to get your hands on a lock but
whatever<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:51.080> but<00:03:52.080> uh<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.740> just<00:03:52.920> punch

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
whatever like but uh you just punch

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.950 
whatever like but uh you just punch
punch<00:03:53.940> dirt<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.570> then<00:03:55.260> you'll<00:03:55.410> get<00:03:55.530> dirt<00:03:55.830> and

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
punch dirt and then you'll get dirt and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.570 
punch dirt and then you'll get dirt and
then<00:03:57.960> you<00:03:58.080> punch<00:03:58.320> lava<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.010> then<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.400> get

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
then you punch lava and then you get

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.490 
then you punch lava and then you get
laughing<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.150> then<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:01.020> from<00:04:01.110> there<00:04:01.320> you

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
laughing and then just from there you

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.320 
laughing and then just from there you
can<00:04:01.620> already<00:04:01.770> make<00:04:02.070> dirt<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.430> lava<00:04:02.580> jumps<00:04:03.090> and

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
can already make dirt and lava jumps and

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.610 
can already make dirt and lava jumps and
that's<00:04:03.570> what<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.780> did<00:04:03.990> at<00:04:04.110> first<00:04:04.670> it's<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:05.820> easy

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
that's what I did at first it's so easy

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.260 
that's what I did at first it's so easy
we'll<00:04:07.620> stop<00:04:07.830> here<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.310> I'm<00:04:08.490> already<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:09.150> is

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
we'll stop here and I'm already this is

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.610 
we'll stop here and I'm already this is
like<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.540> furthest<00:04:09.900> part<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.260> I've<00:04:10.380> made

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
like the furthest part that I've made

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.350 
like the furthest part that I've made
