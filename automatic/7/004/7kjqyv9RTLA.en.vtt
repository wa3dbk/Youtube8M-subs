the file now it says updating now if you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.199 
the file now it says updating now if you
actually<00:02:27.650> had<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> version<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.700> update<00:02:29.000> it

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
actually had a version to update it

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.240 
actually had a version to update it
would<00:02:29.330> tell<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.989> version<00:02:30.860> whatever

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
would tell you here version whatever

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.490 
would tell you here version whatever
number<00:02:31.580> two<00:02:31.760> one<00:02:32.060> point<00:02:32.239> two<00:02:32.480> seven<00:02:32.510> updating

number two one point two seven updating
and<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:34.340> course<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.730> progress<00:02:35.120> meter<00:02:35.360> would

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
and of course the progress meter would

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.530 
and of course the progress meter would
go<00:02:35.660> from<00:02:35.959> zero<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.319> 100%<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.819> minority<00:02:38.390> has

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
go from zero to 100% but minority has

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.090 
go from zero to 100% but minority has
the<00:02:38.810> new<00:02:38.930> version<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.560> says<00:02:39.709> one<00:02:39.860> hundred

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
the new version so it says one hundred

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.559 
the new version so it says one hundred
sent<00:02:40.250> automatically<00:02:40.670> confirm<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.450> had

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
sent automatically confirm that it had

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.809 
sent automatically confirm that it had
the<00:02:41.750> correct<00:02:41.959> version<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.069> just<00:02:43.370> request<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
the correct version and just request the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.360 
the correct version and just request the
you<00:02:44.000> power<00:02:44.209> cycle<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.799> mixer<00:02:45.799> before<00:02:45.980> using

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
you power cycle the mixer before using

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.789 
you power cycle the mixer before using
it<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.510> course<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.870> do<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.140> off<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
it so of course you can do that off the

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.130 
it so of course you can do that off the
back<00:02:48.980> on

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.180 

and<00:02:53.140> while<00:02:53.319> doing<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:55.540> go<00:02:55.690> back<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:56.190> hold

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and while doing that you go back in hold

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.970 
and while doing that you go back in hold
the<00:02:57.280> utility<00:02:57.640> button<00:02:57.790> version<00:02:58.690> number<00:02:58.980> verify

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
the utility button version number verify

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.740 
the utility button version number verify
indeed<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.000> version<00:03:01.600> we've

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
