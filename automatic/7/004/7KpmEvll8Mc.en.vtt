a another commentary and then my in a
while<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:06.240> one's<00:00:06.420> actually<00:00:06.540> pretty

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
while and this one's actually pretty

while and this one's actually pretty
unique<00:00:07.049> from<00:00:07.170> my<00:00:07.319> channel<00:00:07.620> it's<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.010> hardcore

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
unique from my channel it's a hardcore

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.410 
unique from my channel it's a hardcore
sniper<00:00:09.000> around<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.300> assertion<00:00:09.630> destroy<00:00:09.929> and

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
sniper around the assertion destroy and

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.539 
sniper around the assertion destroy and
yeah<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.990> pc<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.590> two<00:00:13.679> together<00:00:13.799> so

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
yeah on the pc we have two together so

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.599 
yeah on the pc we have two together so
we<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.759> actually<00:00:14.880> make<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.360> sniper<00:00:15.780> only<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
we can actually make it sniper only and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.090 
we can actually make it sniper only and
so<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.820> think<00:00:17.940> that's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.570> lot<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> fun<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.350> less

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
so I think that's a lot of fun like less

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.429 
so I think that's a lot of fun like less
explosives<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:21.090> use<00:00:21.630> explosives<00:00:22.109> can't<00:00:22.320> use

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
knives can't use automated weapons like

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.660 
knives can't use automated weapons like

the stuff it just took me make sense but

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.210 
the stuff it just took me make sense but
uh<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.910> there's<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.120> fair<00:02:29.270> bit<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.690> luck<00:02:30.220> in

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
uh so there's a fair bit of luck in

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.400 
uh so there's a fair bit of luck in
these<00:02:31.520> games<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.180> I'll<00:02:32.630> just<00:02:32.780> speed<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.200> up

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
a bit this is an area of nothing and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.970 
a bit this is an area of nothing and

it's<00:03:50.720> right<00:03:50.900> because<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.200> guy<00:03:51.380> actually<00:03:52.010> kills

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
it's right because a guy actually kills

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.490

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
is 2 and I say this you see there's

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.810 
is 2 and I say this you see there's
three<00:04:07.440> red<00:04:07.830> lines<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.430> bottom<00:04:08.670> that's

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
three red lines and the bottom that's

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.840 
three red lines and the bottom that's
because<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:10.440> last<00:04:10.620> kill<00:04:10.920> elasta<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.580> actually

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
because the last kill elasta is actually

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.900 
because the last kill elasta is actually
a<00:04:11.880> team<00:04:12.090> kill<00:04:12.330> my<00:04:12.930> ally<00:04:13.680> who<00:04:13.980> fails<00:04:14.460> hard<00:04:14.790> when

actually the second time I've done this
commentary<00:04:56.250> actually<00:04:57.240> probably<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:58.320> first

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
commentary actually probably the first

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
time I've ever done a commentary twice

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.180 
time I've ever done a commentary twice
in<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.090> row<00:05:00.300> for<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.080> same<00:05:01.230> gameplay<00:05:01.440> because<00:05:01.920> I

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
in a row for the same gameplay because I

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.220 
in a row for the same gameplay because I
actually<00:05:02.370> got<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.240> add<00:05:03.360> one<00:05:03.720> important<00:05:04.140> piece

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
actually got to add one important piece

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.330 
actually got to add one important piece
of<00:05:04.290> information<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.540> so<00:05:06.950> that's<00:05:07.950> I'm

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
of information to it so that's I'm

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.540 
of information to it so that's I'm
probably<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.910> little<00:05:09.150> bit<00:05:10.160> drawn<00:05:11.160> things<00:05:11.430> to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
probably a little bit drawn things to

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.320 
probably a little bit drawn things to
say<00:05:11.700> that's<00:05:12.030> right<00:05:12.650> push<00:05:13.650> through<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.330> though

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
say that's right push through and though

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.820 
say that's right push through and though
this<00:05:15.450> is<00:05:15.570> after<00:05:15.780> 10<00:05:16.050> seconds<00:05:16.350> of<00:05:16.440> camping<00:05:16.770> that

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
this is after 10 seconds of camping that

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.240 
this is after 10 seconds of camping that
I<00:05:16.890> was<00:05:17.040> talking<00:05:17.250> about<00:05:17.510> maybe<00:05:18.510> 20<00:05:18.840> seconds

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
I was talking about maybe 20 seconds

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.050 
I was talking about maybe 20 seconds
yeah<00:05:20.250> it's<00:05:20.940> not<00:05:21.060> too<00:05:21.270> bad<00:05:21.980> and<00:05:22.980> am<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.520> controls

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
yeah it's not too bad and am I controls

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.370 
yeah it's not too bad and am I controls
are<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.270> bit<00:05:24.510> less<00:05:24.630> economic<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.200> on<00:05:25.290> the

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
are a bit less economic that on the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.900 
are a bit less economic that on the
convo<00:05:25.710> for<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.040> PDF<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.460> slowly<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:26.820> have

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
convo for the PDF and slowly and I have

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.240 
convo for the PDF and slowly and I have
to<00:05:27.030> like<00:05:27.210> tap<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:28.140> up<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.740> down<00:05:28.860> arrows<00:05:29.160> and

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
to like tap the up and down arrows and

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.170 
to like tap the up and down arrows and
they<00:05:29.340> go<00:05:29.490> up<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.700> point<00:05:30.120> two<00:05:30.300> times<00:05:31.170> each<00:05:31.680> time

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
they go up I point two times each time

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.670 
they go up I point two times each time
which<00:05:33.180> is<00:05:33.210> kind<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.870> annoying<00:05:33.990> but<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.590> know

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
which is kind of annoying but you know

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.840 
which is kind of annoying but you know
what<00:05:35.540> sacrifices<00:05:36.540> via<00:05:36.960> we<00:05:37.290> make<00:05:38.010> for<00:05:38.520> using<00:05:38.790> a

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
what sacrifices via we make for using a

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.490 
what sacrifices via we make for using a
mouse<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.390> keyboard<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:41.960> shalini<00:05:42.960> coming<00:05:43.410> up

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
mouse and keyboard and shalini coming up

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.840 
mouse and keyboard and shalini coming up
to<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.620> end<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.860> game<00:05:43.890> now<00:05:44.220> because<00:05:44.730> that

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
to the end of the game now because that

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.400 
to the end of the game now because that
last<00:05:45.060> bit<00:05:45.240> is<00:05:45.300> actually<00:05:45.720> nothing<00:05:45.930> happening

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
last bit is actually nothing happening

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.330 
last bit is actually nothing happening
I'm<00:05:46.650> sweating<00:05:46.890> for<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.040> bomb<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.280> be

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
I'm sweating for the bomb to be

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.460 
I'm sweating for the bomb to be
destroyed<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:48.210> my<00:05:48.960> final<00:05:49.140> score<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.850> 20<00:05:50.850> into

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
destroyed so my final score is 20 into
