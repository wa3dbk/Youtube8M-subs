00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:11.078
 Hello to all. We are now in Kiev Cybersport Arena with Misery, 

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.441
 who plays on the replacement in the CLG team 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.147
 Say "hello" to our viewers. 

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.645
 Hey. 

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:20.468
 Tell me, please, is this your first visit to Ukraine? 

00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:22.419
 Yes. Never been. 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.244
 How do you like the venue? 

00:00:25.244 --> 00:00:27.617
 Of course, this is a very nice place. 

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:32.239
 Actually, I was surprised how big the club is. 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.781
 And how beautiful it looks ... That is, it is new and I like it. 

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.973
 Did you come today? 

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:39.205
 Yes. This morning. 

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.659
 Maybe you had time to walk around the city? 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.785
 Not. We came immediately here, ate, looked at the apartment, 

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:53.015
 where we are going to live. And now we are playing. 

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:57.493
 Good. So you will have time to see Kiev tomorrow, 

00:00:57.493 --> 00:00:58.914
 I think you will like it. 

00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:01.923
 You are here to play for the CLG. 

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:05.538
 How exactly did you get to this tournament? 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.845
 I was asked a week ago, 

00:01:08.845 --> 00:01:13.125
 because smulgullig could not play, he had exams. 

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:16.023
 And they asked me if I wanted to try. 

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:20.077
 I said yes, I really want to. 

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.951
 Many are interested in what is happening with Team EG. 

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:26.899
 Can you tell us about your problems? 

00:01:27.118 --> 00:01:31.641
 Well, this is a bit difficult. Everything is not quite as we would like. 

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.761
 Actually, we wanted to change the composition, 

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:39.267
 but we are not quite sure about this because of contracts and other things. 

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:43.091
 So it is still a bit unclear what will happen. 

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:46.324
 But for now I still represent Evil Geniuses 

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:53.339
 Rumor has it that the ex-player of the team It's Gosu - Bulba will join you. 

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:54.663
 Is it true or not? 

00:01:54.663 --> 00:02:01.518
 I assure you that I do not know. Of course, this is possible, but so far I do not know. 

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:03.664
 It is not known exactly what will happen. 

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:07.782
 To be honest, you prefer to play with the line-up like CLG 

00:02:07.782 --> 00:02:11.077
 or more impressed by the style of the game Demon ʻa + Playmate? 

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:16.101
 Hard to say. I really like playing with CLG, 

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.133
 Also because we used to be friends and were in the team. 

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:25.149
 Therefore, there is nothing new here. This is good anyway. 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.072
 Those. I like to play with CLG and with EG too. 

00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:35.446
 For a couple of months it was difficult for us, there were ups and downs. 

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:38.456
 But now I’m really happy to play for CLG as a replacement. 

00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:44.879
 Do you remember the trip to the SMM tournament. There was a scandal of some sort, 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.692
 and no one knows anything about it. Maybe it's time to shed some light? 

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:54.458
 I think I have shed some light on this occasion several times. 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.059
 We were like against the whole tournament, 

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.617
 the whole tournament was very unprofessional, 

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.630
 there were almost no admins who speak English 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.983
 and could really help us, there were no working computers, 

00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:14.059
 blackscreens and blue screens of death all the time. 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.334
 Computers all the time broke. 

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:19.761
 The rules were generally unfinished. 

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:26.111
 I can clarify a bit ... For example, nobody cared 

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:29.690
 that you already broke the second tower to the 20th minute 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.523
 We had an advantage in more than 6,000 gold against Mith.TrusT, 

00:03:33.523 --> 00:03:38.700
 that is, about 20,000 gold in total, and this has not yet passed the first 20 minutes. 

00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:42.466
 And then one of them broke down the computer, 

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:46.555
 threw CM - Crystal Maiden, and they demanded a replay. 

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:53.738
 Admin read the rules, saw that the situation in the game is up to 20 minutes 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.060
 supposedly had no meaning and assigned a replay. 

00:03:57.294 --> 00:04:02.007
 In the replay, they already knew exactly what to do with us, 

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:05.580
 since we had a push strat. They bought other things 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.754
 pumped other skills to their heroes, went to other lines, 

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:18.687
 prepared for this and won in the end. 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.400
 Clear. 

00:04:20.617 --> 00:04:24.069
 Soon The International 2. 

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:29.898
 What do you think about the current form of the proposed teams? 

00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:33.085
 Will Chinese teams dominate 

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:37.422
 or will the European teams show themselves? 

00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:40.461
 It's hard to say something about The International 2. 

00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:43.067
 I do not know how much the Chinese have trained. 

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:46.140
 If they are really going to work on this for the next few months, 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.775
 they really can come out with something and surprise everyone. 

00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.646
 But I think most people expect 

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:56.124
 that Europeans will dominate The International 2. 

00:04:56.124 --> 00:04:59.731
 Are there any major differences in the style of the game? 

00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:04.192
 between teams from Asia, Oceania, Europe and North America? 

00:05:04.192 --> 00:05:10.617
 As I said, I did not see the Chinese ripleas and I do not know how they play. 

00:05:10.854 --> 00:05:16.497
 I still think they are just playing their game, watching what's best for them, 

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:20.554
 so I do not know if I will see any features in the game style. 

00:05:20.772 --> 00:05:27.514
 What about your team? How do you evaluate your chances? 

00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:33.457
 I do not know, firstly, we need to decide on the composition, play, 

00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:35.529
 and then see what happens. 

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:39.838
 Ok, then the last question about this tournament. 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.001
 Who do you see in favorites, and what are the forecasts? 

00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:48.890
 I think everyone expects NA'VI to win. 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.774
 They are actually favorites of this tournament. 

00:05:50.774 --> 00:05:55.392
 Yes, they are really the most powerful team. 

00:05:55.392 --> 00:06:00.770
 But I do not think they are invincible. Everyone has a chance to beat them. 

00:06:00.992 --> 00:06:06.068
 Anything can happen. Let's see what happens tomorrow. 

00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:08.741
 Thanks for the interview. Good luck in the tournament. 

00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:10.784
 See you later. Until.
