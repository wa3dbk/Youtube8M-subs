00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
do with the origin of denim so the way

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.810 
do with the origin of denim so the way
that<00:02:35.000> denim<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.570> woven<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:36.620> coin<00:02:36.950> saj<00:02:37.400> and

originated<00:02:38.570> in<00:02:38.660> neem<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> reason<00:02:39.470> we

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
originated in neem so as a reason we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.100 
originated in neem so as a reason we
called<00:02:39.800> surge<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.430> neem<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:41.360> became<00:02:41.660> denim
