00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.870
 every school and the netherlands is actually 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.969
 looking forward to improving it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.040
 education and I think we are now for it 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.410
 found the first way around 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
 connect with how students learn the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.279
 areas of interest do you want sweet video 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.779
 or do you want text or sound and back 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.000
 combination of that question it to the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.279
 teacher determine what happens in a lesson 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.050
 and we have now found a way 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.300
 which we can connect exactly 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.190
 at have learning profile of the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.190
 students to that is pure profit 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 students are often stopped for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.360
 an almost and by the speed of or one 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 teacher or the rest of the class and that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.149
 no longer needed 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 so students can continue to the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.820
 hand from what they show 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.350
 so students who normally have a month 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.059
 about doing a certain top 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.530
 maybe someone for a week and ready 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.149
 can therefore continue 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 my emoji pondicherry clothes that 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 discussion was doubted Kevin 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.619
 you quasiment that 16 exo 1000 air and six 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.620
 seven mary 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.470
 since the last custom tests 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.110
 then be into the new learning 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.110
 means for me as his city 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.660
 I can pay attention to student 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.010
 that I can also compliment teachings 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.640
 but i can see what they are doing 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.490
 let his online privacy rest 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.160
 little one by throwing 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 I like this way 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.010
 teach 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.230
 because you will be motivated to be more clean 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:39.050
 to do he the term there in the street 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:42.050

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.560
 I him can your own at your own pace 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.530
 level 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.930
 it's a very different way and type 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 van nes because that's how you can go 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.280
 You can do things in different ways 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.860
 look up for the dress evans are brown 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.930
 malicious acoustics father fireworks again 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.930
 after the first with dark by cindy 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.420
 well we are working on an aed today 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.289
 around creativity so it's also the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 intend that you have your own 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.240
 Creativity course totally run 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.070
 let go if you look at apple 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.930
 professional development is the whole thing 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.830
 important that you get the teachers too 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.930
 continuously 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.390
 no to do whatever you show 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.130
 with many trainings and among others the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.350
 monkeys did rings state the t-pack model 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.450
 central to technology 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.790
 content and pedagogy and precisely that 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.130
 combination of all these factors 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.050
 together for a good lesson 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.510
 I'm just going to help you and remember 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.520
 yourself is ok with any situation 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.500
 nice I know the button you soon 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.690
 but especially what am I going with this app 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.160
 in the classroom 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.280
 I sometimes come across a teacher 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.800
 have resistance to the ipad what is possible 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.860
 often try is to show them what 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.890
 the added value is what really suits him 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.650
 and then it always works out like that 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.230
 also to convince the teacher 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.450
 in the beginning i was afraid of it 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.709
 play game lamps lesson 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.480
 are sending messages on social media 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.190
 and well as we are the fashion competition 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.690
 we hand the editing agent three 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.370
 year with the ipad 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.200
 so the pupils are getting to it 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.840
 asked for the 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.000
 history erase time 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.040
 and we often do the local he mine 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.650
 if you fall behind percent you can't 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000
 the students expect none 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.360
 play games on things durning not 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.360
 be allowed to 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.470
 waving a ring and spider becomes ipad 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:42.019
 used for example to see if you 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.239
 good or set or you are good at hand 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.549
 if you come down well 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.000
 and then sooner than you will not really miss out 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.650
 wave the string what you did and now you can 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.159
 you just see that again and yourself again 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.159
 improve 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.420
 I think this new way of 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.090
 teaching incredibly fits to how 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.060
 just this twenty-first century skills 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.920
 and this is all about choices 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.329
 make creativity and take initiative 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.819
 collaborate so education changes 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.100
 gigantic and I think we are this way 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.609
 prepare students better for that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.609
