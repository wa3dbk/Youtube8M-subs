again and then 10 9 7 go down to the a
10<00:02:04.750> 9<00:02:05.290> 7<00:02:05.680> it's<00:02:06.310> pretty<00:02:06.490> much<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:06.820> just<00:02:06.880> 10<00:02:07.120> 9<00:02:07.270> 7

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
10 9 7 it's pretty much it's just 10 9 7

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.740

on<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.990> different<00:02:08.320> strings<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.630> just

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
on the different strings and you just

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.750 
on the different strings and you just
keep<00:02:13.900> your<00:02:14.050> hand<00:02:14.200> right<00:02:14.350> here<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.400> kind

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
of easy do like that too if you want few

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.210 
of easy do like that too if you want few
pinkies<00:02:24.070> not<00:02:24.220> strong<00:02:24.430> alright<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
pinkies not strong alright so that's the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.480 
pinkies not strong alright so that's the
first<00:02:27.430> part<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.790> then<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:29.410> chords<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.280> them

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
first part and then the chords I do them

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.290 
first part and then the chords I do them
up<00:02:30.580> here<00:02:31.020> with<00:02:32.020> pointer<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.530> ring<00:02:33.060> 10<00:02:34.060> on<00:02:34.209> the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
up here with pointer and ring 10 on the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.920 
up here with pointer and ring 10 on the
e<00:02:34.330> 9<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.610> first<00:02:36.850> one<00:02:37.030> then<00:02:37.840> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
e 9 on the a it's the first one then you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.690 
e 9 on the a it's the first one then you
move<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.350> 14<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.040> e<00:02:39.160> 12<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.150> a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.449 

you<00:02:43.880> only<00:02:43.970> ate<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.180> once<00:02:44.270> then<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.349> then<00:02:46.660> 1210

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
you only ate it once then and then 1210

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.470 
you only ate it once then and then 1210
so<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.580> like<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> opposite<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.239> power

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
so it's like the opposite of a power

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.920 
so it's like the opposite of a power
cord

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930

Linton<00:03:05.350> next<00:03:06.350> star<00:03:06.500> goes<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.770> this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.309 

that's<00:03:13.450> really<00:03:13.630> easy<00:03:13.810> because<00:03:13.990> all<00:03:14.140> you're

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
that's really easy because all you're

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.380 
that's really easy because all you're
doing<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.650> hitting<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:14.980> open<00:03:15.130> e<00:03:15.490> with<00:03:16.030> every

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
doing is hitting the open e with every

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.140 
doing is hitting the open e with every
down<00:03:16.569> stroke<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.110> then<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:18.550> string<00:03:19.000> is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
down stroke and then the a string is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.790 
down stroke and then the a string is
where<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.660> all<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.020> higher<00:03:20.680> notes<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.680> it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
where you get all the higher notes so it

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.930 
where you get all the higher notes so it
goes<00:03:23.920> zero<00:03:24.310> seven<00:03:25.150> twice<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.790> nine

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
goes zero seven twice and then nine

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.010 
goes zero seven twice and then nine
zero<00:03:30.690> nine<00:03:30.870> zero<00:03:31.170> ten<00:03:32.070> back<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> zero<00:03:33.240> nine<00:03:33.390> and

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
zero nine zero ten back to zero nine and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:41.270 
zero nine zero ten back to zero nine and
then<00:03:34.860> seven<00:03:35.190> twice<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:39.450> then<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.860> end<00:03:41.220> of

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
then seven twice and then on the end of

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.220 
then seven twice and then on the end of
it<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> ghost<00:03:43.400> that's<00:03:44.400> seven<00:03:45.000> nine<00:03:45.300> ten<00:03:45.840> twelve

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
it a ghost that's seven nine ten twelve

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.340 
it a ghost that's seven nine ten twelve
ten<00:03:46.950> nine<00:03:47.430> seven<00:03:47.460> and<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.900> whole<00:03:49.020> time<00:03:49.230> you're

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
ten nine seven and the whole time you're

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.270 
ten nine seven and the whole time you're
hitting<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.710> open<00:03:49.860> e

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:11.819 

okay<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.670> next<00:03:57.909> part<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.209> the<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:11.560> know<00:04:11.590> this

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
okay the next part is the you know this

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.030 
okay the next part is the you know this
time<00:04:11.980> you're<00:04:12.129> actually<00:04:12.189> using<00:04:12.459> power<00:04:12.790> cords

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
time you're actually using power cords

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.529 
time you're actually using power cords
and<00:04:15.040> you're<00:04:15.250> doing<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.489> all<00:04:15.609> on<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.969> a<00:04:16.180> string

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
and you're doing it all on the a string

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.849 
and you're doing it all on the a string
and<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.750> D<00:04:16.780> string<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.340> let's<00:04:18.549> start<00:04:19.419> off

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
and the D string so let's start off

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.219 
and the D string so let's start off
seven<00:04:20.859> nine<00:04:21.039> hit<00:04:21.699> that<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.870> then<00:04:23.500> seven<00:04:23.919> ten

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
seven nine hit that and then seven ten

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.659 
seven nine hit that and then seven ten
and<00:04:26.229> if<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.710> can<00:04:26.889> reach<00:04:27.100> do<00:04:27.400> seven<00:04:28.270> twelve

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
and if you can reach do seven twelve

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.390 
and if you can reach do seven twelve
can't<00:04:30.669> reach<00:04:30.880> do<00:04:31.330> seven<00:04:32.169> skip<00:04:32.530> one<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.770> seven

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
can't reach do seven skip one and seven

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.540 
can't reach do seven skip one and seven
on<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.759> G<00:04:37.110> sounds<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.169> same<00:04:38.380> but<00:04:38.650> if<00:04:39.490> you

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
on the G sounds the same but if you

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.460 
on the G sounds the same but if you
can't<00:04:39.789> stretch<00:04:40.060> it's<00:04:40.270> easier<00:04:40.599> to<00:04:40.720> do<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.110> then

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
can't stretch it's easier to do and then

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.409 
can't stretch it's easier to do and then
you<00:04:41.500> just<00:04:41.620> mute<00:04:42.009> the<00:04:42.039> string<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.460> between<00:04:48.419> the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
you just mute the string in between the

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.360 
you just mute the string in between the
last<00:04:49.630> one<00:04:49.840> is<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.050> five<00:04:50.259> seven<00:04:50.590> five<00:04:51.070> on<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.340> a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
last one is the five seven five on the a

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.490 
last one is the five seven five on the a
seven<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.509> the<00:04:52.630> D<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:52.930> now<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.169> learn<00:04:53.349> the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
seven on the D and now to learn the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.189 
seven on the D and now to learn the
heavy<00:04:53.680> part<00:04:53.979> E<00:04:55.830> string<00:04:56.830> one<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.570> string<00:04:58.570> three<00:04:58.840> D

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
heavy part E string one a string three D

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.930 
heavy part E string one a string three D
string<00:04:59.470> three<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:02.229> when<00:05:03.190> you<00:05:03.310> meet<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.669> if<00:05:03.820> you

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
string three and when you meet it if you

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.460 
string three and when you meet it if you
have<00:05:04.030> an<00:05:04.120> acoustic<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:04.930> think<00:05:05.139> it's<00:05:05.260> cool

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
have an acoustic and you think it's cool

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.770 
have an acoustic and you think it's cool
just<00:05:06.990> mute<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.110> as<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:09.220> hit<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.370> guitar

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
just mute it as you hit the guitar

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.100 
just mute it as you hit the guitar
sounds<00:05:10.780> like<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.930> drum<00:05:11.080> beat<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.880> then<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:13.930> go

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
sounds like a drum beat and then you go

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.310 
sounds like a drum beat and then you go
over<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.349> hear<00:05:14.680> five<00:05:15.039> on<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.370> g<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.789> you<00:05:16.599> do

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
over to hear five on the g and you do

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.260 
over to hear five on the g and you do
pinch<00:05:17.590> harmonic

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.029 

sounds<00:05:20.930> really<00:05:21.199> cool<00:05:21.319> on<00:05:21.500> our<00:05:21.530> electric<00:05:21.889> it

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
sounds really cool on our electric it

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:29.469 
sounds really cool on our electric it
mixes<00:05:22.370> high<00:05:22.490> pitch<00:05:22.669> squeeze<00:05:27.639> and<00:05:28.639> depending

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.719 
mixes high pitch squeeze and depending
on<00:05:29.569> where<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:30.110> do<00:05:30.349> the<00:05:30.560> pinch<00:05:30.740> harmonic<00:05:31.190> on

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
on where you do the pinch harmonic on

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.600 
on where you do the pinch harmonic on
the<00:05:32.060> string<00:05:32.650> it'll<00:05:33.650> make<00:05:33.770> a<00:05:33.800> different<00:05:34.220> squeal

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
the string it'll make a different squeal

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:42.790 
the string it'll make a different squeal
exam<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:40.250> that<00:05:40.819> goes<00:05:41.090> into<00:05:41.300> a<00:05:41.449> just<00:05:42.289> a<00:05:42.380> a<00:05:42.410> power

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
exam and that goes into a just a a power

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.900 
exam and that goes into a just a a power
chord<00:05:43.180> zero<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.539> a<00:05:44.860> two<00:05:45.860> on<00:05:46.099> the<00:05:46.220> d2<00:05:46.669> on<00:05:46.789> the

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.620 
chord zero on the a two on the d2 on the

three five five three m55 and then back
to<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.120> 1/3<00:06:05.710> remember<00:06:06.710> that's<00:06:06.830> a<00:06:06.949> five<00:06:07.160> on<00:06:07.190> the

to the 1/3 remember that's a five on the
G<00:06:07.729> and<00:06:07.970> then<00:06:08.870> you<00:06:09.020> slide<00:06:09.380> it<00:06:09.530> down<00:06:09.650> afterwards

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
G and then you slide it down afterwards

G and then you slide it down afterwards
the<00:06:11.180> outro

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.330 

that<00:06:21.140> sounds<00:06:21.470> easy<00:06:21.560> but<00:06:21.710> it's<00:06:21.950> actually<00:06:22.070> kind

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
that sounds easy but it's actually kind

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.430 
that sounds easy but it's actually kind
of<00:06:22.430> tricky<00:06:22.760> so<00:06:23.420> you<00:06:23.480> go<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:25.490> on<00:06:25.670> the<00:06:26.200> d4<00:06:27.200> on<00:06:27.350> the

on the fifth fret of the B string or
just<00:07:26.270> hit<00:07:26.360> it<00:07:29.740> seven<00:07:30.740> five<00:07:33.279> then<00:07:34.279> you<00:07:34.369> sing

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550 
just hit it seven five then you sing

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:47.830 
just hit it seven five then you sing
along<00:07:34.759> with<00:07:34.849> it
