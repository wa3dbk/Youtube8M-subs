00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it and then this film really roots it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
it and then this film really roots it
back<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> reason<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.610> created<00:01:21.090> and

and
it's<00:03:52.269> it<00:03:52.959> was<00:03:53.230> much<00:03:53.530> more<00:03:53.769> technical<00:03:54.370> than<00:03:54.400> I

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
it's it was much more technical than I

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.729

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
thought it would be so we know there's

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.229 
thought it would be so we know there's
more<00:03:56.950> than<00:03:57.129> one<00:03:57.280> Godzilla<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:57.909> that<00:03:58.060> right

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
monsters exist no but is it but in terms

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.660 
monsters exist no but is it but in terms
of<00:04:07.510> acting<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.439> it<00:04:08.680> must<00:04:08.890> be<00:04:09.040> somehow

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
of acting is it must be somehow

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.630 
of acting is it must be somehow
different<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.780> act<00:04:10.989> like<00:04:11.349> that<00:04:11.620> then<00:04:12.040> if

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
different to act like that then if

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.190
