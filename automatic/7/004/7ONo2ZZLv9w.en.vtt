00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.289 

so<00:00:04.620> at<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.830> top<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.430> tier<00:00:05.910> that's<00:00:06.120> about

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
so at the top is a tier that's about

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.789 
so at the top is a tier that's about
movement<00:00:06.750> which<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.319> know<00:00:07.410> sounds<00:00:07.440> pretty

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
movement which I know sounds pretty

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.330 
movement which I know sounds pretty
crazy<00:00:07.980> for<00:00:08.460> paladin<00:00:09.740> we<00:00:10.740> totally<00:00:11.070> redesigned

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
crazy for paladin we totally redesigned

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.860 
crazy for paladin we totally redesigned
speed<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.849> light<00:00:12.000> now<00:00:12.269> think<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:12.840> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
speed of light now think of it as a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.660 
speed of light now think of it as a
sprint<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.590> also<00:00:13.860> does<00:00:14.040> some<00:00:14.160> healing<00:00:14.400> while

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
sprint that also does some healing while

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.330 
sprint that also does some healing while
you're<00:00:14.849> sprinting<00:00:15.710> it's<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.859> against<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you're sprinting it's up against a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.950 
you're sprinting it's up against a
modified<00:00:17.789> long<00:00:18.000> arm<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.330> law<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.720> whenever

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
modified long arm of the law so whenever

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
modified long arm of the law so whenever
you<00:00:19.080> judge<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.650> get<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> speed<00:00:20.670> movement<00:00:20.910> we

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
you judge you get a speed movement we

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.790 
you judge you get a speed movement we
don't<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.869> need<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.439> minimum

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
don't think we need to have the minimum

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800 
don't think we need to have the minimum
range<00:00:23.100> thing<00:00:23.340> anymore<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.910> judge<00:00:24.480> makes<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
range thing anymore so judge makes you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.720 
range thing anymore so judge makes you
fast<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> very<00:00:26.490> different

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
fast and then this is a very different

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.300 
fast and then this is a very different
pursuit<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> justice<00:00:27.359> which<00:00:27.810> gives<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> ten

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
pursuit of justice which gives you a ten

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.529 
pursuit of justice which gives you a ten
percent<00:00:29.429> movement<00:00:29.849> speed<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.150> every<00:00:30.300> charge

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
percent movement speed for every charge

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.970 
percent movement speed for every charge
of<00:00:30.689> holy<00:00:30.840> power<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:31.800> about

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
of holy power so you can think about

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
of holy power so you can think about
holding<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> holy<00:00:32.820> power<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.360> bit

so<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:33.960> fast<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.500> using<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.070> because

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so you can go fast or using it because

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.049 
so you can go fast or using it because
you<00:00:35.820> need<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> use<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.300> something<00:00:36.600> else
