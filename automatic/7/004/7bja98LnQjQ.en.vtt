00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
here's something interesting and this is

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.230 
here's something interesting and this is
what<00:01:29.579> N<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> French<00:01:30.090> guys<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:32.240> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
what N and the French guys did to the

France and I'm not from France so it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.810 
France and I'm not from France so it

out<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.160> normal<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:25.100> what<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.220> agreed<00:02:26.459> I

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
out it's normal and what we agreed I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.460 
out it's normal and what we agreed I
think<00:02:26.820> all<00:02:26.970> three<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.300> us<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.630> agree<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.110> one

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
think all three of us can agree that one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.870 
think all three of us can agree that one
of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.620> reasons<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.010> read<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.610> learn<00:02:29.820> about

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
of the reasons we read is to learn about

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.449 
of the reasons we read is to learn about
other<00:02:30.270> people<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.810> other<00:02:30.990> experience<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.130> so

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
other people and other experience and so

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.310 
other people and other experience and so
