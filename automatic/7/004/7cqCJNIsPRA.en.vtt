00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I get it because frankly the show would

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.440 
I get it because frankly the show would

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
feet without that particular aspect of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.030 
feet without that particular aspect of
it<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.049> would<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.470> saying<00:01:22.500> one

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it but that would be like saying one

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.770 
it but that would be like saying one
piece<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> great<00:01:24.000> show<00:01:24.299> without<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
piece would be a great show without the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
piece would be a great show without the
devil<00:01:25.229> fruits<00:01:25.470> which<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> true<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.549> would

devil fruits which is true it would

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.030 
devil fruits which is true it would
still<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.360> great<00:01:27.630> show<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.710> what

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
still be a great show but that's what

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120 
still be a great show but that's what
makes<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.820> piece<00:01:30.290> besides<00:01:31.290> Aaron<00:01:31.590> sort<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.210 
Titan powers would mean that the series
ended<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:50.520> Aaron<00:01:50.939> got<00:01:51.149> eaten<00:01:51.630> by<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.960> tight

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
ended when Aaron got eaten by that tight

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.170 
ended when Aaron got eaten by that tight
realistically<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.579> how<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.970> would<00:01:54.090> have

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
realistically that's how it would have

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.569 
realistically that's how it would have
went<00:01:54.329> down<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.350> notion<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.979> kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.399> sad

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
went down and that notion is kind of sad

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.139 
went down and that notion is kind of sad
clearly<00:01:57.540> dad's<00:01:58.140> mysterious<00:01:58.979> injections<00:01:59.820> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
clearly dad's mysterious injections is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.679 
clearly dad's mysterious injections is
what<00:02:00.869> gives<00:02:01.200> Aaron<00:02:01.979> his<00:02:02.219> Titan<00:02:02.700> powers<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
what gives Aaron his Titan powers and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.550 
what gives Aaron his Titan powers and
I'm<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:04.079> saying<00:02:04.380> dad<00:02:05.040> travels<00:02:05.729> oh

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
I'm just saying dad travels oh

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.010 
I'm just saying dad travels oh
and<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.189> injections<00:02:07.759> mess<00:02:08.030> with<00:02:08.270> memory<00:02:08.660> so

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
and the injections mess with memory so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.100 
and the injections mess with memory so
we<00:02:09.200> can't<00:02:09.530> necessarily<00:02:09.860> know<00:02:10.849> just<00:02:11.810> how<00:02:12.050> many

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
we can't necessarily know just how many

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.610 
we can't necessarily know just how many
people<00:02:12.860> dad<00:02:13.489> has<00:02:13.760> experimented<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.780> I'm<00:02:15.080> just

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
people dad has experimented on I'm just

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.460 
people dad has experimented on I'm just
saying<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.340> some<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.300> abnormal<00:02:17.989> Titans

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
saying that some of the abnormal Titans

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.650 
saying that some of the abnormal Titans
have<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.069> habit<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.580> disappearing<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
have a habit of disappearing and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.050 
have a habit of disappearing and
appearing<00:02:20.750> out<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.560> nowhere<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.760> cloud<00:02:23.030> of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
appearing out of nowhere in a cloud of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.750 
appearing out of nowhere in a cloud of
smoke<00:02:23.620> including<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.769> colossal<00:02:25.280> Titan<00:02:25.610> and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
smoke including the colossal Titan and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.589 
smoke including the colossal Titan and
the<00:02:26.269> armored<00:02:26.540> titan<00:02:26.720> I'm<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:28.180> saying<00:02:29.180> it's

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
the armored titan I'm just saying it's

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.570 
the armored titan I'm just saying it's
worth<00:02:30.200> thinking<00:02:30.230> about<00:02:30.769> although<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.340> must

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
worth thinking about although I must

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.600 
worth thinking about although I must
wonder<00:02:31.880> what<00:02:32.599> people's<00:02:33.019> motivations<00:02:33.769> are<00:02:33.980> for

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
wonder what people's motivations are for

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.970 
wonder what people's motivations are for
allowing<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.269> Titans<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.840> march<00:02:36.050> in<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.680> could

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
allowing the Titans to march in it could

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.949 
allowing the Titans to march in it could
be<00:02:37.130> some<00:02:37.340> kind<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.610> twisted<00:02:38.060> reasoning<00:02:38.569> like<00:02:38.750> I

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
be some kind of twisted reasoning like I

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.470 
be some kind of twisted reasoning like I
want<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.410> end<00:02:39.620> mankind<00:02:40.489> suffering<00:02:41.209> or

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
want to end mankind suffering or

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.350 
want to end mankind suffering or
whatever<00:02:42.350> that's<00:02:42.950> not<00:02:43.280> particularly<00:02:43.819> clear

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
whatever that's not particularly clear

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.449 
whatever that's not particularly clear
to<00:02:44.540> me<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:44.810> if<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.019> abnormal<00:02:45.650> Titans<00:02:46.100> turn

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
to me but if the abnormal Titans turn

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.990 
to me but if the abnormal Titans turn
out<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.910> not<00:02:47.150> be<00:02:47.660> humans<00:02:48.290> then<00:02:48.920> I'll<00:02:49.340> be<00:02:49.730> really

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
out to not be humans then I'll be really

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.190 
out to not be humans then I'll be really
embarrassed<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.930> mean<00:02:51.530> they<00:02:52.280> clearly<00:02:52.730> are

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
embarrassed I mean they clearly are

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.570 
embarrassed I mean they clearly are
because<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.349> their<00:02:54.530> intelligence<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.489> their

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
because of their intelligence and their

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.210 
because of their intelligence and their
tendency<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.209> appear<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.780> disappear<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.680> how

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
tendency to appear it disappear and how

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.380 
tendency to appear it disappear and how
they<00:02:58.400> make<00:02:58.580> plans<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.180> all<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.599> I'm<00:03:00.040> just

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
they make plans and all that I'm just

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.050
