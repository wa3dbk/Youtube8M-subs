00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.689
 to 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.579
 how about friends as it is always a pleasure 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.829
 to say hello, because on this occasion 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.570
 I am accompanied since the time 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.140
 and ezequiel welcome how are you many 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.219
 thanks for joining us 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.760
 Well let's talk a little bit about the 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.680
 Argentine team knowing that they are 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.659
 so close to home and they're going to play 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.629
 practically local in each stadium 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.649
 should help us if it is surely 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.299
 cute for what it means out there 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.649
 Argentina because good Brazil all 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.009
 They know that it is very important that I leave you 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.259
 Argentina is going to notice much more than 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.700
 the theme that the people of brazil are going to 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.710
 to be more against Argentina than to do 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.990
 please there's a lot of talk about the selection 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940
 Argentina but it is also said that it has 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.220
 a great offensive strength but that to 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.140
 the best in defense can be one of 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.700
 his weaknesses I think the style of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.200
 game that the Argentine national team has 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.789
 they make it out and the defenders that in 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.310
 a little more exposed then talk 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.810
 a little bit of defense and also by the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.340
 good time for the strikers 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.470
 of the selection it is said that they are 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 the big favorites together with brazil and 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.729
 with germany I think that the cup of 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.530
 world must be totally different from what 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.510
 that everything is played 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.670
 and one there has no margin for error like that 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.920
 that soccer is full of surprises 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.570
 that anything can happen starts 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.340
 find a team like bosnia 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.560
 surely it is not a selection that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.030
 there everybody knows or thinks that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.259
 it's strong but the first game 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.820
 Argentina is going to have to win it because 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.430
 the start of any competition 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.580
 there are always nerves there are a lot of 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.530
 things in play in which I think the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.890
 winning a match has always been very 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.420
 important that is messi in the field to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.760
 I personally believe that it is the best 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.590
 player of the world and is someone who is 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.060
 very different from the rest obviously that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.680
 Messi is a very important player and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.080
 none will discuss it but I think that 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
 both omen as well as higuaÃ­n also 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.319
 they are very good forwards and that in 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.510
 any time you can 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.060
 unbalance or make a difference with 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.920
 What do you dream? I believe that the dream of everything 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.340
 player and especially Argentine is power 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.340
 win a world cup and it's your turn not to 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.340
 neither
