00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.900
 Let's get this done 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.330
 clearly you think hello and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 welcome 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.620
 we like to know lavender very much like you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.330
 looks in the background and I want to 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.130
 Now make a new lavender bonsai 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.920
 for that I have a small bowl yet 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.970
 no holes in it 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.060
 this shell recently yourself 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.500
 made and how that works 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 I then showed a movie and we had 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.739
 pending down in the description 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.820
 purely the handlebar to the movie could 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.289
 look how to get such bonsai 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.210
 concrete stone can produce itself 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.230
 but now on the subject of lavender as I said 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.850
 i would like to be in small bonsai now 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.679
 Do not rein in the big one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.519
 background but really a clear 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.829
 I've been around for a few years 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.379
 I'll show you and I'll show you now 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.440
 times 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.339
 and here is the little lavender quoted 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.289
 picture of course, of course, but he 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.699
 is really a little pretty then 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.479
 I once heard cut back 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.559
 even now is summer and late summer 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.060
 so it just stays small and easy 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.740
 stay small so that's it 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 not out what would that really be 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.990
 to the little sweet carpet stay here 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.700
 is the mum and they are all lavender 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.649
 who have grown here on the ground 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 who nevertheless sown it by myself 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.360
 and I cut them back constantly 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.159
 for several years and from these 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.570
 plants are excellent 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.130
 but attract 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 yes and as I said now I want to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 to have such a carpet with lavender and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.609
 For that we take the little guy 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:42.680
 now out a few holes 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.680
 drill ears 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.170
 can open the ears again and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.110
 Now we have the plant from us 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.300
 first sting the area around the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.530
 lavender around 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.800
 so they first rooted as many as 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:11.910
 possible with get and then we will 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.910
 continue to work the good 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.870
 water march 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.780
 we have prepared everything now 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.650
 have the peel 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.060
 we already have a wire 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.610
 pulled through where we equal the the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:23.440
 turn it tight 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:24.700
 of course we have our lavender there 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.480
 a little bit the roots for me now 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.440
 not too much but these important ones 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.440
 that we reduce then 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.629
 Of course, use a sharp pair of scissors 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.629
 very clear case 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.670
 then we joined, among others 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.109
 bit down a not too much now completely 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.239
 a little bit open lavender on it 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:00.659
 and are now with the help of 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.659
 Mooring wire 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.230
 standing in the call and I do not come there 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.230
 go to it 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.610
 then turn it almost a bit like that 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.870
 like when I'm in the camera now 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.870
 families and I do not come 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:56.180
 but it is sufficient for the fixed now 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.180
 my remaining amount up 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 We can do that with a diaper 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.720
 So we can do it as well 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.219
 So bonsai attract as a tree or 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.719
 plant in the shell being this 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.069
 lavender will not be a tree now 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.449
 in the sense but I want them 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.180
 compact and tight he should keep 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.590
 later give a green total area and 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.360
 I think that will be in such a way 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.460
 a peel look very interesting 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.069
 if that then expertly old bonsai 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.659
 is still to be discussed is mine too 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.310
 pretty good because I find everything 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.050
 wonderful in small bowls 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.069
 I think that even the lavender 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.629
 will not bloom because we have a lot 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.639
 many thriving matters here is therefore 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.319
 the green compact ball now time 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.969
 and I think that will too 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.889
 the others are interesting 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.360
 I can see design now 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.219
 not saying yet not to say 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.900
 because as I said that is now the first 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.969
 have a look at it now 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.409
 Plant and but look like that 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.789
 all developed just should bloom to it 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.319
 So he does not really go back 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.000
 be cut and nicely compact 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.770
 stay because that's actually mine 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.169
 goal in the whole thing how it like 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.819
 said it looks behind it you will see 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.710
 We will not him boys now 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.139
 only gets in the spring after that 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.580
 austrieb younger and may now first 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.990
 make root and the growth period 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.580
 that's about to end soon anyway 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.860
 then the whole thing goes to winter quarters 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.479
 and will overwinter completely frost-free 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.650
 clear case we impressive now it 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.569
 Of course, do not let it stand 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.310
 that would be too bad if he then 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.279
 would go where the normal 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.569
 lavender so how can the pot outdoors 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.219
 Remember to make the nothing 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.889
 they are standing outside with me in winter 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:45.900
 free and nothing happens 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.159
 So they tolerate that only the 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.389
 sides so no scarf is then 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:50.310
 Mount the frost-free winter 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:54.270
 escapes through lava again much 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.580
 much less is there anything else 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.199
 so say yes in the west with the 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.909
 Of course, peel is totally awesome 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.569
 we made them ourselves like 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:06.089
 said and that is really a lot 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.949
 cheap alternative and I guess 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.210
 also very appealing 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.129
 meanwhile as the others betonstein 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.150
 love made for these 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:14.370
 already peel at the meantime 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.289
 little structure and we are always 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.599
 still experimenting in what things 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:20.729
 are suitable and which are not 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:22.289
 In any case we stay tuned and 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.220
 how we did it as I said 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:27.340
 I already told him or not 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.480
 and the link to the downside, 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.830
 description how we shell these 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.410
 you could have made times 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.670
 like to look so I think that 's it 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.020
 but now I hope you have the film 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.880
 fallen and see you in the 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.800
 next movie again in the sense of 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:46.660
 Roman we can do it 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.790
 but clearly this number denkste have before 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.920
 recently produced and like that 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.630
 I've shown that to a film 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.520
 and we pending and once in the 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.990
 description purely the handlebar to the film 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.310
 you could get such bonsai 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.310
 can produce concrete bowls themselves 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.940
 if that then expertly as a bonsai yet 

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.530
 It is also an open question to me 

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.180
 pretty good because I find everything 

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.920
 wonderful in small bowls 

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.940
 I guess that the well of lavender 

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.560
 will not bloom because we have a lot 

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.560
 many stage things here therefore please
