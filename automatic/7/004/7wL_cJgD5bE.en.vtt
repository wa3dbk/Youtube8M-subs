00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 the only engine in quotation marks at 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.130
 free energy that is manufactured in large 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 series it's the japanese minato engine 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.250
 of which the whole alternative press speaks 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.560
 in this area the minato engine is 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 an engine that was first produced at 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.029
 more than 10,000 copies cause 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.800
 industrial applications and which 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 now at an order of 140 thousand 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.279
 copies for the largest chain 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.170
 of Japanese supermarkets for its 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 air conditioners so I explain it's a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 engine that actually makes magnets and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.329
 these elements are very cleverly 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.680
 used they are biased if you 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.820
 do not want to push not explain to him his 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.219
 picture it's not possible 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.649
 but stop refer to top 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.899
 secret to nexus and his magazines that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 have described in detail its engines or 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.020
 go to the site of naudin and you 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.309
 have all the links to see 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.899
 motor seizures you will have very beautiful 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.309
 computer images we would understand 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.870
 even if you if you are totally 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 impermeable to mechanics 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.610
 good so this biker minato you have to know 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.680
 you consume a few milli watts for 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.699
 simply switch magnets that's 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 small electronic circuits that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.129
 make switches like little ones 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 roles is so it's the only energy 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.280
 who consume because such easily 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.479
 that they rotate constantly then 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 it's fabulous because if they 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.750
 consume nothing to what win and what 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.299
 engine makes my twenty others 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 powers minato himself said that 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.189
 we could imagine 100 engines 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.020
 200 horses 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.189
 you're not half imitate us horses because 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 that there would be the super magnet there 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.460
 it started very expensive but for example 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.560
 powers between 20 and 100 horses 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.610
 are quite realistic to say the least 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.170
 they do something because it's 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.820
 for fans of the teams to stir up 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 their best but he said himself there is no 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.549
 no problem one he still did 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 prototypes already in several 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.090
 dozens of horses and who go early or 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.189
 late and then produces the question is to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.840
 know you know maybe all 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.030
 now what that has been often 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.110
 touched his antenna 2 and just all 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.780
 people who had made engines to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.450
 Bryant energy did not hurt at best 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.799
 be stuck in a way a little traitor and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.970
 the outside of the style oh no that we 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.110
 not interested but we made there had been 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.090
 an intervention in the factories 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.590
 concerned who said at the beginning we went 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.579
 great your engine and a week after 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.600
 no sir finally that we 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.100
 not interested because in the meantime 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.420
 had received a white phone call or who 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.719
 were telling them guys if you ever 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.600
 make 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.159
 we break other factories have the farm and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 either it was downright the team 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.610
 was put in jail we find him 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.290
 always an invented tax record or 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.599
 anything that when they can 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 more free earl who did both 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.250
 free energy and anti gravity he 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.080
 did both 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.220
 saul it's downright military 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.780
 happens whoever's firing the fire at his 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.470
 house and he who is put in jail but 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.750
 it can go very far 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.070
 that's what we've been seeing since 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.720
 a century since 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.640
 finally not so much since the 1920s 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.710
 what and then inventors wanted 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.140
 mass produce energy and stuff 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.700
 now I would say it's still 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.500
 blocked in the usa it's always 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.610
 blocked in europe 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.470
 so why does not it unlock in japan 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.600
 because it's mister minato did 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.160
 never had any problem the clues 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.200
 japanese said it's very very 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.670
 interesting your thing and we put the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.650
 funds they put a lot of money you 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.730
 bats for product 140 miles engine 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.380
 that is to say already you make a big 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.820
 factory to produce them success of 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.580
 high precision motors it's enough 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.320
 it's a little light stuff a ccd 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.489
 engines that are comparable in quality 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.870
 the best electric motors 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.880
 high precision industrial 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.709
 so this is the big industry if 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.110
 you have it precise and then what is 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.420
 very interesting is that I would have 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.770
 an answer hypothesis it's worth this 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.450
 that it's worth it's an assumption then 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.100
 there is no jean-marc robert 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.140
 doing physics or oxycontin 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.370
 it's like you, I'm going to make a 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.020
 hypothesis 1 she was completely 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.900
 stupid maybe she is very fair 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.260
 I notice that it is 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.790
 that in the global banking system 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.799
 the only country whose banks are not 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.269
 not dependent on the big four 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.000
 banks that controls all the banks 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.340
 it's Japan it seems to me a clue 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.239
 is an interesting track that's not it 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.070
 means that Japanese banks 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.010
 when they finance a non- industrial 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.150
 not account to give back to the four benches that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.560
 controls all the other banks in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.790
 the world 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.160
 it could be a track not she 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.790
 is not stupider than another 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.470
 can be one 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.540
 you are listening to radio here 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.540
 now 95 of our guest is
