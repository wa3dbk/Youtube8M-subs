00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.120
 cell is pushed well so you can 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.480

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.470
 learn nothing does not learn anything good anymore 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.200
 I found the culprit that no 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.930

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.850
