00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.309
 very good friends we are back here 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.170
 in the garage to talk about the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:23.230
 new fiat one 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.230
 this car was recently changed in 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.070
 in the fiat brand and now we have that 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.760
 new version with slight modifications 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.510
 aesthetics the front continues with that 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.670
 grill with its three squares let's say 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.370
 asymmetric I know that there are people who do not 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.510
 like nothing that everyone seems to me 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.080
 an aesthetically pleasing car 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.089
 talking does not have already comes with your 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.230
 Top baskets is the most 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.980
 equipped the version that is called way 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.980
 as your form 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.129
 because I say that this is the car 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.290
 most recommended subcompact on the market 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.060
 Mexican because there is no version for the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.030
 entry version of the new 71 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.759
 happens to be the car with air bags 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.340
 abs brakes cheaper market 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:19.079
 most affordable mexican market 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.909
 national and costs 160 pesos for 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.979
 find bs air bags in others 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.220
 cars you have to put 10 thousand pesos more 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.140
 and going to around 170 and 170 is already what 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.570
 what does this cost with a level of 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.440
 equipment also very interesting not 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.150
 come on let's see 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.960
 entered the car 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.410
 and find an interior that to me 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.300
 I do not necessarily look nice 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.050
 that central part looks pretty but 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.960
 but if the screen is something that 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.890
 You see and it impresses you, it's not obvious 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.750
 in the car there is no power button 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.340
 as in the more to two for example the more 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.250
 two obviously does not pretend to be 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.250
 competitor of this car 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.550
 the schalke looks pretty pretty good 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.490
 the board is not smooth either but 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.930
 again not as I said any of 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.360
 the three cars that we are going to show today 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.670
 It has a soft board but it looks 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.890
 pretty good, it is not 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.349
 nice to look at is already has another 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.750
 texture but it also seems very 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.140
 not nice to the eye, not there we have the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.950
 screen on we're going here to lower the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.780
 volume and here ahead of us 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.140
 we also have a steering wheel with functions 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.590
 an interesting cluster I'm looking for 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.630
 here the lever for adjustment of the steering wheel 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.850
 I do not know if I do not know if I have adjustments 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.630
 I start to believe that no 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.490
 I think you do not have it if you have to 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.970
 it has to be and it's fit only 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.820
 only vertical there is no there is no adjustment 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.580
 telescopic in general I repeat I think 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.470
 very nice the space is good I 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.120
 my legs are a bit tight here 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.340
 they would have to move a little more towards 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.320
 back and this is where I need the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.660
 flying telescope so that my legs 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.220
 fit the steering wheel should come a 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.540
 little bit more forward so that I 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.580
 was in the correct position of 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.610
 handling right now I'm not far 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.350
 of what I should because my doll 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.360
 it should be there but with the arm the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.610
 slightly bent arm and my back 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.700
 completely stuck to the seat was given 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.380
 It was like between 5 and 10 centimeters 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.480
 Flywheel farther here than 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.790
 should because there is no steering wheel with 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.130
 depth adjustment the seats are 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.800
 small but well designed are from 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.920
 cloth 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.780
 you have a good sized glove compartment here 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.560
 an usb input an auxiliary input 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.270
 air conditioning a hug hug 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.270
 central that I think is very good 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.740
 very good that you have decided to put it 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.020
 in a couple of small cup holders at 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.989
 front also carried the bottles in 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.420
 the doors electrical adjustments of 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.030
 mirrors et cetera et cetera etcetera 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.000
 the chest there is a small motor with 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.390
 four cylinders with 85 horses 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.370
 strength is not exactly much but it's 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.940
 a car is enough for a car 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.720
 urban back space 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.550
 it is also 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.550
 enough look, I have some little things 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.810
 I have to raise this what is good 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:52.150
 force you to put I feel here and I have 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.910
 space just for me I'm skimming the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.790
 the back seat in the middle is still going 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.490
 to be more complicated up to the 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.520
 by this with solita and the tunnel of 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.240
 escape here and with that seat so far back 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.720
 Well, I really do not fit, it's a car 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.630
 that in terms of space will demand 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.900
 some sacrifices but internal 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.750
 urban management and agility economy 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.760
 fuel and more than anything safety 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.100
 for that price frankly 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.720
 there is no other car in the market 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.330
 Mexican that offers you especially 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:36.729
 talking about the basic version 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:39.360
 of 71 and we have here open the trunk 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.999
 It's a trunk with a reasonable size 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.620
 I do not like that I do not have the flat floor and 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:48.690
 that's because of the spare tires 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.790
 if they wanted to put a flat floor 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.070
 they would have had to lose this space 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.250
 then it is better to have a little more 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.710
 space since the trunk is smaller 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.750
 that other cars is better to lose the 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.960
 flat floor rather than losing something of 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.360
 space is the fiat decision and the 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.479
 handling like the one of all fiat is a handling 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.620
 soft a suspension is comfortable is 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:19.490
 nice is not 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:21.919
 It is very soft in curves you feel in 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.949
 curves a little faster you feel 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:28.250
 that is not your environment is not made for 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:30.110
 that 's an urban car is a car 85 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.410
 horsepower is a car that 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.630
 I repeat the entry version costs 160 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.949
 thousand pesos if this version the more 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:41.960
 equipped costs 170 then no no no 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.110
 you have to think not to wait for 1 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.000
 a fireball is not made for that 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.300
 within what is done I think that 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.419
 It is a great car I would love to repeat a 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.570
 couple of little things more than the first is not 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:59.990
 so difficult to achieve would be the steering wheel 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.389
 of with depth adjustment the second 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.970
 if it is much more complicated that is the 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:07.480
 rear space if we already saw that the 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.180
 trunk just cabes 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.550
 putting more back space is difficult 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.289
 but for a young family for young people 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.569
 even for work 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:19.729
 of urban messaging jobs 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:22.069
 etcetera that is needed is a great 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:26.149
 car is not a car 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:28.639
 I repeat nice comfortable economic and that 

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:32.330
 together with its manual box does not move so 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:34.879
 bad although horses 85 85 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.270
 strength may seem very small, not what 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.399
 are 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.039
 are enough for what is the 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:45.849
 auto we are going now a cut and we left 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:45.849
 from 1 to talk about the 2 the mazda2 2016 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.530
