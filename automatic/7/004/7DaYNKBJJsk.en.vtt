00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 good friends, it's me again and today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.569
 I will teach how to use the pivot 4.1 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.160
 good if you do not have the game or program 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.900
 I looked at the video that I leave in the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.910
 video description 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.830
 we'll start moving the character with 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.940
 the points that reds have move 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.640
 and the yellow moves are all 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.860
 then where it says next frames for 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.960
 Take a photo hehe it's not a photo but it takes 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.700
 how is the character going to see that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.560
 there is a shadow the shadow is like 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.440
 was the character when you took the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.270
 foto jejeje we move the body remember 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.309
 that the red dots is to move the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.540
 arms legs and so on and yellow is 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.540
 to move the whole body 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.640
 already later when we have our 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.160
 photo movie hehe we give to play 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.870
 which is to see the video of photos the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.700
 little arrow that says suddenly is for 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.520
 repeat the video as it ends come back and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.100
 Repeat again what has been shown is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.530
 to load a created person and to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.450
 create a little person we give eric to 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.520
 left side and the sticks that are 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.770
 up is to create a stick the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.229
 X is to eliminate something just give it 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 click and select x and it will be deleted only 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.790
 it gives you an idea to do this 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.080

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.610
 it has to be a stk file because if 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.610

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.960
