that come off of it so what you do is
you<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.810> grab<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> ends<00:01:30.710> and

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
you just grab your one of the ends and

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.990

you<00:01:33.479> pull<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> strings<00:01:34.259> off<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.939> it's<00:01:35.939> like

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you pull the strings off and it's like

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.450 
you pull the strings off and it's like
roots<00:01:36.420> almost<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.560> brittle<00:01:38.009> dry<00:01:38.220> roots

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
roots almost like brittle dry roots

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.219 
roots almost like brittle dry roots
there's<00:01:41.460> still<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> stem<00:01:42.240> root<00:01:42.899> thing

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
there's still a stem root thing

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.039 
there's still a stem root thing
connected<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.189> I'm<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.399> peel

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.460 

it's<00:01:47.350> hard<00:01:48.329> I've<00:01:49.329> actually<00:01:49.659> already<00:01:49.990> eaten

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
it's hard I've actually already eaten

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.370 
it's hard I've actually already eaten
some<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.710> these<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.490> they're<00:01:52.450> kind<00:01:52.689> of<00:01:52.780> sour<00:01:52.990> I

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
some of these and they're kind of sour I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.770 
some of these and they're kind of sour I
think<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.100> sour<00:01:54.460> variety<00:01:55.000> there's<00:01:55.659> a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
think this is a sour variety there's a

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.620 
think this is a sour variety there's a
sweet<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.259> sour<00:01:56.530> righty

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
sweet and sour righty

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.679 
sweet and sour righty
obviously<00:01:58.630> it's<00:01:58.840> sour<00:01:59.080> tasting<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.039> it's<00:02:00.220> sour

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:13.650 

and<00:02:05.789> this<00:02:06.789> one<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:10.899> sour<00:02:11.140> -<00:02:12.660> there's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660
