00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.560
What is your experience
with Hiab HiPro?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.320
My experience with
Hiab products is a positive one.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.920
I am very happy with the handling
and controllability of the vehicle.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.240
Reliability and service
are top features.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.760
I have only good experience with Hiab.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.440
I had older ones before this new one.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.520
I had no trouble
with those either. Just flawless.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.040
I am entirely happy
with the Hiab products.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.880
My experience with Hiab is very good.
Prior to that, I used HMF for ten years.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.160
Hiab really is a very good product.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.920
I am very happy with this crane.
It is easy to control.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.360
It is very subtle, too.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.240
It makes work very easy.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.920
It is one of the best cranes
I have used so far.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.360
The crane is very high quality.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.120
I have no problems and
am very happy with the crane.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.320
I hope the new one will be as good.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.480
What do you use your crane for?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.440
We put up prefabricated houses,
among other things.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.840
For another company
we handle motor yachts,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.960
or move generators
onto roofs or into depots.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.640
I load and unload containers.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.520
I also load and unload the skid loader,
sometimes I put up masts,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.960
catenary support and lamp posts.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.400
It depends on what
the boss asks me to do.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.960
We lift transformers
into their positions.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.920
We erect electrical towers
and lamp posts.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.080
Those are the main tasks for the crane.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.760
A daily routine is unloading stone
packages or loading empty pallets.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.040
That's about it.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.360
Different things...
Bagged cargo, pallets, stones...

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.280
There are stillages
and suchlike, to unload.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.480
It works really well for that.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.880
If you do have to fasten
a belt to secure bigger pallets, well,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
you'll have to live with that.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.920
We mount solar modules,
balconies, window frames.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.280
Anything that you need a crane for.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.520
What is important?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.520
Speed is important because
it's also about money, as usual.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.280
The quicker I complete a job,
the cheaper it is for the client.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.920
That's why speed
is also an important issue.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.680
The operating range of the crane
and its precision are important.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
We deem important that
the crane is quick and sturdy.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.480
It should also receive the commands
from my fingers the way I intend them.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.400
Precision is very important. There isn't
always a lot of space on site.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.560
Sometimes you have to unload
the material on very limited space.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.040
It is all very smooth,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.400
nothing happens abruptly.
Top notch, I'd say.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.320
What do you think of HiPro?

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.840
You can move the crane very fast.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.160
And you can also move it slowly,
reduce the speed somewhat.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.200
That also works well.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.400
It is very delicate
and very easy to use.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.920
You can toggle the speed
and it has a great capacity.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.640
Absolutely precise.
You can set the preferences

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.840
and it really sticks to it precisely.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.160
It takes up the load slowly,
puts it down slowly.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.880
It's a pleasure working with it.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.880
The controllability is really easy,
you get a feeling for it.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.960
Nothing happens abruptly.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.840
Top notch, I'd say.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.280
You can be precise
by the millimetre with this crane.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.240
You can move the crane very precisely.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.160
That makes work very easy.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.040
With a 30 meter range

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.800
every movement usually
has quite an impact.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.000
With this vehicle, you can
set that by remote control

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.960
so that you can move it really subtly.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800
It's a pleasure every day
to work with this crane.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.120
It is very reliable and easy to control.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.040
For anybody.
