00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
do I ever get there or they must have

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.160 
do I ever get there or they must have
had<00:00:17.190> some<00:00:17.220> advantage<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> didn't<00:00:18.960> have

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
had some advantage that I didn't have

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.950 
had some advantage that I didn't have
who<00:00:19.650> knows<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.760> probably<00:00:21.720> have

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
who knows what you and I probably have

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.300 
who knows what you and I probably have
thought<00:00:22.199> over<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> years<00:00:22.859> when<00:00:23.039> we<00:00:23.130> see

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
thought over the years when we see

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.279 
thought over the years when we see
somebody<00:00:23.670> else<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.060> way<00:00:24.330> down<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> road<00:00:24.930> way

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
somebody else it's way down the road way

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
somebody else it's way down the road way
ahead<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.590> us<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> thought<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.670> would<00:00:26.760> be

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
ahead of us so I thought it would be

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.189 
ahead of us so I thought it would be
interesting<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.510> show<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.990> couple

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
interesting to show you a couple

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.200 
interesting to show you a couple
pictures<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.769> where<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> started<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:30.060> this

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
pictures of where I started so this

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.350 
pictures of where I started so this
would<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.359> been<00:00:30.480> about<00:00:30.660> late<00:00:31.289> 2004<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
would have been about late 2004 and I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.549 
would have been about late 2004 and I
don't<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> exact<00:00:33.989> pictures<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
don't have the exact pictures and I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.139 
don't have the exact pictures and I
really<00:00:34.890> regret<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.370> didn't<00:00:35.579> take<00:00:35.730> pictures

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
really regret that didn't take pictures

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.410 
really regret that didn't take pictures
of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> team<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.710> our<00:00:38.250> setup<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> very

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
way I ended up with this setup is I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
way I ended up with this setup is I
bought<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.670> equipment<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:18.330> somebody<00:01:18.780> just

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
bought this equipment off somebody just

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.070 
bought this equipment off somebody just
to<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.439> started<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.659> ten<00:01:22.049> years

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to get started and that was ten years

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.760 
to get started and that was ten years
ago<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.970> looked<00:01:24.210> old<00:01:24.420> back<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:24.770> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
ago now and it looked old back then so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.789 
ago now and it looked old back then so
you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.759> only<00:01:27.030> imagine<00:01:27.390> how<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.080> first<00:01:28.439> looked

organization<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.830> runs<00:02:54.130> pretty<00:02:54.550> well<00:02:55.200> it's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
organization that runs pretty well it's

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.920 
organization that runs pretty well it's
not<00:02:56.350> perfect<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.370> they<00:02:57.760> don't<00:02:58.060> know<00:02:58.390> what<00:02:58.780> it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
not perfect but they don't know what it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.570 
not perfect but they don't know what it
took<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.290> get<00:02:59.410> started<00:02:59.890> they<00:03:00.040> don't<00:03:00.250> know<00:03:00.400> how

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
took to get started they don't know how

hard<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:01.030> was<00:03:01.209> they<00:03:01.570> don't<00:03:01.780> know<00:03:01.959> what<00:03:02.200> we<00:03:02.320> went

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
hard it was they don't know what we went

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
through they don't know how we Grant

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.729 
through they don't know how we Grant
would<00:03:04.180> grind<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.720> out<00:03:04.870> they<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.290> know<00:03:05.410> where

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
would grind it out they don't know where

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.460 
would grind it out they don't know where
we<00:03:05.890> started<00:03:06.489> with<00:03:06.970> hardly<00:03:07.239> anything<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:08.140> we

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
we started with hardly anything and we

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.990 
we started with hardly anything and we
had<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> little<00:03:08.890> bit<00:03:09.070> more<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.520> bought<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> little

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000

had a little bit more we bought a little
more<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.570> kept<00:03:10.810> making<00:03:11.140> incremental

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
more and we kept making incremental

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.130 
more and we kept making incremental
improvements<00:03:12.310> now<00:03:12.940> what<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.360> see<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.900> a

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
improvements now what you see is a

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.590 
improvements now what you see is a
pretty<00:03:14.440> interesting<00:03:14.709> organization<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:16.510> it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
pretty interesting organization but it

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.449 
pretty interesting organization but it
took<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> long<00:03:17.049> time<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.380> get<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.040> there

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
took a long time to get here and there

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.880 
took a long time to get here and there
was<00:03:18.580> no<00:03:18.820> way<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.030> could<00:03:19.180> picture<00:03:19.600> this<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.290> my

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.890 
picture this 10 years ago and say this
is<00:03:24.850> what<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:25.120> going<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.299> look<00:03:25.360> like<00:03:25.600> someday

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
is what it's going to look like someday

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.300 
is what it's going to look like someday
we<00:03:26.380> didn't<00:03:26.590> even<00:03:26.739> know<00:03:26.860> how<00:03:27.010> we<00:03:27.070> were<00:03:27.190> gonna

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
we didn't even know how we were gonna

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.860 
we didn't even know how we were gonna
get<00:03:27.549> here<00:03:27.790> at<00:03:27.910> first<00:03:28.120> we<00:03:28.269> just<00:03:28.299> wanted<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.780> get

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
get here at first we just wanted to get

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.300 
get here at first we just wanted to get
to<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> thousand<00:03:29.470> clients<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.040> seemed

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
to a thousand clients and that seemed

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.000 
to a thousand clients and that seemed
like<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.700> insanely<00:03:31.500> monumental<00:03:32.500> task<00:03:32.769> of

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
like this insanely monumental task of

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.430 
like this insanely monumental task of
how<00:03:33.190> am<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.459> ever<00:03:33.489> gonna<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.480> because

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
how am I ever gonna do that because

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.630 
how am I ever gonna do that because
there<00:03:35.560> were<00:03:35.680> hardly<00:03:35.890> any<00:03:35.980> companies<00:03:36.610> that

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
there were hardly any companies that

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.330 
there were hardly any companies that
were<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.570> size<00:03:37.959> in<00:03:38.260> our<00:03:38.380> local<00:03:38.650> market<00:03:38.830> and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
were that size in our local market and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.180 
were that size in our local market and
so<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.610> just<00:03:39.640> seemed<00:03:40.120> really<00:03:40.840> ambitious<00:03:41.260> but

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
so it just seemed really ambitious but

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.500 
so it just seemed really ambitious but
the<00:03:42.400> way<00:03:42.989> became<00:03:43.989> present<00:03:44.620> or<00:03:44.830> became<00:03:45.510> we

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
the way became present or became we

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.539 
the way became present or became we
could<00:03:46.690> see<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.049> way<00:03:47.170> as<00:03:47.500> we<00:03:47.680> slowly<00:03:47.980> made<00:03:48.310> more

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
could see the way as we slowly made more

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.070 
could see the way as we slowly made more
and<00:03:48.670> more<00:03:48.850> progress<00:03:49.090> as<00:03:49.420> we<00:03:49.540> had<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.690> little<00:03:49.900> bit

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
and more progress as we had a little bit

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.600 
and more progress as we had a little bit
more<00:03:50.140> money<00:03:50.500> as<00:03:50.709> we<00:03:50.860> had<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.040> little<00:03:51.250> bit<00:03:51.430> better

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
advantage all started with a pretty

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.229 
advantage all started with a pretty
boring<00:04:09.640> uninteresting<00:04:11.130> setup<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.400> we

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
boring uninteresting setup and we

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.850 
boring uninteresting setup and we
progressed<00:04:13.660> from<00:04:13.810> there<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.260> that's<00:04:14.590> how<00:04:14.739> it
