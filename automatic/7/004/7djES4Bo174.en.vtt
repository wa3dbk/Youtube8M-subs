00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
attack dodge mana etc I guess this is

another<00:03:48.419> thing<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:48.959> will<00:03:49.109> give<00:03:49.260> Legend<00:03:49.620> of

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
another thing that I will give Legend of

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.289 
another thing that I will give Legend of
Persia<00:03:49.919> instead<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.400> being<00:03:50.579> locked<00:03:50.790> into<00:03:51.090> one

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
Persia instead of being locked into one

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.819 
Persia instead of being locked into one
class<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.780> were<00:03:51.900> given<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.199> base<00:03:52.409> character

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
class you were given a base character

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.110 
class you were given a base character
and<00:03:53.010> build<00:03:53.159> him<00:03:53.400> into<00:03:53.579> what<00:03:53.669> you<00:03:53.760> want<00:03:53.909> to<00:03:54.000> be

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.340 

this<00:05:13.090> is<00:05:13.270> where<00:05:13.420> I<00:05:13.450> think<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.780> major<00:05:13.930> problem

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
this is where I think the major problem

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.990 
this is where I think the major problem
with<00:05:14.500> legend<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:14.860> Persia<00:05:15.040> lies<00:05:15.310> well<00:05:15.700> this<00:05:15.880> is

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
with legend of Persia lies well this is

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.580 
with legend of Persia lies well this is
very<00:05:16.060> similar<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.780> triple<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.200> dungeon

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
very similar to triple a dungeon

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.080 
very similar to triple a dungeon
crawlers<00:05:17.860> out<00:05:17.980> there<00:05:18.160> at<00:05:18.310> no<00:05:18.520> time<00:05:18.730> during<00:05:19.000> my

crawlers out there at no time during my

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.550 
crawlers out there at no time during my

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
playthrough with legend of Persia did I

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.470 
playthrough with legend of Persia did I
feel<00:05:20.710> threatened<00:05:21.040> challenged<00:05:21.730> or<00:05:21.970> even

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
feel threatened challenged or even

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.760 
feel threatened challenged or even
rewarded<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.140> I<00:05:23.200> feel<00:05:23.350> that<00:05:23.500> something

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
rewarded and I feel that something

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.290 
rewarded and I feel that something
that's<00:05:23.860> necessary<00:05:24.490> in<00:05:24.610> this<00:05:24.730> genre<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.150> keep

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
that's necessary in this genre to keep

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.330 
that's necessary in this genre to keep
