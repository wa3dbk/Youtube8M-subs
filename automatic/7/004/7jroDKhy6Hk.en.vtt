unboxing video I don't normally like
unboxing<00:00:35.820> videos<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.050> case<00:00:37.290> this

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
unboxing videos but in this case this

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.960 
unboxing videos but in this case this
might<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.070> sort<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.310> interesting<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> I

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
might be sort of interesting and I

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.690 
might be sort of interesting and I
thought<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.240> would<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.420> fun<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.720> do<00:00:40.700> imagine

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
thought it would be fun to do imagine

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.290 
thought it would be fun to do imagine
yourself<00:00:42.739> transformed<00:00:43.739> back<00:00:44.010> into<00:00:44.300> around

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
yourself transformed back into around

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.290 
yourself transformed back into around
1991<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:47.040> would<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.310> an<00:00:47.520> unboxing<00:00:47.970> video

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
1991 and this would be an unboxing video

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.100 
1991 and this would be an unboxing video
as<00:00:48.630> if<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.560> were<00:00:49.710> taking<00:00:49.980> place<00:00:50.130> in<00:00:50.310> 1991<00:00:51.110> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
as if this were taking place in 1991 so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
as if this were taking place in 1991 so
without<00:00:53.010> further<00:00:53.190> ado<00:00:53.489> let's<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.820> started

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
without further ado let's get started

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.080 
without further ado let's get started
this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> IBM<00:00:54.870> personal<00:00:55.530> system<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.430> PS

this is the IBM personal system or PS

personal system 2 PS 2 space-saving
keyboard<00:00:59.880> this<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.090> basically<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.630> be<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
keyboard this is basically going to be a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.799 
keyboard this is basically going to be a
model<00:01:01.800> M<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.610> space-saving<00:01:03.239> version

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
model M it's the space-saving version

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.499 
model M it's the space-saving version
and<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.129> completely<00:01:05.610> new<00:01:05.729> old<00:01:06.390> stock

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
and I got this completely new old stock

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.780 
and I got this completely new old stock
so<00:01:07.079> it's<00:01:07.380> never<00:01:07.619> been<00:01:07.770> used<00:01:07.829> brand<00:01:08.370> new<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
so it's never been used brand new in the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.719 
so it's never been used brand new in the
box<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.070> sort<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.370> just<00:01:11.430> like

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
box so this would be sort of just like

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.700 
box so this would be sort of just like
unboxing<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.690> if<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.080> factory<00:01:13.470> fresh

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
unboxing it as if it was factory fresh

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.910 
unboxing it as if it was factory fresh
brand<00:01:14.040> new<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.440> pretty<00:01:16.530> happy<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
brand new and so it's pretty happy to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.140 
brand new and so it's pretty happy to

can<00:02:26.599> tell<00:02:27.110> us<00:02:27.260> but<00:02:28.160> I'm<00:02:28.760> working<00:02:29.239> on<00:02:29.330> with<00:02:29.569> a

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
can tell us but I'm working on with a

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.390 
can tell us but I'm working on with a
little<00:02:29.870> bit<00:02:29.959> limited<00:02:30.349> space<00:02:30.620> here<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:33.400> I'm

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
little bit limited space here so I'm

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.250 
little bit limited space here so I'm
about<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.910> how<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.180> unboxing<00:02:35.810> works<00:02:36.019> but

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
about to see how this unboxing works but

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.229 
about to see how this unboxing works but
it's<00:02:36.650> got<00:02:36.800> styrofoam<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.580> here<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.000> I'll<00:02:38.090> just

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
it's got styrofoam in here so I'll just

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.960 
it's got styrofoam in here so I'll just
pull<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.510> out<00:02:38.739> almost<00:02:39.739> like<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.950> big<00:02:40.190> Q<00:02:40.489> box<00:02:40.700> or

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
pull that out almost like a big Q box or

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.350 
pull that out almost like a big Q box or
something<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.450> doesn't<00:02:42.200> have<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.350> lid<00:02:43.360> all

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
something that doesn't have a lid all

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.240 
something that doesn't have a lid all
right<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.630> think<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.019> might<00:02:45.440> have<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.769> styrofoam

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
right I think I might have the styrofoam

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.640 
right I think I might have the styrofoam
in<00:02:46.459> upside-down<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.989> if<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.290> do<00:02:48.350> I'll<00:02:48.620> just

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
in upside-down and if I do I'll just

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.759 
in upside-down and if I do I'll just
have<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> flip<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.310> around<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.680> don't<00:02:51.680> know

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
have to flip it around but I don't know

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.930 
have to flip it around but I don't know
I<00:02:51.799> don't<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.370> go<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.940> brand

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
I don't there we go so there it is brand

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.960 
I don't there we go so there it is brand
new<00:02:56.090> factory<00:02:56.660> fresh<00:02:56.900> out<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> box<00:02:57.940> has<00:02:58.940> a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
new factory fresh out of the box has a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.509 
new factory fresh out of the box has a
nice<00:02:59.239> styrofoam<00:02:59.989> top<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.500> conforms<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
nice styrofoam top that conforms to the

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.050 
nice styrofoam top that conforms to the
keyboard<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:04.370> pretty<00:03:04.610> much<00:03:04.760> it

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
keyboard and that's pretty much it

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.530 
keyboard and that's pretty much it
and<00:03:05.319> if<00:03:06.319> I<00:03:06.410> lift<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.739> up<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.280> think<00:03:08.209> normally

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
and if I lift this up I think normally

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.339 
and if I lift this up I think normally
it<00:03:08.630> would<00:03:08.720> probably<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.140> some

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
it would probably have some

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.190 
it would probably have some
documentation<00:03:10.069> in<00:03:10.220> here<00:03:10.569> maybe<00:03:11.569> a<00:03:11.660> cable<00:03:12.110> if

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
documentation in here maybe a cable if

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.960 
documentation in here maybe a cable if
you<00:03:12.319> bought<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.079> separately<00:03:15.970> so

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
you bought it I have that separately so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.550 
you bought it I have that separately so
I<00:03:17.269> don't<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.540> anything<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:17.930> there<00:03:18.079> now<00:03:18.200> maybe

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
I don't have anything in there now maybe

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.170 
I don't have anything in there now maybe
it<00:03:18.680> would<00:03:18.799> have<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.980> manual<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:19.519> there<00:03:19.700> I'm<00:03:19.970> not

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
it would have a manual in there I'm not

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.210 
it would have a manual in there I'm not
really<00:03:20.329> sure<00:03:20.630> maybe<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.739> just<00:03:21.859> shipped<00:03:22.100> it

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
really sure maybe they just shipped it

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.069 
really sure maybe they just shipped it
like<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:22.790> but<00:03:23.540> anyway<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.049> the

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
like this so but anyway this is the

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.370 
like this so but anyway this is the
keyboard<00:03:24.549> um<00:03:25.720> as<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.840> can<00:03:26.900> see<00:03:27.109> it's<00:03:27.230> got<00:03:27.350> a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
keyboard um as you can see it's got a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.539 
keyboard um as you can see it's got a
black<00:03:27.650> IBM<00:03:29.560> insignia<00:03:30.560> logo<00:03:30.859> right<00:03:30.980> there<00:03:31.040> some

black IBM insignia logo right there some
of<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.730> later<00:03:32.030> ones<00:03:32.299> they<00:03:32.660> switch<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.140> blue<00:03:33.410> so

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
of the later ones they switch to blue so

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
of the later ones they switch to blue so

if you see one in that has a black one

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.340 
if you see one in that has a black one
it's<00:03:36.380> gonna<00:03:36.500> be<00:03:36.680> an<00:03:36.769> older<00:03:37.160> model<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:38.319> when<00:03:39.319> I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
it's gonna be an older model and when I

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.640 
it's gonna be an older model and when I
flip<00:03:39.590> this<00:03:39.739> around<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.989> can<00:03:42.079> kind<00:03:42.319> of<00:03:42.380> see<00:03:42.500> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
flip this around you can kind of see the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.599 
flip this around you can kind of see the
label<00:03:44.350> think<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.859> real<00:03:46.040> part<00:03:46.250> number

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
label think this is the real part number

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.340 
label think this is the real part number
139<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:48.079> 934<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.910> date<00:03:50.299> of<00:03:50.450> manufacture<00:03:50.720> does

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
139 to 934 the date of manufacture does

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.099 
139 to 934 the date of manufacture does
match<00:03:51.700> oh<00:03:52.700> nine<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.690> five<00:03:54.170> 91<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:56.329> bought

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
match oh nine to five 91 and I bought

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.890 
match oh nine to five 91 and I bought
this<00:03:57.290> from<00:03:57.410> an<00:03:57.590> auction<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:59.269> think<00:03:59.750> the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
this from an auction and I think the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.569 
this from an auction and I think the
prior<00:04:00.200> owner<00:04:00.560> did<00:04:00.799> not<00:04:00.950> use<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.190> or<00:04:01.400> anything

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
prior owner did not use it or anything

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.090 
prior owner did not use it or anything
but<00:04:01.819> did<00:04:02.090> place<00:04:02.510> some<00:04:03.319> kind<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.650> laminate

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
but did place some kind of a laminate

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.379 
but did place some kind of a laminate
over<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.549> label<00:04:04.940> because<00:04:05.239> I<00:04:05.269> think

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
over this label because I think

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.229 
over this label because I think
originally<00:04:05.859> it<00:04:06.859> was<00:04:07.280> just<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.639> paper<00:04:07.970> label

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
originally it was just a paper label

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.129 
originally it was just a paper label
that<00:04:08.600> tends<00:04:09.139> to<00:04:09.350> kind<00:04:09.530> of<00:04:09.590> peel<00:04:09.799> off<00:04:10.359> so<00:04:11.359> they

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
that tends to kind of peel off so they

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.599 
that tends to kind of peel off so they
put<00:04:12.350> some<00:04:12.500> kind<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.739> a<00:04:12.829> sticker<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.340> clear

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
put some kind of a sticker and clear

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.000 
put some kind of a sticker and clear
sticker<00:04:13.910> over<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.209> preserve<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.750> label<00:04:15.109> but<00:04:15.829> I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
sticker over to preserve the label but I

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.440 
sticker over to preserve the label but I
do<00:04:16.130> believe<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.789> original<00:04:17.180> label

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
do believe this is the original label

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.690 
do believe this is the original label
for<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.690> keyboard

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
for this keyboard

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.560

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
now you've seen my other video review of

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.330 
now you've seen my other video review of
this<00:04:35.450> model<00:04:35.930> keyboard<00:04:36.290> before<00:04:36.890> wasn't<00:04:37.220> this

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
this model keyboard before wasn't this

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.390 
this model keyboard before wasn't this
particular<00:04:37.820> one<00:04:37.970> but<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.270> was<00:04:38.390> this<00:04:38.510> model<00:04:38.990> and

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
particular one but it was this model and

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.860 
particular one but it was this model and
I<00:04:40.400> really<00:04:41.090> liked<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.390> because<00:04:41.480> it's<00:04:41.690> the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
I really liked it because it's the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.630 
I really liked it because it's the
space-saving<00:04:42.380> design<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.980> as<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.160> notice<00:04:43.460> on

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
space-saving design and as you notice on

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.370 
space-saving design and as you notice on
the<00:04:43.730> right<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.240> does<00:04:44.420> not<00:04:44.570> have<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.900> separate

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
the right it does not have a separate

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.470 
the right it does not have a separate
number<00:04:45.620> keypad<00:04:46.130> so<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:47.060> means<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.390> your

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
number keypad so that means that your

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.180 
number keypad so that means that your
mouse<00:04:47.690> or<00:04:47.900> your<00:04:47.990> trackpad<00:04:48.230> can<00:04:48.590> be<00:04:48.710> right<00:04:48.890> here

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
mouse or your trackpad can be right here

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.900 
mouse or your trackpad can be right here
and<00:04:49.520> just<00:04:49.550> much<00:04:50.420> closer<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:52.670> know<00:04:52.760> your

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
and just much closer in to you know your

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.260 
and just much closer in to you know your
body<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.300> more<00:04:53.390> ergonomic<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.890> this<00:04:55.040> is<00:04:55.270> ranks

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
body and more ergonomic so this is ranks

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.730 
body and more ergonomic so this is ranks
up<00:04:56.360> there<00:04:56.390> it's<00:04:56.660> probably<00:04:57.260> my<00:04:57.440> all-time

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
up there it's probably my all-time

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.770 
up there it's probably my all-time
favorite<00:04:58.340> keyboard<00:04:58.520> I'm<00:04:59.360> going<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.600> be<00:04:59.690> doing
