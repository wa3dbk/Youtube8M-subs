video game or you know in any capacity

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.560 
video game or you know in any capacity
but<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.620> know<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:15.040> just<00:02:15.220> thought<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:15.970> game

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
but you know I just thought in this game

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.900 
but you know I just thought in this game
why<00:02:16.900> not<00:02:17.110> i'll<00:02:17.260> try<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.530> out<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:17.950> when<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> first

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
why not i'll try it out and when I first

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.490 
why not i'll try it out and when I first
spawned<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.480> thought<00:02:19.660> all<00:02:19.870> right<00:02:19.990> well<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.320> is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
spawned I thought all right well this is

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.780 
spawned I thought all right well this is
like<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.910> glitch<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:23.100> visual<00:02:24.100> glitch<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
like a glitch a visual glitch of the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.390 
like a glitch a visual glitch of the
garand<00:02:25.630> because<00:02:26.080> at<00:02:26.410> first<00:02:26.590> glance<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.250> looks

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
garand because at first glance it looks

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.780 
garand because at first glance it looks
like<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> grand<00:02:27.970> but<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.680> m14<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.580> have

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
like a grand but it is the m14 you have

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.530 
like a grand but it is the m14 you have
20<00:02:31.210> rounds<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.990> is<00:02:32.290> automatic<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:34.390> know<00:02:34.510> I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
20 rounds it is automatic and you know I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.300 
20 rounds it is automatic and you know I
wasn't<00:02:34.810> really<00:02:35.050> quite<00:02:35.560> used<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.920> but<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.190> my

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
wasn't really quite used to it but is my

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.460 
wasn't really quite used to it but is my
first<00:02:36.520> game<00:02:36.760> using<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.300> got<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> pretty

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
first game using it and got a pretty

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.130 
first game using it and got a pretty
decent<00:02:38.650> score<00:02:39.160> got<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.790> know<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:40.750> Vietnam

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
decent score got you know with Vietnam

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.110 
decent score got you know with Vietnam
and<00:02:41.380> with<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.680> company<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.190> I'm<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.490> with<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and with the company that I'm in with it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.490 
and with the company that I'm in with it
with<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.390> amount<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.780> people<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.170> are<00:02:44.380> in

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
with the amount of people that are in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.780 
with the amount of people that are in
the<00:02:44.800> party<00:02:45.130> usually<00:02:45.280> when<00:02:45.580> we're<00:02:45.700> playing

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the party usually when we're playing

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.660 
the party usually when we're playing
Vietnam<00:02:46.320> six<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.470> seven<00:02:47.830> usually<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.580> know

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
Vietnam six to seven usually you know

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.990 
Vietnam six to seven usually you know
getting<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.950> competition<00:02:50.950> over<00:02:51.190> kills<00:02:51.490> and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
getting the competition over kills and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.440 
getting the competition over kills and
is<00:02:52.270> usually<00:02:52.900> pretty<00:02:53.200> fierce<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.220> find<00:02:55.209> that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
is usually pretty fierce so I find that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.230 
is usually pretty fierce so I find that
my<00:02:55.720> scores<00:02:56.320> aren't<00:02:56.620> exactly<00:02:57.190> impressive<00:02:58.000> in

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
my scores aren't exactly impressive in

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.040 
my scores aren't exactly impressive in
Vietnam<00:02:58.870> but<00:02:59.140> we<00:02:59.410> win<00:03:00.130> probably<00:03:01.030> ninety<00:03:01.930> nine

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
Vietnam but we win probably ninety nine

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.780 
Vietnam but we win probably ninety nine
percent<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.560> time<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:02.800> don't<00:03:03.190> think<00:03:03.610> we've

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
percent of the time I don't think we've

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.390 
percent of the time I don't think we've
really<00:03:03.820> lost<00:03:04.330> too<00:03:05.260> many<00:03:05.410> games<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.160> other

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
really lost too many games and other

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.270 
really lost too many games and other
rush<00:03:06.760> or<00:03:06.940> conquest<00:03:07.300> so<00:03:07.680> not<00:03:08.680> gloating<00:03:08.980> but

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
rush or conquest so not gloating but

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.280 
rush or conquest so not gloating but
just<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.870> know<00:03:10.989> an<00:03:11.200> decide<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:13.570> you

just you know an decide that you you

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.310 
just you know an decide that you you
know<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:14.500> you're<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> big<00:03:14.890> score<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.310> guess<00:03:15.700> with

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
know if you're a big score I guess with

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.140 
know if you're a big score I guess with
