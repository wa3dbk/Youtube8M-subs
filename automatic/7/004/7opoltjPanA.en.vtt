have won that by five or six goals but
quite<00:00:17.100> easily<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.580> could<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.789> lost<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.119> as

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
quite easily we could have lost that as

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.080 
quite easily we could have lost that as
well<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> mean<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:19.199> was<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.980> then<00:00:20.250> they

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
well I mean it was one one and then they

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.279 
well I mean it was one one and then they
had<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.390> boat<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.779> think<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> was<00:00:22.140> over

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
had that boat do you think it was over

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.050 
had that boat do you think it was over
the<00:00:22.470> line<00:00:22.500> oh<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.189> hard<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> tell<00:00:23.609> from<00:00:23.670> what

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.099 

technology<00:00:27.060> now<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.449> if<00:00:27.660> they've<00:00:27.840> got<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
technology now so if they've got a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.390 
technology now so if they've got a
goal-line<00:00:28.320> technology<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:29.099> would<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.310> got

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
goal-line technology they would have got

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669 
goal-line technology they would have got
instant<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> Emirates<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.500> don't

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
instant because at the Emirates I don't

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.810 
instant because at the Emirates I don't
know<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.890> saw<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> first<00:00:32.430> game<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
know if you saw in the first game of the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
know if you saw in the first game of the
season<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.390> they<00:00:33.510> showed<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.340> they

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
season but they showed it but they

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.040 
season but they showed it but they
didn't<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:36.809> from

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
didn't have that up here for more from

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.840 
didn't have that up here for more from
my<00:00:37.230> viewpoint<00:00:37.500> taking<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.309> completely

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
my viewpoint taking and completely

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.950 
my viewpoint taking and completely
unbiased<00:00:39.149> point<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.510> view<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> thought<00:00:39.840> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
unbiased point of view I thought it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.630 
unbiased point of view I thought it
might<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.260> been<00:00:40.320> over<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> line<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.160> don't

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
might have been over the line I don't

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.770 
might have been over the line I don't
like<00:00:41.760> saying<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.329> things<00:00:42.570> when<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
like saying about these things when I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
like saying about these things when I
haven't<00:00:42.989> seen<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.260> TV<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.860> anyway<00:00:44.550> forget

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
haven't seen it on TV but anyway forget

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.250 
haven't seen it on TV but anyway forget
that<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.180> won<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.750> deserve<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that we won they would deserve it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
that we won they would deserve it
winners<00:00:46.559> Sundin<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.340> feel<00:00:47.550> slightly<00:00:48.120> hard

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
winners Sundin can feel slightly hard

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.970 
winners Sundin can feel slightly hard
done<00:00:48.570> by<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> mean<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.620> could<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.770> been

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
done by but I mean we could have been

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
done by but I mean we could have been
out<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> sight<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.640> halftime<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.270> mean<00:00:51.660> we'll

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
out of sight at halftime I mean we'll

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
out of sight at halftime I mean we'll
caught<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.260> few<00:00:52.350> Eddie's<00:00:52.590> shooting<00:00:52.920> boots<00:00:53.160> on

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
caught a few Eddie's shooting boots on

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.520 
caught a few Eddie's shooting boots on
he<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.420> had<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> hat-trick<00:00:54.809> easily<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
he could have had a hat-trick easily and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.500 
he could have had a hat-trick easily and
I<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.010> think<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.670> many<00:00:56.879> goals<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.390> gonna

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
I just think how many goals are we gonna

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
I just think how many goals are we gonna
score<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.899> season<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.500> click<00:00:58.770> mr.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
himself but I think it's also gonna lead

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
himself but I think it's also gonna lead
to<00:01:11.580> other<00:01:12.479> big<00:01:12.780> players<00:01:13.020> coming<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.439> well

to other big players coming as well

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
to other big players coming as well

to be looking at thinking I'm going to
school<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> load<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> ghosts<00:01:17.759> awesome<00:01:18.619> because

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
school a load of ghosts awesome because

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
school a load of ghosts awesome because
all<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> wasn't<00:01:20.159> even<00:01:20.220> playing<00:01:20.520> today<00:01:20.790> we

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
all it wasn't even playing today we

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
all it wasn't even playing today we

a<00:01:23.070> big<00:01:23.310> statement<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.240> click<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
a big statement but when we click and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.480
