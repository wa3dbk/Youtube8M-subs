 copy and paste 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.100
 done 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.730

 winrar del gip any program that 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.700
 you have and winery as times eliminates 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.740
 perfect then you have to go inside 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.250
 the package we downloaded e 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.640
 move these files here with everyone 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.560

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.170
 royal and world car 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:40.120
 you don't have to put them on so let's go 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:46.540
 inside this here the jar file e 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.010

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.989
 installation 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:02.200

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:06.370
 rename the jar file while in c 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:13.150
 chicken precisely because the name of the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:15.829
 folder also this useless chicken here 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:58.629
 normal does so we can close everything 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.629
 let's start minecraft 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:22.049
