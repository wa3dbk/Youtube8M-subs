00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.859
 [Music] 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.210
 i 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.350
 hello I am veronica for today 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.900
 everything and pastry and I have prepared 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.300
 something to pamper all moms in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 this May 10 we are going to do together 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.789
 some of easy plasters I have here already 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.009
 prepared 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.469
 of bread that can be any screen 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
 of these to make context that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.809
 you like 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.750
 and I also have a mold in the form of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.860
 hemispheres then nothing else I'm going to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.370
 fill a mold 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 ah 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.180
 Baked at 230 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.430
 they already went out to these cupcakes from the oven 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 then nothing else 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.670
 I'm going to unmold 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 [Music] 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 and since you mold obviously we have 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.369
 to cut all the part that is sponged 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 so that we have good plans and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.920
 set aside the loaves so that they remain 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 planes we are going to put some stuffing that to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 you like me here I have a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.409
 lemon cream but it can be another fring 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.409
 it can be some cheese filling 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.210
 all right 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.010
 the loaves 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.680
 and that's what it's going to be 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.680
 two 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.730
 and I'm going to hit them is wrong 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.400
 and now to give it the shape of a teapot 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.800
 I have here almond marzipan that I paint 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.230
 of yellow but you can paint it 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.760
 color that you want and I 'm going to 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.370
 to extend 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:03.330
 to go covering all my cake 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.600
 I finish extending and I will give a 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.470
 little bit of water with a brush 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.470
 to be able to paste 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.260
 since we cover perfectly I'm going to 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.120
 put my cake on a base where 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.970
 we can give it shape and we can 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.700
 go manipulating a little more and nothing more 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.890
 I have to put all my marzipan 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.069
 almond on top 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.480
 in this way 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.670
 and very carefully I will be molding 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.499
 bit by bit and for that I 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.950
 I can help with a pair of scissors to go 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:43.889
 trimming all the excess and here I have 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.040
 royal lighting of white color and let's 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.920
 go decorating we can go making some 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.300
 cracks 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 thus 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.120
 black and I will put points 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.490
 below each of the frets 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.220
 in this way 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.770
 and I'm going to let it dry once 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.010
 we have everything completely decorated and that 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.140
 already dried up if they are fixed here is a base 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.630
 if it is fondant by the color that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.420
 I want them to stay white and swim 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.220
 more a little circle and here I have the other 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.880
 pieces that I made to let dry during 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.060
 all night that's the date the other 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.750
 part of the teapot and the lid to all you 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.190
 I put chopsticks so he can hold on 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.050
 and now all we have to do is 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.670
 once it's already well I know that everything 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:44.520
 this is to go putting 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:47.130
 [Music] 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.910
 and this list is this third here 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.100
 I show other options I made several and 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.230
 this is precisely the idea that you 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.900
 also make several and of different 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.030
 colors I hope you liked it and not 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.220
 forget to give her little hand rita and subscribe 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:08.830
 to my channel we'll see each other until the next 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.830
