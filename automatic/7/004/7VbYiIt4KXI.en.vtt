Minecraft<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.359> name<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> subsidy<00:00:22.080> is

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
Minecraft the name of the subsidy is

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.070 
Minecraft the name of the subsidy is
piston<00:00:22.890> monster<00:00:23.189> trap<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.510> start<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.900> you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
piston monster trap and to start off you

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.900 
piston monster trap and to start off you
want<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> make<00:00:25.350> an<00:00:25.529> outline<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.760> each

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
want to make an outline and at each

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
want to make an outline and at each
corner<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> outline<00:00:27.810> put<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.439> wood<00:00:28.650> plank

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
corner of the outline put one wood plank

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.299 
corner of the outline put one wood plank
and<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.420> look<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.099> next<00:00:32.099> put

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and so it look like this next put

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
and so it look like this next put
pistons<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.880> between<00:00:33.239> each<00:00:33.360> set<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.630> wood

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
pistons in between each set of wood

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.630 
pistons in between each set of wood
planks<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.309> sticky

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
planks they don't have to be sticky

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.920 
planks they don't have to be sticky
pistons<00:00:36.030> that's<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.450> what<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> had<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
pistons that's just what I had at the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.950 
pistons that's just what I had at the
time<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> once<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.570> filled<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
time and so once it's all filled in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.770 
time and so once it's all filled in
it'll<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.540> next<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> want

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it'll look like this and next you want

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
it'll look like this and next you want
to<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.110> fence<00:00:43.320> posts<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> put<00:00:44.399> two

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
to get some fence posts and put two

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.850 
to get some fence posts and put two
fence<00:00:44.879> posts<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.329> each<00:00:45.480> corner<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.710> top

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
fence posts at each corner like on top

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.060 
fence posts at each corner like on top
of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> wood<00:00:47.190> planks<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:51.289> once<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.530> once

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
of the wood planks so once you're once

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.470 
of the wood planks so once you're once
you<00:00:53.219> get<00:00:53.370> done<00:00:53.520> doing<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.000> it'll<00:00:54.180> look<00:00:54.239> like

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you get done doing that it'll look like

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.350 
you get done doing that it'll look like
this<00:00:55.789> next<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.149> some<00:00:57.270> wood

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
this next you want to get some wood

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880 
this next you want to get some wood
planks<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:57.989> cobblestone<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.559> whatever<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.160 
planks or cobblestone or whatever you
like<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> put<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.910> top<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> fences<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like and put it on top of the fences and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.940 
like and put it on top of the fences and
continue<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> outline<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:06.950> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
continue to make the outline on top so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.000 
continue to make the outline on top so
continue<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.520> fill<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.880> in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.550 

all<00:01:13.640> right<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:13.940> Knicks<00:01:14.690> you'll<00:01:15.230> need<00:01:15.380> a

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
all right and Knicks you'll need a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.200 
all right and Knicks you'll need a
pressure<00:01:15.890> plates<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.400> can<00:01:16.580> do<00:01:16.730> nine<00:01:16.910> if<00:01:17.090> you'd

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
pressure plates you can do nine if you'd

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.870 
pressure plates you can do nine if you'd
like<00:01:17.420> by<00:01:17.630> choose<00:01:17.900> not<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.400> put<00:01:19.400> all<00:01:19.670> eight<00:01:19.700> of

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
like by choose not to put all eight of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.160 
like by choose not to put all eight of
them<00:01:20.000> around<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.420> reason<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:20.750> don't<00:01:20.810> fill<00:01:21.080> in

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
them around the reason I don't fill in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.780 
them around the reason I don't fill in
the<00:01:21.260> center<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.680> because<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.100> actually<00:01:22.310> serves

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
the center is because it actually serves

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.240 
the center is because it actually serves
no<00:01:22.880> purpose<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:24.170> that's<00:01:24.800> how<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:24.980> make<00:01:25.220> it

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
no purpose so that's how you make it

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.980 
no purpose so that's how you make it
that's<00:01:25.820> what<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.060> looks<00:01:26.210> like<00:01:26.420> my<00:01:26.630> buddy<00:01:26.810> new

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
that's what it looks like my buddy new

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.510 
that's what it looks like my buddy new
blue<00:01:27.170> Vette<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.500> gonna<00:01:27.680> demonstrate<00:01:27.920> how<00:01:28.250> it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
blue Vette is gonna demonstrate how it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.250 
blue Vette is gonna demonstrate how it
works<00:01:28.580> every<00:01:29.570> time<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:29.840> step<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
works every time you step in the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.170 
works every time you step in the
pressure<00:01:30.470> plate<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.400> piston<00:01:31.790> will<00:01:31.880> come<00:01:32.030> up

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
pressure plate the piston will come up

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.930 
pressure plate the piston will come up
so<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.420> can't<00:01:32.660> get<00:01:32.780> out<00:01:33.190> so<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.220> think<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:34.760> a

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
so you can't get out so I think it's a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.940 
so you can't get out so I think it's a
pretty<00:01:35.240> cool<00:01:35.420> way<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:36.200> know<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.590> travel

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
pretty cool way you know to travel

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.530 
pretty cool way you know to travel
monster<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:37.640> different<00:01:37.970> from<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.300> soil

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
monster it's different from the soil

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.450 
monster it's different from the soil
sand<00:01:38.750> method<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:39.710> pretty<00:01:39.920> much<00:01:40.010> your<00:01:40.190> choice

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
sand method it's pretty much your choice

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.320 
sand method it's pretty much your choice
I<00:01:40.730> like<00:01:40.940> it
