00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
probably leave a link somewhere around

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.850 
probably leave a link somewhere around
there<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.470> um<00:00:40.309> yeah<00:00:40.699> let's<00:00:40.910> get<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.210> it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
there and um yeah let's get to it

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.840 
there and um yeah let's get to it
what<00:00:42.860> I<00:00:42.890> like<00:00:43.070> about<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:43.430> trick<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.820> the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
what I like about this trick is the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.450 
what I like about this trick is the
record<00:00:44.269> not<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.629> setup<00:00:44.809> or<00:00:45.559> gimmicks<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.159> know

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
record not to setup or gimmicks you know

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.390 
record not to setup or gimmicks you know
double<00:00:46.790> cards<00:00:47.180> or<00:00:47.300> anything<00:00:47.510> like<00:00:47.720> that<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.400> to

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
double cards or anything like that so to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.329 
double cards or anything like that so to
do<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.640> trick<00:00:49.909> as<00:00:50.089> you<00:00:50.900> usually<00:00:51.049> would<00:00:51.339> you

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
do the trick as you usually would you

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.109 
do the trick as you usually would you
have<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.909> shuffle<00:00:53.119> the<00:00:53.299> cards<00:00:54.970> so<00:00:55.970> you<00:00:56.000> can

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
have to shuffle the cards so you can

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.490 
have to shuffle the cards so you can
even<00:00:56.390> hand<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.600> cards<00:00:56.839> out<00:00:56.900> of<00:00:56.989> respect<00:00:57.170> that

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
even hand the cards out of respect that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.259 
even hand the cards out of respect that
doesn't<00:00:57.799> matter<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.729> now<00:00:58.909> what<00:00:59.059> you<00:00:59.119> do<00:00:59.239> is

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
doesn't matter and now what you do is

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.539 
doesn't matter and now what you do is
you<00:00:59.869> know<00:01:00.019> spectators<00:01:00.799> are<00:01:00.949> free<00:01:01.100> selected

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
you know spectators are free selected

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.320 
you know spectators are free selected
card<00:01:01.760> let's<00:01:02.629> say<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:02.809> choose<00:01:03.049> this<00:01:03.260> one<00:01:04.330> before

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
card let's say I choose this one before

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.870 
card let's say I choose this one before
the<00:01:05.720> spades

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
the spades

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.580 
the spades
now<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:07.939> first<00:01:08.240> move<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:09.290> have<00:01:09.409> to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
now the first move is you have to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.830 
now the first move is you have to
control<00:01:09.950> with<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.220> card<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.450> bottom<00:01:11.780> of

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
control with the card to the bottom of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.600 
control with the card to the bottom of
the<00:01:11.960> deck<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.159> what<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.400> can<00:01:13.549> do<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:15.430> place<00:01:16.430> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
the deck so what you can do is place the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.420 
the deck so what you can do is place the
card<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.060> back<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:18.350> push<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.619> in<00:01:19.159> and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
card the back and you push it in and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.120 
card the back and you push it in and
leave<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:19.700> out<00:01:19.790> jog<00:01:20.150> through<00:01:20.299> a<00:01:20.390> bit<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.130> then

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
leave it out jog through a bit and then

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.010 
leave it out jog through a bit and then
with<00:01:22.369> with<00:01:22.759> your<00:01:22.909> thumb<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:23.299> just<00:01:23.539> push<00:01:23.749> up

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
with with your thumb you just push up

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.440 
with with your thumb you just push up
and<00:01:24.289> in<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.159> then<00:01:25.670> gives<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.090> bit<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.390> a

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
and in and then gives you a bit of a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.010 
and in and then gives you a bit of a
break<00:01:26.689> now<00:01:27.109> what<00:01:27.289> you<00:01:27.350> can<00:01:27.439> do<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:27.909> just<00:01:28.909> go<00:01:29.509> tap

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
break now what you can do is just go tap

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.739 
break now what you can do is just go tap
like<00:01:30.200> you're<00:01:30.350> screwing<00:01:30.740> up<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:30.979> deck<00:01:31.189> and

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
like you're screwing up the deck and

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.289

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.160 
make sure and keep your pinkie in that
where<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.569> break<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:36.950> file<00:01:37.219> space<00:01:38.170> now

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
where the break is so you file space now

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.870

to<00:01:39.229> go<00:01:39.439> to<00:01:39.469> the<00:01:39.679> bottom<00:01:40.069> you<00:01:40.280> can<00:01:40.340> either<00:01:40.579> take

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
to go to the bottom you can either take

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.779 
to go to the bottom you can either take
where<00:01:41.179> your<00:01:41.299> pinkie<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:42.319> just<00:01:43.310> drop<00:01:43.579> it<00:01:43.700> to

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
could take forces from the bottom and

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.349 
could take forces from the bottom and
bring<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.659> top<00:01:50.979> either<00:01:51.979> way<00:01:52.359> you've

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
bring it to the top either way you've

bring it to the top either way you've
got<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.659> farthest<00:01:53.990> space<00:01:54.049> at<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.380> bottom<00:01:54.499> and

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
got the farthest space at the bottom and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.940 
got the farthest space at the bottom and
even<00:01:56.539> if<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.780> know<00:01:56.899> other<00:01:57.049> ways<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.590> force<00:01:57.829> the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
even if you know other ways to force the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.200 
even if you know other ways to force the
cut<00:01:58.130> at<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.280> bottom<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:58.670> can<00:01:58.819> do<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.060> as

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
cut at the bottom you can do that as

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.660 
cut at the bottom you can do that as
well<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.450> doesn't<00:01:59.659> really<00:01:59.869> matter<00:02:00.139> now<00:02:00.670> once

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
well it doesn't really matter now once

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.010 
well it doesn't really matter now once
you've<00:02:01.789> done<00:02:01.819> that<00:02:01.969> here<00:02:02.659> comes<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
you've done that here comes the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.800 
you've done that here comes the
important<00:02:03.439> bit<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:04.340> where<00:02:04.549> yeah<00:02:04.999> we<00:02:05.389> palm

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
important bit this is where yeah we palm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.020 
important bit this is where yeah we palm
the<00:02:05.990> cart<00:02:06.229> now<00:02:07.219> how<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.399> did<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.939> was<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:10.030> with
