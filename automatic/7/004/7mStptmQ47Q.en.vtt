00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
vertical mill serial number se3 1 204 it

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.099 
vertical mill serial number se3 1 204 it
has<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> two<00:00:12.809> axis<00:00:13.019> servo<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:14.330> CNC<00:00:15.330> system<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.929> it

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
has a two axis servo to CNC system on it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.210 
has a two axis servo to CNC system on it
and<00:00:17.180> the<00:00:18.180> machine<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.750> also<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.350> ran<00:00:19.560> strictly

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and the machine can also be ran strictly

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.450 
and the machine can also be ran strictly
manual<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.109> you<00:00:22.109> would<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> 2<00:00:22.769> axis<00:00:23.010> x

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
manual and you would have the 2 axis x

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.390 
manual and you would have the 2 axis x
and<00:00:23.670> y<00:00:23.760> power<00:00:24.150> feed<00:00:24.510> units<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.650> also<00:00:25.800> has<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and y power feed units it also has a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.060 
and y power feed units it also has a
Sargon<00:00:26.880> 3<00:00:27.240> axis<00:00:27.689> digital<00:00:28.140> readout<00:00:28.500> we're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
Sargon 3 axis digital readout we're

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.900 
Sargon 3 axis digital readout we're
going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.849> quick<00:00:30.029> look

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.200 

and<00:00:37.120> then<00:00:38.080> we'll<00:00:38.230> run<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.560> program<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.310> program

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
and then we'll run the program a program

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.529 
and then we'll run the program a program
that<00:00:40.450> jaundice<00:00:40.960> row

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.779 

we<00:00:45.019> do<00:00:45.170> have<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.440> manuals<00:00:45.890> we<00:00:46.160> have<00:00:46.339> the

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
we do have the manuals we have the

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.079 
we do have the manuals we have the
lagoon<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.350> servo<00:00:48.829> -<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.550> Sark<00:00:49.789> on<00:00:49.940> that

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
lagoon the servo - and the Sark on that

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:57.250 
lagoon the servo - and the Sark on that
is<00:00:51.609> okay<00:00:54.879> yeah<00:00:55.909> -<00:00:56.510> are<00:00:56.570> using<00:00:56.899> today<00:00:56.960> is<00:00:57.229> a

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
is okay yeah - are using today is a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.520 
is okay yeah - are using today is a
sharpie<00:00:58.690> we're<00:00:59.690> gonna<00:00:59.780> run<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.109> spindle<00:01:00.440> at

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
sharpie we're gonna run the spindle at

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:14.789 
sharpie we're gonna run the spindle at
2100<00:01:01.309> rpm

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:24.899 

linear<00:01:15.490> interpolation<00:01:16.390> and

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.980 

straight-cut

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:47.280 

is<00:01:33.470> more<00:01:33.740> fun<00:01:34.009> of<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.250> pen

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.260 

the<00:01:48.290> DRL<00:01:48.740> traction<00:01:49.310> all<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.550> way<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.850> control

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
the DRL traction all the way the control

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.420 
the DRL traction all the way the control
actually<00:01:50.690> reads<00:01:51.050> its<00:01:51.260> positioning<00:01:51.860> from<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
actually reads its positioning from the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:37.050 
actually reads its positioning from the
digital<00:01:52.910> readout<00:01:53.090> not<00:01:53.570> from<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.050> motors

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.339 

I'm<00:02:37.239> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.780> angle<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.200> other

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
I'm going to do the angle the other

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:57.350 
I'm going to do the angle the other
direction

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:29.809 

make<00:02:57.600> cut<00:02:57.870> deeper

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.620 

just<00:03:30.420> like<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.829> all<00:03:31.829> right

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
just like that all right

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.460 
just like that all right
we<00:03:34.350> also<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.890> some<00:03:35.580> cheat<00:03:36.210> sheets<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
we also have some cheat sheets on the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.270 
we also have some cheat sheets on the
servo<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.800> system<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.150> can<00:03:39.330> email<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:40.280> to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
servo to system and I can email to to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.380 
servo to system and I can email to to
you<00:03:41.400> if<00:03:41.580> you'd<00:03:41.790> like

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390
