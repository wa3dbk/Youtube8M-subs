00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
um and then make that invisible go back

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.879 
um and then make that invisible go back
to<00:04:19.870> your<00:04:19.900> solid<00:04:20.440> layer<00:04:20.790> go<00:04:21.790> custom<00:04:22.510> layers

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
to your solid layer go custom layers

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.280 
to your solid layer go custom layers
custom<00:04:23.889> take<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.370> masks<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.150> then<00:04:25.990> on<00:04:26.169> the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
custom take the masks and then on the
