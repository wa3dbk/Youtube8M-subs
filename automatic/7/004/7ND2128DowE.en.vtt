big dent specialist his idea behind this
tool<00:00:41.200> was<00:00:41.440> developed<00:00:41.610> something<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:43.510> would

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
tool was developed something that would

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.860 
tool was developed something that would
basically<00:00:44.260> bring<00:00:44.620> down<00:00:44.980> crowns<00:00:45.730> around<00:00:46.720> the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
basically bring down crowns around the

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.460 
basically bring down crowns around the
dents<00:00:47.110> much<00:00:47.739> cleaner<00:00:48.160> than<00:00:49.000> your<00:00:49.180> traditional

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
dents much cleaner than your traditional

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.619 
dents much cleaner than your traditional
knockdown<00:00:50.470> let's<00:00:51.190> go<00:00:51.339> ahead<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.820> start<00:00:52.420> off

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
knockdown let's go ahead and start off

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.750 
knockdown let's go ahead and start off
with<00:00:52.900> some<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.800> things<00:00:54.070> that<00:00:54.250> I<00:00:54.280> noticed

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
with some of the things that I noticed

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.149 
with some of the things that I noticed
when<00:00:54.970> this<00:00:55.180> thing<00:00:55.360> came<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.839> me<00:00:55.989> number<00:00:56.650> one<00:00:57.010> is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
when this thing came to me number one is

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.390 
when this thing came to me number one is
that<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.610> solid<00:00:58.420> solid<00:00:59.080> tool<00:00:59.500> it's<00:01:00.220> got<00:01:00.370> a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
that it is a solid solid tool it's got a

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.180 
that it is a solid solid tool it's got a
little<00:01:00.820> bit<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:01.059> weight<00:01:01.360> behind<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:02.019> which<00:01:03.010> can

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
little bit of weight behind it which can

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.360 
little bit of weight behind it which can
really<00:01:03.519> for<00:01:03.699> myself<00:01:03.879> can<00:01:04.330> be<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.479> good<00:01:04.720> thing

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
really for myself can be a good thing

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.940 
really for myself can be a good thing
I'll<00:01:06.370> explain<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.940> little<00:01:07.030> bit<00:01:07.420> later

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
I'll explain that a little bit later

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.330 
I'll explain that a little bit later
however<00:01:08.950> it's<00:01:09.520> got<00:01:09.729> comes<00:01:10.390> with<00:01:10.600> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
however it's got comes with this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.370 
however it's got comes with this
industrial-strength<00:01:12.810> duct<00:01:13.810> tape<00:01:14.080> on<00:01:14.290> the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
industrial-strength duct tape on the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.800 
industrial-strength duct tape on the
surface<00:01:14.590> now<00:01:15.010> this<00:01:15.310> does<00:01:15.700> stay<00:01:16.090> on<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.600> tool

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
surface now this does stay on the tool

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.530 
surface now this does stay on the tool
so<00:01:17.650> this<00:01:17.830> will<00:01:18.010> protect<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.700> metal<00:01:19.060> that's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
so this will protect the metal that's

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.600 
so this will protect the metal that's
shaped<00:01:20.080> underneath<00:01:20.710> here<00:01:21.010> from<00:01:21.190> actually

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
shaped underneath here from actually

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.420 
shaped underneath here from actually
marring<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.030> panel<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.920> has<00:01:24.220> been

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
marring the panel it has been

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.820 
marring the panel it has been
strategically<00:01:24.670> designed<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:26.080> mean<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.680> have

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
strategically designed I mean I have

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.420 
strategically designed I mean I have
watched<00:01:27.130> Sal's<00:01:27.900> video<00:01:28.900> on<00:01:29.290> this<00:01:29.620> and<00:01:29.920> it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
watched Sal's video on this and it

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.590 
watched Sal's video on this and it
really<00:01:30.760> gave<00:01:31.180> me<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.870> a<00:01:32.610> good<00:01:33.610> understanding<00:01:34.450> of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
really gave me a a good understanding of

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.140 
really gave me a a good understanding of
the<00:01:35.230> amount<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.620> time<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:35.920> he<00:01:36.430> actually<00:01:36.880> put

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
the amount of time that he actually put

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.600 
the amount of time that he actually put
into<00:01:37.540> developing<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.250> take<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.460> look

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
into developing this and you take a look

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.040 
into developing this and you take a look
at<00:01:39.760> this<00:01:39.880> tool<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.360> thing<00:01:40.570> was<00:01:40.780> not

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
at this tool this thing was not

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.100 
at this tool this thing was not
developed<00:01:41.740> overnight<00:01:42.150> Sal<00:01:43.150> actually<00:01:43.900> went

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
developed overnight Sal actually went

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.800 
developed overnight Sal actually went
through<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.380> lot<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:45.070> protocol<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.540> lot<00:01:46.780> of

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
through a lot of protocol and a lot of

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.170 
through a lot of protocol and a lot of
different<00:01:47.110> tools<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:48.310> come<00:01:48.580> up<00:01:48.700> with<00:01:48.880> this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
different tools to come up with this

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.770 
different tools to come up with this
specific<00:01:49.480> design<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.880> anyhow<00:01:52.180> out<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.570> box

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
specific design so anyhow out of the box

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.600 
specific design so anyhow out of the box
number<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.590> get<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.980> watch<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.460> video

it I mean there was a lot of things that
I<00:02:05.350> learned<00:02:05.680> now<00:02:05.830> when<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:05.980> first<00:02:06.310> got<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.730> I<00:02:06.820> was

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
I learned now when I first got it I was

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.800 
I learned now when I first got it I was
able<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.330> use<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:09.340> I<00:02:09.519> can<00:02:09.789> definitely<00:02:10.509> use

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
able to use it but I can definitely use

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.199 
able to use it but I can definitely use
it<00:02:10.959> much<00:02:11.170> more<00:02:11.440> effectively<00:02:11.980> after<00:02:12.340> watching

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
it much more effectively after watching

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.720 
it much more effectively after watching
his<00:02:14.019> video<00:02:15.900> again<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.680> does<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.159> a<00:02:18.400> nice

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
his video again it does have a nice

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.820 
his video again it does have a nice
little<00:02:19.120> sweet<00:02:19.540> spot<00:02:19.690> right<00:02:20.110> through<00:02:20.379> here<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
little sweet spot right through here and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.369 
little sweet spot right through here and
it<00:02:21.340> begins<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:22.090> tighten<00:02:22.450> up<00:02:22.810> through<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
it begins to tighten up through the

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.170 
it begins to tighten up through the
center<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.950> don't<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.550> if<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.819> see<00:02:25.000> this

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
traditionally the way that Sal designed

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.150 
traditionally the way that Sal designed
it<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.910> be<00:02:50.000> used<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.570> place<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.620> panel

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
it to be used and place it on the panel

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.570 
it to be used and place it on the panel
and<00:02:52.310> tap<00:02:53.060> down<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.510> crown<00:02:53.870> with<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:55.310> going

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
and tap down a crown with it it's going

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.229 
and tap down a crown with it it's going
to<00:02:55.820> leave<00:02:56.170> what<00:02:57.170> Sal<00:02:57.680> calls<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.459> nothing<00:02:58.970> mark

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
to leave what Sal calls a nothing mark

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.840 
to leave what Sal calls a nothing mark
and<00:02:59.590> basically<00:03:00.590> what<00:03:00.800> that<00:03:00.830> is<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.400> takes<00:03:01.640> down

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
and basically what that is it takes down

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.890
