00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hey guys what's up aside from here today

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.409 
hey guys what's up aside from here today
we're<00:00:01.860> doing<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.100> master<00:00:02.460> rank<00:00:02.700> 5<00:00:02.909> test<00:00:03.240> now

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
we're doing the master rank 5 test now

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.090 
we're doing the master rank 5 test now
this<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.720> one<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.020> tests<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.589> most

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
this is one of the tests that most

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.820 
this is one of the tests that most
people<00:00:05.400> feel<00:00:05.960> well<00:00:06.960> not<00:00:07.140> most<00:00:07.350> people<00:00:07.620> some

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
people feel well not most people some

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.709 
people feel well not most people some
people<00:00:08.099> feel<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.490> test<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.179> don't

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
people feel this test I really don't

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.450 
people feel this test I really don't
blame<00:00:09.900> them<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> hacking<00:00:10.800> test<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.219> think<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
blame them as a hacking test I think the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.879 
blame them as a hacking test I think the
first<00:00:11.700> time<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.240> ever<00:00:12.389> did<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.990> think<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.740> got

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
first time I ever did it I think I got

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.890 
first time I ever did it I think I got
close<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.130> feeling<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.360> know<00:00:15.480> it's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
close to feeling it but you know it's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.689 
close to feeling it but you know it's
kind<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.260> problematic<00:00:16.710> test<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.340> never<00:00:17.520> get

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
kind of a problematic test you never get

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.519 
kind of a problematic test you never get
it<00:00:17.850> done<00:00:17.880> or<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.210> can't<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.690> then<00:00:19.439> we

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
it done or you can't so then we

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.929 
it done or you can't so then we
disheartened<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.189> feel<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.820> do

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
disheartened if you feel that you can do

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.640 
disheartened if you feel that you can do
it<00:00:21.029> again<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> next<00:00:21.420> day<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.810> we're<00:00:22.619> just

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it again the next day so we're just

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.740 
it again the next day so we're just
going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> go<00:00:23.039> ahead<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.550> go<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
going to go ahead and go in this is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.839 
going to go ahead and go in this is
actually<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.769> shit<00:00:26.130> up<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.670> equip<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.480> weapon

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
actually up shit up the equip a weapon

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.280 
actually up shit up the equip a weapon
secondary<00:00:29.849> probably<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:32.360> have<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.020> here

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
secondary probably I have to go in here

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.520 
secondary probably I have to go in here
and<00:00:34.500> hack<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> bunch<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.820> panels<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.530> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
and hack a bunch of panels and the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.959 
and hack a bunch of panels and the
reason<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.860> most<00:00:37.980> people<00:00:38.129> fail<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
reason that most people fail this is it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.660 
reason that most people fail this is it
increases<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.960> difficulty<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.430> hack<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
increases in difficulty as you hack the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.889 
increases in difficulty as you hack the
panels<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.300> there's<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.690> more

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
panels so there's going to be more

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.729 
panels so there's going to be more
difficult<00:00:43.110> panels<00:00:43.770> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:45.320> second<00:00:46.320> point<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
difficult panels at the second point of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.729 
difficult panels at the second point of
it<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> second<00:00:47.520> stage<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:49.260> could<00:00:49.469> use

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it like the second stage you could use

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979 
it like the second stage you could use
ciphers<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.420> know<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> waste

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
ciphers but you know it's kind of waste

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.540 
ciphers but you know it's kind of waste
of<00:00:52.230> resources<00:00:52.379> doing<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> will

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
of resources doing it you can do it will

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
of resources doing it you can do it will
like<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.210> very<00:00:54.360> easy<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.989> make<00:00:55.079> sure

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
like them it's very easy just make sure

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.860 
like them it's very easy just make sure
you<00:00:55.620> rush<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> tunnels<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.780> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you rush to the tunnels you see all I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
you rush to the tunnels you see all I
have<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.850> get<00:00:59.850> them<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.210> join<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.629> oh<00:01:05.270> my

what<00:03:35.030> they<00:03:35.150> did<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.510> they<00:03:35.540> they<00:03:36.380> started<00:03:36.799> it

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
what they did is they they started it

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.530 
what they did is they they started it
and<00:03:37.130> before<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.610> patch<00:03:37.820> they<00:03:38.209> were<00:03:38.330> like

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
and before the patch they were like

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.780 
and before the patch they were like
without<00:03:39.290> their<00:03:39.500> thing<00:03:39.769> was<00:03:40.220> done<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.610> way<00:03:40.730> so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
without their thing was done the way so

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.910 
without their thing was done the way so
all<00:03:41.060> they<00:03:41.180> did<00:03:41.330> was<00:03:41.360> like<00:03:41.660> them<00:03:41.840> they<00:03:42.590> slid

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
all they did was like them they slid

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.440 
all they did was like them they slid
over<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.459> they<00:03:43.519> jumped<00:03:43.760> back<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.239> thing

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
over and they jumped back on the thing

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.990 
over and they jumped back on the thing
so<00:03:44.690> yeah<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:45.769> not<00:03:45.890> legit<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.400> room<00:03:46.790> looks

and then we go back to the main room

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.749 
and then we go back to the main room
where<00:04:23.330> we<00:04:23.479> spawn<00:04:23.919> which<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.039> can't<00:04:25.280> change<00:04:25.520> the

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
where we spawn which I can't change the

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.279 
where we spawn which I can't change the
spawn<00:04:26.030> room<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.360> be<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:26.509> different<00:04:26.900> gray<00:04:27.050> hole

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
spawn room to be a different gray hole

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:33.540 
spawn room to be a different gray hole
