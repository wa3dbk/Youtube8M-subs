00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.240
 you want a nice and original idea for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.100
 encrypt the pandoro we have advanced 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.109
 of the Christmas holidays 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.240
 then you must prepare these truffles 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.400
 but made them with the recipe of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.840
 saffron yellow 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.619
 like them are very good at all 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.599
 your guests 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:38.850
 so if you want to see how I have them 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:41.460
 preparations stay here for almost 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.020
 our won truffles serve you well 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.450
 400 g of pandoro about half caldoro 100 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.829
 ml of fresh cream data unfortunately in 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.579
 this case I didn't have it at home and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.199
 use of milk the grated rind 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 of a bitter cocoa orange as required 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.719
 then for the chocolate ganache that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.540
 it would be the decoration of the truffle 50 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.500
 grams of dark chocolate and 50 ml of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 liquid fresh cream 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.549
 I, as I have already said, use of milk 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 but it's better to use it when 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.009
 maybe made with cream and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.009
 rainbow balls to adjust china 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:29.049
 first take pandoro 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.390
 try it in small pieces a little at a time and 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.990
 of course of our employer and the thing 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 rare species 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.140
 so that reducing it to a kind of 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.590
 flour and keep it up for the whole 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.590
 Pandoro 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.660
 so now we've got this 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.060
 Pandoro flour species we go there 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:27.020
 to add the cream in this ours 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:27.020
 nice milk and the grated rind launches 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.390
 and now go and knead with your fingers 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.300
 but without making pandoro too much 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.670
 compact where so going to make more 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.670
 homogeneous unfortunately compact 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.750
 ok I wet the pandoro well 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.140
 now take the 50 ml of cream for the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.959
 ganache and put it on the fire until 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.920
 touch the boil while the milk on 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.269
 fire or in this case the cream anyway 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.640
 get started making balls 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.470
 with the pandoro of the size that 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.940
 you want to compact the ball well for good 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.099
 form the tar tufino place and go to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.019
 put in a dish with bitter cocoa 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:36.250
 and with this movement as you cover with 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.590
 cocoa once you have covered it but 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.130
 take it that you are baking cups 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:47.829
 in short, where do you want to serve them? 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:50.519
 see another behave with them ed 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.519
 the third wine 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.750
 bitter cocoa 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:10.440
 and away and continue like this until you finish the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:16.350
 pandoro cream and milk 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:20.070
 bubbles off fire and go to 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:28.530
 reach the chocolate 50 grams of 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:30.450
 dark chocolate and I go to mix 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.210
 until the melt is completely dissolved 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:41.850
 chocolate and thus obtain a creamy sauce 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:44.100
 we will also leave come then 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.340
 last time I used 50 grams of 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.380
 chocolate and 50 grams ml of cream and yes 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.630
 a creamy sauce is formed immediately 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.550
 as this time of the milk and not therefore 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.470
 it's not really a garage has remained a while 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.110
 liquid 15 goes to add other 50 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.180
 grams of dark chocolate so al 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.980
 third a bit more this cream though if 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.170
 use the ball you should not have this 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.620
 problem and the dose remains what you are 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:12.090
 I said before however with milk it is not 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.230
 a ganache so an increase of some 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.230
 chocolate and is happy 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.700
 ok i did cool question 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.770
 now and of consistency 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:30.210
 19 tartufini now come to taste 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.090
 take some icing or jaws and the 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:38.790
 put a little over each single core 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.970
 so just dive a way with the 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.970
 decoration 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:08.610
 ok now I'm going to decorate with the 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:09.900
 balls to co heartbeat correlation 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.930
 you can also put grains of 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.440
 hazelnuts I told chocolate that 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.440
 which you prefer 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.280
 here you have our truffles ready 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.720
 store them in the refrigerator until 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.120
 time to eat them because obviously 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.759
 have within ie milk so I hope to 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.099
 research both liked and hope it can 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.960
 be united to recycle pandoro 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.930
 which could be advanced as it was 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.810
 already same obviously you can do it too 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:47.280
 with the panettone with sponge cake o 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.380
 any kind of cake is a way 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.110
 original for acting 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.210

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.340
