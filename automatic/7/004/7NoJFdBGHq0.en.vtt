00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.679
 I hope very well at this time 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.210
 you're eating something, you're quiet from 

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.070
 another side of the computer looking at my 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.289
 videos and learning more and more about 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.839
 what is this bodybuilding world and what 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.420
 which is to be well and in shape as well as 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.460
 gain muscles quickly good if 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.500
 we want to achieve the chord musculature or 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.620
 if we stay in an important body 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.450
 worked defined and others is very 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.550
 important the constancy to what I 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.220
 I refer with constancy not to surrender 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.509
 never if to fall many times and come back 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.490
 to get up without any problem 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.590
 Let's go straight to the point if you go to 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.960
 gym and you have your diet and you have your 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.450
 routine please respect what I had 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.820
 your instructor your personal trainer 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.100
 respect him because he will be made to measure 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.170
 of what you need this kind of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.590
 training so much physical routine 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.149
 as a diet then by 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.579
 more than come a friend or some 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.710
 known to those who always believe it 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.970
 in the gym they always tell you not to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.829
 this way it's not right that you train 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600
 it is good that you train differently and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.770
 he says no this is not simple be it like this 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.870
 this way 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.760
 if your personal trainer or your trainer 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.340
 he told you to come in that way 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.060
 respected by the judge not all types 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.690
 somatic of the body or bodies 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.630
 thin obese directly with 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.430
 large frame is not the same one 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.890
 another yes that is what can work very 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.750
 good for that person may that for you 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.040
 does not work well and what can that for 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.780
 it works very well for the other 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.880
 person are not made 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.830
 I am so sure of this that I say is that 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.560
 directly is not that it can is that it is 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.450
 so it's just that I say it in terms 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.220
 a little more open and buy us 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.210
 let's all understand that in order to avoid 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.250
 problems then when your teacher you 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.750
 say do this exercise respect what 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.399
 please do not do it like the one on the side of 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.990
 the days does it also does not have 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.240
 no kind of foundation in any kind 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.040
 of studies not even even 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.899
 you let the teacher train him if I 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.479
 I have seen many times in the gymnasiums 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.680
 people who thought they knew what was 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.060
 doing when they were actually 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.009
 doing anything and 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.590
 unfortunately the friend who was with 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.420
 that person or friends followed them 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.220
 this person because because he would establish 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.280
 charismatic maybe I wanted to 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.360
 be noticed and so on and then the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.640
 only way to gain muscle 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.890
 quickly is to follow the diet 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.150
 specific your coach and the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.620
 exercise routine 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.080
 if you trained you say that doing 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.489
 six sets of two dominated 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.640
 movements or three movements you're going to 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.220
 grow for something is a very quick example 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.650
 a thin person can hang 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.780
 several times yes but it does not suit you 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.790
 train many times a lot of 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.860
 repetitions because it will lose weight if in 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.780
 Instead of producing precisely will 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.700
 catalyze the girl the muscles in 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.540
 I change an obese person to have more 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.700
 musculature 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.200
 He needs to make more effort because 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.930
 because the person sometimes does not want 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.450
 keep your adiposity if you 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.079
 just develop your muscles and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.760
 the time you burn fat or adipose tissue 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.549
 commonly known a person 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.340
 muscular 6a of itself with nature of 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.099
 Large muscles wide back plus no 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810
 you need to do a base routine yes or with 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.000
 guided machines needs a routine 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.310
 train appropriate staff or 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.799
 study of your body somatic type and 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.049
 based on your height and your weight age and 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.769
 physical build a diet according to 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.439
 if you remember without a diet there is no benefit 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.849
 effortlessly there are no benefits and without 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.689
 record directly there is nothing of 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.599
 these two things that we said 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:33.590
 previously then magic formulas 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.120
 there are no tips and secrets if there are those 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.799
 I'm just going to tell you if I 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.930
 liked the video like if you do not 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.459
 like not and if you want to share it in 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.819
 facebook I will be very grateful 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.819
