00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.090
 welcome to my kitchen today vi 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.830
 I will speak a recipe with the name gilthead in 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:19.179
 rose of potatoes but let's see 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:22.869
 potato ingredients to fillet rosemary 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.849
 of sea bream and spinach we pass to the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.470
 Preparation 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:34.120
 then we see the potatoes and go to 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:36.910
 peel them and then with the mandolin 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 indeed with the mandolin and cuts a lot 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 finely 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.790
 when you have to be very careful with 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.510
 companies I recommend that we do not want 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.510
 bloodshed 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.290
 perfect 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.119
 they are so thin thin so later 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:20.899
 certain quickly in the oven and stay 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:26.000
 with cannes I want you so much pepper oil 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.000
 holy pepper salt 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 garlic that we will cut in this way not 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.880
 no need to pull it finely in place 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.900
 re like 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 just peel it already you see a lot of 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.990
 time 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:02:03.700
 and make small incisions before and 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:03.700
 horizontal or vertical and then 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.900
 we cut it 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.620
 the width here is ready our 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.620
 has reported a nice mix 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.040
 ok rosemary 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.950
 here instead the chopped we repeat 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.370
 seriously we remove other muscle on the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370
 between 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.730
 ok and let's put in the potatoes and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:52.420
 we mix well to make 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.420
 season the oven at 180 degrees 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.550
 we take the beautiful baking paper pan 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.350
 give the precise to do this to you 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:09.500
 made a drop of oil well and on 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.640
 Our baking paper we form with the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.480
 potatoes a kind of rose that has one 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.980
 variant with sea bream in potato crust 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.380
 we have a delicious thing it is all one 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.480
 then another effect in my opinion 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:33.850
 judge you but trust a rose below 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.850
 we put our fillets 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.770
 perfect like that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.290
 It is devoid seabass before a drop of oil 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:02.830
 a pinch of salt and always cover a 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.480
 rose shape slightly overlapping but not 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.090
 too so that they cook well and 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:14.190
 being crunchy is a great way to 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.190
 let the fish and children eat this 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:26.050
 however the appearance is very inviting ok 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.140
 so a drop of oil above ground of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.140
 pepper 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.280
 bake in the oven 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.550
 there will be twenty years time 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.050
 that goes from you they become well golden and 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.170
 lightly form the crust 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.170
 on the edges I put in the oven and I wait 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:59.930
 I also burned and I look ok but 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:05:03.819
 expects our fish to be perfect 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.819
 ready we take it out of the oven 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.349
 here we are 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.069
 perfect our motivated and ready 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:27.819
 let's go to the plate let's have some 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.819
 baby spinach and we make a base on the plate 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.740
 and that's it 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:52.660
 the rose very gently underneath 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:55.540
 lay down above and then say that to give 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.960
 a little color we can make one 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.960
 fast Beijing diced 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.950
 from color to freshness the dish 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.469
 ok 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:50.110
 ok 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:50.110
 a drop of oil, freshly ground pepper 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.060
 our sea bream in veiled pink is ready 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.060
