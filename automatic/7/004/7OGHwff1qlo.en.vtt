extremely effective for a smell CBC does
with<00:00:05.730> his<00:00:05.879> if<00:00:06.480> he's<00:00:06.629> going<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.810> come<00:00:06.990> up<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.140> a

ship<00:00:09.690> out<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:09.990> guess<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.290> he's<00:00:10.380> just<00:00:10.530> waiting

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
ship out my guess is he's just waiting

ship out my guess is he's just waiting
for<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> river<00:00:11.160> but<00:00:11.460> man<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.820> his<00:00:12.030> economies

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
for a river but man is his economies

have been so harassed you might have a
river<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.400> dropship<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:14.910> not<00:00:15.030> sure<00:00:15.120> when

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
river in that dropship I'm not sure when

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.359 
river in that dropship I'm not sure when
he<00:00:15.299> has<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.660> tank<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.139> vulture<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> couple<00:00:17.220> things

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
he has a tank of vulture a couple things

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
he has a tank of vulture a couple things
out<00:00:17.609> otherwise<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.960> we'll<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.109> if<00:00:19.560> up

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
out otherwise out and we'll see if up

out otherwise out and we'll see if up
magic<00:00:20.220> looks<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:20.490> he<00:00:20.820> might<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.000> producing

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
magic looks like he might be producing

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.700 
magic looks like he might be producing
right<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.779> may<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.199> more<00:00:22.320> drop<00:00:22.500> ships

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
right there may be some more drop ships

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.140 
right there may be some more drop ships
I'm<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:22.920> sure<00:00:23.130> I'm<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.760> surprised<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
I'm not sure I'm really surprised that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.550 
I'm not sure I'm really surprised that
more<00:00:24.300> Terran<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:24.840> drop<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.199> think<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
more Terran don't go drop I think it's a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.689 
more Terran don't go drop I think it's a
really<00:00:25.680> effective<00:00:25.890> thing<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.430> against

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
really effective thing to do against

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.019 
really effective thing to do against
protoss<00:00:26.970> especially<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:28.320> maps<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
protoss especially on maps like this and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.519 
protoss especially on maps like this and
it<00:00:30.119> looks<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> magic<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> expand

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it looks like a magic going to expand

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
it looks like a magic going to expand
the<00:00:31.619> third<00:00:31.830> time<00:00:32.009> gonna<00:00:32.219> try<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> basically

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the third time gonna try to basically

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.850 
the third time gonna try to basically
he's<00:00:33.719> already<00:00:33.899> got<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> slight<00:00:34.380> economic

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
he's already got a slight economic

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.900 
he's already got a slight economic
advantage<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> try<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> seal<00:00:35.880> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
advantage going to try to seal that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720 
advantage going to try to seal that
economic<00:00:36.420> advantage<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.170> dropships<00:00:37.730> that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
economic advantage that dropships that

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.889 
economic advantage that dropships that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
effective job with kind of a vulture

go<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.710> early<00:01:05.010> rave<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> kind<00:01:06.390> of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
go with that early rave just to kind of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
go with that early rave just to kind of
fight<00:01:06.960> off<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> shuttle<00:01:07.530> basically<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> all

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
fight off the shuttle basically you all

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
fight off the shuttle basically you all
you<00:01:08.520> need<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.210> raids<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> those

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you need is one or two raids and those

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
you need is one or two raids and those
shuttle<00:01:10.500> drops<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.250> almost<00:01:11.490> entirely

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
shuttle drops really are almost entirely

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
shuttle drops really are almost entirely
nullified<00:01:12.560> because<00:01:13.560> even<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
nullified because even if they get a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.590 
nullified because even if they get a
dragoon<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> background<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.360> kind

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
dragoon in the background you can kind

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
dragoon in the background you can kind
of<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> mix<00:01:16.560> between<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> two

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
of you can kind of mix between the two

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
of you can kind of mix between the two
and<00:01:17.220> another<00:01:17.549> drop<00:01:17.880> managed<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.900> single

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and another drop managed to get a single

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.219 
and another drop managed to get a single
shot<00:01:19.380> off<00:01:19.939> basically<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.479> watch<00:01:21.720> as

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
shot off basically on and now watch as

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
shot off basically on and now watch as
you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.560> doing<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.979> very<00:01:23.520> good<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:24.600> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you can see doing a very good kind of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
you can see doing a very good kind of
dropship<00:01:25.140> vs<00:01:25.470> shuttle<00:01:26.100> micro<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.610> magic

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
dropship vs shuttle micro and up magic

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.460 
dropship vs shuttle micro and up magic
in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> meantime<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.509> bring<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
in the meantime you know bring that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
in the meantime you know bring that
vulture<00:01:28.680> into<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> probe<00:01:29.579> line<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
vulture into the probe line kind of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.749 
vulture into the probe line kind of
distract<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.400> up

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
distract be so a little bit and and up

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.190 
distract be so a little bit and and up
magic<00:01:33.060> we'll<00:01:33.180> see<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.450> he<00:01:33.509> does<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:34.020> here

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
magic we'll see what he does from here

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.179 
magic we'll see what he does from here
I'm<00:01:34.259> surprised<00:01:34.590> he<00:01:34.710> hasn't<00:01:34.799> gotten<00:01:34.950> more

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I'm surprised he hasn't gotten more

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.499 
I'm surprised he hasn't gotten more
factories<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.759> maybe<00:01:35.939> they're<00:01:36.180> down<00:01:36.299> off

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
factories down maybe they're down off

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
factories down maybe they're down off
screen<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:38.100> from<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
screen you can see that right from the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.859 
screen you can see that right from the
corner<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.790> waiting<00:01:39.119> kind<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.360> fruit<00:01:39.600> for

corner just waiting kind of fruit for
some<00:01:39.960> prey<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.350> looks<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.560> bees<00:01:40.799> who<00:01:40.920> did

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
some prey and it looks like bees who did

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.880 
some prey and it looks like bees who did
manage<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.490> finally<00:01:41.759> take<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.150> vulture

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
base be sooo now switching into kind of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
base be sooo now switching into kind of
a<00:01:47.070> carrier<00:01:47.340> build<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.700> saw<00:01:47.850> stork<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
a carrier build we saw stork do this but

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.469 
a carrier build we saw stork do this but
we'll<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.159> MAGIX<00:01:50.520> he<00:01:51.149> doesn't<00:01:51.390> look

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
we'll see if of MAGIX he doesn't look

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.210 
we'll see if of MAGIX he doesn't look
like<00:01:51.570> he<00:01:51.659> has<00:01:51.750> comm<00:01:51.990> set<00:01:52.229> yet<00:01:52.409> she<00:01:52.860> does<00:01:53.070> need

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
like he has comm set yet she does need

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.499 
like he has comm set yet she does need
to<00:01:53.280> scout<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.060> he's<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> be

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to scout this out if he's going to be

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
to scout this out if he's going to be
able<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.720> counter<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.020> looks<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.950> he<00:01:56.040> is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
able to counter it looks like he is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.469 
able to counter it looks like he is
going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> getting<00:01:56.670> Academy<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> question<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
going to getting Academy the question is

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.450 
going to getting Academy the question is
really<00:01:57.750> comps<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.530> time<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> how

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
really comps at at at the time and how

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.249 
really comps at at at the time and how
will<00:01:59.610> he<00:01:59.700> adjust<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.899> saw<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
will he adjust and as we saw on the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.280 
will he adjust and as we saw on the
finals<00:02:01.649> against<00:02:02.280> mine<00:02:02.810> mine<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:04.079> very

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
finals against mine mine was very

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
finals against mine mine was very
effective<00:02:04.590> at<00:02:04.680> fighting<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.070> off<00:02:05.390> basically

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
effective at fighting that off basically

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.930 
effective at fighting that off basically
with<00:02:06.540> some<00:02:06.719> rates<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.290> we'll<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.619> if

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
with some rates and we'll see if

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.130 
with some rates and we'll see if
basically<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.149> magic<00:02:09.420> decides<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.020> go

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
basically up magic decides to kind of go

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.839 
basically up magic decides to kind of go
right<00:02:10.289> against<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.489> looks<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.670> he

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
right against this and it looks like he

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.979 
right against this and it looks like he
might<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.450> dropping<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.750> main<00:02:12.870> he

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
might be going for dropping the main he

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.400 
might be going for dropping the main he
might<00:02:13.140> get

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
might get

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.720 
might get
and<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:13.980> drop<00:02:14.310> he<00:02:14.430> may<00:02:14.550> not<00:02:14.670> be

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and with that drop he may not be

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.300 
and with that drop he may not be
successful<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.420> drop<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:15.870> he<00:02:15.900> may

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
successful with that drop but he may

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.470 
successful with that drop but he may
basically<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.640> able<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> scout<00:02:18.330> off

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
basically be able to get the scout off

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.670 
basically be able to get the scout off
and<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.690> looks<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:18.900> two<00:02:19.140> carriers<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
and it looks like two carriers going to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.830 
and it looks like two carriers going to
come<00:02:19.830> out<00:02:19.920> already<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.360> race<00:02:21.570> going<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
come out already and this race going to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.750 
come out already and this race going to
come<00:02:21.990> out<00:02:22.020> can<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.560> sent<00:02:23.130> back<00:02:23.280> by<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
come out can be sent back by that it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.070 
come out can be sent back by that it
looks<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.180> metric<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.600> actually<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:24.990> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
looks like a metric is actually going to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.800 
looks like a metric is actually going to
kind<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> truth<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.970> keep<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.720> over

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
kind of a truth just keep going over

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.120 
kind of a truth just keep going over
this<00:02:27.960> edge<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.170> I'm<00:02:28.380> surprised<00:02:28.680> p<00:02:28.860> su<00:02:28.980> has

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
this edge and I'm surprised p su has

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.710 
this edge and I'm surprised p su has
enough<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.490> go<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.820> fact<00:02:30.240> I'm<00:02:30.360> not<00:02:30.390> even<00:02:30.510> sure

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
enough to go in fact I'm not even sure

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.270 
enough to go in fact I'm not even sure
if<00:02:30.930> he<00:02:31.020> does<00:02:31.230> he<00:02:31.440> might<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.740> have<00:02:31.800> enough<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
if he does he might not have enough to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.650 
if he does he might not have enough to
kind<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.490> really<00:02:32.700> deal<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.120> not<00:02:33.360> magic

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
kind of really deal with this not magic

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.240 
kind of really deal with this not magic
managing<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.350> take<00:02:34.500> down<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> single<00:02:34.980> Dragoon

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
managing to take down a single Dragoon

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
managing to take down a single Dragoon
but<00:02:35.430> more<00:02:35.580> dragoons<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> fight<00:02:36.240> this

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
but more dragoons going to fight this

going<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> be<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.600> think<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.260> might<00:03:46.350> be<00:03:46.410> at

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
going to be I think that might be at

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.660 
going to be I think that might be at
those<00:03:46.800> turrets<00:03:47.010> are<00:03:47.160> up<00:03:47.280> they<00:03:47.400> are<00:03:47.489> going<00:03:47.610> to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
those turrets are up they are going to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.040 
those turrets are up they are going to
be<00:03:47.790> able<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.000> delay<00:03:48.180> long<00:03:48.390> enough<00:03:48.630> the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
be able to delay long enough the

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.150 
be able to delay long enough the
question<00:03:49.320> is<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.440> bc<00:03:49.709> we're<00:03:49.890> gonna<00:03:49.980> bother

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
question is is bc we're gonna bother

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.530 
question is is bc we're gonna bother
defending<00:03:50.610> his<00:03:50.700> front<00:03:50.910> or<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.209> he<00:03:51.300> just<00:03:51.330> going

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
defending his front or is he just going

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.850 
defending his front or is he just going
to<00:03:51.660> try<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.780> inflict<00:03:52.110> as<00:03:52.200> much<00:03:52.230> damage<00:03:52.380> he<00:03:52.680> can

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
to try to inflict as much damage he can

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.800 
to try to inflict as much damage he can
on<00:03:53.489> up<00:03:53.730> magic<00:03:54.030> try<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.270> recover<00:03:54.480> from<00:03:54.660> this

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
on up magic try to recover from this

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.790 
on up magic try to recover from this
point<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.110> don't<00:03:55.140> think<00:03:55.410> he's<00:03:55.530> really<00:03:55.680> gonna

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
point I don't think he's really gonna

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.920 
point I don't think he's really gonna
have<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.100> option<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.489> do<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.850> though<00:03:57.030> he's

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
have the option to do that though he's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.970 
have the option to do that though he's
been<00:03:58.080> mining<00:03:58.350> out<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.530> his<00:03:58.620> main<00:03:58.739> although

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
been mining out of his main although

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.410 
been mining out of his main although
it's<00:03:59.340> been<00:03:59.400> disturbed<00:03:59.820> this<00:03:59.880> entire<00:04:00.150> time<00:04:00.360> and

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
it's been disturbed this entire time and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.880 
it's been disturbed this entire time and
I<00:04:00.600> magic<00:04:00.900> doing<00:04:01.080> everything<00:04:01.440> right<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:01.800> this

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890

game<00:04:02.070> I'm<00:04:02.550> very<00:04:02.910> impressed<00:04:03.150> with<00:04:03.390> his<00:04:03.510> play

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
game I'm very impressed with his play

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.420 
game I'm very impressed with his play
and<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.320> looks<00:04:04.440> like<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> armory<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:05.220> up

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
and it looks like the armory is now up

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.590 
and it looks like the armory is now up
for<00:04:05.580> up<00:04:05.670> magic<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.000> he's<00:04:06.209> probably<00:04:06.360> going<00:04:06.540> to

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
for up magic so he's probably going to

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.630 
for up magic so he's probably going to
start<00:04:06.780> producing<00:04:06.989> goliaths<00:04:07.500> here<00:04:07.709> shortly<00:04:08.550> I

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
you see that Wraith coming into play I

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.260 
you see that Wraith coming into play I
would<00:05:24.370> actually<00:05:24.460> go<00:05:24.700> after<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.000> shuttle

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
would actually go after the shuttle

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.050 
would actually go after the shuttle
instead<00:05:25.510> of<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.660> Dragoon<00:05:26.040> and<00:05:27.040> let<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.460> SUV's

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
instead of the Dragoon and let the SUV's

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.760 
instead of the Dragoon and let the SUV's
tried<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.360> take<00:05:28.480> care<00:05:28.660> of<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.260> dragon<00:05:29.590> but

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
tried to take care of the dragon but

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.230 
tried to take care of the dragon but
instead<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:30.400> looks<00:05:30.520> like<00:05:30.640> that<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:31.090> Wraith

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
instead it looks like that that Wraith

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.580 
instead it looks like that that Wraith
was<00:05:31.419> in<00:05:31.540> fact<00:05:31.690> taken<00:05:31.900> care<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.140> but<00:05:32.290> single

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
was in fact taken care of but single

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.470 
was in fact taken care of but single
dragon<00:05:32.860> didn't<00:05:33.580> have<00:05:33.669> enough<00:05:33.940> how<00:05:34.060> basically

dragon didn't have enough how basically
that<00:05:34.630> that's<00:05:34.870> why<00:05:34.990> i<00:05:35.020> say<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.860> encode<00:05:36.250> but

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
that that's why i say to encode but

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.640 
that that's why i say to encode but

severely sealed in it's just going to be
a<00:05:48.310> few<00:05:48.550> seconds<00:05:48.880> here<00:05:49.030> before<00:05:49.590> it's

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
a few seconds here before it's

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.170 
a few seconds here before it's
absolutely<00:05:50.770> he's<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.550> think<00:05:51.669> he's<00:05:51.880> just<00:05:52.030> gonna

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
absolutely he's I think he's just gonna

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.940 
absolutely he's I think he's just gonna
get<00:05:52.330> run<00:05:52.510> over<00:05:52.630> three<00:05:53.229> more<00:05:53.350> carriers<00:05:53.740> out

get run over three more carriers out

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.980 
get run over three more carriers out
though<00:05:54.130> I'm<00:05:54.850> surprised<00:05:55.270> that<00:05:55.390> up<00:05:55.540> magic<00:05:55.840> just

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
though I'm surprised that up magic just

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.270 
though I'm surprised that up magic just
letting<00:05:56.260> him<00:05:56.290> kind<00:05:56.530> of<00:05:56.560> build<00:05:56.800> up<00:05:56.919> like<00:05:57.100> this

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
letting him kind of build up like this

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.430 
letting him kind of build up like this
he<00:05:58.090> has<00:05:58.210> a<00:05:58.240> lot<00:05:58.479> of<00:05:58.510> Goliath<00:05:58.960> out<00:05:59.140> but<00:05:59.320> he

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
he has a lot of Goliath out but he

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 
think this is the end for BC so it looks

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:24.619 
think this is the end for BC so it looks
like<00:07:23.099> up<00:07:23.519> magic<00:07:23.849> is<00:07:23.969> going<00:07:24.209> to<00:07:24.269> take<00:07:24.389> Game<00:07:24.599> one
