request<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:11.010> safe<00:00:11.580> jump<00:00:11.790> tutorial<00:00:12.240> so

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
request this a safe jump tutorial so

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.880 
request this a safe jump tutorial so
basically<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:13.950> straight<00:00:14.219> jumping<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.940> a

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
basically what straight jumping is is a

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.269 
basically what straight jumping is is a
mixture<00:00:16.890> between<00:00:18.199> twisting<00:00:19.199> joltin<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.100> like

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
mixture between twisting joltin and like

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.420 
mixture between twisting joltin and like
sprinting<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:21.990> fast<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.220> just

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
sprinting but really fast so as you just

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670 
sprinting but really fast so as you just
saw<00:00:23.580> there<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:24.660> can't<00:00:24.900> make<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.289> jump<00:00:25.350> with

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
saw there you can't make that jump with

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.080 
saw there you can't make that jump with
just<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.949> normal<00:00:26.160> jump<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.670> maybe<00:00:26.939> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
just a normal jump or you maybe you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.759 
just a normal jump or you maybe you
could<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.420> hit<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.689> perfect<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.680> I'm

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
could if you hit it perfect so what I'm

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.400 
could if you hit it perfect so what I'm
trying<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.130> show<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.609> how<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:31.109> strafe<00:00:31.380> jump

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
trying to show you is how a strafe jump

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
trying to show you is how a strafe jump
can<00:00:31.949> make<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.309> greater<00:00:32.640> distance<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
can make that greater distance and you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
can make that greater distance and you
don't<00:00:33.840> want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> start<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.250> our

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
don't want to start like this for our

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.709 
don't want to start like this for our
back<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.790> else<00:00:35.880> you'll<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.270> lose<00:00:36.420> momentum

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
back or else you'll just lose momentum

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.619 
back or else you'll just lose momentum
because<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> jolt<00:00:38.940> action

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
because you it's about the jolt action

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.750 
because you it's about the jolt action
so<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> learned<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:40.980> aim<00:00:41.370> straight

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
so what I learned is you aim straight

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.080 
so what I learned is you aim straight
down<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:42.629> gun<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.309> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.760> ledge

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
down and have your gun on on the ledge

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.540 
down and have your gun on on the ledge
and<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> move<00:00:45.960> back<00:00:46.230> until<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> top<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and then you move back until the top of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
and then you move back until the top of
your<00:00:47.700> screen<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.420> horizontal<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
your screen is horizontal with it and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
your screen is horizontal with it and
then<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> lot<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
then that and I do that with a lot of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
then that and I do that with a lot of
big<00:00:52.649> ones<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.100> maybe<00:00:53.309> small<00:00:53.610> ones<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> then

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
big ones like maybe small ones and then

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
big ones like maybe small ones and then
you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.629> adjust<00:00:54.750> yourself<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you can adjust yourself from there so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.450 
you can adjust yourself from there so
about<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> good<00:00:57.329> meter<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.140> run<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
about a good meter and then you run you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.110 
about a good meter and then you run you
you<00:01:00.390> aim<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:01.079> 40<00:01:01.890> degrees<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.640> or

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you aim about 40 degrees to the right or

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
you aim about 40 degrees to the right or
left<00:01:03.149> depends<00:01:03.899> where<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> object<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.010> you're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
left depends where the object is you're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
left depends where the object is you're
jumping<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.750> run<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
jumping to and then you run to that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.140 
jumping to and then you run to that
point<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> shoot<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> little<00:01:08.580> hole<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
point you can shoot a little hole and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
point you can shoot a little hole and
then<00:01:09.630> twist<00:01:10.020> really<00:01:10.290> quick<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> another

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
then twist really quick and another

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
then twist really quick and another
thing<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.430> sensitivity<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> huge

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
thing is sensitivity that is a huge

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.440 
thing is sensitivity that is a huge
factor<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.310> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.760> doing<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
factor you do not want to be doing this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.160 
factor you do not want to be doing this
on<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.409> two<00:01:16.830> three<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.700> four<00:01:18.140> five<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
on like one two three or four five and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.679 
on like one two three or four five and
six<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> would<00:01:20.189> recommend<00:01:20.400> I'm<00:01:20.970> ruling

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
six is what I would recommend I'm ruling

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
six is what I would recommend I'm ruling
on<00:01:21.810> five<00:01:23.540> myself<00:01:24.540> because<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
on five myself because I I just think I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.560 
on five myself because I I just think I
like<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.619> five<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.310> six<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.329> can

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like that five or six on see how you can

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170 
like that five or six on see how you can
just<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.890> Maps<00:01:32.130> especially<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.119> for

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
just then this Maps especially good for

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.859 
just then this Maps especially good for
it<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:34.670> there's<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.880> high<00:01:36.240> points

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it because there's a lot of high points

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.649 
it because there's a lot of high points
and<00:01:36.960> stuff<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.009> recommend<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.850> into

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and stuff so just I recommend going into

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
and stuff so just I recommend going into
a<00:01:39.689> private<00:01:39.810> match<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.340> obviously<00:01:41.820> be

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
a private match all you do obviously be

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.370 
a private match all you do obviously be
doing<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> these<00:01:43.079> spots

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
doing this just to get to these spots

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.429 
doing this just to get to these spots
but<00:01:43.530> before<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> spots<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.409> on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
but before you do the spots just go on

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.350 
but before you do the spots just go on
the<00:01:46.590> ground<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.729> trucks<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the ground or go on these trucks and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060 
the ground or go on these trucks and
just<00:01:48.659> practice<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.350> 10<00:01:49.590> minutes<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
just practice for about 10 minutes and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.039 
just practice for about 10 minutes and
then<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:51.000> you'll<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.450> professional

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
then then you'll be your professional

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.719 
then then you'll be your professional
now<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.009> there's<00:01:53.159> another<00:01:53.460> little

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
now you see there there's another little

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.260 
now you see there there's another little
strafe<00:01:54.090> jump<00:01:54.500> cause<00:01:55.670> nothing<00:01:56.670> too<00:01:56.790> fancy<00:01:56.969> but

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
strafe jump cause nothing too fancy but

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.499 
strafe jump cause nothing too fancy but
you<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.700> practices<00:01:59.700> everything<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.299> I've

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
you are practices everything like I've

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
you are practices everything like I've
been<00:02:00.780> playing<00:02:01.020> I've<00:02:01.350> been<00:02:01.560> doing<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
been playing I've been doing a lot of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.160 
been playing I've been doing a lot of
strife<00:02:02.399> jumps<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> long<00:02:03.270> time<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.899> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
strife jumps for a long time like and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.170 
strife jumps for a long time like and
then<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> strafe<00:02:05.159> jump<00:02:05.189> about<00:02:05.790> hype

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
then this is a strafe jump about hype

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.330 
then this is a strafe jump about hype
you<00:02:06.780> don't<00:02:07.049> want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> aim<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.860> ground<00:02:08.099> for

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you don't want to aim for the ground for

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.550 
you don't want to aim for the ground for
the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.020 
the
you<00:02:08.649> want<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.920> kind<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.130> aim<00:02:09.310> up<00:02:09.550> because<00:02:09.910> it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
you want to kind of aim up because it

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.600 
you want to kind of aim up because it
kind<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.239> like<00:02:10.420> Momentum's<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.349> are<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.770> as

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
showing you because I make a few fails

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.790 
showing you because I make a few fails
here<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.630> stretching<00:02:20.230> up<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.680> won't

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
here but stretching up and you won't

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.850 
here but stretching up and you won't
always<00:02:20.980> get<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.550> first<00:02:21.730> time<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.590> and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
always get it your first time so and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.710 
always get it your first time so and
another<00:02:24.430> thing<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.819> let's<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.150> say<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.390> are

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
another thing is let's just say you are

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.650 
another thing is let's just say you are
doing<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.670> strike<00:02:27.670> jumps<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.180> from<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.450> high

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
doing I strike jumps but from a high

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.040 
doing I strike jumps but from a high
spot<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.319> would<00:02:29.650> use<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.310> c4<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.050> tactical

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
spot I would use the c4 and tactical

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.080 
spot I would use the c4 and tactical
insertion<00:02:32.530> because<00:02:32.860> let's<00:02:33.130> just<00:02:33.310> say<00:02:33.489> you're

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
insertion because let's just say you're

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.210 
insertion because let's just say you're
at<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.300> top<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.780> takes<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.170> 10<00:02:35.739> seconds

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
at the top and it takes like 10 seconds

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.430 
at the top and it takes like 10 seconds
to<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.459> up<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.720> can<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.930> plant<00:02:38.170> your<00:02:38.200> attack

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
to get up you can just plant your attack

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.990 
to get up you can just plant your attack
kill<00:02:38.709> yourself<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.190> you'd<00:02:39.280> be<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.519> there<00:02:39.700> way

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
kill yourself and you'd be up there way

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.630 
kill yourself and you'd be up there way
faster<00:02:40.480> than<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:41.140> practice<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.489> lot

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
faster than that so just practice a lot

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.680 
faster than that so just practice a lot
and<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:44.560> show<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.190> here<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.209> just<00:02:46.239> do

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
and I show you here like you can just do

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.809 
and I show you here like you can just do
brown<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.350> shoot<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.250> where<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.519> want<00:02:48.730> to

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
brown so you shoot to where you want to

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.210 
brown so you shoot to where you want to
jump<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.150> seem<00:02:49.450> aim<00:02:50.290> at<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.769> then<00:02:51.069> you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
jump that seem aim at it and then you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.970 
jump that seem aim at it and then you
curve<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:52.180> run<00:02:52.540> at<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.019> slowly<00:02:53.440> curve<00:02:53.830> at

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
curve you run at it and slowly curve at

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.440 
curve you run at it and slowly curve at
the<00:02:54.069> last<00:02:54.250> second<00:02:54.700> towards<00:02:54.940> your<00:02:55.030> object<00:02:55.330> and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the last second towards your object and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.120 
the last second towards your object and
as<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.140> Joe<00:02:56.410> would<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.769> gave<00:02:56.950> me

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
as you can see that Joe would it gave me

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.160 
as you can see that Joe would it gave me
it's<00:02:57.549> almost<00:02:57.670> kind<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> little<00:02:58.330> glitch<00:02:58.750> but

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
it's almost kind of a little glitch but

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.470 
it's almost kind of a little glitch but
it's<00:02:59.319> not<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.890> ain't<00:03:03.370> shoot<00:03:03.819> aim<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.150> little

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
it's not so you ain't shoot aim a little

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's not so you ain't shoot aim a little
45<00:03:04.840> degrees<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.500> then<00:03:05.590> jump<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:07.799> then<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:08.830> do

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
45 degrees and then jump and then I do

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.759 
45 degrees and then jump and then I do
and<00:03:09.459> then<00:03:09.700> right<00:03:10.209> here<00:03:10.269> i<00:03:10.480> show<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
and then right here i show you you the

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.620 
and then right here i show you you the
reason<00:03:12.160> straight<00:03:12.459> something<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.030> popular<00:03:13.510> is

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
reason straight something so popular is

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.080 
reason straight something so popular is
because<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:14.260> meant<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.739> be<00:03:14.769> used<00:03:15.190> in<00:03:15.579> small

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
because it's meant to be used in small

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.449 
because it's meant to be used in small
area<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:16.930> let's<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.260> say<00:03:17.470> i'm<00:03:17.709> showing<00:03:18.430> you

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
area so let's just say i'm showing you

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.160 
area so let's just say i'm showing you
you<00:03:18.670> might<00:03:18.790> don't<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.359> much<00:03:19.420> room<00:03:19.870> you

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
you might don't have this much room you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.710 
you might don't have this much room you
can<00:03:20.530> see<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.769> never<00:03:21.100> went<00:03:21.370> as<00:03:21.549> far<00:03:21.760> because<00:03:22.000> with

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
can see I never went as far because with

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.590 
can see I never went as far because with
the<00:03:22.840> jump<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.230> had<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.470> jump<00:03:23.680> quicker<00:03:24.040> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the jump I had to jump quicker and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.699 
the jump I had to jump quicker and
sometimes<00:03:25.600> if<00:03:25.900> you're<00:03:26.049> just<00:03:26.230> doing<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.590> normal

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
sometimes if you're just doing a normal

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.440 
sometimes if you're just doing a normal
jump<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.340> won't<00:03:27.519> even<00:03:27.609> make<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.090> jump<00:03:28.329> and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
jump you won't even make the jump and

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.809 
jump you won't even make the jump and
you'll<00:03:29.109> like<00:03:29.380> fall<00:03:30.040> off<00:03:30.250> before<00:03:30.579> you<00:03:30.640> can<00:03:30.790> even

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
you'll like fall off before you can even

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.630 
you'll like fall off before you can even
jump<00:03:31.440> that's<00:03:32.440> why<00:03:32.590> straight<00:03:32.859> jumping<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.400> good
