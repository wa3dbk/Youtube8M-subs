00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.270
 But lothar albert has his doubts 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:14.020
 whether it should be possible during one

 do not consult so easy 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.950
 one is already uncertain what 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.510
 happens now but then it was the first 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.609

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.620
