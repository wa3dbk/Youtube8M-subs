00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
being on one side of the other but then

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.340 
being on one side of the other but then
they<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> come<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.659> settle<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.389 
they get to come out here and settle it
you<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.619> look<00:01:43.770> forward<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you think they look forward to that I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.780 
you think they look forward to that I
think<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> mean<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.750> Dave<00:01:46.290> Coombs

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
think so I mean this is that Dave Coombs

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.490 
think so I mean this is that Dave Coombs
memorial<00:01:47.790> east/west<00:01:48.360> shootout<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.049> know<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
memorial east/west shootout you know and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
memorial east/west shootout you know and
it's<00:01:49.890> been<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.610> 16<00:01:51.030> years<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.720> east

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's been going on for 16 years the east

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410 
it's been going on for 16 years the east
has<00:01:52.229> eight<00:01:52.710> wins<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.460> West<00:01:53.670> has<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.119> twin

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
has eight wins and the West has a twin

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
has eight wins and the West has a twin
so<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> tiebreaker<00:01:55.979> on

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so this is going to be the tiebreaker on

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.219 
so this is going to be the tiebreaker on
May<00:01:57.000> 5th<00:01:57.350> 2012<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.790> know<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> think<00:02:00.869> both
