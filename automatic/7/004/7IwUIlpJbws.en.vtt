00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.570
 while watching the video the day 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.949
 that you actually open and there 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.770
 tweet because I'm not so active on twitter 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.070
 I have to be honest, first of all 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.350
 look what i killed that is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.000
 special somehow so on twitter 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.460
 I am not so represented I thought 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 that's definitely great, too 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 come and but somehow it me 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.059
 somehow totally too stressful sometimes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.640
 I forget that too 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.150
 I will post something will not there 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.180
 idea 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.909
 Definitely the last meal that was 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.090
 about the hour hold hour and I have 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:20.810
 self-occupied pizza eaten with salami 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.650
 and corn and cheese then last dream 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.110
 I would have to think about 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.970
 I do not know if this is the last one 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.330
 Last night was on everyone 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.490
 case 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.930
 attention I have from other youtube 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.909
 their faithful I think so now 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.320
 totally blatant but I think that was 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.729
 because I'm going to bed shortly before 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 from eac from her after a video 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.729
 have looked at or something and indeed 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.799
 from the english free the has in new 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.049
 york is living all the time and now 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.630
 but lives now for a very short time 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.979
 Time in London makes super videos me 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.079
 think that one or the other of you will 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.210
 you know I just think so great 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.130
 to my first youtube in the me 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 I have subscribed to and from 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.890
 I always dreamed that we, I think so 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.960
 was in new york with 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.979
 gone shopping so know exactly 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.240
 I do not remember, I know that too 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.619
 I have dreamed of her 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.350
 somehow very blatant then next 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.450
 ask last sm 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.120
 last sms so actually I write 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.950
 no sms anymore there is usually everything 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.890
 about nowadays I think that is at 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.310
 do not write me any sms I write 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.320
 actually with my mom there the km 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.340
 has wood and there I wrote 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.200
 Hello 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.140
 because she wrote me hello 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.220
 Do you stay because I enter her ? 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.080
 a little later came from work 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.010
 am cooked and eating something and sat there 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.710
 waited 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.070
 that's why she wrote hello and 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.660
 it was the last sms very interesting 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:51.430
 say so the next question is 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.490
 last kiss and that one was mine 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.780
 last price mama kÃ¼ster not count 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.720
 I would say something now or ten 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.040
 brands so i am a person you are 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.900
 even kissing man you are not 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.540
 Embarrassing or something like that when I'm not 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.370
 bad I'll just let him apply 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:14.380
 and then I would say that was today 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.790
 last shoe purchase last shoe purchase i 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.220
 I'm not that shy I have to say 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.080
 I do not therefore normal as 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.830
 sounded typical woman water concerns 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.989
 but shoes 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.580
 I know that my shoes were too 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.500
 these horny ballerinas is already one 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.140
 a while ago I bought it 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.810
 had ordered over zalando yes always 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.320
 to each other and which are of the mark so 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.150
 is it because it says on it but the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.420
 stood turn I think the hot ones 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.880
 Ariane Ariane I believe that is called 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.709
 shoes are super comfortable really great with 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.780
 the pink and especially the wise with 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.180
 this stand is definitely a real one 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.489
 Attention has also in minimal paragraph 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.620
 and also has air cushions inside 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.180
 that you can walk there very pleasant 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.040
 When I'm in Berlin I almost have those too 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.739
 worn daily and then you walk yes 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.140
 also a while if you are in Berlin 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.320
 visited and I think they have 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.540
 cost 60 euros causes a bit 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.700
 a lot but they really need to be clean 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.450
 I say 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:18.850
 we come to the next question and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.530
 though that is the last instagram picture and 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.109
 thats why 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.660
 yes I'm very hard working I have to look 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.000
 and that was the moment before one 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.730
 hour and hour I have a picture 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.530
 posted by my new nail polish the 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.450
 By the way, I'm wearing it too 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.460
 again a bit so that recognizes that 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.730
 I know and there I have this picture 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.389
 Posted because I just great the naga 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.000
 find 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.740
 that is so great that is so 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.320
 really nice with tonic and not so 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.650
 does not look so cheap the next one 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.150
 Question is my last visit I have to go 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.340
 also superior so I was forever 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.940
 not in the cinema anymore 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.140
 I think that was already in any case 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.960
 a few weeks vendor that was 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.640
 hangover 3 yes, norbert rank 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.240
 I was his must say I was from 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.169
 the film is a bit disappointed 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.600
 I found the first two parts 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.490
 Much much better I was 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.260
 but three simple conclusions 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.580
 best then i had to laugh otherwise 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.570
 I almost did not need my movie 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.979
 I do not know , it was you who laughed 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.979
 somehow that's how I was the only one 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.820
 the only one of the movie somehow 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.490
 is definitely disappointed 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.800
 Well, you have seen him that was 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.320
 good but not so i have to say um 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:36.810
 she has to see again then 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:42.300

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:48.750

 I subscribed to that last 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.169
 Duke only short hair I found 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.789
 actually very sympathetic and therefore 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:08.729
 I once glued on subscribe 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:10.620
 then the next question is last 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.820
 Overnight last night is 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.800

 so the overnight tip i long in 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.610
 I know what I mean on my own bed 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.990
 have the last night, so to speak 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.360
 was just so with my ex boyfriend yet 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.430
 a year the last thing you did before 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.240
 Sleep is the last thing I do 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.610
 make is 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.650
 I take a shower and my sleep 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.560
 have just been on my phone or mine 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.270
 laptop click on youtube cut 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.520

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.979
 what i really like i do not watch in 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.550
 my bed and really mumble me 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:49.020
 that I am good and then I will 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:52.320
 then simply sleep the last question 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.669
 even last read book and 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.200
 moment have say I'm coming 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.270
 not so read or I forget 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.289
 partly also hears me reading something 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.810
 I actually start again 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.280
 because I really love reading and reading 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.409
 There are also such great books currently 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.180
 the last thing I read and that 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:10.590
 you can not really read it's name 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:13.080
 what we do when what oh what do we 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.030
 if the elevator does not come and that 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.830
 is not a book for typical reading 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.450
 but that's just how it is going to be 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:24.210
 funny statistics and graphs 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.650
 Diagrams I know because I already 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.900
 somehow fell into the hands and have 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.909
 it definitely belongs to me 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.039
 already a lot of smiles and have 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:33.720
 me somehow yes again 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.580
 discovered or again even there 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.650
 can find 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.789
 and which also has the last I ask 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.789
 really enjoyed the day very interesting 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:42.960
 and probably just 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:44.669
 consider what you do not have everything 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.409
 made or even the last dream 

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:48.390
 that you can continue my super league 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:50.700
 The last dreamed in any case 

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.960
 Thanks again, no one sees a woman 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.280
 I have not checked that out 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.229
 really gladly participated I hope 

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.370
 the video caught your attention and me 

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:58.289
 would say, see and say when 

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.849
 next time else wish 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:01.680
