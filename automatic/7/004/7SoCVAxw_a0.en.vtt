 development of our own communist 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.900
 People's Party, I think that now we 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.080
 we must seriously deal with the formation 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.360
 operating headquarters in central 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.360

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.420

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.500

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.960
 spoke in the forest Borisovich achievement 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.070

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.310
 we still have our own program 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.270
 ideological platform and we stand in 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.520
 as competitors to all existing 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.520
