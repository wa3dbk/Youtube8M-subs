00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
as you can see here basically taking the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.690 
as you can see here basically taking the
whole<00:00:31.140> case<00:00:31.410> off<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.099> trying<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> figure<00:00:32.579> out

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
whole case off and trying to figure out

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.299 
whole case off and trying to figure out
I<00:00:33.090> couldn't<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.899> thing<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> lift<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.710> let

to<00:00:39.780> lift<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
to lift up I was like what is going on I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
to lift up I was like what is going on I
couldn't<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.450> any<00:00:42.629> available<00:00:43.020> screws<00:00:43.379> well

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
couldn't see any available screws well

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.250 
couldn't see any available screws well
let<00:00:44.370> me<00:00:44.399> tell<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:45.480> screw<00:00:45.780> holes<00:00:45.840> right

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
let me tell you these screw holes right

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.340 
let me tell you these screw holes right
here<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:47.670> way<00:00:48.000> recessed<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> screws

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
here are way way recessed so the screws

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.100 
here are way way recessed so the screws
were<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:50.070> inch<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.910> half<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
were like an inch and a half in here you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
were like an inch and a half in here you
can<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.800> far<00:00:52.980> back<00:00:53.190> they<00:00:53.430> were<00:00:53.489> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
can see that's how far back they were so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.490 
can see that's how far back they were so
I<00:00:54.180> didn't<00:00:54.510> realize<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.289> still

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I didn't realize that there was still

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.330 
I didn't realize that there was still
screws<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.010> there

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
screws on there

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.869 
screws on there
so<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> basically<00:00:57.420> did<00:00:58.379> too<00:00:58.530> much<00:00:58.680> work<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.340> if

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so I basically did too much work so if

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.729 
so I basically did too much work so if
you<00:01:00.090> guys<00:01:00.210> look<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.109> those<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.440> screw<00:01:01.710> holes

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you guys look for those two screw holes

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
you guys look for those two screw holes
or<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.520> any<00:01:02.640> kind<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> recessed<00:01:03.420> screw

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
or look for any kind of recessed screw

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
or look for any kind of recessed screw
holes<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> you'll<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.880> in

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
holes and you'll see that there is in

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.250 
holes and you'll see that there is in
fact<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:08.729> find<00:01:09.180> them<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.990> were<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
fact and you find them here were the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
fact and you find them here were the
screws<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.830> were<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:12.000> see

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
screws that were in there you can see

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
screws that were in there you can see
they're<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.600> big<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.950> were

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
they're not very big but they were

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.399 
they're not very big but they were
recessed<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.240> they<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.810> caused<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.290> bunch

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
recessed and so they just caused a bunch

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
recessed and so they just caused a bunch
of<00:01:16.560> chaos<00:01:16.770> I'll<00:01:17.520> show<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> how<00:01:17.909> easy<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
of chaos I'll show you how easy it is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.270 
of chaos I'll show you how easy it is
once<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:18.990> those<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.860> wouldn't

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
once you get those two out I wouldn't

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.100 
once you get those two out I wouldn't
even<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> take<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> apart<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.750> could

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
even have to take this apart I could

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
even have to take this apart I could
have<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.439> lifted<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> see

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
have just lifted it up and you can see

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.539 
have just lifted it up and you can see
I'll<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.500> set<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.860> sideways<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> then

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
I'll take out set it sideways and then

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
I'll take out set it sideways and then
show<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
show you you can see that's what the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.670 
show you you can see that's what the
blower<00:01:28.950> motor<00:01:29.310> looks<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.229> easy<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.470> pie

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
blower motor looks like and easy as pie

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
blower motor looks like and easy as pie
would<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.130> taken<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.579> two<00:01:32.790> minutes

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
would have taken like two minutes

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
would have taken like two minutes
instead<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> half<00:01:33.990> hour<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.530> all

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
instead of like a half hour to take all

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
instead of like a half hour to take all
this<00:01:34.799> stuff<00:01:34.860> apart<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.600> hoping<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
this stuff apart but I was hoping to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.960 
this stuff apart but I was hoping to
share<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> guys<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
share this with you guys so that you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.990 
share this with you guys so that you
didn't<00:01:39.299> waste<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.680> did<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.729> good

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
didn't waste time like I did on a good
