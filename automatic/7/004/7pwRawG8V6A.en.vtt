00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
Windows 2000 CLA sticker on the side I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.970 
Windows 2000 CLA sticker on the side I
think<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.710> 500<00:00:41.550> mega<00:00:42.000> memory<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.680> 30<00:00:43.680> gig

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
think it has 500 mega memory a 30 gig

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.119 
think it has 500 mega memory a 30 gig
hard<00:00:44.250> drive<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.200> plain<00:00:46.440> Jane<00:00:46.710> CD

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
hard drive and just a plain Jane CD

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.319 
hard drive and just a plain Jane CD
drive<00:00:48.200> Syrena<00:00:49.200> 1/2<00:00:49.320> inch<00:00:49.500> floppy<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:51.059> think

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
drive Syrena 1/2 inch floppy and I think

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.180 
drive Syrena 1/2 inch floppy and I think
that's<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
that's it

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
that's it
on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> back<00:00:53.489> end<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.910> thing<00:00:54.180> there's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
on the back end of this thing there's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240 
on the back end of this thing there's
actually<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> set<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.350> keys<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.590> will<00:00:55.920> let<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
actually a set of keys that will let you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.389 
actually a set of keys that will let you
lock<00:00:56.930> lock<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> case<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> guess<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.190> can

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
lock lock the case so I guess you can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.179 
lock lock the case so I guess you can
open<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:01.070> there's<00:01:02.070> also<00:01:02.250> an<00:01:02.430> installed

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
open it and there's also an installed

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.350 
open it and there's also an installed
network<00:01:05.189> card<00:01:05.430> alright<00:01:05.880> because<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
network card alright because the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.399 
network card alright because the
original<00:01:06.540> motherboard<00:01:07.049> didn't<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
original motherboard didn't have a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.410 
original motherboard didn't have a
network<00:01:07.880> jack<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> other<00:01:09.900> side<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
network jack on the other side of it so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
network jack on the other side of it so
outside<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.380> fairly

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
outside of that I think it's fairly

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.390 
outside of that I think it's fairly
stock<00:01:14.460> fairly<00:01:14.880> original<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:16.040> don't<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.159> much

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
stock fairly original I don't know much

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.330 
stock fairly original I don't know much
about<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.790> computer<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.680> gonna<00:01:19.950> turn<00:01:20.189> it

connector let me show you what that is
alright<00:01:53.159> here's<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> inside<00:01:54.439> here's<00:01:55.439> that

alright here's the inside here's that

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.840 
alright here's the inside here's that
daughter<00:01:56.100> card<00:01:57.950> that<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.159> referring<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.549> on

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
daughter card that I was referring to on

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.810 
daughter card that I was referring to on
that<00:01:59.880> decal<00:02:01.130> there's<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:03.229> little<00:02:04.229> switch<00:02:04.820> or

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that decal there's a little switch or

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.419 
that decal there's a little switch or
two<00:02:06.479> wire<00:02:06.689> switch<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.530> sort<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> comes<00:02:08.220> all

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
two wire switch that sort of comes all

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.110 
two wire switch that sort of comes all
the<00:02:08.550> way<00:02:08.989> around<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.349> snakes<00:02:10.679> into<00:02:11.120> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the way around and snakes into this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.339 
the way around and snakes into this
little<00:02:12.450> button<00:02:12.599> here

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
little button here

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.910 
little button here
and<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:14.250> think<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.739> hundred

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and I think what this is not a hundred

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.970 
and I think what this is not a hundred
percent<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:19.400> like<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> detector<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:22.079> tell<00:02:22.680> like

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
percent is like a detector to tell like

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.979 
percent is like a detector to tell like
a<00:02:23.129> service<00:02:23.489> guy<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.120> somebody<00:02:24.599> opened<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
a service guy that somebody opened the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.050 
a service guy that somebody opened the
case<00:02:25.260> maybe<00:02:25.950> I'm<00:02:26.819> not<00:02:28.400> not<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> hundred<00:02:29.730> percent

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
case maybe I'm not not a hundred percent

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.000 
case maybe I'm not not a hundred percent
so<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.329> can<00:02:30.480> leave<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.689> comment<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.859> do

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
so you can leave the comment if you do

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030 
so you can leave the comment if you do
know<00:02:32.159> exactly<00:02:32.780> underneath<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.079> cover

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
know exactly underneath the cover

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.199 
know exactly underneath the cover
there's<00:02:35.310> actually<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:36.980> little<00:02:38.209> piece

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
there's actually a like a little piece

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.170 
there's actually a like a little piece
of<00:02:39.359> metal<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:40.579> seems<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.700> correspond<00:02:42.150> with

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
of metal that seems to correspond with

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.670 
of metal that seems to correspond with
this<00:02:42.599> guy<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.019> think<00:02:43.109> once<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.439> put<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
this guy so I think once you put the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.580 
this guy so I think once you put the
case<00:02:43.859> on<00:02:44.510> that'll<00:02:45.510> press<00:02:45.810> down<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.349> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
case on that'll press down on this and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.319 
case on that'll press down on this and
maybe<00:02:46.709> when<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.040> releases<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.000> knows<00:02:48.299> that

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
maybe when it releases it it knows that

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.190 
maybe when it releases it it knows that
somebody<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.109> in<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.290> case<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.829> guess<00:02:51.200> but

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
somebody was in the case I guess but

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.379 
somebody was in the case I guess but
definitely<00:02:52.620> live<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.769> comment<00:02:53.189> if<00:02:53.340> if<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.269> do

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
definitely live a comment if if you do

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.599 
definitely live a comment if if you do
know<00:02:54.829> it's<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.889> Pentium<00:02:56.189> 3

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
know it's a Pentium 3

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.520 
know it's a Pentium 3
I<00:02:56.639> think<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.180> 900<00:02:57.659> megahertz<00:02:58.730> to<00:03:00.139> 256<00:03:01.139> Meg

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I think it's 900 megahertz to 256 Meg

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.729 
I think it's 900 megahertz to 256 Meg

it's<00:03:20.819> hard<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> see<00:03:21.299> but<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.629> is<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.840> 30<00:03:22.169> gig

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
it's hard to see but this is a 30 gig

it's hard to see but this is a 30 gig
hard<00:03:22.620> drive<00:03:23.389> so<00:03:24.389> let<00:03:24.629> me<00:03:25.040> plug<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.159> in<00:03:26.370> and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
hard drive so let me plug this in and

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.649 
hard drive so let me plug this in and
let's<00:03:27.209> see<00:03:27.299> what<00:03:27.449> happens<00:03:29.449> alright<00:03:30.449> let's

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
let's see what happens alright let's

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.670 
let's see what happens alright let's
plug<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.290> here

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:48.900 

all<00:03:36.680> right<00:03:36.830> that's<00:03:37.040> got<00:03:37.190> Auto<00:03:37.610> power

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.860 

so<00:03:49.510> try<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.020> get<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.350> screen<00:03:50.650> here

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:06.979 

Wow<00:03:57.760> looks<00:03:58.760> like<00:03:58.940> we've<00:03:59.120> got<00:03:59.620> XP

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.220 

well<00:04:07.470> actually<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.769> don't<00:04:07.829> want<00:04:08.040> safemode

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
well actually I don't want safemode

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:19.050 
well actually I don't want safemode
let's<00:04:10.230> just<00:04:10.500> start<00:04:10.680> normally

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.370 

and<00:04:19.690> it's<00:04:19.840> XP

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.270 

all<00:04:24.010> right<00:04:24.480> let's<00:04:25.480> see<00:04:25.840> if<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.890> previous

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
all right let's see if the previous

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.310 
all right let's see if the previous
owner<00:04:29.700> had<00:04:30.700> any<00:04:30.880> kind<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.240> security<00:04:31.870> sense

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
owner had any kind of security sense

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.620 
owner had any kind of security sense
here<00:04:35.940> let's<00:04:36.940> see

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:54.560 

okay<00:04:41.340> let's<00:04:42.340> try<00:04:44.220> QWERTY<00:04:47.190> about<00:04:48.190> nothing<00:04:53.310> well

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
okay let's try QWERTY about nothing well

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.980 
okay let's try QWERTY about nothing well
that's<00:04:55.570> not<00:04:55.750> very<00:04:55.870> secure<00:05:00.630> all<00:05:01.630> right<00:05:01.810> let's

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
that's not very secure all right let's

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:09.720 
that's not very secure all right let's
see<00:05:02.260> what<00:05:02.290> we<00:05:04.560> have<00:05:05.560> here

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.510 

okay<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:10.510> it's<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.810> Pentium<00:05:11.170> 3<00:05:12.660> 996<00:05:13.660> megahertz

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
okay so it's a Pentium 3 996 megahertz

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.870 
okay so it's a Pentium 3 996 megahertz
so<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.580> take<00:05:16.120> that<00:05:16.240> as<00:05:16.450> a<00:05:16.720> gigahertz<00:05:17.440> but<00:05:17.880> there

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
so I take that as a gigahertz but there

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.520 
so I take that as a gigahertz but there
you<00:05:18.970> have<00:05:19.120> it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
you have it

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:30.030 
you have it
512<00:05:20.530> Meg<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.830> RAM<00:05:23.730> and<00:05:27.990> nothing<00:05:28.990> out<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.890> whack

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
512 Meg of RAM and nothing out of whack

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:40.380 
512 Meg of RAM and nothing out of whack
here<00:05:35.100> hard<00:05:36.100> drive<00:05:36.370> 30<00:05:37.210> gig<00:05:38.580> only<00:05:39.580> 7<00:05:39.910> gig<00:05:40.060> in<00:05:40.180> use

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
here hard drive 30 gig only 7 gig in use

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.050 
here hard drive 30 gig only 7 gig in use
which<00:05:40.840> probably<00:05:41.500> means<00:05:42.270> maybe<00:05:43.270> they<00:05:45.060> cleaned

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
which probably means maybe they cleaned

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:55.920 
which probably means maybe they cleaned
out<00:05:47.490> what<00:05:48.490> was<00:05:48.640> ever<00:05:48.820> was<00:05:49.420> on<00:05:49.570> here

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.999 

hmm<00:05:59.370> and<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.490> looks<00:06:00.610> like<00:06:00.669> it's<00:06:01.590> wow<00:06:02.590> it<00:06:02.830> looks

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
hmm and it looks like it's wow it looks

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.499 
hmm and it looks like it's wow it looks
like<00:06:03.070> at<00:06:03.340> least<00:06:03.610> they<00:06:03.759> went<00:06:04.000> in<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.240> cleaned

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
like at least they went in and cleaned

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:10.560 
like at least they went in and cleaned
up<00:06:05.669> user<00:06:06.669> information<00:06:07.710> which<00:06:08.710> is<00:06:09.039> a<00:06:09.570> good

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
up user information which is a good

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.140 
up user information which is a good
thing<00:06:11.759> yeah<00:06:13.169> so<00:06:14.490> at<00:06:15.490> least<00:06:15.699> I<00:06:15.789> had<00:06:15.910> enough

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
thing yeah so at least I had enough

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.740 
thing yeah so at least I had enough
sense<00:06:16.330> to<00:06:16.570> do<00:06:16.690> that<00:06:17.100> before<00:06:18.100> they<00:06:18.479> let's<00:06:19.479> hold

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
sense to do that before they let's hold

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.460 
sense to do that before they let's hold
this<00:06:19.900> machine<00:06:21.060> this<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.240> an<00:06:22.360> old<00:06:22.509> one<00:06:22.720> I<00:06:22.930> don't

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
this machine this is an old one I don't

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.870 
this machine this is an old one I don't
really<00:06:23.949> know<00:06:24.130> what<00:06:24.280> I'm<00:06:24.340> gonna<00:06:24.430> do<00:06:24.639> with<00:06:24.759> this

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
really know what I'm gonna do with this

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.409 
really know what I'm gonna do with this
one<00:06:25.030> I<00:06:25.090> mean<00:06:25.330> I<00:06:25.419> could<00:06:26.610> I<00:06:27.610> could<00:06:28.030> reload
