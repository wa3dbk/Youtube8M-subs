that<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.920> record<00:01:25.189> really<00:01:26.149> really<00:01:27.020> meant<00:01:27.200> a

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
that that record really really meant a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.769 
that that record really really meant a
lot<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.499> me<00:01:27.740> as<00:01:28.009> if<00:01:28.880> people<00:01:29.240> would<00:01:29.359> look<00:01:29.479> at<00:01:29.630> it
