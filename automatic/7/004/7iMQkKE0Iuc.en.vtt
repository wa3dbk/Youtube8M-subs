00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:10.679
 he is welcome to the profile and night already 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.740
 is good 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 Good, I saw nothing of bh today to make a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.220
 I'm sure I want to talk about some of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.690
 things that have annoyed one of them is the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.380
 world cup that will be held in 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.359
 Brazil 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.010
 There is no world cup that ends late. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 that fifa has made some demands 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.580
 for the world cup held here 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.769
 only end up, for example, with the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.570
 half-income benefit for student 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.020
 I do not know about you but I think it's a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 absurd is an international entity 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.930
 I wanted to interfere with a Brazilian law. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.820
 something that is already rooted in our 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.280
 culture is that the falsification of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.450
 student card georgio other 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.460
 thing is also quite the traffic 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 there in bh so bad here in são paulo and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.489
 which is also in the decade came problem 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.750
 it's not just another car on the street it 's 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.670
 problem is that the staff is every time 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.350
 more stressed in traffic is a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.690
 closing the other in without giving an arrow 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.129
 obscene 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.870
 transit at all times 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.699
 even to me that the basis of the problem of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 Transit, like everything else in Brazil. 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.149
 the basis of the problem is where 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 education 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 They will agree with me because it's just 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.260
 reach the school holidays and the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.049
 traffic flows much better 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.200
 that is, if we end up with education 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.540
 we solve the traffic problem is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.740
 where do politicians do nothing 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.299
 Then I say that I need to improve the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 education because that's the whole 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.740
 public school someone who is at school 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 Public also just for you to understand me 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.640
 so it it hurts better than 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.610
 she had to come 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.430
 recreation is why running to the canteen is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.670
 always rolling rosé temperado is with 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.100
 onion sausage watch a stumble 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.130
 also with sausage sometimes she 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 Nice pasta with sausage is a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 Bean curd with sausage broth 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.570
 cassava with canjiquinha sausage with 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.360
 chicken and sausage is a sweet rice with 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.009
 cinnamon with cinnamon for both 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.780
 that they had no sausage in the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.990
 school is sweet rice and hot dog 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.240
 That's it 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.659
 now the private school guys do not 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.489
 had the canteen and nice riverside ne 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.890
 she has a cool class number 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.069
 the moniker of poor performance rising with 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.849
 sausage is something else bettany 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.930
 tactical gost sertaneja music like or 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.880
 no, but you really have nothing against it. 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.190
 sertaneja music itself that I do not 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.230
 I like some doubles that they think 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.780
 that 's just making a beast 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.019
 if you're talking about life in the field ready 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.450
 It's poetry is that success. 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:43.720
 What a good life or what a good life 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.530
 frog fell in the pond 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.319
 it's me on the way to my backyard looks like 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.150
 is so realistic that shivers is poetry of 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.739
 image of who is carlos drumond de 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.560
 andrade when you hear Victor and Léo in 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.450
 I had a stone in the middle of the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.810
 stone path in the middle of the path after 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.849
 a frog to fall into the pond that's cool 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.709
 to talk about everyday life in the countryside is 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.470
 who has never been a farm gone 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.829
 on the wizard's side was there daddy sap for 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.660
 The whole time, there's not much. 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.880
 interesting thing you can do in 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.180
 Interior I like very much to walk to 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.340
 horse is from the agenda on horseback by nakagawa 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.440
 the treated the horses anything 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.959
 depending on the farm it even gives to play 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.600
 a ball to camping I do not know how to do 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.630
 a meat in the evening is barbecue 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.350
 Always good, you fish a lot 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.390
 to fish has no river has site has invoke 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.060
 has nothing do not like such a 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:48.660
 I had a life I heard the sound of 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.660
 little birds early morning thing 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.530
 to scratch the bag is life in the field is this 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.909
 I have a friend spent a month of 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.409
 Vacation on the farm the team came back 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.920

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.989
 too much 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.819
 I slept in the hammock in the river where I 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.280
 asshole fruit on purple foot hit 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.980
 I still have not done it in sapucaí 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.989
 friends and did not see that country life 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.060
 life in the field or sapucaí does not learn 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.620
 With victor léo sai do sapucaí is there to 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.359
 life in the countryside as well as the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.549
 rio de janeiro carnival is essential 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.530
 But ok I was born and grew up in the city. 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.209
 also wants to do poetry too. 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.949
 I want to be successful, just follow the same 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.880
 All I'm saying is that it's essential to 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:32.070
 people who cool life what legal route 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.000

 sertanejas 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.889
 but the music is calling it a backwoodsman 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.690
 today these versions would do more 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.800

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.570
 country life 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.460

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.830

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.370
