00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello my name is Michael 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.390
 Another review of the Chinese league today 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.550
 we will consider one very 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.349
 interesting set but first I would like 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.210
 briefly tell the background of this 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.849
 video thing is that yesterday 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.070
 somehow I was walking down the street experiencing a creepy 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.590
 Thirst they do not want to go to the store and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 buy yourself a drink to the vase and there I saw 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.769
 very small outlet in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 which sold various Chinese 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.920
 toys 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.429
 but among other things I noticed there 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 designer and I really liked this 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.750
 I set here excavator and backhoe 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.480
 I have not yet met at least among 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 Chinese Oleg and since 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.460
 remotely but it s an Oka container 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.989
 relationship to my current profession I 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.969
 just couldn't get past and of course I 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.230
 bought it and so today we 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:58.680
 We are considering a heavy engineering kit from 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.780
 firms sluban or threw m38 b01 19 less 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.649
 mini excavator router 46 details about 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.799
 six years old 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.360
 there are modifications that are still possible behind 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.760
 you can even collect from it 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.770
 here's a machine yes it does not matter 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.840
 let's open let's see what we have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.530
 inside and inside we only have one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.500
 bag 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.780
 nothing more, Jesus is the same inside and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.869
 here is an interesting decision to be here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.759
 already if on carefully and detail this here 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.759
 this platform that rotates 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.340
 excavators and and then it will be possible 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:38.030
 somewhere in mind give open package 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.030
 just like that 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.650
 it fell here we fell alone 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.780
 detail on quality is not a problem 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.550
 I can say that the details are quite soft 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.560
 let's see how everything holds on to the principle 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.630
 not bad of course everything is hard stuck and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.110
 after lego before and after you don't want 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.270
 assemble Chinese designers but 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.420
 let's try to collect see what 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 it will turn out all the same it seems to me that brik 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 does the constructor of course also not 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.920
 say what's perfect but minifigures by 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.470
 at least there seems to be better because 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 what here i see in three places is 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.660
 burrs but plastic and it's not very 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 ok but nonetheless all hands 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.450
 spin nothing fall off this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.330
 it is very interesting that some 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.390
 the details are different, but rather there are two types 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.030
 details if here are as soft as here 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.300
 this is the basis and some are written on them 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.510
 Letters as they poured written them 38 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.739
 But there are such details on which nothing 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.830
 written and plastics they have such more 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.840
 tough by the way it should be mentioned that 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.890
 the price of this set is rather small 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.750
 only 75 rubles and therefore find fault 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.780
 I think thereâ€™s too much quality 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.250
 there is such an interesting detail 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.570
 directly excavator bucket that is 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.140
 hand excavator as its correct 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.019
 to name 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.970
 and it consists of these 3 small 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.470
 details and such here it turns out 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.750
 interesting design 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.430
 that in my comments did not write about 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.500
 that I incorrectly called the worker 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.940
 body excavator now I'm all specifically 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.090
 On the example of this detail I will explain this 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.970
 thing is an excavator bucket here it is 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.459
 the handle and this part is the arrow 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.850
 so here's the quality 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.610
 plastics 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.770
 how not to say good but not bad 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.650
 In principle, I normally eat so much 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.260
 burrs in places but all the elements that 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.090
 should rotate they rotate here 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.820
 the cab spins all the wheels spinning 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.030
 whom quietly moves the door 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.550
 open well and how do you bucket work 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.450
 saw everyone thank you for your attention put 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.370
