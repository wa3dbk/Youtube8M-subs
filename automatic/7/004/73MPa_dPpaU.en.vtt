00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
and you notice we use some of the sandy

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.280 
and you notice we use some of the sandy
stuff<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:30.820> like<00:00:31.150> this<00:00:31.330> topsoil<00:00:31.900> you<00:00:32.110> just

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
stuff to it like this topsoil you just

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.770 
stuff to it like this topsoil you just
need<00:00:32.439> something<00:00:32.680> else<00:00:32.890> that<00:00:33.340> can<00:00:33.489> run<00:00:33.700> into<00:00:33.850> so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
need something else that can run into so

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.530 
need something else that can run into so
the<00:00:34.900> thing<00:00:35.140> same<00:00:35.470> thing<00:00:35.500> goes<00:00:35.950> just<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:37.480> know

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
the thing same thing goes just you know

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.510 
the thing same thing goes just you know
take<00:00:37.840> your<00:00:37.989> transplants<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:39.160> could<00:00:39.309> actually

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
take your transplants you could actually

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.750 
take your transplants you could actually
you<00:00:40.510> could<00:00:40.720> put<00:00:40.900> carrots<00:00:41.379> in<00:00:41.559> here<00:00:41.590> beets<00:00:42.280> you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
you could put carrots in here beets you

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.910 
you could put carrots in here beets you
know<00:00:42.820> you<00:00:43.000> could<00:00:43.270> seed<00:00:43.600> anything<00:00:44.140> in<00:00:44.320> as<00:00:44.500> well

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
know you could seed anything in as well

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.500 
know you could seed anything in as well
as<00:00:45.129> putting<00:00:45.460> in<00:00:47.730> transplants<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:51.269> this<00:00:52.269> one

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
as putting in transplants and this one

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.990 
as putting in transplants and this one
here<00:00:52.750> is<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:53.019> in<00:00:53.379> retrospect<00:00:54.100> as<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.460> were<00:00:54.579> going

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
here is I in retrospect as we were going

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.030 
here is I in retrospect as we were going
we<00:00:55.660> could<00:00:55.899> have<00:00:55.989> been<00:00:56.110> packing<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.710> little<00:00:56.800> bit

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
we could have been packing a little bit

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.240 
we could have been packing a little bit
more<00:00:57.219> manure<00:00:57.579> in<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.940> bottoms<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.620> then<00:01:00.129> we

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
more manure in the bottoms but then we

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.010 
more manure in the bottoms but then we
got<00:01:00.399> a<00:01:00.430> fair<00:01:00.730> amount<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.149> mid<00:01:01.390> layer<00:01:01.629> so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
got a fair amount of the mid layer so

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.280 
got a fair amount of the mid layer so
this<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.410> think<00:01:02.860> will<00:01:02.980> still<00:01:03.190> perform<00:01:03.460> good

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this I think will still perform good

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.080 
this I think will still perform good
Hyuga<00:01:05.290> cultures<00:01:05.680> can<00:01:05.920> be<00:01:05.979> too<00:01:06.310> much<00:01:06.340> carbon<00:01:06.970> to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
Hyuga cultures can be too much carbon to

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.240 
Hyuga cultures can be too much carbon to
nitrogen<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.720> then<00:01:07.930> again<00:01:08.229> hand<00:01:08.500> manure<00:01:08.920> tea

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
nitrogen and then again hand manure tea

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.070 
nitrogen and then again hand manure tea
or<00:01:09.990> fish<00:01:10.990> fertilizer<00:01:11.259> tias<00:01:12.100> as<00:01:12.550> needed<00:01:13.240> but<00:01:14.050> I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
or fish fertilizer tias as needed but I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.580 
or fish fertilizer tias as needed but I
think<00:01:14.440> this<00:01:14.619> will<00:01:14.830> this<00:01:15.340> will<00:01:15.399> work<00:01:15.700> good

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
think this will this will work good

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.410 
think this will this will work good
there's<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.770> heavy<00:01:18.430> stuff<00:01:18.729> this<00:01:18.910> is<00:01:19.090> good<00:01:19.270> for

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
there's a heavy stuff this is good for

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.020 
there's a heavy stuff this is good for
20<00:01:19.810> years<00:01:20.080> or<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:20.560> before<00:01:20.830> that<00:01:21.100> stuff<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.880> all

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
20 years or so before that stuff is all

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.510 
20 years or so before that stuff is all
decomposed<00:01:22.390> under<00:01:23.020> there<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.619> will<00:01:23.830> sink<00:01:24.250> over

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
decomposed under there it will sink over

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.630 
decomposed under there it will sink over
time<00:01:24.970> this<00:01:25.630> won't<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:26.020> as<00:01:26.170> tall<00:01:26.530> as<00:01:26.920> things

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
time this won't be as tall as things

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.929 
time this won't be as tall as things
settle<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:28.780> sink<00:01:29.439> in<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.549> can<00:01:30.729> put<00:01:30.909> a

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
settle and sink in you can put a

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.240 
settle and sink in you can put a
sprinkler<00:01:31.689> a<00:01:31.810> couple<00:01:32.110> of<00:01:32.200> yeah<00:01:32.500> one<00:01:32.770> sprinkler

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
sprinkler a couple of yeah one sprinkler

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.890 
sprinkler a couple of yeah one sprinkler
or<00:01:33.400> two<00:01:33.549> little<00:01:33.820> sprinklers<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.479> do<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
or two little sprinklers and do the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.070 
or two little sprinklers and do the
whole<00:01:35.049> area<00:01:35.500> as<00:01:36.220> far<00:01:36.250> as<00:01:36.490> watering<00:01:37.000> they<00:01:37.689> tend

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
whole area as far as watering they tend

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.960 
whole area as far as watering they tend
to<00:01:38.170> want<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.500> really<00:01:38.710> dry<00:01:39.070> out<00:01:39.100> especially<00:01:39.640> the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
to want to really dry out especially the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.090 
to want to really dry out especially the
first<00:01:40.270> year<00:01:40.450> we<00:01:40.869> were<00:01:40.900> spraying<00:01:41.290> water<00:01:41.799> in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
first year we were spraying water in

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.130 
first year we were spraying water in
there<00:01:42.280> but<00:01:42.759> there's<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:43.030> lot<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.180> dry<00:01:43.479> material

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
there but there's a lot of dry material

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.039 
there but there's a lot of dry material
in<00:01:44.259> there<00:01:44.439> so<00:01:45.150> they'll<00:01:46.150> have<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.509> really<00:01:46.750> water

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
in there so they'll have to really water

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.100 
in there so they'll have to really water
it<00:01:47.290> this<00:01:47.439> year<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:47.950> next<00:01:48.549> year<00:01:48.790> it's<00:01:49.479> all<00:01:49.689> sort

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
it this year but next year it's all sort

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.789 
it this year but next year it's all sort
of<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.490> blending<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.110> rain<00:01:53.350> and

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
of like blending and all the rain and

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.670 
of like blending and all the rain and
snow<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.759> stuff<00:01:55.000> falls<00:01:55.329> on<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.020> next<00:01:56.350> year

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
snow and stuff falls on it so next year

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.710 
snow and stuff falls on it so next year
it<00:01:57.070> should<00:01:57.100> be<00:01:57.400> like<00:01:57.579> more<00:01:57.820> like<00:01:57.939> a<00:01:57.970> sponge<00:01:58.360> so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
it should be like more like a sponge so

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.810 
it should be like more like a sponge so
in<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.320> years<00:01:59.560> ahead<00:01:59.770> you'll<00:02:00.400> need<00:02:00.610> less

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
in the years ahead you'll need less

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.940 
in the years ahead you'll need less
water<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.479> goal<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.170> Yuka<00:02:02.470> culture<00:02:02.829> is

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
water the goal and the Yuka culture is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.880 
water the goal and the Yuka culture is
that<00:02:03.159> as<00:02:04.150> they<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:05.079> certain<00:02:05.530> point<00:02:05.710> in<00:02:05.860> time

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
that as they in a certain point in time

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.440 
that as they in a certain point in time
you<00:02:06.280> don't<00:02:06.399> have<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.700> water<00:02:06.909> them<00:02:07.180> anymore

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
you don't have to water them anymore

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.990 
you don't have to water them anymore
because<00:02:07.720> it's<00:02:08.110> fully<00:02:08.410> saturated<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.759> there's

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
because it's fully saturated and there's

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.890 
because it's fully saturated and there's
a<00:02:10.060> lot<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.299> water<00:02:10.540> in<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.130> that's<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.420> know<00:02:13.510> may

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
a lot of water in it that's you know may

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.280 
a lot of water in it that's you know may
not<00:02:13.930> work<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.590> good<00:02:14.860> at<00:02:14.980> hot<00:02:15.280> springs<00:02:15.610> but

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
not work that good at hot springs but

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.420 
not work that good at hot springs but
attendance<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.500> rainfall<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.160> here<00:02:18.310> you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
attendance is a rainfall but here you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.110 
attendance is a rainfall but here you
get<00:02:18.549> 18

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.820 

Jill's<00:02:23.120> got<00:02:23.390> some<00:02:23.570> nice<00:02:23.810> gold<00:02:24.170> currents<00:02:24.710> over

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
Jill's got some nice gold currents over

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.510 
Jill's got some nice gold currents over
there<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.030> these<00:02:26.420> are<00:02:26.600> one-year<00:02:27.020> shoots<00:02:27.520> this

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
there and these are one-year shoots this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.370 
there and these are one-year shoots this
is<00:02:28.760> vigorous<00:02:29.240> these<00:02:29.450> are<00:02:29.660> these<00:02:29.900> are<00:02:29.930> growing

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
is vigorous these are these are growing

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.430 
is vigorous these are these are growing
good<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.480> there's<00:02:32.480> way<00:02:32.690> too<00:02:32.750> many<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.230> them<00:02:33.320> so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
good and there's way too many of them so

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.050 
good and there's way too many of them so
it<00:02:33.530> needs<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.770> be<00:02:33.860> thinned<00:02:34.190> out<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.850> take

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
it needs to be thinned out so you take

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.930 
it needs to be thinned out so you take
these<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:36.010> usually<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.070> cut<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.490> bottom<00:02:37.820> in<00:02:37.910> a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
these and usually I cut the bottom in a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.640 
these and usually I cut the bottom in a
steep<00:02:38.330> angle<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:40.480> top<00:02:41.480> there<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.470> I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
steep angle and then top there and I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.270 
steep angle and then top there and I
would<00:02:43.390> cut<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.540> again<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.110> steep<00:02:45.410> no<00:02:45.860> sharp

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
would cut that again in a steep no sharp

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.650 
would cut that again in a steep no sharp
point<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:49.400> cut<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:49.910> above

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
point and then and you cut just above

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.640 
point and then and you cut just above
above<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.200> bud<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:56.930> looking<00:02:57.230> for<00:02:57.380> maybe<00:02:57.530> a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
above a bud so I'm looking for maybe a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.160 
above a bud so I'm looking for maybe a
little<00:02:57.800> better<00:02:58.010> spot<00:02:58.780> leave<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> little<00:03:00.020> bit

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
little better spot leave a little bit

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.860 
little better spot leave a little bit
sticking<00:03:00.590> out<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.920> ground<00:03:01.360> keeps<00:03:02.360> watered

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
sticking out of the ground keeps watered

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.890 
sticking out of the ground keeps watered
and<00:03:03.170> these<00:03:03.380> should<00:03:03.890> grow<00:03:04.240> so<00:03:05.240> it's<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.420> fast<00:03:05.690> way

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
and these should grow so it's a fast way

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.230 
and these should grow so it's a fast way
to<00:03:05.930> getting<00:03:06.230> shrubs<00:03:07.070> into<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.460> Hyuga<00:03:07.850> Coulter

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
to getting shrubs into a Hyuga Coulter

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.410 
to getting shrubs into a Hyuga Coulter
and<00:03:08.270> said<00:03:08.570> digging<00:03:08.990> a<00:03:09.050> rut<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:10.030> go<00:03:11.030> right

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
and said digging a rut is to go right

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.060 
and said digging a rut is to go right
with<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.660> great<00:03:12.320> with<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> great<00:03:12.920> with<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
with the great with a great with a

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.920 
with the great with a great with a
ribbon<00:03:13.340> cutting<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.720> how<00:03:14.870> you

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
ribbon cutting so this is how you

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.220 
ribbon cutting so this is how you
propagate<00:03:15.470> currants<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.160> gooseberries

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
propagate currants and gooseberries

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.590 
propagate currants and gooseberries
poplars<00:03:18.230> willows<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.330> sticking

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
poplars willows it's just sticking

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.900 
poplars willows it's just sticking
cuttings<00:03:21.140> in<00:03:21.430> but<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.520> need<00:03:22.700> good<00:03:23.000> firm<00:03:23.630> soil

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
cuttings in but you need good firm soil

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.990 
cuttings in but you need good firm soil
contact<00:03:25.910> with<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.510> bark<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:28.970> a

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
contact with the bark and this is a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.460 
contact with the bark and this is a
little<00:03:29.330> bit<00:03:29.420> late<00:03:29.690> in<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.960> season<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.380> be

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
little bit late in the season to be

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.230 
little bit late in the season to be
taking<00:03:30.920> these<00:03:31.040> see<00:03:31.280> they're<00:03:31.460> breaking<00:03:31.880> but<00:03:32.120> in

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
taking these see they're breaking but in

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.980 
taking these see they're breaking but in
the<00:03:32.390> top<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.840> usually<00:03:32.990> do<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.470> late<00:03:34.160> winter

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
the top you usually do it late winter

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.400 
the top you usually do it late winter
you<00:03:35.990> know<00:03:36.050> chances<00:03:37.010> are<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.280> might<00:03:37.460> still<00:03:37.820> work

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
you know chances are it might still work

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.230 
you know chances are it might still work
but<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.530> don't<00:03:39.740> use<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.220> skinny<00:03:40.760> stuff<00:03:41.120> at

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
but you don't use this skinny stuff at

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.030 
but you don't use this skinny stuff at
the<00:03:41.360> top<00:03:41.570> you're<00:03:41.810> just<00:03:41.990> using<00:03:42.200> some<00:03:42.530> nice<00:03:42.710> and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040

the top you're just using some nice and
they're<00:03:43.760> usually<00:03:43.880> about<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.480> long<00:03:46.780> that's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
they're usually about this long that's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.800 
they're usually about this long that's
kind<00:03:48.050> of<00:03:48.080> Oh

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
kind of Oh

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.479 
kind of Oh
you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.290> somewhere<00:03:49.620> along<00:03:49.739> those<00:03:50.099> lines

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
you know somewhere along those lines

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.760 
you know somewhere along those lines
that's<00:03:51.420> kind<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.840> skinny<00:03:52.140> one<00:03:52.349> too<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.680> you

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
that's kind of a skinny one too but you

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.350 
that's kind of a skinny one too but you
could<00:03:52.920> stick<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.489> if<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.730> are<00:03:53.849> short<00:03:54.180> on

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
could stick it in if you are short on

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.070 
could stick it in if you are short on
material<00:03:54.870> but<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:56.130> best<00:03:56.430> ones<00:03:56.730> most<00:03:57.599> likely

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
material but the best ones most likely

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.160 
material but the best ones most likely
ones<00:03:58.290> are<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.560> butt<00:03:58.830> ends<00:03:59.340> oh<00:04:00.170> so

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.600 

so<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.350> that<00:04:06.590> that's<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.100> nice<00:04:07.310> healthy

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
so that that that's a nice healthy

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.000 
so that that that's a nice healthy
strong<00:04:08.090> cutting<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.410> can<00:04:09.560> just<00:04:09.740> put<00:04:09.920> them

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
strong cutting and you can just put them

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.680 
strong cutting and you can just put them
right<00:04:10.040> right<00:04:10.400> down<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.820> row<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.150> your<00:04:11.180> garden

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
right right down the row in your garden

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.660 
right right down the row in your garden
and<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:12.050> they'll<00:04:12.290> start<00:04:12.590> growing<00:04:12.770> and<00:04:13.490> you

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
and then they'll start growing and you

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.670 
and then they'll start growing and you
can<00:04:13.790> get<00:04:13.910> good<00:04:14.180> yields<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.690> second<00:04:15.140> year<00:04:15.380> from

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
can get good yields the second year from

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.750 
can get good yields the second year from
cuttings<00:04:17.110> in<00:04:18.110> good<00:04:18.769> conditions<00:04:21.760> that's

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
cuttings in good conditions that's

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.700 
cuttings in good conditions that's
easier<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.270> shove<00:04:23.510> it<00:04:23.660> in<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.870> ground<00:04:24.170> and

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
easier to shove it in the ground and

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.130 
easier to shove it in the ground and
even<00:04:25.460> if<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:25.880> if<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.300> find<00:04:26.540> where<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.930> butt

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
even if you if you find where the butt

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.110 
even if you if you find where the butt
is<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.620> cut<00:04:27.830> across<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.400> buddy<00:04:28.730> area

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
is and you cut across the buddy area

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.930 
is and you cut across the buddy area
it's<00:04:29.660> more<00:04:29.840> likely<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.350> shoot<00:04:31.130> roots<00:04:31.460> out<00:04:31.670> then

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
it's more likely to shoot roots out then

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.930 
it's more likely to shoot roots out then
cutting<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.390> in<00:04:32.720> injury<00:04:33.320> internode<00:04:33.950> that's<00:04:34.730> a

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
cutting it in injury internode that's a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.180 
cutting it in injury internode that's a
node<00:04:35.180> this<00:04:35.540> is<00:04:35.600> internode<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:36.560> in<00:04:36.710> between<00:04:36.800> the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
node this is internode so in between the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.190 
node this is internode so in between the
buds<00:04:37.430> there<00:04:38.300> are<00:04:38.390> long<00:04:38.600> distance<00:04:38.870> between
