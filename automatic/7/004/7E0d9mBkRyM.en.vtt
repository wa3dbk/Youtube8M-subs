I<00:01:03.830> was<00:01:04.830> lagging<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.340> I<00:01:05.370> made<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:05.940> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I was lagging when I made this because I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.170 
I was lagging when I made this because I
had<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.300> whole<00:01:06.420> bunch<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.720> things<00:01:06.960> open<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.180> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
had a whole bunch of things open and so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.180 
had a whole bunch of things open and so
it's<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.050> skipping<00:01:10.290> frames<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
it's kind of skipping frames here so you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.390 
it's kind of skipping frames here so you
might<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.460> always<00:01:11.730> see<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.120> menu<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.590> right

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
might not always see the menu but right

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.020 
might not always see the menu but right
now<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.330> no<00:01:15.510> AI<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:16.400> there's<00:01:17.400> no<00:01:17.730> map
