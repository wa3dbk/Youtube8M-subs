00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.980
 narrating a creepy pasta my game 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.870
 favorite everything started at the unam in my 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.090
 home when I played my videogame 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.280
 favorite they call me is my series of 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.770
 favorite video games then on that day 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.350
 still vacation I will never forget that day 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.660
 I was calmly playing the title 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.850
 of megaman 3 never lost by playing 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.670
 everything was fine this one that broke down my 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.110
 console nes and games I sold them 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.390
 spent five years when I was 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.369
 I walked around the city when I saw a bazaar 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.280
 of used items and on the shelf 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.990
 they had games and consoles then review 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.660
 and I found a nintendo console 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.610
 so I decided to buy it and I asked 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.619
 to the Lord if he had a cassette of nes del 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.740
 title of megaman 3 then he 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.570
 he replied saying not a couple of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.130
 months that I sold my last copy of 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.800
 game you are looking for 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.869
 then disappointed I went home to 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.090
 get home connect my console nes 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.920
 to test if it worked and if it turned out 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.440
 that worked then I played the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.750
 titles that included me in the nes me 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.670
 I spent the games in a day then I 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.840
 I agreed that there was not so far a store 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.909
 of video games 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.350
 I arrived at the establishment but I took 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.929
 the surprise that the establishment 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.850
 it was destroyed apparently it was for a 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.619
 fire that by the features of the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.179
 debris 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.489
 then I was disappointed but curious 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.410
 I went to the ruins and I had the surprise of 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.840
 find between several bricks in one 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.790
 copy of megaman 3 that was a bit 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.860
 burned but it was very strange because 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.900
 It was inside some kind of box 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.269
 of semi-burned wood then I went back to 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.790
 home I arrived and cleaned the game with a 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.769
 moist cloth I opened it to clean it 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.989
 also inside and I looked at the table 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.569
 circuits or whatever it is called and it was not 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.549
 damaged already after cleaning it I put it 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.650
 the game console taking advantage 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.420
 It was Friday and my parents were 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.030
 trip and my brother that I had to 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.220
 caring went with a cousin then I 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.260
 I started playing until on the screen 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.299
 title was in another language as if 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.280
 out of china or japan but the cover 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.410
 I was in English and whatever I wanted, I started 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.629
 play when the screen came out for 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.730
 choose the robot master they were in red and 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.890
 the images of the robots were not 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.019
 they only marked the name and face of 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.880
 sad megaman then I chose the 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.880
 topman scenario since for me it is the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.130
 easier 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.290
 then I entered the world the stage 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.510
 It was fine but the music that happened with 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.400
 the music was not alone you could hear a 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.380
 kind of wind blowing and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.780
 move forward there was nobody until I got there 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.210
 with the robot master was not in his 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.400
 original form were those robots that 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.200
 they come out by beating the first master 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.080
 robots then follow those of the mega 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.820
 controls went down just like the spirit of 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.760
 that he got into the robot and took his 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.350
 powers to beat him did not explode if not 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.060
 came to the rus dog and started 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.890
 tear the member robots apart 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.780
 member and that paralyzed me with fear 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.480
 being my favorite game of the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.000
 childhood never despite that they were 8 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.040
 bit traumed me that moment then 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.080
 defeat all the first master 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.540
 robots should then put the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.150
 master past robots or the mega ones 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.400
 controls but it was not like that I happened to the last 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.500
 Doctor wil castle scene 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.780
 then I fought against him and it was a 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.850
 defeated he had not lost any life 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.980
 then I lost and I returned the first life 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.650
 but megan man had changed he was missing 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.960
 one foot I lost again and this time I 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.810
 one arm was missing on the third attempt 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.239
 I won then followed the next phase 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.250
 last phase I won him then they started to 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.530
 fall the stones one crushed willy 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.690
 another to mega man but that's part of the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.430
 original game but when you crush them 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.440
 would base blood from wil's part 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.990
 then he finished the fire mega man speaks 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.210
 with its creator the light doctor then 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.490
 it got all dark the screen was heard 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.650
 a cry went on the screen the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.840
 doctor light was not then I 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.570
 teletransporta goes again with the stone 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.450
 I was not there was not just a trace of 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.150
 blood then again it got dark 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.820
 He came out with an unpleasant appearance 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.919
 as a zombie type then I shot him 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.750
 but it did not hurt him then I 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.970
 I passed the game without others 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.250
 that did not bring powers then what did 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.860
 it stopped next to megan man it got dark 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.840
 the screen screamed mega man then 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.000
 they said moving with red as if 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.310
 was written with blood and the game 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.050
 ended then I grabbed a hammer 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.060
 destroy the cassette and burn it in the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.180
 same 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.280
 and then I found a note saying never 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.110
 be curious and in kind where there was 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.950
 catastrophic events since you died 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.050
 the owner 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.060
 who decided to burn the establishment 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.060
 to experience the same hell 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.199
 so 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.840
