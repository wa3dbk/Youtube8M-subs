00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:36.180
 Internet 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 On various also towards the future its overseas not only of course in Japan because it is deployed in 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.079
 From the beginning it will be necessary to send 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.129

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.910
 I was in the sight of something called digital comic dispatch 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:54.880
 Japanese Anxious Face 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:01:01.059
 First of all, there is a question of how widely English-speaking people should know 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:05.110
 Until now , Japanese manga has been read not only in North America but also all over the world 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:08.900
 After all it is a real degree when it is a paper publication 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.930
 Will continue to be limited just because the work which established as a business 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.500
 Just that Japanese manga is so huge 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.280
 More than having a big spread 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.240
 As much as possible 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 It is big that we want you to see various kinds of things 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020
 Hmm 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.050
 As there is one as a theme 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.910
 In that sense I think Japanese works that have not been introduced so far 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.910
 We believe the Fu that we want to put out many 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:52.750

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.050
 part is 5 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.270
 One of the features is the ability to switch between Japanese and English. 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.590
 We are out to viewer gar 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:12.480
 The reason is that international students coming to Japan recently are fine 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.860
 Learn Japanese even though enrollment book of paintings that I'm more and more people are finding employment Toka Shumaki to be devised 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.430
 But for that opportunity 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.359
 Japanese cartoons and specialties 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:25.299
 Te Irasshaimasu are many who say interested in color Japan 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:30.459
 So those who have an interest in Japan also saw the manga in North America to study Japanese Toka of Japan 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:32.829
 In order to get acquainted with the Japanese culture of getting familiar, English and Japanese notations are lined up 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.110
 I think it's very important to be 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.400
 Kind of people we Tsu that the the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.730
 many 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:51.240
 In so kind of meaning in the it requires that get seen in the reader user 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:57.690
 It is the timing of it from is also announced of the work to increase the number of work 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:59.750
 It's not as attractive as this one's old work alone, so what's new 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.130
 Things 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.090
 Whether it can be released or announced as soon as possible is also a big theme 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.080
 think 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.390
 Then for now 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:17.760
 Though we are in the heart to say that North America since the Well is the English that the North America 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.220
 If the English would go is to proceed would Ikeru also read in various places of the world 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.350
 By say 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.830
 It is such a thing It is thought that we want to put in the view of expansion 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.830
 I am 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:38.550
