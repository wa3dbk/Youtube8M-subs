00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.070
 [music] 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.630
 hello everyone again, Sasha asked 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.730
 tell a little technical 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.029
 features of those pictures that I 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.450
 rented and here you are now with us 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.700
 pleasure we will deal with you 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.200
 I think we will see one of mine. 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.640
 latest pictures for claustrophobia 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.020
 probably worth a little more about myself 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.010
 claustrophobic tell something that 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.840
 this is generally a very cool project 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.300
 which the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.120
 tied to the creation of game quests 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.870
 people get into the room equipment 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.760
 all sorts of mechanisms mysteries females and 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.620
 absolutely incredible entourage 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.350
 engineering solutions trying to make 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.560
 minutes to get out of there either decide 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.890
 some global task and this 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.010
 a picture from one of the quests that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.009
 called coma this post talks about 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.700
 people who fell into the mind consciousness 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.200
 turned out to be closed in a coma and they should 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.400
 get out of there anyway 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.979
 visiting time they will stay forever 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.630
 the picture shows a man who 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:27.070
 actually got into a coma due to an accident and 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.630
 now he sits in that car and 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.110
 trying to understand what is it all the same 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.640
 happened to somehow analyze 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.970
 current situation and find some 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.340
 exit out 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.350
 the picture is not only interesting from the point 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.450
 view some like you and commercial 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.700
 work often happens so on 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.710
 commercial filming I still shoot something 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 for myself and highly recommend 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.100
 do it to you because usually 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.400
 if your creative look suggests 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.710
 what can be done better and better than that 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.840
 requires your client if you stay in 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.820
 late filming even there 5-10 minutes 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.310
 try to realize it because 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.379
 typically 75 percent of the time 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.480
 client will say about cool listen to this 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.689
 we also take a picture in general 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.220
 one of these photos which 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.080
 removed a little 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.410
 in less than those that are located 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:28.320
 on the website of quests this photo is very 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.840
 unusually wide I think well usually 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.750
 so say those people that well you don't 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.530
 I understand how this is shot top very 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.760
 simple 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.430
 this photograph is panoramic she shot on 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.080
 50 millimeters and consists of about 10 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.170
 photos or so in general here 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.510
 there are 5 photos in series 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.000
 located from left to right and this is the first 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.250
 layer which is removed exclusively from 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.160
 natural light with that light which 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.790
 locations are located the second layer which 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.610
 goes over 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.340
 this is a panorama and individual elements 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.150
 which are shot with the light that is needed 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.050
 me as a commercial light 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.670
 impulse sources in this case two 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.810
 this is a flash diffuser with an umbrella which 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.769
 illuminates the face of the model on the right and the second 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.910
 flash 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:30.870
 with such a warm color it is located in 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.000
 passenger area 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.010
 backseat and running content 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.959
 ravik 10 is also separate from and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.540
 elements are separate and exhibited 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:48.150
 lights and some small glare 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.760
 cleaned things are unnecessary and quite a bit 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.320
 processing which in general is also 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.640
 somehow is 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.750
 is part of this result 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.500
 when I process pictures and how 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.580
 rule pull out the texture and 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.170
 our some atmospheric 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.510
 variety in the picture so that in 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.500
 overall felt the air in it to me 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.570
 of course it helps 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.600
 and here it is an unusual panoramic 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.430
 assembly because well donâ€™t 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.229
 anyone that this picture is taken at 50 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.660
 millimeters they will say that 50 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.790
 millimeters oh well you starred on 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.780
 huge shirik but pay attention 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.670
 there is no 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.840
 very serious 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.290
 geometric distortion at the edges of the frame 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.670
 and this is due to the fact that all the same it 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:41.890
 frame 50 millimeters 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:45.650
 plus a very interesting zone mushroom which 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.490
 here at such shooting does still a picture 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.490
 even more atmospheric 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.950
 Here, in principle, and shot this frame 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:08.589
