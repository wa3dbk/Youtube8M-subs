better<00:01:29.640> lit<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.299> her<00:01:30.479> play<00:01:30.750> field<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:32.250> agree

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
better lit up her play field and I agree

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.990 
better lit up her play field and I agree
the<00:01:33.090> original<00:01:33.540> release<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.290> kind<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> dark

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the original release it was kind of dark

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.270 
the original release it was kind of dark
this<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.380> added<00:01:38.040> I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
this one is not because I have added I

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
this one is not because I have added I
believe<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.210> 10<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:39.930> 11<00:01:39.960> different

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
believe it's about 10 or 11 different

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
believe it's about 10 or 11 different
lights<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.840> I've<00:01:42.840> placed<00:01:43.140> them<00:01:43.380> very

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
lights up there I've placed them very

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.359 
lights up there I've placed them very
nicely<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.850> light<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.299> every<00:01:46.259> area<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
nicely to light up every area of the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580 
nicely to light up every area of the
upper<00:01:47.759> play<00:01:48.090> field<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.320> no<00:01:49.560> longer

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
upper play field so it's just no longer

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.100 
upper play field so it's just no longer
dark<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> ball<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.450> at<00:01:51.930> all

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
dark you can see when the ball is at all

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.999 
dark you can see when the ball is at all
times

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
times

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.880 
times
and<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.939> looks<00:01:54.270> much<00:01:55.200> better<00:01:55.439> overall

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and it just looks much better overall

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.670 
and it just looks much better overall
I'm<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.700> sure<00:01:56.820> why<00:01:56.969> they<00:01:57.210> didn't<00:01:57.479> light<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> up

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
I'm not sure why they didn't light it up

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.870 
I'm not sure why they didn't light it up
a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:58.920> bit<00:01:59.040> better<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.340> beginning<00:01:59.670> but

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
a little bit better in the beginning but

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.310 
a little bit better in the beginning but
this<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:00.990> looks<00:02:01.229> good<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.850> also<00:02:02.969> has

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
this one looks good this one also has

which goes in the the backboard of the

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.500 
which goes in the the backboard of the
machine<00:03:06.489> which<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.639> have<00:03:07.730> installed<00:03:08.030> as<00:03:08.269> well

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
machine which I have installed as well

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.259 
machine which I have installed as well
and<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:09.530> plays<00:03:09.799> over<00:03:10.220> all<00:03:10.819> better<00:03:11.030> you

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
and it just plays over all better you

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.750 
and it just plays over all better you
can<00:03:11.780> read<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:12.049> on<00:03:12.139> it<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.859> breaks<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.489> down<00:03:13.519> even

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
can read up on it it breaks it down even

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.839 
can read up on it it breaks it down even
more<00:03:13.879> online<00:03:14.319> but<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:15.889> it's<00:03:16.010> got<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.220> mod<00:03:16.549> kit

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
more online but so it's got the mod kit

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.970 
more online but so it's got the mod kit
the<00:03:17.150> upper<00:03:17.599> play<00:03:17.780> field<00:03:18.109> is<00:03:18.319> lit<00:03:18.620> up<00:03:18.650> much

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the upper play field is lit up much

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.229 
the upper play field is lit up much
better<00:03:20.859> this<00:03:21.859> one<00:03:22.069> also<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:22.879> unique

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
better this one also is a little unique

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.119 
better this one also is a little unique
because<00:03:23.949> it's<00:03:24.949> a<00:03:25.419> it's<00:03:26.620> set<00:03:27.620> up<00:03:27.650> for<00:03:27.739> Deutsche

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
because it's a it's set up for Deutsche

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.710 
because it's a it's set up for Deutsche
marks

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
marks

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.619 
marks
so<00:03:29.720> I'm<00:03:30.049> guessing<00:03:30.409> at<00:03:30.500> one<00:03:30.650> time<00:03:30.949> it<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:32.359> was<00:03:32.510> in

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
so I'm guessing at one time it it was in

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.589 
so I'm guessing at one time it it was in
Germany<00:03:33.019> but<00:03:33.440> quarters<00:03:34.400> worked<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.299> fine

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
Germany but quarters worked just fine

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.979 
Germany but quarters worked just fine
it<00:03:36.500> set<00:03:36.709> up<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:36.859> free<00:03:37.069> play<00:03:37.310> right<00:03:37.519> now<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.900> you

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it set up a free play right now but you

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.689 
it set up a free play right now but you
can<00:03:39.139> put<00:03:39.349> quarters<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.919> run<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.549> way

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
can put quarters in and run it that way

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.479 
can put quarters in and run it that way
if<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.879> like<00:03:41.199> case<00:03:42.199> is<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.769> good<00:03:43.040> shape<00:03:43.250> it's

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
if you like case is in a good shape it's

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.830 
if you like case is in a good shape it's
got<00:03:43.609> some<00:03:43.959> some<00:03:44.959> minor<00:03:45.199> Nicks<00:03:45.829> and<00:03:46.129> scratches

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
got some some minor Nicks and scratches

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.780 
got some some minor Nicks and scratches
typical<00:03:47.840> stuff<00:03:48.049> you'd<00:03:48.260> find<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.709> case<00:03:49.010> from

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
typical stuff you'd find on a case from

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.939 
typical stuff you'd find on a case from
a<00:03:50.000> machine<00:03:50.359> that<00:03:50.690> has<00:03:50.840> been<00:03:51.049> in<00:03:51.199> an<00:03:51.290> arcade<00:03:51.590> sit

you're<00:03:55.340> gonna<00:03:55.430> find<00:03:55.729> a<00:03:55.970> machine<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.329> does

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
you're gonna find a machine that does

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.250 
you're gonna find a machine that does
not<00:03:56.629> have<00:03:56.989> any<00:03:57.319> Nicks<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:57.979> scrapes<00:03:58.930> as<00:03:59.930> if
