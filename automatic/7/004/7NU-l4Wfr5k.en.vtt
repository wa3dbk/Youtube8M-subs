00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
things down here in this area now we can

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.870 
things down here in this area now we can
have<00:01:01.949> Roman<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.370> Roman<00:01:02.699> coins<00:01:03.379> we<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.559> have

Neolithic we can have access down here

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.210 
Neolithic we can have access down here
so<00:01:08.250> caveman<00:01:08.939> axes<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.010> just

everything down here sexin Viking and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
everything down here sexin Viking and
there's<00:01:14.070> no<00:01:14.189> other<00:01:14.340> place<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.390> world

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
there's no other place here in the world

there's no other place here in the world
that<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.110> find<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.560> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> thing<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that you can find this kind of thing in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
that you can find this kind of thing in
just<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.509> such<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> small<00:01:18.960> area<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
just this in such a small area this is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.520 
just this in such a small area this is
called<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.159> spur<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> pipe<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.869> more

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
called the spur of the pipe the more

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
called the spur of the pipe the more
shallower<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.880> older<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> pipe<00:01:27.540> now

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
shallower that is the older the pipe now

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.969 
shallower that is the older the pipe now
you're<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> say<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.500> me<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> over<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you're going to say to me get over that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.810 
you're going to say to me get over that
one's<00:01:29.189> quite<00:01:29.430> shallow<00:01:29.670> compared<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.990> one

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
one's quite shallow compared to that one

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.340 
one's quite shallow compared to that one
if<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:33.360> almost<00:01:33.509> cut<00:01:33.780> across<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
if they almost cut across it will be a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
if they almost cut across it will be a
16th<00:01:34.740> century<00:01:34.799> pipe<00:01:35.280> plus<00:01:35.670> you'll<00:01:35.850> know

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
16th century pipe plus you'll know

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
16th century pipe plus you'll know
notice<00:01:36.509> yet<00:01:36.720> because<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> bowls<00:01:37.229> were<00:01:37.439> really

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
notice yet because the bowls were really

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.460 
notice yet because the bowls were really
small<00:01:38.329> but<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> spur<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.170> maker's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
small but on the spur you get maker's

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
small but on the spur you get maker's
marks<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> lucky<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
marks now you lucky on that one do the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.060 
marks now you lucky on that one do the
fact<00:01:43.049> you've<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.320> way<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.560> written<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:46.070> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
fact you've got way out written on it it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.170 
fact you've got way out written on it it
could<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.310> been<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> could<00:01:47.939> mean<00:01:48.090> for

could have been it could mean for

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
could have been it could mean for
anything<00:01:48.390> he<00:01:48.720> looks<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.229> over<00:01:49.560> set

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
anything he looks like it's got over set

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.230 
anything he looks like it's got over set
of<00:01:49.890> hands<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> could<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> Spanish<00:01:51.030> pipe

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
of hands and it could be a Spanish pipe

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.840 
of hands and it could be a Spanish pipe
so<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.259> pitted<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.490> rolled<00:01:53.729> up

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
so it's all pitted where it's rolled up

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.209 
so it's all pitted where it's rolled up
and<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.360> stone<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.710> depending<00:01:56.159> also

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
and down like a stone so depending also

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.440 
and down like a stone so depending also
depending<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.790> where<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.180> find

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
depending on where you actually find

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
depending on where you actually find
them<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> force<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.170> depends<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
them on the force or depends on the

them on the force or depends on the
conditions<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.729> well<00:02:00.229> they<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.439> apart<00:02:01.740> I'd

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
conditions as well they get apart I'd

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.070 
conditions as well they get apart I'd
snip<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.090> piece<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> skin<00:02:03.810> off<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:03.960> finger

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
they get a now like the ones we got here

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.210 
they get a now like the ones we got here
leave<00:02:11.140> now<00:02:11.260> that's<00:02:11.440> not<00:02:11.560> now<00:02:11.770> but<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.070> close

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
leave now that's not now but it's close

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.040 
leave now that's not now but it's close
enough<00:02:12.250> they<00:02:12.640> get<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> rusty<00:02:13.150> now<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.900> they

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
enough they get a rusty now and they

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.290 
enough they get a rusty now and they
bend<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.490> reason<00:02:15.640> why<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:15.970> would<00:02:16.090> bend

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
bend it and a reason why they would bend

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.410 
bend it and a reason why they would bend
it<00:02:16.450> here<00:02:16.600> was<00:02:16.780> going<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.050> put<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.380> into<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.590> pot

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420

they put your piece of skin they put
your<00:02:20.950> now<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.430> put<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> rusty<00:02:22.390> now<00:02:22.540> in<00:02:22.690> there

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
your now in I put a rusty now in there

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.810 
your now in I put a rusty now in there
then<00:02:23.530> they<00:02:23.620> put<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.830> little<00:02:23.980> piece<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.310> silk<00:02:24.670> in

then they put a little piece of silk in

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.920 
then they put a little piece of silk in
there<00:02:25.000> because<00:02:25.090> silk<00:02:25.390> was<00:02:25.510> very<00:02:25.690> expensive

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
there because silk was very expensive

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.540 
there because silk was very expensive
now<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.680> if<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.830> little<00:02:27.040> bit<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.280> silk

now is that so if a little bit of silk

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.970 
now is that so if a little bit of silk
in<00:02:27.700> there<00:02:28.050> sometimes<00:02:29.050> they<00:02:29.350> put<00:02:29.470> some<00:02:29.650> hair<00:02:29.830> in

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
there and then they pee in the pot

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.630 
there and then they pee in the pot
they'd<00:02:32.560> actually<00:02:32.740> have<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.010> pee<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> pot

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.690 
they'd actually have a pee in the pot
and<00:02:34.390> they<00:02:34.510> would<00:02:34.630> seal<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:36.370> actually

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.740 
the Thames and then you've been found
they<00:02:47.830> still<00:02:48.100> come<00:02:48.250> up<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.640> came<00:02:48.880> up<00:02:49.090> about<00:02:49.270> a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
they still come up one came up about a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.630 
they still come up one came up about a
year<00:02:49.810> ago<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.830> still<00:02:50.860> had<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.250> pee<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.550> it

year ago and it still had to pee and it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.460 
year ago and it still had to pee and it
was<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.910> sealed<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:52.990> still<00:02:53.200> had<00:02:53.290> some

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
was is sealed so I still had some

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.410 
was is sealed so I still had some
buddies<00:02:53.680> medieval<00:02:54.190> pee<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.459> there<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
buddies medieval pee in there and the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.760 
buddies medieval pee in there and the
reason<00:02:55.570> why<00:02:55.720> they<00:02:55.840> bent<00:02:56.020> in<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.170> now<00:02:56.320> was<00:02:56.590> it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
reason why they bent in the now was it

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.030 
reason why they bent in the now was it
was<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.459> when<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.970> which<00:02:58.390> had<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> P<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.260> well<00:02:59.470> it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
was so when the which had a P as well it

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.880 
was so when the which had a P as well it
would<00:03:00.190> hurt<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.520> witch<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> pee

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
would hurt the witch to have a pee

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.810 
would hurt the witch to have a pee
sometimes<00:03:02.890> they're<00:03:03.070> built<00:03:03.250> into<00:03:03.400> fireplaces

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
sometimes they're built into fireplaces

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
let through the shell of that let be

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.449 
let through the shell of that let be
poetry<00:03:36.260> like<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.769> then<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:36.980> have<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.190> pin

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
poetry like that and then you have a pin

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.860 
poetry like that and then you have a pin
going<00:03:37.700> through<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.300> normal<00:03:38.450> buckle

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
but it's a nice little medieval answer

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.740 
but it's a nice little medieval answer

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
come back a couple hundred years later

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.289 
come back a couple hundred years later
they<00:03:53.989> actually<00:03:54.410> go<00:03:54.590> into<00:03:54.769> strains<00:03:55.299> which

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
they actually go into strains which

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.610 
they actually go into strains which
means<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.660> if<00:03:56.750> we<00:03:56.900> find<00:03:57.080> in<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.260> little<00:03:57.470> place

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
means that if we find in a little place

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.289 
means that if we find in a little place
down<00:03:57.650> here<00:03:57.860> yeah<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.519> have<00:03:58.640> rules

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
look if you see now hopefully your f

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.150 
look if you see now hopefully your f
site<00:04:03.799> also<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.840> reason<00:04:05.989> why<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
site also the reason why that is the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.069 
site also the reason why that is the
nails<00:04:07.400> come<00:04:07.730> together<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.599> things<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:09.049> that

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
nails come together and things of that

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.620 
nails come together and things of that
size<00:04:09.410> come<00:04:09.709> together<00:04:10.040> as<00:04:10.310> well<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:11.209> if<00:04:11.450> we<00:04:11.569> were

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
size come together as well so if we were

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.690 
size come together as well so if we were
to<00:04:11.690> find<00:04:11.959> like<00:04:12.440> f<00:04:12.620> 5<00:04:12.860> p's<00:04:13.130> that<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.370> threw<00:04:13.549> in

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
to find like f 5 p's that we threw in

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.390 
to find like f 5 p's that we threw in
500<00:04:14.269> years<00:04:14.420> ago<00:04:14.750> if<00:04:15.590> we<00:04:15.799> were<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.070> look<00:04:16.100> yeah

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
500 years ago if we were to look yeah

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.640 
500 years ago if we were to look yeah
