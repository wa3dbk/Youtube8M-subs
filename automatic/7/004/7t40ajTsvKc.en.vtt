00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
lack of an audience is really one of my

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.630 
lack of an audience is really one of my
biggest<00:01:23.290> complaints<00:01:23.800> it<00:01:24.280> just<00:01:24.430> makes

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
biggest complaints it just makes

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.540 
biggest complaints it just makes
everything<00:01:24.760> seem<00:01:25.270> well<00:01:25.900> fake<00:01:26.440> there's<00:01:27.430> no

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
everything seem well fake there's no

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.070 
everything seem well fake there's no
referee<00:01:27.880> either<00:01:28.210> just<00:01:28.540> numbers<00:01:28.870> that<00:01:28.900> appear

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
referee either just numbers that appear

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.899 
referee either just numbers that appear
when<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.380> pin<00:01:29.590> someone<00:01:29.920> they<00:01:30.520> can't<00:01:30.760> fight

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
when you pin someone they can't fight

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.219 
when you pin someone they can't fight
outside<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.300> ring<00:01:31.360> either<00:01:31.630> so<00:01:32.020> every

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
outside of the ring either so every

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.780 
outside of the ring either so every
match<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.560> basically<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.979> default<00:01:33.430> lumberjack

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
match is basically a default lumberjack

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.790

match<00:01:34.060> they<00:01:34.840> do<00:01:34.930> have<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.140> bell<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.470> rings<00:01:35.619> at

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
match they do have a bell that rings at

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.370 
match they do have a bell that rings at
the<00:01:35.830> end<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.100> match<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.580> there<00:01:36.760> is<00:01:36.880> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the end of the match so there is that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.630 
the end of the match so there is that

little things like that

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.550 
little things like that
the<00:01:51.909> controls<00:01:52.270> are<00:01:52.420> beyond<00:01:52.780> frustrating

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
the controls are beyond frustrating

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.020 
the controls are beyond frustrating
everyone<00:01:54.100> moves<00:01:54.340> like<00:01:54.490> they<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.729> stick<00:01:54.940> up
