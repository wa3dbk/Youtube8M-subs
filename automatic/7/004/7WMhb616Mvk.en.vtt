didn't realize that damage had the
sawed-off<00:04:58.940> right<00:04:59.300> there<00:04:59.450> you<00:04:59.630> know<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.750> kind<00:05:00.050> of

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
sawed-off right there you know I kind of

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.840 
sawed-off right there you know I kind of
backed<00:05:00.290> up<00:05:00.530> as<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.800> saw<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.250> but<00:05:01.460> that's<00:05:01.580> one<00:05:01.730> of

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
backed up as I saw it but that's one of

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.460 
backed up as I saw it but that's one of
the<00:05:01.910> reasons<00:05:02.270> still<00:05:02.720> don't<00:05:02.900> know<00:05:02.960> how<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.110> get

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
the reasons still don't know how to get

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.720 
the reasons still don't know how to get
that<00:05:03.620> kill<00:05:03.860> it's<00:05:04.070> one<00:05:04.190> of<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.370> reasons<00:05:04.670> that

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
that kill it's one of the reasons that

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.410 
that kill it's one of the reasons that
epic<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.360> putting<00:05:06.110> that<00:05:06.230> big<00:05:06.710> flashing<00:05:07.420> light

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
epic is putting that big flashing light

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.300 
epic is putting that big flashing light
on<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.990> end<00:05:09.140> of<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.320> gun<00:05:09.530> so<00:05:09.560> when<00:05:10.010> someone's

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
on the end of the gun so when someone's

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.410 
on the end of the gun so when someone's
running<00:05:10.460> up<00:05:10.670> on<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:10.910> with<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:11.090> sawed-off
