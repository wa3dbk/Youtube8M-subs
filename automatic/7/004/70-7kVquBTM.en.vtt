00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.129 
this is the round foliage brush
it's<00:00:04.900> made<00:00:05.110> from<00:00:05.320> bristle<00:00:05.770> and<00:00:05.890> hair<00:00:06.960> but<00:00:07.960> it's

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
it's made from bristle and hair but it's

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.299 
it's made from bristle and hair but it's
has<00:00:08.919> a<00:00:09.059> rounded<00:00:10.059> shape<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.620> end<00:00:12.009> of<00:00:12.219> the

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
has a rounded shape to the end of the

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.209 
has a rounded shape to the end of the
brush<00:00:12.490> but<00:00:13.209> also<00:00:13.499> the<00:00:14.499> top<00:00:14.709> and<00:00:14.919> bottom

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
brush but also the top and bottom

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.349 
brush but also the top and bottom
actually<00:00:15.549> tapers<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:17.769> point<00:00:17.859> like<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:18.849> so

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
actually tapers to a point like that so

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.230 
actually tapers to a point like that so
there's<00:00:19.630> an<00:00:19.750> angle<00:00:20.380> here<00:00:20.740> and<00:00:20.920> an<00:00:21.699> angle<00:00:22.090> on

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
there's an angle here and an angle on

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.689 
there's an angle here and an angle on
the<00:00:22.359> other<00:00:22.390> side<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:26.019> it's<00:00:26.199> a<00:00:26.550> rounded<00:00:27.550> brush

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
the other side so it's a rounded brush

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.270 
the other side so it's a rounded brush
with<00:00:28.539> no<00:00:28.570> straight<00:00:29.410> edges<00:00:31.770> it's<00:00:32.770> quite<00:00:33.250> a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
with no straight edges it's quite a

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.270 
with no straight edges it's quite a
stiff<00:00:33.640> head<00:00:33.879> brush<00:00:34.180> so<00:00:34.989> if<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.260> step<00:00:35.980> up<00:00:36.039> with
