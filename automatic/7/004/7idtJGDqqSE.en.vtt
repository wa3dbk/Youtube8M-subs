bench<00:00:21.900> fitness<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.619> today<00:00:22.890> we're<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
bench fitness and today we're going to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.009 
bench fitness and today we're going to
be<00:00:23.310> talking<00:00:23.490> about<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.090> shrink-wrap<00:00:24.600> effect

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
be talking about the shrink-wrap effect

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.960 
be talking about the shrink-wrap effect
what<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> shrimp<00:00:25.890> were<00:00:26.039> perfect<00:00:26.460> well

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
what is the shrimp were perfect well

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.540 
what is the shrimp were perfect well
firstly<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.779> originated<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.619> rusty<00:00:29.310> mores

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
firstly it originated from rusty mores

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
firstly it originated from rusty mores
visual<00:00:30.359> impact<00:00:30.750> muscle<00:00:30.960> building<00:00:31.439> program

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
visual impact muscle building program

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.340 
visual impact muscle building program
and<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.460> consists<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:32.940> three<00:00:33.480> phases<00:00:33.809> phase

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and it consists of three phases phase

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.799 
and it consists of three phases phase
one<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.980> weight<00:00:35.610> loss<00:00:35.940> phase<00:00:36.210> two<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
one is weight loss phase two is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.940 
one is weight loss phase two is
maintenance<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> phase<00:00:38.129> three<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> build<00:00:39.570> up

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
maintenance and phase three is build up

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.319 
maintenance and phase three is build up
so<00:00:40.950> how<00:00:41.070> does<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.430> shrink-wrap<00:00:41.910> effect

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so how does the shrink-wrap effect

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
so how does the shrink-wrap effect
actually<00:00:42.930> work<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.620> basically<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
actually work or basically if you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.270 
actually work or basically if you
imagine<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.989> skin<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
imagine this is your skin here and this

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.920 
imagine this is your skin here and this
is<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.640> muscle<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.539> what's<00:00:48.780> in

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
is your muscle here and what's in

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.319 
is your muscle here and what's in
between<00:00:49.050> these<00:00:49.500> fat<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.820> lose<00:00:50.969> weight

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
between these fat and as you lose weight

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.990 
between these fat and as you lose weight
the<00:00:51.899> fuck<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.320> between<00:00:52.739> disappears<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.879> then

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the fuck in between disappears but then

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.450 
the fuck in between disappears but then
your<00:00:54.120> skin<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> still<00:00:54.870> left<00:00:55.140> hanging<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.829> so

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
your skin is still left hanging here so

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
your skin is still left hanging here so
what<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.570> maintain<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.230> weight

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
what do you do you maintain your weight

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.220 
what do you do you maintain your weight
this<00:00:59.219> gives<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.640> skin<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.210> chance<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> catch

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this gives your skin a chance to catch

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.709 
this gives your skin a chance to catch
up<00:01:01.260> round<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> muscle<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.120> towards<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.600> end

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
up round the muscle then towards the end

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
up round the muscle then towards the end
you<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> quick<00:01:04.470> muscle<00:01:05.040> building<00:01:05.400> phase

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you have a quick muscle building phase

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.530 
you have a quick muscle building phase
of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> program<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.229> look<00:01:08.040> look<00:01:08.540> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
of the program and then look look the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170 
of the program and then look look the
muscle<00:01:09.960> expands<00:01:10.830> within<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> skin<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.030> give

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
muscle expands within the skin to give

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.719 
muscle expands within the skin to give
that<00:01:12.420> shrink<00:01:13.170> wrap<00:01:13.409> effect<00:01:13.860> look<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.430> today

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that shrink wrap effect look down today

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
that shrink wrap effect look down today
up<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.150> three<00:01:15.570> phases<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> program

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
up to all three phases of the program

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
up to all three phases of the program
phase<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.640> consists<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> heavy<00:01:18.780> weight

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
phase one consists of heavy weight

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.679 
phase one consists of heavy weight
training<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:20.040> losing<00:01:20.640> weight<00:01:20.820> now<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
training was losing weight now the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
training was losing weight now the
reason<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.409> being<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:23.009> actually<00:01:23.369> two

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
reason for this being was actually two

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
reason for this being was actually two
reasons<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> first<00:01:24.570> reason<00:01:24.990> being<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> want

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
reasons the first reason being you want

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
reasons the first reason being you want
to<00:01:26.159> preserve<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.700> much<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.659> possible

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to preserve as much more so as possible

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
to preserve as much more so as possible
Wallace<00:01:29.070> losing<00:01:29.460> weight<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> heavy<00:01:30.450> weight

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
Wallace losing weight and heavy weight

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719 
Wallace losing weight and heavy weight
train<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> best<00:01:31.650> way<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
train is the best way to do that the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
train is the best way to do that the
second<00:01:33.210> reason<00:01:33.360> being<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
second reason being you want to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.890 
second reason being you want to
purposefully<00:01:34.740> lose<00:01:35.540> sarcoplasm<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
purposefully lose sarcoplasm in the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.230 
purposefully lose sarcoplasm in the
muscle<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.439> basically<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.100> sarcoplasm<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
muscle and basically what sarcoplasm is

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.749 
muscle and basically what sarcoplasm is
is<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.810> fluid<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.740> muscle<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
is the fluid in the muscle and the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.030 
is the fluid in the muscle and the
second<00:01:42.210> phase<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.689> program<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.439> basically

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
second phase of the program is basically

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.190 
second phase of the program is basically
just<00:01:44.070> keeping<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.850> calories<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.750> maintenance

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just keeping you calories of maintenance

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.950 
just keeping you calories of maintenance
level<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.189> maintain<00:01:47.520> white<00:01:48.240> giving<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
level so you maintain white giving you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.889 
level so you maintain white giving you
skin<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.159> chance<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.880> catch<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.149> around

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
skin I can a chance to catch up around

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
skin I can a chance to catch up around
the<00:01:52.110> muscle<00:01:52.500> base<00:01:52.920> through<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> program<00:01:53.729> now

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the muscle base through the program now

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.760 
the muscle base through the program now
this<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> magic<00:01:54.899> happened<00:01:55.649> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this is where the magic happened this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.550 
this is where the magic happened this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
workouts as opposed to before it was

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.600 
workouts as opposed to before it was
more<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.960> power<00:02:04.229> lifting<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.040> strength

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
