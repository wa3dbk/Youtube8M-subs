this<00:01:58.380> first<00:01:58.740> perk<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.250> probably<00:01:59.640> sits<00:01:59.909> out

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
this first perk here probably sits out

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.570 
this first perk here probably sits out
about<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.330> shit<00:02:00.689> con<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.159> perk<00:02:02.400> is

now<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.290> perk<00:02:04.530> got<00:02:04.710> nerfed<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.250> while<00:02:05.520> ago

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
now this perk got nerfed a while ago

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
now this perk got nerfed a while ago
because<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.659> freakin<00:02:07.110> good<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.890> even

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009

because it was so freakin good but even
now<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.610> still<00:02:08.729> probably<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.660> best<00:02:09.929> perk

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
now it's still probably the best perk

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.710 
now it's still probably the best perk
you<00:02:10.350> can<00:02:10.530> use<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> game<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:12.060> perk<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.480> so

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.260 
probably use is the battle hind now
there's<00:03:38.400> really<00:03:38.490> not<00:03:38.670> much<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.060> say<00:03:39.240> about

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
there's really not much to say about

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.720 
there's really not much to say about
this<00:03:39.690> helicopter<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.770> just<00:03:41.010> call<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.550> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
this helicopter you just call it in it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.550 
this helicopter you just call it in it
flies<00:03:42.000> around<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.510> map<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.260> just

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
flies around the map and it just

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.920 
flies around the map and it just
destroys<00:03:44.010> people<00:03:44.490> and<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.450> pretty<00:03:45.630> good<00:03:45.720> at

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
destroys people and it's pretty good at

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.290 
destroys people and it's pretty good at
that<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.440> we'll<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.310> leave<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.580> there

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.480 

finally<00:03:51.300> we<00:03:51.390> have<00:03:51.480> our<00:03:51.630> last<00:03:51.870> kill<00:03:52.440> streak<00:03:52.770> the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
finally we have our last kill streak the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.040 
finally we have our last kill streak the
one<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.790> everyone<00:03:54.090> loves<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.390> use<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.020> that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
one that everyone loves to use and that

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.920 
one that everyone loves to use and that
would<00:03:55.320> be<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.680> helo<00:03:55.950> pilot<00:03:56.300> hands<00:03:57.300> down<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
would be the helo pilot hands down the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.540 
would be the helo pilot hands down the
best<00:03:58.110> kill<00:03:58.440> streak<00:03:58.710> in<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.980> game<00:03:59.220> and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
best kill streak in the game and

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.910 
best kill streak in the game and
honestly<00:04:00.540> not<00:04:00.780> too<00:04:00.960> hard<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.260> get<00:04:01.500> for<00:04:01.830> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
honestly not too hard to get for the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.040 
honestly not too hard to get for the
damage<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.460> it<00:04:02.580> does<00:04:02.730> basically<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.810> call

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
damage that it does basically just call

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.350 
damage that it does basically just call
it<00:04:04.170> in<00:04:04.320> control<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.310> invite<00:04:05.820> everyone<00:04:06.150> to

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
it in control it and invite everyone to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.060 
it in control it and invite everyone to
the<00:04:06.450> gangbang<00:04:08.210> so<00:04:09.210> there<00:04:09.390> we<00:04:09.510> have<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:10.070> not

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
the gangbang so there we have it's not

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.250 
the gangbang so there we have it's not
exactly<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.640> full<00:04:11.910> class<00:04:12.180> setup<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:12.870> something

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
exactly a full class setup but something

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.820
