right into it this is week one in each

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.290 
right into it this is week one in each
of<00:02:02.330> these<00:02:02.890> would<00:02:03.890> be<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> day<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.030> starts

of these would be a day and it starts

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.240 
of these would be a day and it starts
very<00:02:05.540> simple<00:02:06.170> you'll<00:02:06.500> notice<00:02:06.800> when<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.009> get

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
very simple you'll notice when you get

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.600 
very simple you'll notice when you get
over<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:08.019> higher<00:02:09.019> break<00:02:09.560> you've<00:02:10.070> got<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> lot

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
over to higher break you've got a lot

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.490 
over to higher break you've got a lot
more<00:02:10.970> reading<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.510> lot<00:02:11.660> more<00:02:11.870> words<00:02:12.110> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
paragraphs to correct the top so you're

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.340 
paragraphs to correct the top so you're
going<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.560> start<00:02:15.830> very<00:02:16.160> simple<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.110> it's

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
going to start very simple and so it's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.770 
going to start very simple and so it's
going<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> tell<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.950> students<00:02:19.510> exactly<00:02:20.510> how
