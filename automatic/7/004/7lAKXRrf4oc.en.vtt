more<00:00:29.279> than<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:30.140> wait<00:00:31.140> did<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.679> guy<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
more than a wait did that guy in the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.830 
more than a wait did that guy in the
corner<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.399> killed<00:00:32.579> anything<00:00:33.120> more<00:00:33.510> than<00:00:33.690> a

one kill death ratio
I<00:00:35.070> will<00:00:35.340> accept<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:36.350> it's<00:00:37.350> decent<00:00:37.800> because

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I will accept as it's decent because

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
I will accept as it's decent because
this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> more<00:00:39.180> challenging<00:00:39.629> than<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.870> guys

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
this is more challenging than you guys

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.580 
this is more challenging than you guys
can<00:00:40.200> even<00:00:40.320> imagine<00:00:40.649> there<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.820> oh<00:00:42.410> my<00:00:43.410> knife

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
can even imagine there we go oh my knife

can even imagine there we go oh my knife
went<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> wall<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:45.469> was<00:00:46.469> hoping<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.920> that

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
went up on the wall I was hoping is that

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
went up on the wall I was hoping is that
random<00:00:47.430> throw<00:00:47.670> picks<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.300> building

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
random throw picks from up this building

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.060 
random throw picks from up this building
is<00:00:48.690> actually<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> pretty<00:00:49.140> great<00:00:49.440> place<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> go

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is actually a pretty great place to go

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610 
is actually a pretty great place to go
see<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.360> some<00:00:51.480> nice<00:00:51.600> turns<00:00:51.899> outside

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
