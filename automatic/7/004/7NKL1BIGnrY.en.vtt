some tape and a plastic thing to put it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.080 
some tape and a plastic thing to put it
in<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.950> each<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.280> cost<00:00:47.579> around<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.940> dollar

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.420 
in so each one cost around a dollar
alright<00:00:48.870> let's<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.289> started<00:00:49.620> first<00:00:50.100> take

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
alright let's get started first take

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.250 
alright let's get started first take
your<00:00:50.579> three<00:00:50.820> party<00:00:51.180> poppers<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.989> cut<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
your three party poppers and cut the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.479 
your three party poppers and cut the
ends<00:00:52.559> off<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> each<00:00:52.920> one

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
ends off of each one

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
ends off of each one
then<00:00:53.879> remove<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> insect<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.649> using

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
then remove the insect or if you using

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.619 
then remove the insect or if you using
something<00:00:56.100> else<00:00:56.280> make<00:00:56.879> two<00:00:57.090> holes<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.449> them

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
something else make two holes in them

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.599 
something else make two holes in them
once<00:00:58.140> you've<00:00:58.350> emptied<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.770> three<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.399> go

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
once you've emptied all three you can go

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
once you've emptied all three you can go
ahead<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.000> set<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.270> aside<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:00.930> take<00:01:01.710> your

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
ahead and set them aside now take your

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
ahead and set them aside now take your
sparklers<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.149> need<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> remove<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
sparklers and you need to remove the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
sparklers and you need to remove the
sparkler<00:01:04.379> composition<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> wooden

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
sparkler composition from the wooden

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
sparkler composition from the wooden
sticks<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.390> method<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.020> doing<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.290> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
sticks one method of doing this is

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
sticks one method of doing this is
twisting<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> bag<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.240> falls

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
twisting the bag so that it all falls

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
twisting the bag so that it all falls
off<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.260> use<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> multi-tool<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
off or you can use the multi-tool to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.550 
off or you can use the multi-tool to
break<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> off<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.630> tape<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
break it off now tape up one on the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
break it off now tape up one on the
holes<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.340> party<00:01:14.640> poppers<00:01:14.970> then

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
holes on one of your party poppers then

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
holes on one of your party poppers then
fill<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> sparkler<00:01:16.680> powder<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
fill it with the sparkler powder now you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
fill it with the sparkler powder now you
can<00:01:17.549> go<00:01:17.700> ahead<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.939> fill<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> other<00:01:18.450> two<00:01:18.750> but

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can go ahead and fill the other two but

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.960 
can go ahead and fill the other two but
don't<00:01:19.170> tape<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> holes<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> stack<00:01:20.790> them

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
don't tape up the holes and stack them

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
don't tape up the holes and stack them
up<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> tape<00:01:21.479> them<00:01:21.659> together<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.350> looks

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
up and tape them together so it looks

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
up and tape them together so it looks
like<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.820> attach<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.479> fuse<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.930> top

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
like this then attach a fuse to the top

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
like this then attach a fuse to the top
like<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:26.729> know<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> fuse

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
like this or if you don't know the fuse

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
like this or if you don't know the fuse
you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.930> another<00:01:28.170> sparkler<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.310> let's<00:01:29.640> go

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you can use another sparkler so let's go
