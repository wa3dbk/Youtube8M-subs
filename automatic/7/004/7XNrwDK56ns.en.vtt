least

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
least

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.529 
least
just<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.890> teenage<00:00:53.460> romance<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.120> almost

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
just because teenage romance is almost

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
just because teenage romance is almost
unbearable<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.559> anyone<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.039> teenagers

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
unbearable for anyone but teenagers

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
unbearable for anyone but teenagers
obviously<00:00:57.270> they'll<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.539> reunited<00:00:58.109> again<00:00:58.289> by

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
obviously they'll be reunited again by

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
obviously they'll be reunited again by
the<00:00:58.500> end<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> season<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> obviously<00:00:59.760> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the end of the season and obviously I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.130 
the end of the season and obviously I
think<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.270> Korra<00:01:00.480> still<00:01:00.719> has<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
think that Korra still has a lot to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
think that Korra still has a lot to
learn<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.500> being<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> avatar<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.699> think

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
learn about being the avatar but I think

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
learn about being the avatar but I think
that<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> end<00:01:03.390> I'll<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.600> reconciled<00:01:04.170> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that by the end I'll have reconciled but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.390 
that by the end I'll have reconciled but
obviously<00:01:04.739> there's<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> period

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
obviously there's going to be a period

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.460 
obviously there's going to be a period
of<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:05.939> she's<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.210> her<00:01:06.299> own<00:01:06.360> marks<00:01:07.049> mojo

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
of time when she's on her own marks mojo

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
couple of episodes so I'm really excited

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.620 
couple of episodes so I'm really excited
about<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.850> one<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.000> my<00:02:27.120> other<00:02:27.300> favorite

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
about that but one of my other favorite

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.360 
about that but one of my other favorite
moments<00:02:27.960> though<00:02:28.050> was<00:02:28.260> obviously<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.950> final

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
moments though was obviously that final

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.890 
moments though was obviously that final
battle<00:02:29.730> with<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> bender<00:02:30.270> twins<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.840> that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
battle with the bender twins and that

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.530 
battle with the bender twins and that
giant<00:02:31.470> dark<00:02:31.800> spirit<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.760> had<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.030> Eska<00:02:33.360> set

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
giant dark spirit we had that Eska set

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.580 
giant dark spirit we had that Eska set
up<00:02:33.630> at<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> beginning<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> episode<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
up at the beginning of the episode so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.900 
up at the beginning of the episode so
obviously<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.040> had<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> pay<00:02:35.400> off<00:02:35.520> at<00:02:35.700> some

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
obviously it had to pay off at some

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.250 
obviously it had to pay off at some
point<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> thought<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.050> was<00:02:37.170> really

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
point so I thought it was really

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.020 
point so I thought it was really
appropriate<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.100> bending<00:02:38.400> twins<00:02:38.670> kind

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
appropriate that the bending twins kind

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.610 
appropriate that the bending twins kind
of<00:02:39.090> led<00:02:39.240> into<00:02:39.390> corrugating<00:02:39.990> eaten<00:02:40.290> by<00:02:40.410> this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
of led into corrugating eaten by this

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.070 
of led into corrugating eaten by this
sea<00:02:40.830> monster<00:02:40.860> but<00:02:41.850> here's<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.090> crazy<00:02:42.270> theory<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
sea monster but here's a crazy theory so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.570 
sea monster but here's a crazy theory so
a<00:02:43.110> lot<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.530> people<00:02:43.740> think<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> bender

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
a lot of people think that the bender

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.220 
a lot of people think that the bender
twins<00:02:44.880> are<00:02:45.180> not<00:02:45.390> actually<00:02:45.750> people<00:02:45.900> they're

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
twins are not actually people they're

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.530 
twins are not actually people they're
either<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.920> spirit<00:02:47.580> broken<00:02:48.060> into<00:02:48.360> two

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
either like one spirit broken into two

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.750 
either like one spirit broken into two
bodies<00:02:48.960> or<00:02:49.230> they're<00:02:49.920> somehow<00:02:50.160> connected<00:02:50.730> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
bodies or they're somehow connected to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.610 
bodies or they're somehow connected to
the<00:02:50.970> dark<00:02:51.150> spirits<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.990> fact<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> dark

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the dark spirits the fact that the dark

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.500 
the dark spirits the fact that the dark
spirit<00:02:53.010> appeared<00:02:53.310> when<00:02:53.460> they<00:02:53.610> appeared<00:02:54.090> can't

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
spirit appeared when they appeared can't

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.540 
spirit appeared when they appeared can't
be<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.660> total<00:02:55.110> coincidence<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.890> obviously<00:02:56.490> I

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
be a total coincidence so obviously I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.860 
be a total coincidence so obviously I
think<00:02:56.640> there's<00:02:57.000> something<00:02:57.300> going<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.630> there

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
think there's something going on there

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.530 
think there's something going on there
but<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.500> did<00:02:58.830> love<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.100> fact<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.670> Eska<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.450> I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
but I did love the fact that Eska can I

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.450 
but I did love the fact that Eska can I
made<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> call-out<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.110> Bolin<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.710> technically

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
made a call-out to Bolin so technically

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.910 
made a call-out to Bolin so technically
in<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:03.000> her<00:03:03.210> own<00:03:03.390> crazy<00:03:04.020> person<00:03:04.500> way<00:03:04.620> her<00:03:04.770> own

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
in in her own crazy person way her own

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.060 
in in her own crazy person way her own
Azula<00:03:05.370> way<00:03:05.520> she<00:03:06.030> does<00:03:06.240> love<00:03:06.570> Bolin<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.680> that'll

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
Azula way she does love Bolin so that'll

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.140 
Azula way she does love Bolin so that'll
be<00:03:08.130> interesting<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.520> see<00:03:08.670> how<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:08.880> gets

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
be interesting to see how that gets

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.520 
be interesting to see how that gets
resolved<00:03:09.660> by<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.810> end<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> season

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
resolved by the end of the season

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.350 
resolved by the end of the season
because<00:03:10.710> obviously<00:03:10.980> I'm<00:03:11.610> kind<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.880> expecting

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
because obviously I'm kind of expecting

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.670 
because obviously I'm kind of expecting
that<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.600> bender<00:03:12.840> Twins<00:03:13.110> will<00:03:13.350> end<00:03:13.560> up

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
that the bender Twins will end up

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.710 
that the bender Twins will end up
switching<00:03:14.280> sides<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.000> helping<00:03:15.300> out<00:03:15.420> Korra

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
switching sides and helping out Korra

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.210 
switching sides and helping out Korra
but<00:03:16.260> now<00:03:16.380> let's<00:03:16.560> talk<00:03:16.680> about<00:03:16.740> something

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but now let's talk about something

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.220 
but now let's talk about something
really<00:03:17.370> big<00:03:17.660> supposedly<00:03:18.660> there's<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:19.050> to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
really big supposedly there's going to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.590 
really big supposedly there's going to
be<00:03:19.350> medium<00:03:19.950> bad<00:03:20.250> not<00:03:20.580> big<00:03:20.820> bad<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.270> obviously

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
be medium bad not big bad and obviously

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.920 
be medium bad not big bad and obviously
not<00:03:21.750> small<00:03:22.140> bad<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.250> medium<00:03:23.790> bad<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.660> is

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
not small bad so a medium bad that is

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.630 
not small bad so a medium bad that is
going<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.320> totally<00:03:25.680> surprising<00:03:26.100> when<00:03:26.520> it's

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
going to be totally surprising when it's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.340 
going to be totally surprising when it's
revealed<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.120> us<00:03:27.270> on<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.510> show<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:28.230> not

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
revealed to us on the show it's not

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.170 
revealed to us on the show it's not
gonna<00:03:28.530> be<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.890> great<00:03:29.190> zalaya<00:03:29.460> dark<00:03:29.790> spirit

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.400 
gonna be the great zalaya dark spirit
character<00:03:30.540> obviously<00:03:31.020> I'm<00:03:31.140> kind<00:03:31.380> of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
character obviously I'm kind of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.310 
character obviously I'm kind of
expecting<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.130> be<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.520> big<00:03:33.000> bad<00:03:33.240> so<00:03:33.900> this

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
expecting that to be the big bad so this

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.900 
expecting that to be the big bad so this
medium<00:03:34.710> bad<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.340> be<00:03:35.430> someone<00:03:35.730> else

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
medium bad is going to be someone else

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.120 
medium bad is going to be someone else
and<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.240> could<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:37.080> Azula

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and it could be Azula

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.560 
and it could be Azula
that's<00:03:38.460> right<00:03:38.640> someone<00:03:38.880> pointed<00:03:39.180> out<00:03:39.270> in<00:03:39.420> the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
that's right someone pointed out in the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.390 
that's right someone pointed out in the
promo<00:03:39.900> trailers<00:03:40.230> for<00:03:40.530> book<00:03:40.770> 2<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.130> there<00:03:41.280> was

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
an old woman character that looked like

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.650 
an old woman character that looked like
it<00:03:43.350> could<00:03:43.500> totally<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.280> Azula<00:03:44.910> she'd<00:03:45.450> be<00:03:45.570> about

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
it could totally be Azula she'd be about

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
it could totally be Azula she'd be about
80<00:03:46.050> years<00:03:46.320> old<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.130> events<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.760> are

80 years old in the events that are
going<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.210> in<00:03:48.360> Korra<00:03:48.600> right<00:03:48.780> now<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.200> she's

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
going on in Korra right now and she's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.470 
going on in Korra right now and she's
still<00:03:49.770> alive<00:03:50.040> as<00:03:50.250> far<00:03:50.460> as<00:03:50.550> we<00:03:50.670> know<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.180> so

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
still alive as far as we know and so

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.060 
still alive as far as we know and so
Zuko<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.170> matter<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:52.800> it's<00:03:52.950> totally

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
Zuko for that matter so it's totally

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.920 
Zuko for that matter so it's totally
possible<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.970> she<00:03:54.150> could<00:03:54.330> be<00:03:54.450> working<00:03:54.660> on

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
possible that she could be working on

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.870 
possible that she could be working on
some<00:03:55.110> sort<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.320> anti<00:03:55.710> avatar<00:03:56.250> plot<00:03:56.520> that's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
some sort of anti avatar plot that's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.160 
some sort of anti avatar plot that's
going<00:03:57.150> on<00:03:57.240> that<00:03:57.300> we<00:03:57.510> don't<00:03:57.540> know<00:03:57.780> about<00:03:57.900> yet

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
going on that we don't know about yet

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.990 
going on that we don't know about yet
that<00:03:58.410> also<00:03:58.860> kind<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.070> goes<00:03:59.250> back<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.730> Fire

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
that also kind of goes back to the Fire

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.250 
that also kind of goes back to the Fire
Nation<00:04:00.030> theme<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.780> was<00:04:00.900> talking<00:04:01.080> about

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
Nation theme that I was talking about

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.110 
Nation theme that I was talking about
earlier<00:04:01.440> too<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.160> think<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.760> Fire<00:04:02.940> Nation

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
earlier too I think that the Fire Nation

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.610 
earlier too I think that the Fire Nation
is<00:04:03.360> going<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.630> play<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:04.110> big<00:04:04.230> role<00:04:04.410> in

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
is going to play a really big role in

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.440 
is going to play a really big role in
the<00:04:04.860> resolution<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.460> the<00:04:05.610> civil<00:04:06.000> war<00:04:06.150> going<00:04:06.360> on

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
the resolution of the civil war going on

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
that gradle Isle dark spirit but overall

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.480 
that gradle Isle dark spirit but overall
