first<00:00:14.330> lap<00:00:14.660> steel<00:00:14.900> guitar<00:00:15.230> I've<00:00:15.349> never<00:00:15.530> played

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
first lap steel guitar I've never played

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
first lap steel guitar I've never played
before<00:00:16.509> but<00:00:18.009> I'm<00:00:19.009> not<00:00:19.189> I'm<00:00:19.430> not<00:00:19.490> new<00:00:19.730> to

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
before but I'm not I'm not new to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.180 
before but I'm not I'm not new to
guitars<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.720> would<00:00:21.199> consider<00:00:21.650> this<00:00:21.890> like

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
guitars and I would consider this like

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.720 
guitars and I would consider this like
Squire<00:00:23.150> bullet<00:00:23.600> quality<00:00:24.170> probably<00:00:24.619> which<00:00:24.890> if

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
Squire bullet quality probably which if

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.859 
Squire bullet quality probably which if
you've<00:00:25.880> ever<00:00:25.939> played<00:00:26.060> a<00:00:26.240> Squire<00:00:26.539> bullet

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
you've ever played a Squire bullet

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.140 
you've ever played a Squire bullet
they're<00:00:27.019> actually<00:00:27.320> not<00:00:27.619> that<00:00:27.680> bad<00:00:28.150> especially

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
they're actually not that bad especially

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.670 
they're actually not that bad especially
with<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.630> guitar<00:00:29.750> like<00:00:30.080> this<00:00:30.109> you<00:00:30.410> don't<00:00:30.560> need

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
with a guitar like this you don't need

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.229 
with a guitar like this you don't need
to<00:00:30.740> worry<00:00:30.890> about<00:00:30.949> neck<00:00:31.340> warpage<00:00:31.820> or<00:00:32.059> anything

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
to worry about neck warpage or anything

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.000 
to worry about neck warpage or anything
like<00:00:32.449> that<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:32.930> you<00:00:33.379> kind<00:00:33.530> of<00:00:33.590> can't<00:00:33.769> go<00:00:33.890> wrong

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
like that so you kind of can't go wrong

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.920 
like that so you kind of can't go wrong
the<00:00:34.519> tuning<00:00:34.879> pegs<00:00:35.120> are<00:00:37.329> really<00:00:38.329> pretty<00:00:38.719> nice

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
the tuning pegs are really pretty nice

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.870 
the tuning pegs are really pretty nice
they<00:00:39.260> feel<00:00:39.290> like<00:00:39.710> higher<00:00:40.130> quality<00:00:40.640> than<00:00:40.760> you

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
they feel like higher quality than you

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.170 
they feel like higher quality than you
would<00:00:41.000> expect<00:00:41.170> came<00:00:42.170> with<00:00:42.320> strings<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:46.610> the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
would expect came with strings the the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.170 
would expect came with strings the the
bridge<00:00:47.870> feels<00:00:49.629> pretty<00:00:50.629> solid<00:00:51.640> sounds<00:00:52.640> nice

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
bridge feels pretty solid sounds nice

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.360 
bridge feels pretty solid sounds nice
I<00:00:53.210> mean<00:00:53.450> I'm<00:00:54.289> sure<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.649> doesn't<00:00:54.890> sound<00:00:54.980> as<00:00:55.160> nice

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
I mean I'm sure it doesn't sound as nice

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.950 
I mean I'm sure it doesn't sound as nice
as<00:00:55.520> a<00:00:55.550> Fender<00:00:55.940> or<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.149> Gretsch<00:00:56.360> or<00:00:56.570> something

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
as a Fender or a Gretsch or something

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.510 
as a Fender or a Gretsch or something
but<00:00:57.170> played<00:00:57.590> through<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.860> decent<00:00:58.219> amp<00:00:58.340> it's

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
but played through a decent amp it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.220 
but played through a decent amp it's
going<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.760> sound<00:00:58.910> good

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
going to sound good

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.250 
going to sound good
came<00:01:00.739> with<00:01:00.860> legs<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.000> legs<00:01:02.210> are<00:01:02.420> not<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.079> legs

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
came with legs the legs are not the legs

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.660 
came with legs the legs are not the legs
are<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.530> chin<00:01:03.800> C<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.009> part<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:04.489> package

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
are the chin C is part of the package

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.170 
are the chin C is part of the package
but<00:01:05.089> they<00:01:05.210> work<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.660> mean<00:01:05.899> it's<00:01:06.020> it's<00:01:06.649> not<00:01:07.180> real

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
but they work I mean it's it's not real

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.920 
but they work I mean it's it's not real
solid<00:01:08.780> but<00:01:08.930> it's<00:01:09.080> not<00:01:09.320> real<00:01:09.799> floppy<00:01:10.100> either

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
solid but it's not real floppy either

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.810 
solid but it's not real floppy either
there<00:01:11.930> was<00:01:12.020> one<00:01:12.200> little<00:01:12.320> flaw<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.070> found<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:13.640> it

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820
