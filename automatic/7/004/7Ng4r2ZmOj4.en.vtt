00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
so never a musician's life we're in

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.480 
so never a musician's life we're in
every<00:00:09.050> person's<00:00:09.470> life<00:00:09.530> I<00:00:09.860> suppose<00:00:10.070> there

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
every person's life I suppose there

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.890 
every person's life I suppose there
would<00:00:10.640> be<00:00:10.670> moments<00:00:11.150> that<00:00:11.540> do<00:00:11.630> we<00:00:11.750> would

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
would be moments that do we would

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.299 
would be moments that do we would
consider<00:00:12.260> as<00:00:12.500> pivotal<00:00:13.040> to<00:00:14.650> our<00:00:15.650> station<00:00:16.219> and

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
consider as pivotal to our station and

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.910 
consider as pivotal to our station and
life<00:00:16.520> bed<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.090> our<00:00:17.810> station<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.410> life<00:00:18.650> ever

life bed and our station and life ever

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.770 
life bed and our station and life ever
since<00:00:19.340> that<00:00:19.430> moment<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:20.090> guess<00:00:20.240> that's<00:00:20.450> why<00:00:20.630> we

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
since that moment I guess that's why we

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.590 
since that moment I guess that's why we
call<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.320> game-changing<00:00:22.310> moment<00:00:22.670> for<00:00:22.880> me<00:00:23.120> if

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
call it a game-changing moment for me if

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.779 
call it a game-changing moment for me if
I<00:00:24.140> really<00:00:24.380> had<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.950> pick<00:00:25.190> because<00:00:25.670> there

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
I really had to pick because there

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.260 
I really had to pick because there
certainly<00:00:26.119> isn't<00:00:26.330> only<00:00:26.750> one<00:00:26.960> I<00:00:27.890> would<00:00:28.789> have<00:00:29.060> to

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
certainly isn't only one I would have to

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.060 
certainly isn't only one I would have to
go<00:00:29.420> with<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.750> musical<00:00:30.260> moment<00:00:30.650> that<00:00:30.800> really

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
go with the musical moment that really

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.850 
go with the musical moment that really
turned<00:00:32.029> things<00:00:32.239> around<00:00:32.419> for<00:00:32.870> me<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.470> big<00:00:33.680> way

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
turned things around for me in a big way

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.850 
turned things around for me in a big way
as<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:35.030> kid<00:00:35.510> obviously<00:00:35.780> I<00:00:36.170> listen<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.590> a<00:00:36.620> lot<00:00:36.800> of

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
as a kid obviously I listen to a lot of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.850 
as a kid obviously I listen to a lot of
music<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.520> got<00:00:37.880> inspired<00:00:38.300> by<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.960> had<00:00:39.829> the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
music and got inspired by it and had the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.850 
music and got inspired by it and had the
inkling<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.120> fact<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:41.989> think<00:00:42.500> legal<00:00:42.770> a

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
inkling of the fact that I think legal a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.220 
inkling of the fact that I think legal a
notion<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:43.510> when<00:00:44.510> people<00:00:44.750> are<00:00:44.960> really

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
notion that when people are really

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.100 
notion that when people are really
playing<00:00:45.620> especially<00:00:45.940> improvised<00:00:46.940> music<00:00:47.180> they

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
playing especially improvised music they

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.780 
playing especially improvised music they
would<00:00:48.290> go<00:00:48.530> places<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.250> know<00:00:49.340> they<00:00:49.460> would<00:00:49.610> go

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
would go places you know they would go

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.870 
would go places you know they would go
places<00:00:50.090> that<00:00:50.390> are<00:00:50.540> not<00:00:51.190> mundane<00:00:52.190> they're<00:00:52.640> not

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
places that are not mundane they're not

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.410 
places that are not mundane they're not
everyday<00:00:53.480> places<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.820> but<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.850> didn't<00:00:56.300> have

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
everyday places and but I didn't have

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.959 
everyday places and but I didn't have
any<00:00:56.660> experience<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:58.820> know<00:00:58.940> I

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
any experience of that so I you know I

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.030 
any experience of that so I you know I
thought<00:00:59.390> about<00:00:59.690> it<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.200> thought<00:01:00.230> that<00:01:00.469> there

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
thought about it I thought that there

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.700 
thought about it I thought that there
was<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.219> bit<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.270> seed<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:02.840> me<00:01:03.020> that<00:01:03.230> said<00:01:03.469> it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
was a bit of a seed in me that said it

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.259 
was a bit of a seed in me that said it
must<00:01:03.920> be<00:01:04.069> that<00:01:04.219> way<00:01:04.399> but<00:01:04.969> I'd<00:01:05.089> never

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
must be that way but I'd never

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.199 
must be that way but I'd never
experienced<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.139> and<00:01:06.350> then<00:01:06.609> the<00:01:07.609> moment<00:01:08.090> we're

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:08.209 
experienced it and then the moment we're

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.569 
experienced it and then the moment we're
gonna<00:01:08.329> talk<00:01:08.630> about<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.200> 1994<00:01:10.130> as<00:01:10.249> I<00:01:10.429> was

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
gonna talk about is in 1994 as I was

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.599

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
conditions were very different and we

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.690 
conditions were very different and we
played<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> piece<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:27.560> actually<00:01:28.159> was<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.520> my

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
gentlemen who led traditional Serbian

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.249 
gentlemen who led traditional Serbian
full<00:01:34.909> court<00:01:35.179> astray<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:35.599> we<00:01:35.749> just<00:01:36.049> did<00:01:36.229> a

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
full court astray and we just did a

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.410 
full court astray and we just did a
little<00:01:37.159> bit<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.429> an<00:01:37.520> arrangement<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.209> and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
little bit of an arrangement of that and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.389 
little bit of an arrangement of that and
we<00:01:38.509> played<00:01:38.749> it<00:01:38.929> but<00:01:39.380> we<00:01:39.499> played<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.889> really

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
we played it but we played it really

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.129 
we played it but we played it really
really<00:01:40.700> very<00:01:40.969> open<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.719> and<00:01:41.899> there<00:01:42.049> were

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:42.139 
really very open and and there were

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.559 
really very open and and there were
there<00:01:42.469> were<00:01:42.560> solos<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.219> basically<00:01:43.669> my<00:01:44.240> point

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
there were solos and basically my point

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.609 
there were solos and basically my point
is<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.840> as<00:01:45.459> we<00:01:46.459> were<00:01:46.869> even<00:01:47.869> as<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.139> started

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
is that as we were even as we started

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.339 
is that as we were even as we started
things<00:01:49.429> started<00:01:50.329> happening<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:51.200> me

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
things started happening to me

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.440 
things started happening to me
emotionally<00:01:52.130> intellectually<00:01:52.819> on<00:01:53.149> every

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
emotionally intellectually on every

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.269 
emotionally intellectually on every
level<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:53.779> you<00:01:53.959> can<00:01:54.109> imagine<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.009> have

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
level that you can imagine that I have

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.789 
level that you can imagine that I have
never<00:01:56.020> experienced<00:01:57.020> at<00:01:57.139> that<00:01:57.259> point<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.649> mean

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
never experienced at that point I mean

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.760 
never experienced at that point I mean
when<00:01:58.279> I<00:01:58.310> start<00:01:58.700> talking<00:01:58.880> about<00:01:59.149> this<00:01:59.479> I'm

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
when I start talking about this I'm

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.059 
when I start talking about this I'm
actually<00:02:00.819> starting<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.409> relive<00:02:03.409> some<00:02:03.859> of<00:02:03.979> it

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
actually starting to a relive some of it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.810 
actually starting to a relive some of it
and<00:02:04.249> it's<00:02:04.669> shivers<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.149> mean<00:02:05.389> it's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and it's shivers I mean it's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.660 
and it's shivers I mean it's
really<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.210> get<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:06.930> these<00:02:07.320> Pleasant<00:02:08.009> chills

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670

really I get these these Pleasant chills
just<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.450> thinking<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> moment<00:02:10.320> so

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
just just thinking about the moment so

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.700 
just just thinking about the moment so
eventually<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.910> kept<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.750> noticed

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
eventually as it kept going I noticed

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.430 
eventually as it kept going I noticed
that<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> was<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.400> guess<00:02:15.270> Alice<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:16.020> Wonderland

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
that I was I guess Alice in Wonderland

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.190 
that I was I guess Alice in Wonderland
would<00:02:16.740> be<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> good<00:02:17.280> metaphor<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.630> you're

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
would be a good metaphor for this you're

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440 
would be a good metaphor for this you're
just<00:02:19.230> going<00:02:19.500> into<00:02:20.220> levels<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.970> mirrors<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
just going into levels and mirrors and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.930 
just going into levels and mirrors and
and<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.200> deeper<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.920> deeper<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.340> let<00:02:23.820> me

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and and deeper and deeper and let me

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.810 
and and deeper and deeper and let me
just<00:02:24.150> uh<00:02:24.860> qualify<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.280> say<00:02:26.400> I've<00:02:26.580> never

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820
