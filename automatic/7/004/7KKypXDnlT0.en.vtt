 what you like

 and what you do to open the rescue folder 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 to see if this program 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.320
 but to that country 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.240
 April 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 we go to the windows folder 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.539
 that these cities 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.639
