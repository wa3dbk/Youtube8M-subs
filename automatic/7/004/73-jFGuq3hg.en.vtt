on the 5 inch on the on the batwing here

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.610 
on the 5 inch on the on the batwing here
we've<00:02:51.760> got<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.359> the<00:02:52.629> 7<00:02:52.959> trick<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.319> 7

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620

translucent<00:02:54.160> colors<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.640> well<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.329> as<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.810> go

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
translucent colors as well as as you go

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.619 
translucent colors as well as as you go
higher<00:02:56.430> they<00:02:57.430> get<00:02:57.579> into<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.819> gradient<00:02:58.450> color

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
higher they get into the gradient color

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.940 
higher they get into the gradient color
so<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.109> know<00:02:59.200> it'll<00:02:59.319> go<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.500> say<00:02:59.829> the
