realism at all actually it's just
straight-up<00:01:27.190> action<00:01:27.970> I<00:01:31.080> personally<00:01:32.080> like<00:01:32.260> to

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
straight-up action I personally like to

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.370 
straight-up action I personally like to
play<00:01:32.620> as<00:01:32.799> Taiwan<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:34.540> just<00:01:34.840> because<00:01:35.110> I<00:01:35.140> live

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
play as Taiwan not just because I live

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.550 
play as Taiwan not just because I live
in<00:01:35.560> Taiwan<00:01:35.799> that's<00:01:36.340> one<00:01:36.520> reason<00:01:36.760> but<00:01:37.560> another

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
in Taiwan that's one reason but another

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.910 
in Taiwan that's one reason but another
reason<00:01:39.040> is<00:01:39.220> because<00:01:40.200> Taiwan<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.440> really<00:01:41.740> good

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
reason is because Taiwan is really good

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.780 
reason is because Taiwan is really good
at<00:01:42.070> three-point<00:01:42.700> shots<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:44.080> game<00:01:44.409> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
at three-point shots and in this game I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.910 
at three-point shots and in this game I
find<00:01:45.790> that's<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.420> good<00:01:46.840> key<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.320> winning<00:01:47.530> yeah

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
find that's a good key to winning yeah

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.830 
find that's a good key to winning yeah
if<00:01:48.280> every<00:01:48.670> time<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:48.880> get<00:01:49.150> control<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.659> the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
if every time you get control of the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.780 
if every time you get control of the
ball<00:01:50.080> if<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.380> can<00:01:50.680> make<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> three-point<00:01:51.520> shot

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
ball if you can make a three-point shot

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.630 
ball if you can make a three-point shot
and<00:01:52.600> you'll<00:01:52.869> quickly<00:01:53.140> rack<00:01:53.979> up<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.400> higher

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
and you'll quickly rack up a higher

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.840 
and you'll quickly rack up a higher
score<00:01:55.119> than<00:01:55.150> your<00:01:55.479> opponent<00:01:56.020> which<00:01:56.369> often<00:01:57.369> not

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
score than your opponent which often not

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.620 
score than your opponent which often not
always<00:01:58.030> but<00:01:58.299> often<00:01:58.630> Coast<00:01:59.080> just<00:01:59.500> four<00:01:59.770> dunks

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.900 

I<00:02:05.060> like<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.270> set<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.689> game<00:02:06.979> times<00:02:07.979> usually<00:02:08.399> for

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
I like to set the game times usually for

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.249 
I like to set the game times usually for
two<00:02:09.239> minutes

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
two minutes

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770 
two minutes
you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.890> set<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.130> longer<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.120> find<00:02:12.569> two

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you can set it longer but I find two

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.410 
you can set it longer but I find two
minutes<00:02:13.140> works<00:02:13.380> best<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
minutes works best so that is just a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.979 
minutes works best so that is just a
quick<00:02:15.860> short<00:02:18.319> very<00:02:19.319> intense<00:02:19.830> game<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.870 

typically<00:02:24.989> when<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> play<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.280> game<00:02:26.580> I'll

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
typically when I play this game I'll

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.410 
typically when I play this game I'll
play<00:02:26.910> two<00:02:27.569> games<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.140> succession<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:28.980> that's

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
play two games in succession and that's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.729 
play two games in succession and that's
unless<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.599> really<00:02:30.900> start<00:02:31.170> winning<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.560> lot

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
unless I really start winning a lot

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.540 
unless I really start winning a lot
that's<00:02:32.010> usually<00:02:32.819> about<00:02:33.090> how<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.769> play<00:02:35.250> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that's usually about how much I play and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.910 
that's usually about how much I play and
then<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.599> something<00:02:36.870> else<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.410> four

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
then I go and do something else so four

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.250 
then I go and do something else so four
minutes<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.930> basketball<00:02:39.930> straight<00:02:40.410> up<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:42.260> so

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
minutes a basketball straight up and so

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.900 
minutes a basketball straight up and so
like<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.650> said<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.010> game's<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:44.670> everybody

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
like I said the game's not for everybody

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.580 
like I said the game's not for everybody
because<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.540> don't<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.080> everybody's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
because I don't know if everybody's

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.509 
because I don't know if everybody's
