how<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.939> exactly<00:01:57.390> drag<00:01:57.869> scope<00:01:58.200> k<00:01:59.009> Drax<00:01:59.340> open

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
how do we exactly drag scope k Drax open

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.760 
how do we exactly drag scope k Drax open
is<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.000> rocket<00:02:00.180> science<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:00.990> probably<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
is not rocket science it's probably the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.249 
is not rocket science it's probably the
easiest<00:02:02.159> way<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> snipe<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> quick<00:02:03.960> scope

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
easiest way to snipe or a quick scope

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.920 
easiest way to snipe or a quick scope
should<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.500> say<00:02:04.759> it's<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.939> same<00:02:06.180> way<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.689> hard

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
should I say it's the same way as hard

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
should I say it's the same way as hard
scope<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.439> buying<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> quicker<00:02:07.979> way<00:02:08.099> I'm<00:02:08.429> gonna

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
scope in buying a quicker way I'm gonna

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.940 
scope in buying a quicker way I'm gonna
show<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.330> slower<00:02:09.780> way<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.229> drag<00:02:10.530> scoping

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
show you a slower way of drag scoping

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.440 
show you a slower way of drag scoping
which<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
which is a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.100 
which is a
cost<00:02:12.349> as<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.730> quick<00:02:13.730> scope<00:02:13.970> Jack<00:02:14.270> scope<00:02:14.569> it's

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
cost as a quick scope Jack scope it's

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.650 
cost as a quick scope Jack scope it's
just<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.950> know<00:02:16.099> like<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> hard<00:02:16.940> scope<00:02:17.180> like

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
just you know like a hard scope like

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.540 
just you know like a hard scope like
that<00:02:17.989> but<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.010> course<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.879> quicker

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
that but of course if you do it quicker

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.640 
that but of course if you do it quicker
it<00:02:22.550> would<00:02:22.819> look<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.269> little<00:02:23.660> bit<00:02:23.959> more<00:02:24.319> like

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
it would look a little bit more like

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.839 
it would look a little bit more like
this<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.690> no<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.380> working<00:02:30.620> reto<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.069> drag

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
this so no one working reto to drag

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.370 
this so no one working reto to drag
scope<00:02:32.000> except<00:02:32.450> from<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.690> people<00:02:32.989> that<00:02:33.019> do<00:02:33.230> it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
scope except from the people that do it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.380 
scope except from the people that do it
so<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.130> would<00:02:34.250> look<00:02:34.280> exactly<00:02:34.580> like<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.090> quick

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so it would look exactly like a quick

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.440 
so it would look exactly like a quick
scope<00:02:35.660> but<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.170> drag<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.440> which<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.370> about<00:02:38.090> 10

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
scope but you drag it which is about 10

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.550 
scope but you drag it which is about 10
times<00:02:38.750> more<00:02:40.090> consistent<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.269> takes<00:02:42.260> one

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
times more consistent and takes one

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.740 
times more consistent and takes one
hundred<00:02:42.799> percent<00:02:42.830> skill<00:02:45.370> okay<00:02:46.370> now<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.390> you

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
hundred percent skill okay now that you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.509 
hundred percent skill okay now that you
know<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.400> where<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:50.480> drag<00:02:50.750> scope<00:02:51.049> um<00:02:51.519> now

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
know when and where we drag scope um now

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.819 
know when and where we drag scope um now
i'm<00:02:52.610> going<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> show<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.000> why<00:02:53.360> we<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:53.660> that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
i'm going to show you why we do that

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.380 
i'm going to show you why we do that
okay<00:02:54.829> so<00:02:54.890> instead<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.459> pop<00:02:55.760> shot<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.090> which<00:02:56.239> is

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
okay so instead of pop shot in which is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.900 
okay so instead of pop shot in which is
the<00:02:56.540> most<00:02:56.690> common<00:02:56.989> way<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.290> quick<00:02:57.590> scoping<00:02:58.010> um

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
the most common way of quick scoping um

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.900 
the most common way of quick scoping um
it<00:02:59.360> does<00:02:59.630> take<00:02:59.989> longer<00:03:00.019> time<00:03:00.739> then<00:03:01.130> pop

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
it does take longer time then pop

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.069 
it does take longer time then pop
sighing<00:03:02.180> because<00:03:02.299> you<00:03:02.569> want<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.780> get<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.019> the

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
sighing because you want to get in the

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.839 
sighing because you want to get in the
middle<00:03:03.140> well<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:04.160> enemy<00:03:04.430> in<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.610> middle<00:03:04.819> of

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
middle well the enemy in the middle of

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.970 
middle well the enemy in the middle of
your<00:03:04.970> crosshair<00:03:05.450> then<00:03:06.110> quick<00:03:06.470> scope<00:03:06.739> him

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
your crosshair then quick scope him

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.309 
your crosshair then quick scope him
there's<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.579> faster<00:03:07.970> way<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.120> do<00:03:08.329> it<00:03:08.450> but<00:03:08.630> i<00:03:08.870> will

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
there's a faster way to do it but i will

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.710 
there's a faster way to do it but i will
show<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.890> on<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.390> on<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.420> next

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
show you that on the on the next

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.660 
show you that on the on the next
tutorial<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:12.560> course<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.099> harder<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:13.610> you

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
tutorial of course it's harder so you

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.620 
tutorial of course it's harder so you
want<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:13.910> start<00:03:13.940> off<00:03:14.180> by<00:03:14.450> drag<00:03:15.440> shine<00:03:16.299> now<00:03:17.299> i'm

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
want to start off by drag shine now i'm

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.309 
want to start off by drag shine now i'm
just<00:03:17.840> gonna<00:03:17.930> show<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:18.260> little<00:03:19.220> demonstration

just gonna show you little demonstration
when<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.350> quick<00:03:21.920> scope<00:03:22.220> this<00:03:22.370> enemy<00:03:22.790> here<00:03:23.090> pop

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
when I quick scope this enemy here pop

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.680 
when I quick scope this enemy here pop
show<00:03:24.290> him<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.560> miss<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.850> had<00:03:26.030> him<00:03:26.239> right<00:03:26.600> in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
show him I miss and I had him right in

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.870 
show him I miss and I had him right in
the<00:03:26.720> middle<00:03:26.900> my<00:03:27.049> crosshair<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:28.190> second<00:03:28.609> one<00:03:28.730> I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
the middle my crosshair the second one I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.360 
the middle my crosshair the second one I
don't<00:03:29.090> miss<00:03:29.299> so<00:03:30.260> if<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.680> guys<00:03:30.829> understand

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
don't miss so if you guys understand

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.050 
don't miss so if you guys understand
this<00:03:31.519> properly<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.620> second<00:03:34.010> one<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:34.609> I

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
this properly on the second one all I

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.170 
this properly on the second one all I
mean<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.420> first<00:03:35.660> one<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.920> was<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.180> normal

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
mean on the first one it was a normal

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.000 
mean on the first one it was a normal
pop<00:03:38.569> shot<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.959> had<00:03:39.200> him<00:03:39.380> in<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.560> middle<00:03:39.799> of<00:03:39.829> my

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
pop shot I had him in the middle of my

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.520 
pop shot I had him in the middle of my
aim<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.540> quick<00:03:41.540> scope<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.079> didn't<00:03:42.290> get<00:03:42.380> him

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
aim I quick scope that I didn't get him

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.979 
aim I quick scope that I didn't get him
because<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:44.450> bullet<00:03:44.690> didn't<00:03:44.870> go

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
because you the bullet didn't go

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.319 
because you the bullet didn't go
straight<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.530> that's<00:03:46.280> probably<00:03:46.489> why<00:03:46.880> we<00:03:47.090> drag

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
straight and that's probably why we drag

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.300 
straight and that's probably why we drag
show<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:48.709> you're<00:03:48.920> basically

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
show because you can you're basically

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.490 
show because you can you're basically
controlling<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.970> bullet<00:03:50.299> if<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:51.139> doesn't<00:03:51.290> go

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
controlling the bullet if it doesn't go

controlling the bullet if it doesn't go
