with the key so that safe is is log and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
with the key so that safe is is log and
here's<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> keys<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> with

here's the keys so you can see that with

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.270 
here's the keys so you can see that with
the<00:01:14.970> key<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> opens<00:01:17.180> there<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:18.509> locked

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
the key it opens there it's now locked

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.350 
the key it opens there it's now locked
once<00:01:20.280> again<00:01:23.689> that<00:01:24.689> opens<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:26.090> let's<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.240> which

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
once again that opens up let's see which

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.620 
once again that opens up let's see which
way<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> latch<00:01:27.930> goes<00:01:28.670> now<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.509> going

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
way that latch goes now what I'm going

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
way that latch goes now what I'm going
to<00:01:30.659> demonstrate<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.280> way

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to demonstrate is if you know which way

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.969 
to demonstrate is if you know which way
the<00:01:33.000> latch<00:01:33.210> goes<00:01:33.540> there's<00:01:34.110> Springs<00:01:34.560> inside

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the latch goes there's Springs inside

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.819 
the latch goes there's Springs inside
this<00:01:35.130> lock<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.750> take<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.170> safe<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
this lock and so if I take this safe and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.300 
this lock and so if I take this safe and
I<00:01:38.329> hit<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> ground<00:01:40.009> find<00:01:41.009> out<00:01:41.159> which

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I hit it on the ground find out which

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
I hit it on the ground find out which
way<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.899> latch<00:01:42.899> goes<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:44.869> pop<00:01:45.869> open<00:01:49.220> so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
way the latch goes here pop open so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
way the latch goes here pop open so
there<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.500> which

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
there you go you just have to know which

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.920 
there you go you just have to know which
way<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> latch<00:01:53.100> goes<00:01:53.399> which<00:01:54.329> way<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> springs

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
way the latch goes which way the springs

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.200 
way the latch goes which way the springs
are<00:01:55.320> mounted<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.670> open<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.969> safe

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
are mounted and you can open this safe

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420 
are mounted and you can open this safe
up
