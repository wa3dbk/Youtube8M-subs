00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
much better is in my opinion is the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.219 
much better is in my opinion is the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
it on there I don't know I might think

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.810 
it on there I don't know I might think
twice<00:05:36.770> about<00:05:36.889> it<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.400> griot

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
twice about it the griot

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.360 
twice about it the griot
is<00:05:38.000> completely<00:05:38.840> pH<00:05:39.169> neutral<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:39.979> that's<00:05:40.190> the

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
is completely pH neutral so that's the

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.029 
is completely pH neutral so that's the
next<00:05:40.490> video<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:42.110> be<00:05:42.260> sure<00:05:42.289> to<00:05:42.500> check<00:05:42.710> that<00:05:42.740> out
