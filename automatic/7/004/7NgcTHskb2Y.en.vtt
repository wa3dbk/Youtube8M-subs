00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
so this is one of those matches where me

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.940 
so this is one of those matches where me
and<00:00:03.149> my<00:00:03.300> buddy<00:00:03.570> Matt<00:00:03.780> joined<00:00:04.259> like<00:00:04.589> halfway

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
and my buddy Matt joined like halfway

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.190 
and my buddy Matt joined like halfway
through<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.430> first<00:00:05.640> round<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.210> things<00:00:07.080> were

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
through the first round and things were

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.530 
through the first round and things were
looking<00:00:07.230> bad<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:07.950> were<00:00:08.040> getting<00:00:08.250> dominated<00:00:08.540> we

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
looking bad we were getting dominated we

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.200 
looking bad we were getting dominated we
were<00:00:09.660> down<00:00:09.870> like<00:00:10.050> 90<00:00:10.410> points<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.059> try

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
were down like 90 points and so we try

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.690 
were down like 90 points and so we try
to<00:00:12.269> stage<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> comeback<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> end<00:00:14.190> we

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
to stage a comeback and in the end we

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.430 
to stage a comeback and in the end we
fail<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.389> throw<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.900> my<00:00:15.960> mouth<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> little

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
fail and I throw up in my mouth a little

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.990 
fail and I throw up in my mouth a little
bit<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> wanted<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> show<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.670> clip

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
bit but I wanted to show you this clip

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.330 
bit but I wanted to show you this clip
because<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> perfect<00:00:18.960> example<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.650> how

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
because it's a perfect example of how

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.460 
because it's a perfect example of how
one<00:00:20.699> player<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.090> hold<00:00:21.420> off<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.689> entire<00:00:22.020> team

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
one player can hold off an entire team

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.130 
one player can hold off an entire team
on<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.859> map<00:00:23.210> basically<00:00:24.210> at<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.600> point<00:00:24.689> I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
on this map basically at this point I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.259 
on this map basically at this point I
was<00:00:26.039> convinced<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.640> could<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:26.789> hold<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
was convinced if we could just hold the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
was convinced if we could just hold the
double<00:00:27.539> cap<00:00:27.720> until<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> game<00:00:28.199> ended<00:00:28.670> we<00:00:29.670> would

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
double cap until the game ended we would

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
double cap until the game ended we would
eat<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> super<00:00:31.050> close<00:00:31.199> win

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
eat out you know like a super close win

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.020 
eat out you know like a super close win
like<00:00:31.650> maybe<00:00:31.830> win<00:00:32.009> by<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.430> two<00:00:32.550> points<00:00:32.730> now

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
like maybe win by one or two points now

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.049 
like maybe win by one or two points now
of<00:00:33.120> course<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.600> was<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.680> off<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:35.489> math<00:00:35.700> is

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
of course I was way off my math is

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.540 
of course I was way off my math is
garbage<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.320> really<00:00:38.010> hard<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
garbage and it's really hard to do the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
garbage and it's really hard to do the
calculations<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.480> gunfighting<00:00:39.899> but

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
calculations all your gunfighting but

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.900 
calculations all your gunfighting but
this<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> tactic<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.550> whole<00:00:41.700> match

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
this is the tactic I use the whole match

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.080 
this is the tactic I use the whole match
and<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> put<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> 5k<00:00:44.090> d600

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and you know I put up like a 5k d600

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.700 
and you know I put up like a 5k d600
score<00:00:45.239> per<00:00:45.360> minute<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.200> make<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
score per minute and we make up like a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
score per minute and we make up like a
100<00:00:47.280> point<00:00:47.460> deficit<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.140> had<00:00:49.260> been

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
100 point deficit and if we had been

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080 
100 point deficit and if we had been
there<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> beginning<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> game<00:00:50.550> we

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
there from the beginning of the game we

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.150 
there from the beginning of the game we
wanted<00:00:51.390> won<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.570> easy<00:00:51.780> now<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.860> simple

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
wanted won it easy now it's simple

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.569 
wanted won it easy now it's simple
really

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
