00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
is of course a great score but

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.300 
is of course a great score but

with<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.040> benchmark<00:01:56.460> although

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
with this with this benchmark although

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.800 
with this with this benchmark although
it<00:01:57.509> also<00:01:57.750> seems<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.409> unable<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.070> compete

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
it also seems to be unable to compete

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.010 
it also seems to be unable to compete
with<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.110> new<00:02:01.880> quad-core<00:02:02.880> power<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.750> One

X<00:02:04.229> next<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.280> we're<00:02:05.880> gonna<00:02:06.890> test<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> handsets

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
X next up we're gonna test the handsets

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.410 
X next up we're gonna test the handsets
using<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.959> antutu<00:02:10.530> system<00:02:11.459> benchmark<00:02:12.209> this

kind of benchmarks the whole system as a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.780 
kind of benchmarks the whole system as a
whole<00:02:16.750> not<00:02:17.750> just<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.200> graphical<00:02:18.800> performance

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
whole not just the graphical performance

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.240 
whole not just the graphical performance
of<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.630> devices<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.770> I'll<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.250> launch<00:02:23.210> this

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
of the devices so I'll just launch this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.000 
of the devices so I'll just launch this
application<00:02:25.250> on<00:02:25.970> all<00:02:26.150> three<00:02:26.450> devices<00:02:30.010> and

application on all three devices and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.750 
application on all three devices and
again<00:02:31.370> I'm<00:02:31.550> starting<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.600> test<00:02:33.460> will<00:02:34.460> test

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
again I'm starting the test will test

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.170 
again I'm starting the test will test
everything<00:02:35.240> with<00:02:35.960> this<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:37.580> I'll<00:02:37.850> show<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
everything with this and I'll show you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.270 
everything with this and I'll show you
the<00:02:38.390> results<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.900> while

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
the results in a while

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.860 
the results in a while
and<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.670> have<00:02:40.910> our<00:02:41.090> results<00:02:41.600> from<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
and then we have our results from the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.590 
and then we have our results from the
antutu<00:02:42.350> benchmark<00:02:42.910> with<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.060> devastating

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
antutu benchmark with the devastating

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.990 
antutu benchmark with the devastating
Queen<00:02:45.080> we<00:02:45.350> have<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.690> HTC<00:02:47.690> One<00:02:47.960> X<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.440> it's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
Queen we have the HTC One X and it's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.300 
Queen we have the HTC One X and it's
incredible<00:02:50.000> result<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.690> eleven<00:02:51.590> thousand<00:02:52.100> and

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
incredible result of eleven thousand and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.980 
incredible result of eleven thousand and
twenty<00:02:52.700> four<00:02:52.880> points<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.690> great

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
twenty four points so it's a great

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.660 
twenty four points so it's a great
achievement<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.710> both<00:02:55.610> HTC<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.660> Nvidia<00:02:57.670> to

achievement for both HTC and Nvidia to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.410 
achievement for both HTC and Nvidia to
to<00:02:59.600> have<00:02:59.810> this<00:03:00.020> kind<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.770> performance<00:03:01.430> then<00:03:02.120> we

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
to have this kind of performance then we

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.660 
to have this kind of performance then we
have<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:03.020> second<00:03:03.350> place<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:03.770> have<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.250> Samsung

hundred and nine points still pretty

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.080 
hundred and nine points still pretty

eight<00:03:27.560> points<00:03:28.520> so<00:03:29.030> remember<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:30.320> are

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
eight points so remember that we are

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.160 
eight points so remember that we are
actually<00:03:30.650> testing<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:32.300> whole<00:03:32.510> system<00:03:32.960> with

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
actually testing the whole system with

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.050 
actually testing the whole system with
this<00:03:33.350> benchmark<00:03:33.740> who<00:03:34.130> were<00:03:34.310> testing<00:03:34.760> stuff

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
this benchmark who were testing stuff

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.650 
this benchmark who were testing stuff
like<00:03:35.330> RAM<00:03:35.990> performance<00:03:37.450> integer<00:03:38.450> and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
like RAM performance integer and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.570 
like RAM performance integer and
floating-point<00:03:39.470> operations

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
floating-point operations

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.630 
floating-point operations
2d<00:03:40.940> 3d<00:03:41.270> graphics<00:03:41.840> data<00:03:42.440> base<00:03:42.740> inputs<00:03:43.340> and

2d 3d graphics data base inputs and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.690 
2d 3d graphics data base inputs and
output<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:45.350> on<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:45.770> pretty<00:03:46.160> much<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.640> is

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
output and so on so pretty much this is

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.330 
output and so on so pretty much this is
this<00:03:47.150> should<00:03:47.420> reflect<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.560> performance<00:03:49.130> of

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
this should reflect the performance of

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.500 
this should reflect the performance of
the<00:03:49.610> whole<00:03:49.900> system<00:03:51.550> next<00:03:52.550> up<00:03:52.730> we're<00:03:53.300> actually

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the whole system next up we're actually

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.420 
the whole system next up we're actually
gonna<00:03:53.959> move<00:03:54.500> on<00:03:54.740> with<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:56.890> benchmark<00:03:57.890> test

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
gonna move on with a benchmark test

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.760 
gonna move on with a benchmark test
which<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.000> bit<00:03:59.330> more<00:03:59.360> graphically<00:04:00.170> oriented

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
which is a bit more graphically oriented

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.540 
which is a bit more graphically oriented
and<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.640> is<00:04:01.910> nano<00:04:02.209> mark<00:04:02.600> 2<00:04:06.100> here's<00:04:07.100> our<00:04:07.310> test

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
and this is nano mark 2 here's our test

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.850 
and this is nano mark 2 here's our test
and<00:04:07.760> again<00:04:08.060> I'm<00:04:08.360> running<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.990> on<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.500> three

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
and again I'm running it on all three

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.260 
and again I'm running it on all three
devices<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:11.630> will<00:04:12.140> come<00:04:12.410> back<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.800> a<00:04:12.920> while<00:04:13.270> so

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
devices and will come back in a while so

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.570 
devices and will come back in a while so
in<00:04:14.720> this<00:04:15.050> first<00:04:15.380> round<00:04:15.770> of<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.489> nano<00:04:17.120> mark<00:04:17.480> to

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
in this first round of the nano mark to

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.830 
in this first round of the nano mark to
benchmark<00:04:19.580> we<00:04:19.970> actually<00:04:20.299> have<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.540> very

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
benchmark we actually have a very

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.920 
benchmark we actually have a very
surprising<00:04:21.620> result

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
surprising result

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.059 
surprising result
first<00:04:23.650> here<00:04:24.189> ranked<00:04:24.849> the<00:04:25.060> Galaxy<00:04:25.780> s2<00:04:26.020> with<00:04:26.919> the

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:27.069 
first here ranked the Galaxy s2 with the

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.210 
first here ranked the Galaxy s2 with the

one more time just to make sure that
these<00:05:03.879> results<00:05:04.569> are<00:05:04.750> adequate<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:08.080> I'm<00:05:08.800> good

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
these results are adequate so I'm good

test once again and there we have our

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.269 
test once again and there we have our
new<00:05:15.490> results<00:05:16.060> again<00:05:16.960> this<00:05:17.199> time<00:05:17.469> we<00:05:17.650> have<00:05:17.860> the

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:18.279 
new results again this time we have the

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.140 
new results again this time we have the
galaxy<00:05:19.029> s2<00:05:19.419> win<00:05:19.930> or<00:05:20.439> with<00:05:20.800> an<00:05:20.979> average<00:05:21.159> FPS<00:05:21.580> of

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
galaxy s2 win or with an average FPS of

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.249 
galaxy s2 win or with an average FPS of
fifty-one<00:05:22.779> and<00:05:23.770> then<00:05:24.250> we<00:05:24.460> have<00:05:24.930> right<00:05:25.930> close

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
fifty-one and then we have right close

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.760 
fifty-one and then we have right close
behind<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:26.949> we<00:05:27.069> have<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.779> HTC<00:05:28.779> One<00:05:28.990> X<00:05:29.229> with

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
behind that we have the HTC One X with

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.430 
behind that we have the HTC One X with
an<00:05:29.919> average<00:05:30.069> FPS<00:05:30.490> of<00:05:31.120> forty<00:05:31.629> seven<00:05:31.960> point<00:05:32.169> four

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
an average FPS of forty seven point four

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.309 
an average FPS of forty seven point four
and<00:05:32.650> third<00:05:33.099> comes<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.789> galaxy<00:05:34.389> note<00:05:34.599> with<00:05:35.169> its

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
and third comes the galaxy note with its

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.140 
and third comes the galaxy note with its
result<00:05:36.159> of<00:05:36.460> forty<00:05:37.180> point<00:05:38.110> nine<00:05:38.440> average<00:05:39.370> FPS

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
result of forty point nine average FPS

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.930 
result of forty point nine average FPS
so<00:05:40.949> we<00:05:41.949> think<00:05:42.159> that<00:05:42.279> we<00:05:42.610> can<00:05:42.789> actually

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
so we think that we can actually

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.890 
so we think that we can actually
attribute<00:05:43.719> this<00:05:43.960> win<00:05:44.639> to<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.669> Galaxy<00:05:46.389> s2

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
attribute this win to the Galaxy s2

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.800 
attribute this win to the Galaxy s2
lower<00:05:47.529> resolution<00:05:48.250> display<00:05:48.699> we<00:05:49.569> should<00:05:49.719> not

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
lower resolution display we should not

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.180 
lower resolution display we should not
forget<00:05:49.930> it's<00:05:50.830> this<00:05:51.069> play<00:05:51.310> still<00:05:51.699> at<00:05:52.289> forty<00:05:53.289> 480

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
forget it's this play still at forty 480

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.860 
forget it's this play still at forty 480
by<00:05:54.789> 800<00:05:55.089> pixels<00:05:55.990> whereas<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:57.389> HTC<00:05:58.389> One<00:05:58.569> X<00:05:58.779> has

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
by 800 pixels whereas the HTC One X has

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.079 
by 800 pixels whereas the HTC One X has
an<00:05:59.110> HD<00:05:59.620> display<00:06:00.009> so<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.400> takes<00:06:00.669> a<00:06:00.879> lot<00:06:01.029> more

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.089 
an HD display so it takes a lot more

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.209 
an HD display so it takes a lot more
horsepower<00:06:01.539> to<00:06:02.379> achieve<00:06:02.680> such<00:06:02.889> a<00:06:02.919> great

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
horsepower to achieve such a great

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.899 
horsepower to achieve such a great
performance<00:06:03.940> here<00:06:04.389> with<00:06:05.349> this<00:06:05.560> type<00:06:05.860> of

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
performance here with this type of

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.320 
performance here with this type of
quality<00:06:06.909> display<00:06:07.889> so<00:06:08.889> this<00:06:09.729> was<00:06:09.879> a<00:06:09.909> quick

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
quality display so this was a quick

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.369 
quality display so this was a quick
benchmark<00:06:10.900> test<00:06:11.199> between<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.710> HTC<00:06:12.669> One<00:06:12.849> X

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 
benchmark test between the HTC One X

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.300 
benchmark test between the HTC One X

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
we saw with those tests which concerned

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.619 
we saw with those tests which concerned
the<00:06:22.599> whole<00:06:22.629> operation<00:06:23.469> of<00:06:23.589> the<00:06:23.740> system<00:06:24.629> the

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
HTC One X is a clear winner with its
