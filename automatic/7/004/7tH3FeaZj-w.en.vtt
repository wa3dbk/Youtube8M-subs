00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.010 

all<00:02:26.700> right<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.000> these<00:02:27.120> are<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.360> cars<00:02:27.570> i<00:02:27.720> use<00:02:27.870> i

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
all right so these are the cars i use i

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.410 
all right so these are the cars i use i
protect<00:02:28.710> item<00:02:29.130> protect<00:02:29.610> from<00:02:29.790> melee<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
protect item protect from melee and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.930 
protect item protect from melee and
piety<00:02:31.350> but<00:02:31.710> i<00:02:31.830> think<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.160> could<00:02:32.430> use<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
piety but i think you could use the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.330 
piety but i think you could use the
first<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.780> attack<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.290> strength<00:02:34.560> whereas<00:02:35.220> if

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
first to attack and strength whereas if

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:51.860 
first to attack and strength whereas if
you<00:02:35.490> don't<00:02:36.240> have<00:02:36.360> piety<00:02:50.030> I'd<00:02:51.030> rest<00:02:51.360> until<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you don't have piety I'd rest until you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.910 
you don't have piety I'd rest until you
had<00:02:52.020> about<00:02:52.640> 40<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.850> 50<00:02:54.030> run<00:02:54.930> energy<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.590> can

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
had about 40 to 50 run energy so you can

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.650 
had about 40 to 50 run energy so you can
avoid<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.240> fight<00:02:57.450> or<00:02:57.660> tax<00:02:57.840> at<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.110> beginning

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
avoid the fight or tax at the beginning

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.820 
avoid the fight or tax at the beginning

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
will hit you for a thousand which is

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.360 
will hit you for a thousand which is
fine<00:04:24.280> right<00:04:24.310> now<00:04:25.350> but<00:04:26.350> later<00:04:26.800> on<00:04:26.979> it's<00:04:27.250> gonna

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
fine right now but later on it's gonna

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.189 
fine right now but later on it's gonna
be<00:04:28.199> we're<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.350> third<00:04:29.770> wave<00:04:30.250> or<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:31.810> guess<00:04:32.050> it's

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
be we're the third wave or I guess it's

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.469 
be we're the third wave or I guess it's
the<00:04:32.290> third<00:04:32.470> time<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.800> go<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:32.979> Kelvin<00:04:33.479> you're

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
the third time you go to Kelvin you're

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.610 
the third time you go to Kelvin you're
going<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.660> want<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.840> turn<00:04:35.050> on<00:04:35.139> protect<00:04:35.470> from

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
going to want to turn on protect from

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.870 
going to want to turn on protect from
magic<00:04:35.949> because<00:04:36.100> that's<00:04:36.250> when<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.460> grot<00:04:36.699> ones

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
magic because that's when the grot ones

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.770 
magic because that's when the grot ones
are<00:04:37.060> going<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.240> start<00:04:37.389> actually<00:04:37.600> hurting<00:04:38.050> me

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
are going to start actually hurting me

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.939 
are going to start actually hurting me
or<00:04:40.780> if<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.169> want<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.380> kill<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.620> grotto<00:04:41.830> arms

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
or if you want to kill the grotto arms

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.800 
or if you want to kill the grotto arms
you<00:04:42.160> can<00:04:42.190> but<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:42.970> wouldn't<00:04:43.300> recommend<00:04:43.330> it

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
you can but I wouldn't recommend it

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.070 
you can but I wouldn't recommend it
using<00:04:44.139> this<00:04:44.260> method<00:04:44.680> just<00:04:44.889> because<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:46.720> takes

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
using this method just because it takes

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.240 
using this method just because it takes
a<00:04:47.289> little<00:04:47.729> longer<00:04:48.729> than<00:04:49.320> really<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.350> crafty<00:04:51.220> one

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
a little longer than really a crafty one

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.400 
a little longer than really a crafty one
it<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.789> try<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.000> lay<00:04:52.210> out<00:04:52.419> enough<00:04:53.020> damage

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
it I just try to lay out enough damage

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.350 
it I just try to lay out enough damage
to<00:04:53.590> kill<00:04:53.770> anymore<00:04:56.789> this<00:04:57.789> is<00:04:57.910> pretty<00:04:58.180> easy

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
to kill anymore this is pretty easy

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.420 
to kill anymore this is pretty easy
something<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.139> you<00:04:59.289> look<00:04:59.500> inside<00:04:59.830> little<00:05:00.190> drop

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
form and kill the other one now if you

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
do get in that situation where you can

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.450 
do get in that situation where you can

hit the thing or kill that or kill the
tortured<00:05:06.850> soul<00:05:07.030> I'd<00:05:07.270> hit<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.660> lever<00:05:08.760> just

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
tortured soul I'd hit the lever just

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.719 
tortured soul I'd hit the lever just
because<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:11.740> grot<00:05:12.039> ones<00:05:12.250> are<00:05:12.430> going<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.610> deal

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
because the grot ones are going to deal

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.050 
because the grot ones are going to deal
more<00:05:12.910> damage<00:05:14.250> now<00:05:15.250> right<00:05:15.490> here<00:05:15.700> that's<00:05:15.910> the

more damage now right here that's the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.210 
more damage now right here that's the
most<00:05:16.479> important<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.260> probably<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:17.889> hardest

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
most important and probably the hardest

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.580 
most important and probably the hardest
part<00:05:18.539> when<00:05:19.539> it<00:05:19.660> comes<00:05:19.870> up<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.169> says<00:05:20.320> she's

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
part when it comes up and says she's

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.890 
part when it comes up and says she's
breathing<00:05:21.070> in<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.430> fire<00:05:21.639> or<00:05:22.300> breathing<00:05:22.599> to<00:05:22.780> do

breathing in the fire or breathing to do
a<00:05:22.930> powerful<00:05:23.260> attack<00:05:23.650> you're<00:05:24.610> gonna<00:05:24.789> want<00:05:25.090> to

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
a powerful attack you're gonna want to

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.020 
a powerful attack you're gonna want to
put<00:05:25.870> on<00:05:26.740> your<00:05:26.889> anti<00:05:27.130> fire<00:05:27.310> shield<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.760> get<00:05:27.880> out

put on your anti fire shield and get out
of<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.210> center<00:05:28.539> because<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:29.050> will<00:05:29.260> hurt<00:05:33.090> when

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
of the center because it will hurt when

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.890 
of the center because it will hurt when
at<00:05:34.660> in<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.169> last<00:05:35.380> wave<00:05:35.800> when<00:05:36.250> she<00:05:36.639> some<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.750> the

captive souls stay above five thousand

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.510 
captive souls stay above five thousand
health<00:05:41.380> because<00:05:41.680> I've<00:05:41.800> never<00:05:42.010> been<00:05:42.190> able<00:05:42.340> to

health because I've never been able to

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.969 
health because I've never been able to
dodge<00:05:42.700> it<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.870> do<00:05:43.930> despite<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.410> lot<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:44.919> I

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
dodge it and I do despite a lot so I

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.290 
dodge it and I do despite a lot so I
don't<00:05:45.190> I'm<00:05:45.460> sure<00:05:45.729> there's<00:05:45.910> people<00:05:46.030> out<00:05:46.270> there

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
that can but just to be safe I'd be

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.450 
that can but just to be safe I'd be
about<00:05:49.060> five<00:05:49.270> thousand<00:05:49.630> health<00:05:50.610> now<00:05:52.740> also<00:05:53.740> the

about five thousand health now also the
captive<00:05:54.820> souls<00:05:55.000> will<00:05:55.180> teleport<00:05:55.419> to<00:05:55.720> the
