00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.840
 with samsung galaxy s 4 for one more 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 video of the basics that's right we go there with 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.639
 a device we will now 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.100
 movements and gestures 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.140
 I already made a video of itself movements and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 gestures are we have three options here 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.750
 we only have many options within these 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.400
 options is gesture is what has the gesture 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.470
 controls your device by doing 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.140
 movements with your hand over the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.719
 sensor of this sensor here which has 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 blinking beyond movement 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350
 control your device with movements 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.300
 such as placing the device in the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 ear to call a contact 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.290
 directly you have a contact until the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 When you put it, I did not see it. 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.690
 link to it the movement with the palm 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.329
 hand will not turn off not even rhymed 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 control of the device by touching the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.070
 with the palm of the hand we aegis tri is not 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.940
 jeff green 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.750
 We have here. Let's do it here. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.470
 she sees he says he is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.619
 positioned up such he will he would 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.820
 that have a little hand that also up 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.710
 when the skin is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.299
 off if you lose 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.720
 to view important information and 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.280
 Here he puts the time you and that is more 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.040
 the time to date and the air if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 then go to the screen suspended change 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.770
 is rolling email message and heels 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.049
 screen size 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 Okay, so he 's reading and he's going to mail it. 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.650
 jump 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.450
 I do not know if there is a movement like this if not 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 I'm wrong, he jumps to the next. 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.340
 suspended navigation page move between 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 photos pages with music tracks you 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 You can do this, here he will do. 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.970
 a movement for both the photo and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 The song you're talking about for the photo. 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.020
 I already came to the music, I do not remember if he 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.119
 does this move move move 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.040
 shortcuts move applications shortcuts 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.310
 events from full to pages 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.680
 different you you you make one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.049
 he thinks that movement does not 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.280
 I know if it's this way or that way, I do not 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.990
 I remember personal right or else it's jeffri 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.430
 I do not remember, I remember that I had a 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.310
 a certain movement that we did the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.590
 last seen the icons but this one in the US 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.540
 I think this is not the case here. 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.030
 to answer incoming calls 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.950
 You can learn by making a gesture here. 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.380
 in front there is only one way you can do 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.680
 a gesture in front of the device you 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.360
 Meet him through rg3 Saturday know 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.050
 more about the sensor icon here 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 sensor icon is rest then this 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.070
 here is very nice I've already tested and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.210
 both with 11 with suspended execution 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.130
 when the movement 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.110
 it works great with both the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.930
 eye movement we will also see with 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.810
 control your device called Direct 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.670
 call contacts displayed on the alert screen 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.940
 smart pick up calls messages 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.250
 lost by movement 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.370
 the zoom applied to the screen when 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.230
 gallery you do it so leaning and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.390
 so does he then zoom in but the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.210
 Sandro has to play twice with two 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.010
 fingers well to make use explore one 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.260
 image one for example an image 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.940
 pan is an image 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.860
 ok mute extended pause silence is 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.590
 calls received paulo the sounds 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.490
 when the screen is active 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.260
 understood then you can hear it here 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.340
 Catch you come here you 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.580
 telephone 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.860
 so this is a moving part of it 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.160
 this part works well apart from the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.840
 skol with eyes it works more 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.550
 or less until you get the hang of it 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.680
 takes a little bit but then and 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.860
 way it works right the part of 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.410
 eye movement you with you 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.030
 eye control is in motion 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:06.600
 with palm movement capture 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.490
 screen captures screen by wiping it 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.730
 right to left and vice versa with the 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.390
 side of death รณ you turn it on and off 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.940
 this motion mute pause 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.600
 silenced positions covering the screen you 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.660
 snakes screens and mute the sound is also the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.050
 it's different from the other you go down here and 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.220
 if you put it in front 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.900
 Silence too, so these are not 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
 very cool options in movements and 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.979
 20th hand gestures with the palm of the hand 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.310
 to control this device he 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:42.639
 works fine as I arrived 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.280
 here even smart was smart is the 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.800
 who uses intelligent eyes suspension 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.270
 until it stays on while you 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.889
 Look at her this is also a resource 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.590
 very nice that samsung is adopting 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.990
 for her latest devices 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.469
 smart voting the gl screen according to 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.610
 the orientation of your face is there 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:05.169
 back like this if I do so geek 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.280
 How can you turn around if I do? 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.389
 so or so and you have triggered this 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.770
 option here 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:17.229
 Until then she does not turn she did not 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.789
 she had worked so would not 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.060
 that if I had a busy head 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.860
 John, you're the smart one. 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.560
 watching a video is you turned the face 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.629
 and so did my face and in the new strength 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.479
 and turned the face he paulo when you 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:34.569
 look again at the device 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.550
 it continues with the video scrolling 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.710
 clever here is what I told you 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.840
 you are browsing the web 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.469
 internet and just make my face back here 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.279
 He spoke so ah yes it goes up and down rises 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:50.620
 and the screen goes down from your browser already 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.690
 I did this test also works but it takes 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.029
 a time for you to get used to 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.219
 smart works perfect or wheels 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:59.860
 smart works perfect suspension 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.750
 smart also works a lot 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.879
 perfect only problem I had was 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.120
 with this screen scroll that led to a 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:09.550
 some time to get used to you doing 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.550
 Right there, some people. 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.210
 so I explained movements and gestures and 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.560
 screen display suspense is that 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.319
 I'll explain in the next video 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.060
 suspended execution and control control 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.069
 by voice personal touch then this is it 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.710
 Did you like the ladybug leave the message? 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.710
 Thank you and even more people spoke
