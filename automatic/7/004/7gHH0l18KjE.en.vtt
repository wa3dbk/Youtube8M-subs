enough to be part of this attack but i

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.570 
enough to be part of this attack but i
don't<00:06:05.000> think<00:06:05.300> they<00:06:05.539> are<00:06:06.129> they're<00:06:07.129> going<00:06:07.460> to

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
don't think they are they're going to

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.999 
don't think they are they're going to
have<00:06:07.759> to<00:06:07.939> be<00:06:08.060> part<00:06:08.360> of<00:06:09.189> some<00:06:10.189> other<00:06:10.370> attack

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
have to be part of some other attack

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.070 
have to be part of some other attack
yeah<00:06:13.009> remember<00:06:13.789> when<00:06:13.969> I<00:06:14.060> said<00:06:14.210> roads<00:06:14.870> are

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
yeah remember when I said roads are

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.879 
yeah remember when I said roads are
important<00:06:15.500> well<00:06:16.159> I<00:06:16.750> guess<00:06:17.750> if<00:06:18.050> you're<00:06:18.469> an

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
important well I guess if you're an

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.839 
important well I guess if you're an
enemy<00:06:19.189> civilization<00:06:20.060> which<00:06:20.479> has<00:06:21.339> cities<00:06:22.339> that

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
enemy civilization which has cities that

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.900 
enemy civilization which has cities that
are<00:06:23.060> placed<00:06:23.839> far<00:06:24.110> apart<00:06:24.469> it's<00:06:25.279> a<00:06:25.430> good<00:06:25.580> idea<00:06:25.729> to

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
are placed far apart it's a good idea to

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.360 
are placed far apart it's a good idea to
have<00:06:27.030> your<00:06:27.330> roads<00:06:28.100> be<00:06:30.410> crappy<00:06:31.410> because<00:06:32.190> it's

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
have your roads be crappy because it's

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.240 
have your roads be crappy because it's
really<00:06:32.490> slowed<00:06:32.850> us<00:06:33.030> up<00:06:33.150> so<00:06:33.360> far<00:06:34.070> yeah<00:06:35.070> the

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
really slowed us up so far yeah the

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.880 
really slowed us up so far yeah the
Germans<00:06:35.640> crappy<00:06:36.060> road<00:06:36.240> system<00:06:36.660> has<00:06:36.930> hurt<00:06:37.260> us<00:06:37.440> a

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
Germans crappy road system has hurt us a

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.180 
Germans crappy road system has hurt us a
lot<00:06:38.070> more<00:06:38.370> than<00:06:38.430> it's<00:06:38.760> helped<00:06:39.120> them<00:06:39.920> so<00:06:40.920> I

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
lot more than it's helped them so I

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.420 
lot more than it's helped them so I
guess<00:06:44.660> if<00:06:45.660> you're<00:06:45.840> playing<00:06:45.990> defensively<00:06:46.500> it's

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
guess if you're playing defensively it's

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.300 
guess if you're playing defensively it's
not<00:06:47.610> that<00:06:47.880> important<00:06:48.240> to<00:06:48.360> have<00:06:48.510> a<00:06:49.160> great<00:06:50.160> road

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
not that important to have a great road

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.550 
not that important to have a great road
system<00:06:50.700> but<00:06:51.450> then<00:06:51.600> again<00:06:51.720> if<00:06:52.290> you're<00:06:52.410> playing

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
system but then again if you're playing

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.820 
system but then again if you're playing
defensively<00:06:53.130> chances<00:06:54.090> are<00:06:54.300> you<00:06:55.200> you're<00:06:55.800> not

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
defensively chances are you you're not

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.760 
defensively chances are you you're not
playing<00:06:56.250> that<00:06:56.370> well<00:06:56.700> and<00:06:56.940> you're<00:06:57.060> not<00:06:57.210> winning

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
playing that well and you're not winning

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.110 
playing that well and you're not winning
well<00:06:58.770> I<00:06:58.800> shouldn't<00:06:59.130> say<00:06:59.220> that<00:06:59.550> we've<00:06:59.880> had

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
well I shouldn't say that we've had

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.970 
well I shouldn't say that we've had
we've<00:07:00.540> all<00:07:00.720> had<00:07:00.870> to<00:07:01.050> play<00:07:01.230> defensively<00:07:01.740> once

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
we've all had to play defensively once

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.680 
we've all had to play defensively once
in<00:07:02.130> a<00:07:02.190> while<00:07:02.370> but<00:07:02.700> um<00:07:03.770> hopefully<00:07:05.510> you'll<00:07:06.510> be

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
in a while but um hopefully you'll be

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.970 
in a while but um hopefully you'll be
able<00:07:06.810> to<00:07:07.080> turn<00:07:07.230> the<00:07:07.410> tide<00:07:07.560> around<00:07:08.930> yes<00:07:09.980> because

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
able to turn the tide around yes because

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.650 
able to turn the tide around yes because

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
if you remember there was a point in

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.100

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
which both the Germans and the cells

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.830 
which both the Germans and the cells
were<00:07:16.410> larger<00:07:16.830> than<00:07:16.860> us<00:07:17.450> whoops<00:07:18.450> from<00:07:18.660> the

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
were larger than us whoops from the

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.810 
were larger than us whoops from the
screen<00:07:19.110> yes<00:07:20.040> I<00:07:20.190> forgot<00:07:20.430> to<00:07:20.520> tell<00:07:20.610> you<00:07:20.670> about

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
screen yes I forgot to tell you about

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.660

that<00:07:20.910> command<00:07:21.360> you<00:07:21.600> can<00:07:21.780> actually<00:07:22.020> send<00:07:22.740> your

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670 
that command you can actually send your

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.030 
that command you can actually send your
ships<00:07:24.150> to<00:07:24.720> a<00:07:25.110> city<00:07:27.470> alright<00:07:28.470> and<00:07:28.830> if<00:07:28.950> you

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040

notice our southern force is gone I

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.250 
notice our southern force is gone I
thought<00:07:32.700> that<00:07:33.000> they<00:07:33.690> should<00:07:33.840> go<00:07:33.990> out<00:07:34.110> with<00:07:34.230> a

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.260 
thought that they should go out with a

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.270 
thought that they should go out with a
bang<00:07:34.470> and<00:07:34.860> they<00:07:35.220> did<00:07:35.400> and<00:07:35.730> they're<00:07:36.480> gone<00:07:37.280> well

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
bang and they did and they're gone well

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.750 
bang and they did and they're gone well
that<00:07:39.210> just<00:07:39.240> makes<00:07:40.220> all<00:07:41.220> of<00:07:41.280> our<00:07:41.730> other
