00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
disappointed by that because judging

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.310

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
from the trailer I was like yeah this is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
from the trailer I was like yeah this is
totally<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.160> looking<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.579> some<00:01:02.760> hunt

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
totally like it's looking like some hunt

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
totally like it's looking like some hunt
the<00:01:03.090> hunt<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> 2011<00:01:03.899> type<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.170> animation<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the hunt to 2011 type of animation and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
the hunt to 2011 type of animation and
art<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:06.060> kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.450> didn't<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> which

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
art and we kind of didn't get that which

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.469 
art and we kind of didn't get that which
is<00:01:07.320> unfortunate<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.430> nonetheless<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:09.210> least

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
is unfortunate but nonetheless at least

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
is unfortunate but nonetheless at least
it's<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> most<00:01:10.590> part<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.920> par<00:01:11.189> what<00:01:11.460> fairy

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's for the most part on par what fairy

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's for the most part on par what fairy
tale<00:01:11.939> used<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> old

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
tale used to be when we had the old

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.260 
tale used to be when we had the old
anime<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> last<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.700> episodes<00:01:15.119> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
anime back for the last two episodes so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
anime back for the last two episodes so
it's<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.570> entirely<00:01:16.380> bad<00:01:16.770> now<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.250> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it's not entirely bad now with this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
it's not entirely bad now with this

now<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> remember<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> manga<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.299> I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
now I remember this in the manga and I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.940 
now I remember this in the manga and I
feel<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.049> though<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.259> debate<00:01:49.590> comes<00:01:49.770> up

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
feel as though this debate comes up

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.530 
feel as though this debate comes up
again<00:01:50.189> we're<00:01:50.340> pretty<00:01:50.490> much<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.970> Fairy<00:01:51.270> Tail

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
again we're pretty much that Fairy Tail

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.420 
again we're pretty much that Fairy Tail
is<00:01:51.780> treating<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> end<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.100> day<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
is treating at the end of the day I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.310 
is treating at the end of the day I
think<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.750> cheating<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> know

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
think even if they are cheating you know

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.600 
think even if they are cheating you know
it's<00:01:55.590> okay<00:01:55.860> whatever<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.250> against<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
it's okay whatever it's against the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.959 
it's okay whatever it's against the
rules

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
rules

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.700 
rules
that<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.780> fairy<00:01:58.020> tale<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.469> they

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
don't give a fuck and that's I think one

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760
