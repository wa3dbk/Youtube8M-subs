00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.240
 Ukraine and the EU discussed a joint future 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.690
 put forward his range of Brussels conditions at that 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.580
 same time declares readiness 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.209
 substitute the particular shoulder such 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.360
 painful for the Ukrainian side 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.959
 the issue of how gas talks with Moscow 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.919
 analysts are sure if by chance 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.689
 the eve of the summit alienated gas 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:17.240
 aspect 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.150
 signals of the banks of the Dnieper 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.100
 Seven billion Gazprom seems not 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.089
 will be 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.050
 yak seem trumpet 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.539
 we refused to pay penalties and 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.400
 We are negotiating a contract 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.869
 which we have for gas supply 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.449
 unfair in terms of price so 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.160
 and in terms of penalties in 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.829
 700 percent for gas shortage 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.460
 from the point of view of transportation 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.990
 on the territory of Ukraine 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.690
 the main result of today's meeting 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.530
 became a kind of roadmap 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.830
 which will allow Ukraine in November 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.730
 sign an associate agreement 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.660
 membership and free trade area with 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.340
 eu 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.640
 but there is a European barrel of honey and a spoon 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 tar on the eve of the summit president 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.590
 Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy and 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.780
 European Commission President Jose 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.130
 Manuel Barroso did the last 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.140
 Chinese warning Kiev 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.190
 should reform and collapse 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.680
 politically motivated by 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.320
 Brussels opinion litigations 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.150
 against opposition leaders 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730
 Ukraine in turn make 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.370
 European side curtsy 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.780
 partners Supreme Council all the same opened 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.020
 second session of the seventh convocation one 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.640
 from the first documents adopted by parliament 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 became a statement of implementation 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.470
 Euro-integration aspirations of the country 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.090
 parliament voted in 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.040
 the document that we have adopted is contained 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.290
 Cyprus Calling Union will provide visa-free 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.180
 regime for ukrainians and also sign 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.750
 association and zone agreement 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 free trade 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.040
 observers immediately declared this step 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.149
 more alienates Ukraine from Russia 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.739
 and as a consequence the retreat in 

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:43.850
 Customs Union 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.360
 And the looming prospect 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090
 visa-free regime became apparent 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.980
 irritant for Moscow 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.650
 but it's been a long time 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.650
 but I am convinced we are ready for a visa-free regime 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 short trips of citizens with us 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.210
 have agreed 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.270
 list of joint steps along with 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 European Commission when all these foci will be 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.210
 implemented injuries will move on to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.149
 visa-free regime 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.279
 however, analysts point out problems in 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.149
 Ukraine’s relations and it’s by no means 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.389
 comes down only to judicial 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:14.899
 prosecution position 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.589
 and gas conflict with Russia we are talking about 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.879
 persistent rejection in the ranks of the EU expanded 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.699
 organizations at the expense of Soviet 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:22.579
 of states 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.939
 however western analysts 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.849
 warn similar approach carries 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.699
 in itself serious risks for himself 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.449
 EU because it can contribute 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.819
 offset political 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.430
 vector of Ukraine towards more 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.930
 active participation in integration 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.719
 the processes of the post Soviet 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.159
 space primarily involving 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.989
 Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.670
