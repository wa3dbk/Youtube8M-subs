00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.790
 that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.330
 Let's talk with Ana clara clarasceno. 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.970
 who is a student of the first period of the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.500
 course of advertising and propaganda 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.050
 Of course, how are you? 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.140
 got ready for the college entrance examination 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.540
 I studied a lot of physical and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.880
 chemistry I had more difficulty 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.280
 so in the first half I caught 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.770
 quite heavy so physical math 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.380
 and chemistry and in the second to wood ideas 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 second pink light ana hint you give 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.070
 for those who will be taking a university entrance examination 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.009
 advertising course 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.380
 much more than this gives at least 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.470
 The one that helped me the most was the same calm. 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 have to prepare more to stay more 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.440
 Calm down for a world to wait on time. 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.450
 because this is what is the most 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.550
 important today one of the things that is 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.130
 It is necessary for the person to read 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.690
 and this reading she needs is 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.360
 understand several areas because the 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.739
 the field of communication as one of the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.019
 area of ​​human 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.750
 he intends that the student has a 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.880
 more human understanding of the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.120
 process of life the narration of the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.640
 of the writing of the vestibular is a 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.400
 process that allows more freedom 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.690
 creative than the dissertation than the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.450
 letter then the narration is a one space 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.840
 for a student who has facilities 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.160
 Creative better express the people 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.950
 it is said that the student of 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.070
 He is a student and he is very 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.049
 creative is actually in my classes 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.450
 When I work with processes 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.530
 creative I usually say that we all 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.570
 we are creative 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.790
 The fact that you do not think you are creative does not 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.400
 means that you are not the processes 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.360
 can be developed 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.360
 creativity 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.730
 For you, what are you going to do? 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.250
 What brings the Portuguese tips on abc 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.150

 the 11 th pronominal placement themselves and 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.470
 But the crisis and the crisis 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.260
 The prosthesis is when the pronoun is in the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.130
 front of the verb but first you must have a 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.560
 word as not that or now by 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.040
 example, do not forget our 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.130
 commitment or she is the only one who 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.169
 has signed the contract 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.200
 The only crisis table is used to express 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.560
 a future action and the pronoun is placed 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.870
 in the middle of the verb for example perform 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.030
 there will be a conference tomorrow 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.700
 already the imply occurs when the verb 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.440
 expresses an interactive action or when 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.410
 you are in the gerund 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.000
 in this case the pronoun is after the verb 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.690
 for example 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.430
 move to jade places or else 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.040
