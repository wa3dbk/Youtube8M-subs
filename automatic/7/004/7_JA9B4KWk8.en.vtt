00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.309
 pixar animation studios a name that 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.099
 it resonates in our minds as moments 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.800
 of joy and happiness made us laugh 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.349
 laughter and made us cry in spades 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.160
 that brought us animated films so 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:31.270
 exalts like toy story bugs monsters 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.309
 inc looking for nemo and so many more 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.290
 pixar we have an immense affection for 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.809
 the simple fact of being there in our 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.940
 childhood and being in the moments that most 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.590
 we need 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.570
 pixar is now an institution in 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.730
 As far as digital animation is concerned 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.220
 by hong the basis for a new 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.829
 generation of animated films that 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.160
 little by little as technology advances they go 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.370
 improving to exorbitant levels what 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.010
 would happen if I told you that none of this 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.230
 it could have happened 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.600
 as the co-founder of pixar tells us 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:10.920
 ed catmull in his book creativity inc 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 in the winter of 1998 to almost a year from 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.780
 premiere of toy story 2 the second 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.420
 delivery of the saga of toy story and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.200
 third pixar movie was about 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.140
 of being completely lost in oblivion 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.490
 and tells us that he was working 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.850
 with his team in the movie 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.500
 quietly everything was fine until 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.590
 he noticed something that he was bleeding 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 complete first saw as the hat of 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.829
 woody the cowboy then disappeared his 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.600
 boots then his vest at the end 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.770
 disappeared wood and completely from the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 scene 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.700
 some distracted who never names in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.009
 your book accidentally or rather 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.590
 causally he wrote this simple command 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.829
 whose job was to erase and eliminate everything 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.130
 in an efficient and fast way and go 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.950
 who did his job well 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.750
 when he realized this he took the phone 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.030
 and he called the server room where 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.410
 was happening the event asked them 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.150
 to disconnect the plug from 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.880
 server where the movie was 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.120
 as quickly as possible those who were 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.519
 there they asked with more reason because 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.640
 I wanted to disconnect it after all 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.110
 it was a reasonable question he 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.989
 he shouted with all his might for the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.240
 phone for god's sake 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.090
 disconnect it as quickly as possible 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.560
 for when they did it was too much 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.600
 late 90% of the movie work 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.850
 of years of a team of more than 30 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.440
 people working without rest 24 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.950
 hours a day, 7 days a week 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.650
 he completely lost 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.300
 and to top it all the blessed discs of 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.260
 backup failed when more 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.019
 they needed there was no turning back 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.110
 and even then if they started again and 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.659
 the film worked tirelessly 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.909
 it was only one year from its release and the 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.909
 time was not even remotely enough 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.470
 pixel in those years immediately 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.080
 had disappeared since it was a 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.300
 small and growing company will help 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.910
 economically by its investors and the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.010
 gains of the movies would have been 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.480
 crushed like an ant by the huge 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.599
 and like the shoe of bankruptcy 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.069
 you will wonder how pixar follows 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.230
 I live in these moments as he survived 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.139
 pixar was saved by a very miracle 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.930
 unexpected almost as miraculous as in 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.750
 the movies that they made 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.659
 grayling sussman was the director of 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.879
 technical supervision in pixar and she 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.069
 after the birth of his second 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.659
 son had to work at home almost 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.730
 most of the time taking care of their 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.819
 children and as I already worked directly 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.099
 also with toy story 2 to the count of 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.170
 every week without fail he was already taking his 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.299
 house an entire copy of the movie 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.969
 to work on her at home while 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.129
 she looked after her children she tells us that 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:12.040
 when he heard the news he took his 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.560
 computer and the backup files and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.690
 he wrapped them in cars and dragons and in 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.489
 his words led him like a pharaoh 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.070
 Egyptian in his car to the barracks 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.190
 of pixar being received as a hero 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.590
 since it was not only the salvation of the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.529
 movie but it was from the company 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.549
 complete 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:34.600
 that's how pixar almost died and how 

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:37.300
 suddenly revived 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.760
 my name is Alberto Sanchez and this is 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.760
 the vortex of terror until then
