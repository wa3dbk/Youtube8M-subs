 Gamers Review: Lords of the Fallen 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
 You are a warrior named Harkyn, and due to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.820
 to sins committed in the past, you have been arrested. More time to redeem in front 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 of mankind has arrived, since only you can defeat an evil God who wishes to end 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.930
 with the world. This is the story of a new RPG game 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.480
 of action, where only the best warriors are worthy of the greatest rewards. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.630
 It's Lords of the Fallen. 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.170
 Since its announcement, it was a title that was compared to the number of Dark Souls for 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.660
 his style of struggle and high degree of difficulty. And after playing it, we can say that they 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.820
 were not wrong, and at all times you will be compared in every detail. 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.019
 Just as inevitable since it is the same formula. 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.439
 Accounts with different combat styles, which are based on the principles of the genre, 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.189
 such as black magic, stealth, and white magic. Although, in fact, you will fight against 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.849
 most of the time with your sword using the right trigger while you defend yourself 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:27.590
 with his shield with the left trigger. Every action you take, it will consume your 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.659
 stamina bar, so you should calculate your shots well. 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.889
 If you end up exhausted, you'll be an easy target for enemies that will kill you 

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:43.889
 with some punches. As if that were not enough, his character movements were slow 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.179
 made to increase the difficulty. 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.380
 You gain experience by defeating all enemies, with which you can improve 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.709
 your skills and upload level. But to die, you lose what you have accumulated, 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:11.540
 and needs to get back to his corpse to retrieve them. Does that sound like? U.S. too. 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.719
 While you are here, you will experience multipliers the longer you keep it 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:23.099
 live, but will reset once per checkpoint touches. So if you 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.170
 want to have a lot of experience, will better watch your step. 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.909
 Battles against bosses are very challenging, but it's just a matter of watching your 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.310
 movement patterns to attack at the right moment. 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.310
 Lords of the Fallen, is an attempt to use the successful and addictive formula of the series 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:54.969
 Souls, but ends up being a generic experience, especially if you played such titles. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.909
 It can be completed in a little over 12 hours, and meets the terms, motivated 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.079
 not to return to play. In addition, although the armor project 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.200
 and some scenes are well designed, it features many technical glitches, with objects appearing 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.200
 of nothingness and errors in the physics of the characters. The camera begins to interfere with 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.659
 closed and artificial intelligence is also inconsistent. 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.319
 You can easily get lost in the scenarios for lack of map, and even in history 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.409
 for not having mission list. And although they are details we also saw 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:41.409
 in the Souls series, here become frustrating and do not produce the same feeling. He just 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.340
 ends up feeling like a workout for other games. 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.340
 I am Alexandra Vicencio, and for this occasion I think I will leave aside the dark worlds, 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:03.079
 for something more tranquil.
