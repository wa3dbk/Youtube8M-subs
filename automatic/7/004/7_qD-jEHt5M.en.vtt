little bit of pizzazz to the images

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.200 
little bit of pizzazz to the images
themselves<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:46.010> this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.280> new<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.579> Joomla

themselves and this is new in Joomla

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
themselves and this is new in Joomla
because<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.050> version<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.649> Joomla<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.100> built

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
because this version of Joomla is built

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
because this version of Joomla is built
with<00:00:50.640> bootstrap<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.020> template

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
with bootstrap and because this template

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.560 
with bootstrap and because this template
is<00:00:52.559> integrating<00:00:53.280> bootstrap<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.059> part<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> its

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
design we can leverage any of bootstraps

design we can leverage any of bootstraps
classes<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.789> are<00:01:00.149> contained<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.079> provided

classes that are contained and provided

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
classes that are contained and provided
that<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.309> apply<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.670> class<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> way<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that we apply that class and the way the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
that we apply that class and the way the
bootstrap<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> expecting<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:06.000> apply

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
bootstrap is expecting we can apply

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.600 
bootstrap is expecting we can apply
those<00:01:06.510> styles<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> our<00:01:07.229> web<00:01:07.380> pages<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
those styles to our web pages one of the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310 
those styles to our web pages one of the
most<00:01:08.790> striking<00:01:09.060> ways<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.110> this

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
most striking ways that we can do this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
most striking ways that we can do this
is<00:01:10.560> where<00:01:10.890> our<00:01:10.920> images<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.850> concerned<00:01:12.030> so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
is where our images are concerned so

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560 
is where our images are concerned so
right<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:13.260> these<00:01:13.409> images<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.939> square

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
right now these images are just square

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
right now these images are just square
images<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.320> come<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.009> out

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
images that have come right out and out

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
images that have come right out and out
of<00:01:17.250> photoshop<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> they're<00:01:18.090> appearing<00:01:18.540> here

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
of photoshop and they're appearing here

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.980 
of photoshop and they're appearing here
in<00:01:18.930> our<00:01:19.080> web<00:01:19.320> page<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.369> bootstrap<00:01:21.000> has<00:01:21.030> three

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
in our web page but bootstrap has three

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.219 
in our web page but bootstrap has three
different<00:01:22.380> ways<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.950> style<00:01:23.280> images<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
different ways you can style images and

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.330 
different ways you can style images and
that<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> bootstrap<00:01:26.130> documentation

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that is in the bootstrap documentation

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.590 
that is in the bootstrap documentation
so<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:28.500> bootstrap<00:01:29.250> com<00:01:29.820> you'll

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
so if you go to get bootstrap com you'll

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.469 
so if you go to get bootstrap com you'll
wind<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.439> home<00:01:31.680> page<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.240> go

seeing a little demonstration of the way
that<00:01:43.259> bootstrap<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.920> style<00:01:44.220> these<00:01:44.460> images

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
background but I have looked at this

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.349 
background but I have looked at this
effect<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:17.829> pages<00:02:18.400> where<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.849> background<00:02:19.209> was

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
effect on pages where the background was

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.630 
effect on pages where the background was
not<00:02:19.390> white<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.409> will<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> white<00:02:21.159> wrap

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
not white and that will be a white wrap

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.729 
not white and that will be a white wrap
around<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.359> picture<00:02:22.569> followed<00:02:23.140> by<00:02:23.290> the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
but once we hit save and we go to the

front end of the website and we go to
the<00:04:44.290> energy<00:04:44.949> bulbs<00:04:45.310> page<00:04:45.660> you'll<00:04:46.660> see<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:47.020> we

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
the energy bulbs page you'll see that we

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.770 
the energy bulbs page you'll see that we
now<00:04:47.199> have<00:04:47.560> an<00:04:47.650> image<00:04:47.919> with<00:04:48.100> rounded<00:04:48.490> corners

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
now have an image with rounded corners

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.480 
now have an image with rounded corners
so<00:04:49.780> that's<00:04:49.960> quite<00:04:50.169> nice<00:04:50.320> if<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:51.130> go<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.280> the

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
so that's quite nice if we go to the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.580 
so that's quite nice if we go to the
low-flow<00:04:51.880> showerhead<00:04:52.479> I<00:04:52.720> think<00:04:53.260> this<00:04:53.410> one

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
low-flow showerhead I think this one

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.140 
low-flow showerhead I think this one
might<00:04:53.620> look<00:04:53.919> good<00:04:54.070> with<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.280> circle<00:04:54.699> around<00:04:54.820> it

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
might look good with a circle around it

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.719 
might look good with a circle around it
so<00:04:55.600> let's<00:04:56.229> hop<00:04:56.560> into<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.979> backend<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.460> Joomla

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
so let's hop into the backend of Joomla
