00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
details with this figure that just you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
details with this figure that just you
know<00:02:07.729> differentiates<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.879> from<00:02:08.910> previous

so I'll touch base on some of those in

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.580 
so I'll touch base on some of those in
just<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:14.580> bit<00:02:15.020> before<00:02:16.020> we<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.380> will

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
just a little bit before we do will

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.400 
just a little bit before we do will
enter<00:02:16.830> articulation<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.700> accessories<00:02:18.410> and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.910 
he does feature a ball jointed head
although<00:02:24.360> sadly<00:02:24.780> some<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.470> possibility

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
although sadly some of that possibility

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.640 
although sadly some of that possibility
has<00:02:26.430> been<00:02:26.670> ended<00:02:27.150> due<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> sculpted<00:02:28.290> fur

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
on the head we get hinges at these

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.040 
on the head we get hinges at these
shoulders<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.250> elbows<00:02:32.630> swivels<00:02:33.630> at<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
shoulders and elbows swivels at the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.980 
shoulders and elbows swivels at the
forearms<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:35.160> triple<00:02:35.520> join<00:02:35.970> at<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.390> tosser

forearms and a triple join at the tosser

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.060 
forearms and a triple join at the tosser
we<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:38.090> giant<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.570> there<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
we have a giant just there so of it the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.240 
we have a giant just there so of it the
breasts<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.750> midsection<00:02:43.170> there<00:02:43.560> as<00:02:43.710> well

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
breasts in the midsection there as well

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.540 
breasts in the midsection there as well
and<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.580> believe<00:02:45.440> there<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.590> swivel<00:02:47.160> although

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and I believe there is a swivel although

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.410 
and I believe there is a swivel although
a<00:02:47.580> very<00:02:47.820> tight<00:02:48.150> swivel<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.770> waist

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
a very tight swivel just of the waist

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.790 
a very tight swivel just of the waist
because<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.750> swivels<00:02:52.140> at<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.590> hips

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
because I have swivels at the hips

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.430 
because I have swivels at the hips
hinges<00:02:53.550> at<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.880> knees<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.360> hinges<00:02:54.990> at<00:02:55.200> the
