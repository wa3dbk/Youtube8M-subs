00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.050
 one 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.990
 one 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.960
 one 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
 one 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.829
 a 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.400
 of half a century the course in which we will show how to perform various 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.550
 aspects 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.480
 with maintenance standby mode not 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.270
 for this we understand an open document and we are going to create a text 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.400
 lie 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.400
 we are using a rather thick typeface 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.760
 and we focus it 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.470
 what we are going to do is create a shadow by way of likewise both 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 for this we are going to publish 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.320
 the single-engine a right on the layer the text duplicate layer 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 and in documents we select a new document 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.610
 read or what 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.380
 and we create a new document 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.390
 let's go right button 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 fusion options we select a thrashing 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 and a color that uses fixed 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.470
 let's adjust the size to be quite large 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.320
 more or less 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.180
 and create a new layer 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.970
 one is that we have a new stage that has been given since two guys below 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.640
 with the uppercase key we select the two layers and we go to 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.300
 ap layer with mine layers little the key control 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.010
 has created us in a new layer and without any fusion option 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.979
 and what we're going to do now is go to filter 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.979
 blur ocean blur 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.159
 let's apply a high blur value 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.949
 more or less read or kelly 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.559
 this will depend on each photograph and on functional value of 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:27.159
 blur let's get a halftone effect another 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:33.179
 lie we have the edil defocus done now let's go to picture mode 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.819
 grayscale 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.059
 it eliminates the information of colors we call him we give him or what and we repeat the 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.899
 steps image mode but we select bitmap that we could not before 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.389
 we give him what he calls copla the layers 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.389
 and it tells us kent out we want a resolution of 300 pixels per inch 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.189
 and use a halftone plot we give it or what 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.799
 and he is bitten by mali natura de 10 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.079
 tortured lines from a 45 degree angle 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.759
 with a round shape 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.499
 depending on the values ​​that you enter is here and get is 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.479
 different different effects you have to try different values 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.069
 and babies that the points are getting ready hiding more like this 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.229
 how to modify its size 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.379
 we give him or kelly 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.379
 and you see that we have created the halftone plot 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:26.189
 now with the magic marita mint we select good first we passed 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.619
 picture mode 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.619
 grayscale yes no does not allow us to select 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.539
 in size fata we give 1 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.819
 and we created a selection on any part of the subway 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.859
 more or less 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.909
 let's make is similar chemistry xerez 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:46.449
 and in the selection to all black dots 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.869
 edition 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.509
 copy 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.729
 and minimizes mons 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.729
 We are going to work on the text layer that we are working on 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.479
 We were going to hit 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:04.119
 we have pasted the halftone frame and we changed the layer the text the 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.759
 we put up 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.759
 and we change the color by double clicking 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.189
 sciara we move it with the move tool you can see the effect of that myth 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.039
 not that he created us 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.039
 that can be quite interesting 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.090
 we have done this, he answered but we could do it with any event 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.849
 ccoo any effect with any shape 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.180
 for example, we close 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.199
 we give him 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.919
 save changes 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.400
 we are going to close the documents that we have open and create a new 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.639
 document 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.289
 let's give my pitchers with my pixels for example 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.649
 one is that we have this new document created we are going to form we select form 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:55.699
 customized 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.699
 and we take a form for example from this 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.640
 well we create the way we are going to center the 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.409
 and the famous rastelli 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.289
 so that we do not become this if we had a color does not convert us 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.830
 this mode in this space work in grayscale 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.169
 always the rejoinder mosson document new right button click layer 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.259
 and new document 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.000
 and we work on this one 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.990
 to be able to do the conversion 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.789
 picture mode 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.830
 they are already grayscale 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.020
 let's filter 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.610
 ar for a hundred out of focus 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.610
 ocean blur 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.099
 let's not talk to anyone about any deal in this case 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.110
 only the blur we give him or what 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.110
 we return bitmap mode image 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.090
 in output 300 halftone we give you though 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:03.149
 by the way to Moscow the values ​​according to the effects in each case is to be tested 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.220
 and you can see how the plot has created us is the mythomaniac that way 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.230
 and good with this fetus you can get according to design sodemasa quite 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.979
 It has interesting effects and good 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.199
 stacy this tutorial I hope the state is old thank you for your attention and 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:21.849
 until the next
