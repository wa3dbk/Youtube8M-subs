00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
close the cutter back up just keeps dust

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.259 
close the cutter back up just keeps dust
from<00:00:46.749> getting<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.230> components<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:49.149> also

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
from getting to the components it also

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.180 
from getting to the components it also
has<00:00:49.539> some<00:00:49.749> additional<00:00:49.929> features<00:00:50.469> it<00:00:50.949> has<00:00:51.159> a

has some additional features it has a

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.619 
has some additional features it has a
watermark<00:00:51.730> detector<00:00:52.179> which<00:00:52.300> trunk<00:00:52.539> that

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
watermark detector which trunk that

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.720 
watermark detector which trunk that
turns<00:00:52.870> on<00:00:53.019> a<00:00:53.050> light<00:00:53.109> here<00:00:53.649> which<00:00:54.309> allows<00:00:54.550> you

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
turns on a light here which allows you

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.599 
turns on a light here which allows you
to<00:00:54.760> take<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:54.999> bill<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:56.379> it<00:00:56.469> on<00:00:56.559> here<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.069> you

to take a bill put it on here and you
can<00:00:57.729> look<00:00:57.819> at<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:57.999> watermarks<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.629> verify

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
can look at the watermarks to verify

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.139 
can look at the watermarks to verify
that<00:00:59.229> is<00:00:59.409> indeed<00:00:59.739> with<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.429> legitimate<00:01:00.969> bill

that is indeed with the legitimate bill
hit<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.199> watermark<00:01:02.589> button<00:01:02.829> that<00:01:02.920> turns<00:01:03.039> the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
hit the watermark button that turns the

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.399 
hit the watermark button that turns the
light<00:01:03.399> off<00:01:03.429> there's<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:03.940> magnetic<00:01:04.409> detector

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
light off there's a magnetic detector

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.040 
light off there's a magnetic detector
which<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.370> can<00:01:06.520> turn<00:01:06.640> on<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:07.600> detects<00:01:07.930> the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
which you can turn on that detects the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.289 
which you can turn on that detects the
magnetic<00:01:08.500> properties<00:01:08.979> of<00:01:09.100> ink<00:01:09.280> ok<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:10.120> just

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
magnetic properties of ink ok so just

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.870 
magnetic properties of ink ok so just
slide<00:01:10.659> your<00:01:10.720> bill<00:01:11.020> over<00:01:11.260> that<00:01:11.760> sensor<00:01:12.760> right

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
slide your bill over that sensor right

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.450 
slide your bill over that sensor right
there<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:14.229> let<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.620> know<00:01:14.740> if<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:14.890> bill<00:01:15.340> is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
there it let you know if that bill is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.670 
there it let you know if that bill is
true<00:01:15.730> and<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.240> lights<00:01:16.450> up<00:01:16.600> makes<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:17.080> noise<00:01:17.260> if

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
true and it lights up makes a noise if

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.540 
true and it lights up makes a noise if
it<00:01:17.800> is<00:01:17.920> legitimate<00:01:18.550> if<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.630> isn't<00:01:19.870> legitimate

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
it is legitimate if it isn't legitimate

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.460 
it is legitimate if it isn't legitimate
as<00:01:21.550> many<00:01:21.730> times<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:22.030> slide<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.390> over<00:01:22.510> it<00:01:23.350> will

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
as many times you slide it over it will

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.350 
as many times you slide it over it will
not<00:01:23.590> make<00:01:23.770> any<00:01:23.890> kind<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.280> noise<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:25.330> turn

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
not make any kind of a noise you turn

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.160 
not make any kind of a noise you turn
that<00:01:25.660> off

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
that off

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.860

it<00:01:26.230> has<00:01:26.920> UV<00:01:27.340> light<00:01:27.520> built<00:01:27.760> into<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.150> hit<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.630> UV

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
it has UV light built into it hit the UV

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.500 
it has UV light built into it hit the UV
button<00:01:29.200> there's<00:01:30.070> no<00:01:30.190> UV<00:01:30.400> light<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.820> there<00:01:30.970> now

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
button there's no UV light in there now

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.990 
button there's no UV light in there now
if<00:01:32.290> there's<00:01:32.470> a<00:01:32.530> lot<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.800> sunlight<00:01:33.040> or<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.730> lot<00:01:33.880> of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
if there's a lot of sunlight or a lot of

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.980 
if there's a lot of sunlight or a lot of
light<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.300> room<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.540> might<00:01:34.660> be<00:01:34.780> kind<00:01:34.960> of

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
light in the room it might be kind of

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.570 
light in the room it might be kind of
hard<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.290> see<00:01:37.260> but<00:01:38.260> if<00:01:38.410> you're<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.710> normal

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
hard to see but if you're in a normal

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.390 
hard to see but if you're in a normal
lip<00:01:40.540> room<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:41.140> shouldn't<00:01:41.410> have<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.560> problem<00:01:42.010> so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
lip room you shouldn't have a problem so

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.620 
lip room you shouldn't have a problem so
just<00:01:42.430> slide<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.820> bill<00:01:43.000> in<00:01:43.120> there<00:01:43.270> there's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
just slide the bill in there there's
