00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi guys welcome with a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.080
 brand new video today we are on fast 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.400
 fringer a really nice game and 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 particular for our devices in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.139
 which with our finger we should make gods 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.630
 routes get to the finish line and more 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.109
 quickly possible so let's say that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 whoever has the fastest finger in the west wins 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.630
 perfect after saying this great 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.490
 crap 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
 I would say we can start like 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.570
 always however first sale leave a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.920
 nice bit of days up then we leave 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.109
 immediately and let's see some 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 what it is about places the finger 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.430
 on departure, drag published 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.710
 on arrival ok it seems enough 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.469
 simple perfect at least tutorial we are 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 managed to complete it incredible now 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.260
 even a disgusting door is counted 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 okay the replay doesn't interest us 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 because it's not like that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.559
 great to complete the tutorial then 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.090
 complete less quickly to keep one 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 perfect gold medal ok I should have it 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.150
 done quite well well it starts not 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.990
 these levels can be complicated then 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 let's do this well ok there is why 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.100
 the hard you with your finger on 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.430
 ca n't understand where you are 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.619
 clicking then is a bit of a mess though 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.630
 it succeeds 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.659
 is there for now it succeeds 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.689
 here are the obstacles 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:35.490
 so I guess it's a lot harder 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.060
 dear serious ok after ten years just ha 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 finally made then the next level 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 let's see what touches us 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.869
 what is this stuff use to upgrades for 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.579
 overcome the most difficult levels we have 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.740
 two enhancements with positioning 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.860
 shield absorb a blow va well 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.500
 a shield upgrade and I'm dead 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.869
 equal time enhancement slows down 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.710
 obstacles well so let's do one 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.229
 Stuff like this has done well 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.970
 ok i did it this time we see a 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.709
 little 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.720
 this seems simple what this thing is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.700
 it is right but we can also make some 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.830
 zoom 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.130
 ok i don't think you need a zoom for 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.410
 this level which was a great bullshit 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.269
 very well next we see a little thing 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.590
 it's beautiful 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.750
 ok wild a snake 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.880
 then let's do it because I have 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.030
 the finger practically as big as 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.150
 the track so I have to go 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.680
 practically blind and not a thing 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.090
 positive 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.459
 so now we have two obstacles 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.989
 let's do it oh fuck the fuck i am 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:50.620
 in shit I don't know how I did it to 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:53.349
 save them you did it perfect it ok 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.180
 supermario type but with the finger without 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.180
 to get a taste what it does so the table 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.799
 it moves as perfect as it still does 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.799
 simple, simple and feasible 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.450
 as what is really very pretty i 'm 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:15.220
 really taking perfect taste looks like 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:18.189
 type the impossible not possible of 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.420
 there was a game that everyone now 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.420
 noble the name 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:30.060
 oh well let's focus on this perfect 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.220
 it went ok levels i did because 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.959
 is slowly grinding levels like 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:42.930
 if they were rice grains it doesn't make sense 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.690
 well then it was a dodge let's go 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.010
 headed to the finish line 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.840
 for now they are still quite feasible 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.970
 that I brought bad luck because this 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.489
 already seems more difficult 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.370
 and instead no ok this I want to do it in a 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.879
 second total then fucking fucking cock 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.790
 dick 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.549
 now now perfect perfect though 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.410
 they are starting to get a little more 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.019
 complicated ucci and that I like from a 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.579
 side but I don't like it from another ok 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.229
 this already seems too difficult 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.660
 he did it 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:22.800
 perfect perfect i don't like this 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.950
 not at all because I can't 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.330
 understand when it is based on that 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.229
 fucking wall let's see if we can 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.690
 make a zoom 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:36.389
 here is so already but much better perfect 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.400
 that's if we can zoom in becomes more 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.470
 feasible because if it is not there 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.350
 practically impossible so I like it 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.980
 no this is not good 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.450
 what the fuck table we're at 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.660
 we are here 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:58.230
 perfect this also went that 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.760
 here we are fucking dick i got it 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.590
 pretty ass but I did it 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.450
 perfect to tell us about the last level 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:11.610
 let's see what is expected now are 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.220
 ready well, I should have stopped at 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.800
 previous level this seems to me 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:24.750
 even more impossible 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:28.750
 fuck all right well we start a lot 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:34.090

 for the moment we put it with the normal 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.780
 we have two characters 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.880
