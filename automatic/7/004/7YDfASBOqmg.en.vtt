00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.220 
we spent quite a lot of time together in
in<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.610> simulator<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.870> some<00:01:45.080> good

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
in in the simulator and with some good

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.780 
in in the simulator and with some good
time<00:01:45.410> and<00:01:45.650> I<00:01:45.740> think<00:01:45.770> Lucas<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.340> really<00:01:46.640> really

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
time and I think Lucas is really really

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.960 
time and I think Lucas is really really
experienced<00:01:47.500> as<00:01:48.500> well<00:01:48.770> from<00:01:49.610> his<00:01:49.730> Renault

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
experienced as well from his Renault

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.740 
experienced as well from his Renault
time<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.900> think<00:01:51.830> we<00:01:52.070> have<00:01:52.390> found<00:01:53.390> already

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
time and I think we have found already

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.380 
time and I think we have found already
quite<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.050> good<00:01:54.460> way<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.520> work<00:01:55.790> together<00:01:56.000> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
quite a good way to work together and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.530 
quite a good way to work together and
Lewis<00:01:56.690> as<00:01:56.840> well<00:01:57.100> our<00:01:58.100> test<00:01:58.400> drivers<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.240> a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
Lewis as well our test drivers it's a

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.420 
Lewis as well our test drivers it's a
couple<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.080> times<00:02:00.260> in<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.530> simulator<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.250> and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
couple of times in the simulator and and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.300 
couple of times in the simulator and and
doing<00:02:02.030> doing<00:02:02.480> a<00:02:02.690> lot<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.870> work<00:02:03.110> for<00:02:03.320> us<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:03.650> it's

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
doing doing a lot of work for us so it's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.359 
doing doing a lot of work for us so it's
important

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.889 

is<00:02:08.429> awesome<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.000> has<00:02:09.390> been<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.780> much

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is awesome but has been so much

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.630 
is awesome but has been so much
preparation<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:10.799> am<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.519> looking

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
preparation that I am really looking

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.670 
preparation that I am really looking
forward<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.239> sit<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> car<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.019> know<00:02:13.170> I'm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
forward to sit on the car you know I'm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.220 
forward to sit on the car you know I'm
eager<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.879> get<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.959> whole

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
eager to get there and I get the whole

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.100 
eager to get there and I get the whole
program<00:02:16.709> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.370> how<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.670> car<00:02:17.970> is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
program going to see how the car is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.420 
program going to see how the car is
reacting<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.260> every<00:02:19.560> corner<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:19.950> every<00:02:20.040> break

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
reacting in every corner and every break

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.509 
reacting in every corner and every break
in<00:02:20.670> every<00:02:21.090> acceleration<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.500> I'm<00:02:23.310> really

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
in every acceleration so I'm really

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.130 
in every acceleration so I'm really
really<00:02:23.640> anxious<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.299> be<00:02:25.019> there<00:02:25.230> driving<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
really anxious to be there driving I

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.449 
really anxious to be there driving I
would<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.500> spend<00:02:28.680> more<00:02:28.890> time<00:02:29.099> because

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
would like to spend more time because

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.250 
would like to spend more time because
the<00:02:29.579> simulator<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.360> awesome<00:02:30.569> there<00:02:31.019> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.520 

it's<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.440> very<00:02:34.470> useful<00:02:34.920> tool<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.180> learn

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
it's a very useful tool for you to learn

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
it's a very useful tool for you to learn
to<00:02:37.530> have<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.709> feeling<00:02:38.099> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> car<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.849> learn

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
to have a feeling of the car to learn

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.800 
to have a feeling of the car to learn
new<00:02:39.239> circuits<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.989> we<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:41.730> had<00:02:41.879> some<00:02:42.060> quality

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
new circuits and we we had some quality

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.780 
new circuits and we we had some quality
time<00:02:42.840> there<00:02:43.290> improving<00:02:43.709> our<00:02:43.950> our<00:02:44.160> driving<00:02:44.489> and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
time there improving our our driving and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.699 
time there improving our our driving and
the<00:02:45.420> testing<00:02:45.840> some<00:02:46.049> components<00:02:46.590> so

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
the testing some components so

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.369 
the testing some components so
definitely<00:02:47.400> good<00:02:50.930> practically<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.989> piece<00:02:52.230> of

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
definitely good practically a piece of

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.270 
definitely good practically a piece of
art<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.340> car<00:02:53.519> has<00:02:53.670> become<00:02:54.560> I've<00:02:55.560> seen<00:02:55.890> it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
art that the car has become I've seen it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.720 
art that the car has become I've seen it
from<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.239> project<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.870> building<00:02:58.730> pieces

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
from the project to the building pieces

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.880 
from the project to the building pieces
and<00:03:00.120> pieces<00:03:00.629> all<00:03:00.780> together<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.409> did<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> seat

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
and pieces all together we did a seat

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.380 
and pieces all together we did a seat
fitting<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.519> everything<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:02.940> that's<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
fitting and everything but that's the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.030 
fitting and everything but that's the
first<00:03:03.599> time<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> see<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.200> car<00:03:04.379> complete<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
first time I see the car complete and it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.730 
first time I see the car complete and it
just<00:03:05.370> looks<00:03:05.549> awesome
