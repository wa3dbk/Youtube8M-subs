on<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> desktop<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.070> when<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.060> open<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.510> game

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
on the desktop but when I open a game

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.740 
on the desktop but when I open a game
the<00:02:21.410> noise<00:02:21.590> completely<00:02:22.040> stopped<00:02:22.750> after

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the noise completely stopped after

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690 
the noise completely stopped after
listening<00:02:24.230> around<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.710> case<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.250> seemed<00:02:25.670> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
listening around the case it seemed that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.040 
listening around the case it seemed that
the<00:02:25.910> whining<00:02:26.330> noise<00:02:26.480> was<00:02:26.750> coming<00:02:26.810> from

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
the whining noise was coming from

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.710 
the whining noise was coming from
somewhere<00:02:27.710> on<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.280> motherboard<00:02:28.820> around<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
somewhere on the motherboard around the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.740 
somewhere on the motherboard around the
CPU<00:02:30.680> socket<00:02:30.950> area<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.940> whining<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.480> coming

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
CPU socket area if the whining is coming

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.900 
CPU socket area if the whining is coming
from<00:02:32.810> your<00:02:32.960> motherboard<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.460> likely<00:02:34.700> that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
from your motherboard it is likely that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.410 
from your motherboard it is likely that
the<00:02:35.120> cause<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.420> intel<00:02:36.380> speedstep<00:02:37.420> basically

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the cause is intel speedstep basically

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.180 
the cause is intel speedstep basically
intel<00:02:38.690> speedstep<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.590> thing<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.830> drops

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
intel speedstep is the thing that drops

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.000 
intel speedstep is the thing that drops
down<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.870> clock<00:02:41.870> speed<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.440> voltage<00:02:42.590> with

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
down the clock speed and voltage with

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.000 
down the clock speed and voltage with
your<00:02:43.130> processor<00:02:43.820> when<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:44.900> not<00:02:45.170> under<00:02:45.680> heavy

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
your processor when it's not under heavy

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.000 
your processor when it's not under heavy
use<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.930> often<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.410> source<00:02:48.770> of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
use and this can often be a source of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.100 
use and this can often be a source of
oil<00:02:49.790> wine<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.450> what<00:02:50.570> I'm<00:02:50.690> doing<00:02:50.720> now<00:02:51.080> is

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
oil wine so what I'm doing now is

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.550 
oil wine so what I'm doing now is
opening<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:52.040> CPU<00:02:52.610> Z<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:53.420> check<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.050> clock

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
opening up CPU Z to check the clock

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.580 
opening up CPU Z to check the clock
speed<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.280> voltages<00:02:55.760> my<00:02:55.940> CPU<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.630> I'll

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
speed and the voltages my CPU and I'll

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.580 
speed and the voltages my CPU and I'll
open<00:02:57.740> up<00:02:57.950> prime95<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:59.330> stress<00:02:59.720> test<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.140> CPU

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
open up prime95 to stress test the CPU

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.520 
open up prime95 to stress test the CPU
and<00:03:00.800> see<00:03:00.980> if<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.280> noise<00:03:01.580> changes<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.320> can

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
and see if the noise changes so you can

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.710 
and see if the noise changes so you can
see<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.830> my<00:03:03.920> core<00:03:04.190> clock<00:03:04.550> speed<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.180> jumping

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
see that my core clock speed is jumping

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.450 
see that my core clock speed is jumping
around<00:03:05.810> all<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.290> time<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:07.100> was<00:03:07.340> actually

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
around all the time it was actually

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.580 
around all the time it was actually
floating<00:03:08.150> around<00:03:08.240> 1<00:03:08.600> gigahertz<00:03:08.960> before<00:03:09.560> I

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
floating around 1 gigahertz before I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.860 
floating around 1 gigahertz before I
started<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.370> recording<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.480> it's<00:03:11.600> gone<00:03:11.750> up

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
started the recording but it's gone up

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.530 
started the recording but it's gone up
now<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.080> bit<00:03:12.320> so<00:03:13.310> I'm<00:03:13.430> going<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.730> open<00:03:13.850> prime95

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
now a bit so I'm going to open prime95

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.380 
now a bit so I'm going to open prime95
and<00:03:15.320> run<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.709> stress<00:03:16.040> test<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.490> see<00:03:17.090> how<00:03:17.120> it

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
and run a stress test and see how it

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.130 
and run a stress test and see how it
affects<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.080> clock<00:03:18.800> speed<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.490> noise

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
affects the clock speed and the noise

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.800 
affects the clock speed and the noise
okay<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:21.200> I've<00:03:21.440> opened<00:03:21.970> prime95<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.570> I'm

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
okay so I've opened prime95 and I'm

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.110 
okay so I've opened prime95 and I'm
running<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.110> stress<00:03:24.380> test<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.920> as<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:26.000> can

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
running the stress test and as you can

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.830 
running the stress test and as you can
see<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.680> clock<00:03:27.680> speed<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.040> now<00:03:28.400> stuck<00:03:28.880> on<00:03:29.060> 2.7

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
see the clock speed is now stuck on 2.7

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.160 
see the clock speed is now stuck on 2.7
gigahertz<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:32.180> noise<00:03:32.510> seems<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.080> have

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
gigahertz and the noise seems to have

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.120 
gigahertz and the noise seems to have
stopped<00:03:33.470> I'm<00:03:33.770> not<00:03:34.580> hearing<00:03:34.910> ecor1

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.800 

okay<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:42.190> now<00:03:42.490> I'm<00:03:42.580> going<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.760> go<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.940> disable

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
okay so now I'm going to go to disable

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.770 
okay so now I'm going to go to disable
the<00:03:44.050> intel<00:03:44.920> speed<00:03:45.160> set<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.490> my<00:03:45.580> files<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.180> I'm

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the intel speed set of my files so I'm

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.470 
the intel speed set of my files so I'm
going<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.990> restart<00:03:47.290> my<00:03:47.470> pc<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.400> when<00:03:49.360> it

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
going to restart my pc and when it

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.030 
going to restart my pc and when it
restarts<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:50.260> will<00:03:50.380> need<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.620> press<00:03:50.860> which

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
restarts you will need to press which

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.690 
restarts you will need to press which
other<00:03:51.250> key<00:03:51.730> gets<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.600> into<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.020> bossman<00:03:53.700> so

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
other key gets you into the bossman so

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.600 
other key gets you into the bossman so
in<00:03:54.910> my<00:03:55.060> case<00:03:55.330> that's<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.930> leads<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.190> I'm<00:03:57.370> going

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
in my case that's the leads so I'm going

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.390 
in my case that's the leads so I'm going
to<00:03:57.790> hammer<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.540> leaky<00:03:59.140> until<00:03:59.770> I<00:03:59.830> get<00:04:00.070> into<00:04:00.310> the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
to hammer the leaky until I get into the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.620 
to hammer the leaky until I get into the
vials<00:04:05.490> now<00:04:06.490> I'm<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.760> bar<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.180> I'm<00:04:07.330> going<00:04:07.570> to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
vials now I'm in the bar so I'm going to

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.930 
vials now I'm in the bar so I'm going to
go<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.780> overclocking<00:04:08.650> settings<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.400> then

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
go to overclocking settings and then

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.830 
go to overclocking settings and then
into<00:04:10.420> CPU<00:04:11.140> features<00:04:11.710> and<00:04:12.120> if<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.360> have<00:04:13.600> an

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
into CPU features and if you have an

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.780 
into CPU features and if you have an
older<00:04:14.080> motherboard<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:15.070> BIOS<00:04:15.280> menu<00:04:15.520> will

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
older motherboard the BIOS menu will

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.220 
older motherboard the BIOS menu will
probably<00:04:16.090> look<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.480> little<00:04:16.600> different<00:04:17.080> than

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
probably look a little different than

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.210 
probably look a little different than
then<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.300> UEFI<00:04:19.300> bars<00:04:19.710> but<00:04:20.710> you<00:04:20.830> just<00:04:20.950> need<00:04:21.130> to

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
then the UEFI bars but you just need to

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.450 
then the UEFI bars but you just need to
find<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.640> CPU<00:04:22.210> settings<00:04:22.750> menu<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:24.190> has

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
find the CPU settings menu that has

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.900 
find the CPU settings menu that has

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.530 
monitor while this will work
I<00:06:59.730> can<00:07:00.600> recommend<00:07:00.930> using<00:07:01.290> vsync<00:07:01.920> as<00:07:02.270> it<00:07:03.270> is<00:07:03.510> a

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
I can recommend using vsync as it is a

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.260 
I can recommend using vsync as it is a
frequent<00:07:04.170> cause<00:07:04.440> of<00:07:04.580> input<00:07:05.580> lag<00:07:05.760> in<00:07:06.060> many

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
frequent cause of input lag in many

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.810 
frequent cause of input lag in many
games

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.080 

the<00:07:09.600> preferable<00:07:10.290> option<00:07:10.410> is<00:07:10.890> to<00:07:11.160> use<00:07:11.190> an<00:07:11.610> FPS

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
the preferable option is to use an FPS

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.650 
the preferable option is to use an FPS
limiter<00:07:12.570> so<00:07:13.500> if<00:07:13.890> that<00:07:14.130> is<00:07:14.250> available<00:07:14.490> use<00:07:15.480> it
