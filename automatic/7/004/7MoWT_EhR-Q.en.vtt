00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.490
Countering Against Kicking Attacks.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.730
There are two different ways to counter the
kicking attacks.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.730
Alright?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.410
The first one and most common on is once I've
blocked a roundhouse kick with my leg, I come

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.210
down and then I return back with a kick of
my own.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.210
Okay?

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.140
So I'm going to defend my opponent's left
roundhouse kick.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.140
Okay?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.740
I block and then from the block I come down
and then come straight up with my own roundhouse.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.750
One more time.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.109
I block, come down, up, and then up with my
own roundhouse kick.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.059
Now, when I block with the left one, also
come with a block.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.340
I'm not going to put the leg down in front
and then switch because now it takes a little

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.570
bit too much time to go through the motions.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.430
So after I block from this position here now,
I'm going to shoot forward with the right

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.480
foot and then go right into the kick from
there.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.480
Okay?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.760
So, I'm going to block the right roundhouse
kick.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.680
I block, and then up from there.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.809
Again.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.060
Block, and then up from there.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.060
Okay?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.070
Now, the other one.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.790
If my opponent decides to throw his left roundhouse
kick, if I don't have the time to block with

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.980
the right leg, I can come up and I can use
a front push kick or a teep (?) in order to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.640
put him off of balance now.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.100
So he comes up with that left roundhouse kick,
I drop the left teep (?), puts him off of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.940
balance, now I can close the distance and
now go into attack now.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.940
Again.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.350
When you come up with that push kick, make
sure you pick your knee up nice and high so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.320
when you go out, your foot ends up pretty
much in the middle of the chest so you can

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.710
get good movement out of your opponent.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.710
Okay?

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.680
So again, he comes up with that left roundhouse.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.859
I go up and then now I can come in.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:56.100
When he attacks with his right roundhouse,
I'm going to come up with my right leg (okay?)

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.009
in the same motion again.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.009
Up.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.009
Again, up.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.380
And then extend the leg out and again now
I can attack in with punches or kicks.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.380
Alright.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.750
Now we have my opponent throws a kick up high.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.020
I may not be able to block the kick with my
leg, so I'm going to take the impact.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.230
Once I've taken the impact, I come right back
down and I throw my kick towards the thigh.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.640
So when you speed it up and you go up, bop,
bap.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640
Again.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.250
He comes up, bop, bap.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.250
Alright?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.859
And that is defending some of the attacking
kicks.
