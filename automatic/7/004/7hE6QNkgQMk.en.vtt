seen at most hardware stores it's got a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.539 
seen at most hardware stores it's got a
pin<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> thread<00:01:30.829> opens<00:01:31.829> completely<00:01:32.369> up

the<00:01:33.450> benefits<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.220> probably

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
item but one of the downfalls is that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.109 
item but one of the downfalls is that
you<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:44.060> involved<00:01:45.060> you

carabiner does not have this screw lock
on<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.410> will<00:02:19.530> keep<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.920> from<00:02:20.070> opening<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
on it that will keep it from opening it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.490 
on it that will keep it from opening it
up<00:02:23.210> again<00:02:24.210> if<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.510> does<00:02:24.690> not<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> screw

I'm putting the line on my ladder shrimp
traps<00:02:32.490> personally<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> way<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.510> do<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.050> use<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
traps personally the way I do it I use a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.400 
traps personally the way I do it I use a
carabiner<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.430> use<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> line<00:02:36.690> with<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> loop

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
carabiner I use a line with a loop

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.100 
carabiner I use a line with a loop
spliced<00:02:37.830> into<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.930> I've<00:02:39.930> put<00:02:40.170> my<00:02:40.350> eye<00:02:42.110> through

spliced into it I've put my eye through

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.600 
spliced into it I've put my eye through
the<00:02:43.230> pot<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:44.959> snap<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:46.170> carabiner<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.130> then

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
the pot I snap my carabiner in and then

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460 
the pot I snap my carabiner in and then
the<00:02:47.730> most<00:02:47.880> important<00:02:48.450> part<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.750> feel<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.260> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
the most important part I feel is that I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.920 
the most important part I feel is that I
make<00:02:50.840> wraps<00:02:51.840> around<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.739> shank<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
make wraps around the shank of the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.960 
make wraps around the shank of the
carabiner<00:02:54.930> but<00:02:55.860> about<00:02:56.040> three<00:02:56.340> or<00:02:56.430> four<00:02:56.670> wraps

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
carabiner but about three or four wraps

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.590 
carabiner but about three or four wraps
in<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:58.400> basically<00:02:59.400> what<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.700> does<00:03:00.150> is

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
in here and basically what that does is

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.370 
in here and basically what that does is
keeps<00:03:01.170> everything<00:03:01.700> on<00:03:02.700> I've<00:03:03.690> had<00:03:03.900> these<00:03:04.080> snaps

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
keeps everything on I've had these snaps

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.820 
keeps everything on I've had these snaps
open<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.950> before<00:03:05.690> being<00:03:06.690> hit<00:03:06.900> by<00:03:07.850> boat<00:03:08.850> hooks

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
open up before being hit by boat hooks

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.710 
open up before being hit by boat hooks

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.250 
bouncing on the pot whatever may be but
I<00:03:12.930> do<00:03:13.110> not<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:14.370> snap<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.910> non<00:03:15.630> locking

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
I do not just snap a non locking

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.810 
I do not just snap a non locking

stuff today just for demonstration what
it<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:06.799> it's<00:04:07.799> two<00:04:08.130> rings<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:10.130> kind<00:04:11.130> of

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
it is it's two rings that have a kind of

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.340 
it is it's two rings that have a kind of
unique<00:04:11.519> little<00:04:11.700> groove<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.660> them<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.959> that

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
unique little groove in them that that

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.150 
unique little groove in them that that
meshed<00:04:13.829> together<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:16.049> very<00:04:16.140> important<00:04:16.890> you

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
meshed together it is very important you

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.740 
meshed together it is very important you
you<00:04:17.430> obviously<00:04:17.849> need<00:04:17.970> two<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.330> them<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.720> you

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
you obviously need two of them so you

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.659 
you obviously need two of them so you
need<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
need a

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.080 
need a
lead<00:04:20.329> on<00:04:20.659> the<00:04:20.870> pot<00:04:21.109> or<00:04:21.520> one<00:04:22.520> on<00:04:22.639> each<00:04:22.759> end<00:04:23.030> of

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
lead on the pot or one on each end of

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.489 
lead on the pot or one on each end of
your<00:04:23.180> line<00:04:23.419> however<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.020> want<00:04:24.199> to<00:04:24.289> put<00:04:24.409> them

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:24.499 
your line however you want to put them

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:28.779 
your line however you want to put them
together<00:04:26.889> so<00:04:27.889> you're<00:04:28.189> connecting<00:04:28.610> two

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
together so you're connecting two

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.290 
together so you're connecting two
lengths<00:04:29.150> of<00:04:29.240> line<00:04:29.539> together<00:04:29.830> again<00:04:30.999> they<00:04:31.999> snap

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
lengths of line together again they snap

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.420 
lengths of line together again they snap
in<00:04:32.539> real<00:04:32.719> easy<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.830> chance<00:04:34.129> of<00:04:34.249> them<00:04:34.400> coming

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
in real easy the chance of them coming

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.089 
in real easy the chance of them coming
undone<00:04:35.060> not<00:04:36.050> real<00:04:36.409> well<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.800> way<00:04:36.919> they're

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
undone not real well the way they're
