00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
to how to take the hard drive up first

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.380 
to how to take the hard drive up first
you<00:00:21.449> take<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> battery<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:24.090> cover<00:00:24.300> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
you take the battery out the cover is

you take the battery out the cover is
already<00:00:24.600> loose<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> make

sure<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.800> video<00:00:26.130> goes<00:00:26.279> nice<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.550> smooth<00:00:27.180> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
sure this video goes nice and smooth it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.210 
sure this video goes nice and smooth it
does<00:00:27.630> take<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.080> time<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.590> reach<00:00:29.039> your

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
does take some time but reach your

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.959 
does take some time but reach your
fingers<00:00:29.460> underneath<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> pop<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:31.969> it's

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
fingers underneath and pop this and it's

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
fingers underneath and pop this and it's
better<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.270> go<00:00:33.450> around<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.020> side<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.649> when<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
better to go around the side of when the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.250 
better to go around the side of when the
battery<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.880> these<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.600> clips<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
battery is because these have clips I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.290 
battery is because these have clips I
have<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.739> first<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.399> makes<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
have to go in first so it makes it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.569 
have to go in first so it makes it
easier<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> pivot<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.770> down<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.489> we're

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
easier to pivot up and down so we're

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.760 
easier to pivot up and down so we're
going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> take<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> off<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.629> hard<00:00:43.590> drives

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
going to take that off the hard drives

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770 
going to take that off the hard drives
right<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> cable<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.360> runs<00:00:45.420> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
right here you have a cable that runs in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
right here you have a cable that runs in
the<00:00:45.870> groove<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> pay

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the groove here you have to pay

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
the groove here you have to pay
attention<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.430> all<00:00:47.969> right<00:00:48.360> these<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.570> sensors

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
attention to all right these are sensors

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
off the tape is kind of tough to take

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
off the tape is kind of tough to take
off<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.360> side<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.440> part<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the on the hard drive so it has to come

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.279 
the on the hard drive so it has to come
off

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289
