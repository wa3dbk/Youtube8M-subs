and<00:03:02.170> about<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.980> much<00:03:03.160> whatever<00:03:04.050> then<00:03:05.050> I<00:03:05.080> just

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
and about that much whatever then I just

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.780 
and about that much whatever then I just
took<00:03:05.440> some<00:03:05.500> food<00:03:05.890> coloring<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:06.670> to

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
took some food coloring like this to

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.400 
took some food coloring like this to
make<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.060> easier<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.450> see<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:07.810> we're<00:03:08.230> going<00:03:08.320> to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410

water<00:03:55.349> in<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.830> put<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.459> plug<00:03:56.670> in<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
water in it and put a plug in the

I<00:04:09.319> covered<00:04:10.319> my<00:04:10.349> bottle<00:04:10.769> invite<00:04:11.069> red<00:04:11.280> Christmas

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
I covered my bottle invite red Christmas

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.300 
I covered my bottle invite red Christmas
wrapping<00:04:11.910> paper<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.660> make<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.840> more<00:04:13.019> visible

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
wrapping paper to make it more visible

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.410 
wrapping paper to make it more visible
visible<00:04:14.310> enough<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.670> see<00:04:14.849> that<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.090> rocket

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
visible enough to see that the rocket

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.150 
visible enough to see that the rocket
tended<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.810> rotate<00:04:16.169> wildly<00:04:16.680> when<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.010> ran<00:04:17.130> out

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
tended to rotate wildly when it ran out

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.150 
tended to rotate wildly when it ran out
of<00:04:17.310> water<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.299> added<00:04:18.540> fins<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.709> nose<00:04:19.859> cone

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
of water so I added fins and a nose cone

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.190 
of water so I added fins and a nose cone
now<00:04:20.700> when<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.030> ran<00:04:21.180> out<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.359> water<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.959> flipped

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
now when it ran out of water it flipped

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
baking soda and this is what it looks

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.129 
baking soda and this is what it looks
like<00:06:45.440> when<00:06:45.740> it<00:06:45.860> goes<00:06:46.070> off

hey<00:06:57.009> everyone<00:06:57.430> I<00:06:57.639> thought<00:06:58.360> I'd<00:06:58.479> show<00:06:58.629> you<00:06:58.659> how

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
hey everyone I thought I'd show you how

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.540 
hey everyone I thought I'd show you how
water<00:06:59.139> bottles<00:06:59.500> are<00:06:59.620> actually<00:07:00.009> made

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
water bottles are actually made

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.610 
water bottles are actually made
so<00:07:01.030> industrially<00:07:01.659> this<00:07:01.840> process<00:07:02.289> is<00:07:02.440> called

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
so industrially this process is called

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.770 
so industrially this process is called
blow<00:07:02.919> molding<00:07:03.430> and<00:07:03.639> the<00:07:04.270> thing<00:07:04.449> that<00:07:04.479> you

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
blow molding and the thing that you

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.439 
blow molding and the thing that you
start<00:07:05.110> with<00:07:05.169> is<00:07:05.560> this<00:07:05.919> which<00:07:06.699> is<00:07:06.849> a<00:07:06.879> call<00:07:07.330> to

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
start with is this which is a call to

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:08.070 
start with is this which is a call to
preform

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
preform

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.779 
preform
and<00:07:08.229> this<00:07:08.379> is<00:07:08.500> injection<00:07:08.889> molded<00:07:09.039> by<00:07:09.490> a<00:07:09.520> very

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789 
and this is injection molded by a very

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:12.029 
and this is injection molded by a very
large<00:07:10.000> press<00:07:10.419> but<00:07:11.080> to<00:07:11.199> convert<00:07:11.500> this<00:07:11.680> into<00:07:11.740> a

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
large press but to convert this into a

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:14.309 
large press but to convert this into a
2-liter<00:07:12.520> soda<00:07:12.610> bottle<00:07:13.240> you<00:07:13.990> don't<00:07:14.169> actually

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 
2-liter soda bottle you don't actually

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.869 
2-liter soda bottle you don't actually
need<00:07:14.530> all<00:07:14.650> that<00:07:14.770> much<00:07:14.949> special<00:07:15.310> equipment<00:07:15.759> at

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 
need all that much special equipment at

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:19.680 
need all that much special equipment at
all<00:07:16.000> I<00:07:17.370> started<00:07:18.370> by<00:07:18.639> placing<00:07:19.120> the<00:07:19.210> preform

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
all I started by placing the preform

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.540 
all I started by placing the preform
into<00:07:20.080> an<00:07:20.319> oven<00:07:20.620> at<00:07:20.740> about<00:07:20.949> 110<00:07:21.520> degrees

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
into an oven at about 110 degrees

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.600 
into an oven at about 110 degrees
centigrade<00:07:22.449> and<00:07:22.690> left<00:07:23.409> it<00:07:23.530> in<00:07:23.650> there<00:07:23.860> for<00:07:24.129> 5<00:07:24.340> to

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
centigrade and left it in there for 5 to

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.119 
centigrade and left it in there for 5 to
10<00:07:24.639> minutes<00:07:24.849> at<00:07:25.569> this<00:07:26.080> point<00:07:26.169> the<00:07:26.530> preform<00:07:27.039> is

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:27.129 
10 minutes at this point the preform is

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:29.040 
10 minutes at this point the preform is
quite<00:07:27.400> soft<00:07:27.699> and<00:07:28.060> so<00:07:28.150> I<00:07:28.180> took<00:07:28.300> one<00:07:28.569> out<00:07:28.599> just<00:07:28.930> to

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
quite soft and so I took one out just to

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.159 
quite soft and so I took one out just to
experiment<00:07:29.379> with<00:07:29.770> and<00:07:30.210> blew<00:07:31.210> it<00:07:31.240> up<00:07:31.479> just<00:07:31.960> in

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169 
experiment with and blew it up just in

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.529 
experiment with and blew it up just in
free<00:07:32.469> air<00:07:32.680> and<00:07:32.949> ended<00:07:33.159> up<00:07:33.250> with<00:07:33.430> kind<00:07:33.610> of<00:07:33.699> a<00:07:33.849> an

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:34.539 
free air and ended up with kind of a an

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.899 
free air and ended up with kind of a an
oval<00:07:34.960> sort<00:07:35.259> of<00:07:35.379> form<00:07:35.680> and<00:07:35.979> all<00:07:36.580> I<00:07:36.610> did<00:07:36.819> to

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:36.909 
oval sort of form and all I did to

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:38.249 
oval sort of form and all I did to
connect<00:07:37.210> the<00:07:37.300> air<00:07:37.449> to<00:07:37.569> this<00:07:37.719> was<00:07:37.870> just<00:07:38.050> drill<00:07:38.229> a

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:38.259 
connect the air to this was just drill a

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:40.649 
connect the air to this was just drill a
hole<00:07:38.500> in<00:07:38.620> a<00:07:38.710> standard<00:07:39.099> bottle<00:07:39.280> cap<00:07:39.639> put<00:07:40.509> the

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659 
hole in a standard bottle cap put the

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.300 
hole in a standard bottle cap put the
preform<00:07:41.139> the<00:07:41.289> hot<00:07:41.409> preform<00:07:41.919> in<00:07:42.039> there<00:07:42.190> and

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.310 
preform the hot preform in there and

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.399 
preform the hot preform in there and
blew<00:07:42.520> it<00:07:42.550> up<00:07:42.729> inside<00:07:43.210> the<00:07:43.449> aluminum<00:07:43.629> tube<00:07:44.110> and

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:44.409 
blew it up inside the aluminum tube and

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:46.200 
blew it up inside the aluminum tube and
this<00:07:44.889> actually<00:07:45.310> worked<00:07:45.460> pretty<00:07:45.550> well<00:07:45.940> I<00:07:45.969> ended

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
this actually worked pretty well I ended

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.820 
this actually worked pretty well I ended
up<00:07:46.389> with<00:07:46.599> two<00:07:46.750> forms<00:07:47.139> that<00:07:47.229> are<00:07:47.319> pretty<00:07:47.560> close

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.830 
up with two forms that are pretty close

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:58.690 
up with two forms that are pretty close
to<00:07:48.039> bottles<00:07:48.840> okay<00:07:49.840> see<00:07:50.199> you<00:07:50.349> next<00:07:50.530> time

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:58.700
