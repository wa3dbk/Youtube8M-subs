00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.190
 for me to give me a new video of 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.940
 channels for your points in this video 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.670
 let's teach husbands shoulder bag 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.080
 germany plus your we have incorporated 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.080
 recently for something 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.259
 we are two who carry a rigid panel 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.830
 to maintain the position correctly 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.110
 of the bag on the side of the body 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.080
 the economic fabric that allows the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.040
 bag we move pretty if you want 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.040
 well placed 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.170
 about that and it looks pretty or has 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.040
 a little fast boy style 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.120
 of mastering 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.930
 the configuration that our 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 carrying shoulder bag 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 adjustable and you also carry 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.620
 your release kit 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.620
 and on the panel we have some ships 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.320
 with closures that we're going out 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.320
 To generate 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.370
 with the knife 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 functioning 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.330
 have here 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.870
 a plane 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.820
 for documentation 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.110
 similar little ones 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.940
 Clear 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.940
 has the answer dad 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.680
 and low tops have 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.180
 with station in the lid clear deposit 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.100
 also zipper for some little thing 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.119
 additional clear 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.939
 and it has the two departments 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.930
 leading the first of them as 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.300
 it's been usual, we have 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.500
 pocket with a zipper the person 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.000
 almost complete 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 Pocket page inside 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.270
 with this level of openness to 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.840
 Interior lining is waterproof 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.840
 in this period the slalom exterior 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.500
 and also under the lid 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.579
 full of main pocket then 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.579
 note that the configuration is a bit 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.079
 peculiar we stop well up close so that 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.340
 you see there are here they vary a bit 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.040
 about what we are what really 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.189
 used to doing 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.569
 The main pocket closure is with 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.569
 a fat man and we have 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.890
 is this waterproof nylon fabric 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.400
 what 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.590
 we close them by pulling this color and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.000
 then we fix with the clip 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.940
 the cord to the fabric to keep the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.730
 objects this kind of thing seems to me very 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.150
 practical if what we carry is material 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.980
 loose 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.079
 that we want to access with comfort 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.019
 because we know perfectly all 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.189
 pocket content in a jiffy 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.230
 if you see inside it also carries a 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.060
 small pocket of grids to add 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.440
 any 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.720
 to organize a little bit better 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.870
 elements 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.790
 apart from this already outside the fixed lid 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.290
 does not have interesting detail like this 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.500
 regulatory strap that also carries a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.500
 ring 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.770
 We have two external positions 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.090
 Metro concert an expected 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:38.750
 this cream concert arrives 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.750
 that takes apart 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.239
 for me a little detail here here 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.250
 the ballpoint pens arrive 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.170
 curiously so here 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.420
 has added that the little loops one to 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.420
 each side to contribute 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.700
 well, this is in this bag 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.980
 quite complete 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.310
 practical good on the one hand the purpose 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.349
 who have these two times 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.349
 for a small survival kit 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.040
 the system is a start 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.530
 It is all cordial greeting come the next 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.530
 video up to the view
