00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.480
 white we are here today with a new video 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.279
 dedicated aviv 15 last team change 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.960
 slightly the theme of these videos 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.090
 because because we are usually used to 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.790
 do three reviewed football players 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.610
 then lend and trani kart in this one 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.340
 klose should have come out week ago 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.230
 neymar and westling we are seeing 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.699
 but decided to do only klose and in 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.860
 sea ​​of ​​schneider do another 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.719
 type of video a squat builder in 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.059
 which, however, I am talking about this 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.460
 player that I think is one of the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.829
 most interesting midfielders of the game 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.409
 so from today there will probably be 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.600
 two reviews and a scud builder with 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.359
 those scott miller players they see 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.469
 the player we're going to receive 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.079
 on loan as the most player 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.089
 expensive of the team then teams that 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.690
 often maybe they know how to reach 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.139
 all 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.030
 the form I chose is a 4 3 3 4 la 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:03.639
 team you are already seeing it now ve 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.880
 I talk about it slightly dismissing us super 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:09.009
 that sneijder and in that position in the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.390
 its strengths its weaknesses 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.409
 etc. etc. 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.159
 the team is a 4 3 2 4 hybrid between series 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.009
 then a Turkish league and English league 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.299
 at barclays premier league we check 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:28.600
 my con leandro castan cahill filipe luis 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.000
 melo guarin sneijder so emenike cuadrado 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.310
 these men we see a little 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.219
 strength features on goal 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.570
 we put a player check check 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.210
 extraordinary and in my opinion is one of the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.950
 goalkeepers stronger than the game despite 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.840
 both arrived courtois tila put in 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.359
 bench that is, think of the panchinare one 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.579
 how czech at the chelsea will succeed 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.829
 I'm an extraordinary goalkeeper like then 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.170
 courtois remains one of the most goalkeepers 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.189
 strong of the game probably in the boat 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.899
 the premier league and my choice 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.670
 personal goes on him rather than on 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.109
 courtois more than anything else for a relationship 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.780
 of price quality 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.850
 then we have a very solid defense 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.600
 I would say because anyway they all have a 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.220
 excellent physique in all around 77 80 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.780
 which is not bad we never have with i 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.340
 lewis books that are two fullbacks that 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.190
 manage to push but also succeed in 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.410
 give so much in defense 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.600
 from the medium to high world race because 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.350
 however they come back a lot we have two 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.560
 central that although not fast 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.030
 they are however discrete in certain speed 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.030
 I'm not thiago silva a chiellini though 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.490
 71 74 is not bad at all they have a good one 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.020
 work with normal normal normal high 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.900
 therefore they do not go forward and above all 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.460
 they are very good both in defense and in 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 head despite castan is not 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.610
 very high but cahill one meter and 93 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.100
 trust you hear everything moving on to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.540
 midfield is a midfield that yes 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.610
 complete well because we have a 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.950
 player who breaks the game 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.360
 felipe melo normal others of work 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.060
 remember the statistics are really 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.770
 exceptional certainly to that little problem of the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.570
 three stars stand weaker than that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.360
 just a median is not like that 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.840
 fundamental if you wish you could put yourself 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.670
 even an apple tree in shape costs 50 thousand 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.890
 credits I preferred to keep the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.080
 low price while the basic version e 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.430
 of felipe melo and then we have guarino 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.530
 this is a more offensive midfielder 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.470
 because other normal than warcraft 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.660
 however, from a little bit in defense 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 therefore despite this works in defense 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.970
 It helps a great shot at a great 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.680
 pass because at the end 37 games 15 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.580
 assist and play as a midfielder 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.489
 central 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.410
 trust me it's not bad at all 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.350
 definitely worse schneider lo 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.239
 we will see later passing to the attack 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.920
 we have moussa sow for him too 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.660
 a fit version is available 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.970
 be careful because many say that 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.620
 could smell like upgrade in 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.200
 these weeks the Jews should 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.510
 go out around the first week of 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.000
 February therefore these days 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.620
 they might succeed is not bad at four 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.500
 salt pd weak sin for the three stars 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.120
 ski pro is a fake to the left 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.239
 striker because you still have excellent 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.610
 stay for a tip is not a wing a 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.640
 neymar is more a Christian rnaldo wing 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.090
 to keep a very strong room 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.980
 physically and good at making it happen 5 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.930
 matches 2 goals two aces is not mine 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.780
 forward reference point however knows 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.579
 hurt 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.350
 then we have cuadrado on the other end 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.400
 which is a 5 star attention spell 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.600
 because square went to chelsea 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.580
 so the price could rise 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.220
 in the next weeks 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.370
 51 matches 17 goals 14 asti is not 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.240
 but very much what it does creates superiority 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.100
 because square with its speed 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.560
 manages to split easily i 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.840
 defender fullbacks then maybe or pass 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.880
 for someone else who then creates anyway 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.100
 an important numerical ita in 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.440
 you know the tip very well 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.050
 and meghni that probably could 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.580
 maybe you're even get a review 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.620
 matches 6 goals 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.500
 definitely not bad because it's a tip 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.090
 so fast with a great 4-star shot 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.620
 weak foot therefore both of right and of 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.660
 left warcraft is ok 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.760
 sin only for the skill and stars 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.530
 we come to the strong point of the team that 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.720
 the player I took in 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.910
 consideration to create it 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.410
 wesley sneijder normal now of warner 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.419
 so different from last year 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.190
 where to have a high bass that made it 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.020
 a little more difficult to use 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.690
 let's start from the negative side the three stars 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.669
 a skill that penalizes him a little 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.260
 because anyway you can't do all the 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.540
 signature for the rest statistics 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.540
 extraordinary speed 77 seems 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.430
 even a little bit faster at 85 more 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.830
 agility then juggles 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.860
 quite well even in the narrow indeed 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.990
 definitely good because at 90 of 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.539
 however, ball control is a dribble 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.280
 of 87 therefore a similar agility dribbling 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.330
 to what we've seen for a month or 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.160
 for a neymar 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.150
 if we therefore exclude this dream 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.039
 mpg life changing your favorite foot 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.240
 so maybe moving from the right to 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.289
 left etc. and so on 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.990
 the fantastic shot of shooting 87 yes 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.729
 translates into a 94 shooting power 91 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.140
 of long then values ​​really 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.240
 the punishments are exceptional 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.510
 extraordinary then what he can do and is 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.950
 in this team he receives the ball and or passes 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.930
 the ball thanks also the passages that 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.190
 90 are extraordinary on the 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.620
 pass card then a value 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.720
 extraordinary or passes the ball a square 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.100
 from a dream and mail or pulls him between 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.260
 distance if the defense goes to 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.910
 crush five-star weak foot 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.400
 therefore to be able to pull if right than from 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.050
 left and then creates really 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.060
 many dangers contacts for a 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.260
 trequartista six games and 7 goals and three 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.520
 axes which means that it has in the center 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.500
 of the action puts him in the middle 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.870
 and so can i manage so well i 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.520
 so we have a lot of balls 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.930
 solid does not cost much because the 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.000
 more expensive and sneijder that costs around 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.830
 to 130 thousand credits 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.199
 then maybe we have a cuadrado too 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.889
 little cost about 15,000 20,000 per 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.270
 now he is moving to chelsea if 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.580
 you don't want him you could put maybe 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.319
 shaqiri see a little in each case one 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.610
 very solid team that makes sneijder 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.979
 and its strong point but really 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.330
 nothing bad to see some of you 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.979
 this team if you like it if you like it 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.750
 the idea of ​​making a scoop builder around 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:03.940
 to the third player of the team of the week 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.940
 we will see each other again soon
