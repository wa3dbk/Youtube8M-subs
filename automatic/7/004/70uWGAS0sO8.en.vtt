at Ibaka we're looking at cutting our LP
gas<00:01:08.149> costs<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:09.079> so<00:01:09.469> this<00:01:09.590> system<00:01:10.039> is<00:01:10.130> helping

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
gas costs and so this system is helping

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.160 
gas costs and so this system is helping
on<00:01:10.670> 10<00:01:10.909> barns<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.570> then<00:01:11.719> we're<00:01:11.899> going<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.109> move

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
on 10 barns and then we're going to move

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.810 
on 10 barns and then we're going to move
it<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.679> greenhouse<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.490> we<00:01:13.609> raise

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
it to the greenhouse and we raise

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.669 
it to the greenhouse and we raise
greenhouse<00:01:14.270> tomatoes<00:01:14.600> over<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:15.560> last

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
greenhouse tomatoes over the last

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.919 
greenhouse tomatoes over the last
several<00:01:16.039> years<00:01:16.310> I've<00:01:16.579> been<00:01:16.609> researching<00:01:17.359> this

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
several years I've been researching this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.160 
several years I've been researching this
for<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.560> more<00:01:19.009> automated<00:01:19.280> approach<00:01:20.240> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
for a more automated approach and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.359 
for a more automated approach and
something<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.619> would<00:01:21.740> be<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.920> little<00:01:22.189> more

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
something it would be a little more

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.889 
something it would be a little more
efficient<00:01:22.909> than<00:01:22.999> what<00:01:23.179> than<00:01:23.450> what<00:01:23.659> we<00:01:23.780> were

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
efficient than what than what we were

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.499 
efficient than what than what we were
previously<00:01:24.380> doing<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.039> by<00:01:25.909> receiving<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
previously doing so by receiving the

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.090 
previously doing so by receiving the
grant<00:01:26.749> money<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.609> kind<00:01:28.609> of<00:01:29.560> enticed<00:01:30.560> us<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.979> go

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
grant money it kind of enticed us to go

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.580 
grant money it kind of enticed us to go
ahead<00:01:31.219> and<00:01:31.579> take<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.359> chance<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.990> do<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.350> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
ahead and take a chance and do it and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.859 
ahead and take a chance and do it and
and<00:01:33.799> we<00:01:34.280> found<00:01:34.520> out<00:01:34.759> it's<00:01:35.270> worked<00:01:35.509> very<00:01:35.810> well

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
and we found out it's worked very well

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.770 
and we found out it's worked very well
and<00:01:36.319> you<00:01:36.590> know<00:01:36.799> I'm<00:01:37.189> glad<00:01:37.460> we<00:01:37.640> did<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
and you know I'm glad we did and and the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.569 
and you know I'm glad we did and and the
grant<00:01:39.020> money<00:01:39.079> has<00:01:39.409> been<00:01:39.499> a<00:01:39.560> big<00:01:40.069> difference

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
grant money has been a big difference

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.580 
grant money has been a big difference
and<00:01:40.819> you<00:01:41.119> know<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.390> was<00:01:41.539> was<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:41.960> big<00:01:42.200> part<00:01:42.409> of

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
and you know it was was a big part of

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.169 
and you know it was was a big part of
our<00:01:42.710> decision-making<00:01:43.249> on<00:01:43.639> whether<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.030> go

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
our decision-making on whether to go

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.989 
our decision-making on whether to go
ahead<00:01:44.210> with<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.659> project<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.909> here's<00:01:46.909> a

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
ahead with the project so here's a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.760 
ahead with the project so here's a
perfect<00:01:47.179> example<00:01:47.389> we<00:01:47.840> got<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.079> gentleman<00:01:48.380> who

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
perfect example we got a gentleman who

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.580 
perfect example we got a gentleman who
has<00:01:49.369> found<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.119> way<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:50.749> deal<00:01:50.960> with<00:01:51.079> his<00:01:51.200> input

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
has found a way to deal with his input

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.620 
has found a way to deal with his input
costs<00:01:51.920> because<00:01:52.670> as<00:01:52.819> we<00:01:52.969> know<00:01:52.999> the<00:01:53.299> medium

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
costs because as we know the medium

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.569 
costs because as we know the medium
between<00:01:53.749> input<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.289> profit<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.249> getting

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
between input and profit is getting

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.279 
between input and profit is getting
slimmer<00:01:55.880> all<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.210> time<00:01:56.450> here's<00:01:57.109> a<00:01:57.170> perfect

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
slimmer all the time here's a perfect

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.779 
slimmer all the time here's a perfect
example<00:01:57.469> whereas<00:01:57.829> gentle<00:01:58.069> minutes<00:01:58.369> has<00:01:58.549> done

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
example whereas gentle minutes has done

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.099 
example whereas gentle minutes has done
a<00:01:58.819> good<00:01:58.999> job<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.450> looking<00:01:59.689> at<00:01:59.780> controlling

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
a good job and looking at controlling

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:01.899 
a good job and looking at controlling
some<00:02:00.319> of<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:00.469> cost<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.039> factor<00:02:01.579> trust<00:02:01.759> was

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
some of this cost and factor trust was

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.219 
some of this cost and factor trust was
