walk lick go any more uses this a lot
there's<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.429> little<00:00:08.670> pattern<00:00:08.970> repeating

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
there's a little pattern repeating

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.379 
there's a little pattern repeating
pattern<00:00:09.719> sounds<00:00:10.230> like<00:00:10.349> this

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
basically pay them it's lower and we're

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.790 
basically pay them it's lower and we're
gonna<00:00:24.750> start<00:00:25.019> off<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.350> flat<00:00:25.560> five

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800

repay the twelfth fret on the B string
hang<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> fifteenth<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.840> pull<00:00:34.050> back

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
hang on to the fifteenth and pull back

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.119 
hang on to the fifteenth and pull back
up<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> twelfth<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:38.010> pattern<00:00:39.710> once

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.619 

and<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.280> repeat<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.149> maybe<00:00:45.360> nine

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and we repeat that I think maybe nine

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.580 
and we repeat that I think maybe nine
times<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.289> did<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> maybe<00:00:47.370> eight<00:00:47.610> times<00:00:48.469> at<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
times I did it maybe eight times at the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
times I did it maybe eight times at the
end<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.190> go

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.830 

something<00:01:01.300> like<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.450> we<00:01:02.200> do<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:04.120> I<00:01:04.720> think

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
something like that we do and I think

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.590 
something like that we do and I think
the<00:01:05.140> beat<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.980> in<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:06.550> lick<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.330> the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
the beat in in this lick is on the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.590 
the beat in in this lick is on the
twelfth<00:01:08.290> round<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.650> end<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.300> first

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
twelfth round the end when we first

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
twelfth round the end when we first
picked<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.930> twelfth<00:01:11.200> fret<00:01:11.320> on<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.590> B<00:01:11.920> string

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
picked the twelfth fret on the B string

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.690 
picked the twelfth fret on the B string
so<00:01:13.540> this<00:01:13.690> flat<00:01:14.680> five<00:01:14.890> comes<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.340> little<00:01:15.490> bit

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
so this flat five comes a little bit

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.719 
so this flat five comes a little bit
before<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.060> beat<00:01:16.210> so<00:01:20.790> sort<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.850> thing<00:01:22.060> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
before the beat so sort of thing I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.360 
before the beat so sort of thing I
believe<00:01:24.729> anyway<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.900> you<00:01:29.680> have<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.950> listen<00:01:30.340> to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
believe anyway so you have to listen to

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.460 
believe anyway so you have to listen to
like<00:01:30.550> my<00:01:31.180> actual<00:01:31.390> track<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.050> slow<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.320> down<00:01:32.350> a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
like my actual track and slow it down a

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:43.650 
like my actual track and slow it down a
bit<00:01:32.560> maybe<00:01:32.979> if<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.190> can't<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.450> next

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
bit maybe if you can't then the next

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:52.260 
bit maybe if you can't then the next
part<00:01:43.900> is

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.940 

that's<00:01:53.270> how<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.450> play<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.590> we're<00:01:54.829> gonna

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
that's how I play it so we're gonna

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.910 
that's how I play it so we're gonna
hammer<00:01:55.189> on<00:01:55.429> from<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.960> twelfth<00:01:56.960> fret<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.679> B

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
hammer on from the twelfth fret of the B

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.719 
hammer on from the twelfth fret of the B

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
string I think a bit sharp of the kind

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.400 
string I think a bit sharp of the kind
of<00:02:19.519> full<00:02:19.730> tone<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.299> where<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.540> Bend<00:02:20.810> up<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:26.410> so

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
of full tone is where I Bend up so so

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.089 
of full tone is where I Bend up so so
I'll<00:02:27.530> Bend<00:02:27.769> up<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.280> I've<00:02:29.030> tone<00:02:29.269> in<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.540> bit

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
I'll Bend up and I've tone in a bit

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.610 
I'll Bend up and I've tone in a bit
firstly<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:32.450> I've<00:02:32.569> been<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:33.110> little<00:02:33.410> clearer

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
firstly that I've been a little clearer

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:42.160 
firstly that I've been a little clearer
laughter<00:02:33.920> that

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.900 

then<00:02:43.170> we'll<00:02:43.380> go<00:02:44.780> which<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.990> 1,200<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:47.070> floor

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
then we'll go which is 1,200 a floor

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.040 
then we'll go which is 1,200 a floor
seem<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.510> about<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.050> well<00:02:49.230> 28<00:02:50.870> then<00:02:51.870> we'll

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
seem to be about this well 28 then we'll

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:06.940 
seem to be about this well 28 then we'll
go<00:02:53.240> one<00:02:54.240> more<00:02:54.300> time<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.620> goes<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.430> this

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.560 

is<00:03:07.950> ever<00:03:08.190> gonna<00:03:08.490> go<00:03:08.660> Bobby<00:03:09.660> go<00:03:09.810> first<00:03:10.290> finger

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.130 

so<00:03:15.570> 12<00:03:16.050> 12<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.800> your<00:03:17.010> high<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.930> find<00:03:18.930> all
