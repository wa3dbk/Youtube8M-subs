00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.650

 party she's one of the startups the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.619
 hotter of the moment and should become one 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.690
 even more in the coming months 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.430
 founded in 2005 twitter did a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 important announcement yesterday it's obviously 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 in less than 140 characters that the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.769
 news fell the tweet was the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.850
 following we have just submitted 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.820
 confidential way 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.870
 a form s-1 to the sc the policeman 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 American stock exchange for a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.809
 IPO in the tweet 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 following all been claimed good 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.839
 now returns to work 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.190
 if the information is important for 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.230
 twitter she is also for all those 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.429
 who believed in it from its launch in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.570
 investing a few thousand even 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.550
 a few million dollars 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.600
 as is the case for jeff bezos the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.609
 amazon boss 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 the announcement of the arrival of twitter 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 would be the most important introduction 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 on the stock market since facebook's year 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.270
 last before we even side value 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.189
 of twitter is already estimated at 9 billion 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 dollars is a lot I like friend 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.680
 although we will hear a lot about 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.720
 of this introduction 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 and if the specter of the failed launch of 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.110
 facebook could also loom to 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.579
 the horizon for twitter we are ready to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 bet that anyone who buys 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.790
 day shares the first 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 transactions should do quickly 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.079
 to grow their business investments 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.939
 to be followed carefully if you use 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.350
 outlook point com who replaced hotmail 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.750
 you should be happy to learn 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.979
 that microsoft has finally added support 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.079
 from imap to his mail 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.180
 before hotmail settle for the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.280
 pop protocol but the imap adds some 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.149
 synchronization features 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 obviously very interesting 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.200
 so when you read a message on 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.090
 your mobile the server will synchronize 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 this action and the mail will be displayed 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.390
 like him on your computer and this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.009
 obviously works with all 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.740
 email clients on mobile 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.869
 windows phone ios android or pc and mac 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.729
 to change your settings please visit 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.619
 on the site but.fr I put you 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.070
 the address of this article in which we 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.620
 gives you 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.850
 info to change your account is 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.730
 as in imap 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.780
 do not thank us pleasure here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.820
 a story not trivial that has us 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.380
 a lot rain this morning a character from 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.360
 video game will land in a system 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.280
 of exploitation she is called cortana and 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.350
 she is the artificial intelligence that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.060
 assists the main character in the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.340
 series of halo games i'm sure you 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.810
 know eco systems microsoft oblige 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.260
 the developers of windows phone and 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 windows 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.740
 we thought he would be very nice 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.520
 of cortana guests on our smartphones and 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.620
 our computers 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.050
 it will be done soon since 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.430
 cortana will be the next syria of 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.989
 windows phone and windows 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.220
 it will be integrated into the systems 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.810
 exploitation to respond to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.760
 voice commands and will be able 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.900
 to learn and evolve in order to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.090
 adapt to his owner 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.400
 and this thanks to its connection with bing and 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.720
 the habits of the user cortana 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 should therefore make his arrival but 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.770
 it's not right now between 2014 and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.080
 2016 on windows phone but also on 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.850
 windows 8 points 1 as well as on the xbox 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.250
 world where she would also be part 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.269
 integral of the operating system 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.650
 the question of the day comes from 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.850
 joselito who wonders about the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.370
 apple strategy they ask us 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.900
 so why the iphone 5 has been removed 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.400
 from the apple catalog while the iphone 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.350
 4s is still on sale 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.299
 not stupid as a question thanks to josÃ©lito 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.810
 to have asked and thank you also for his 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.940
 loyalty 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.989
 so to sum up the iphone 4s is the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.640
 apple cow of milk 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.680
 it's been profitable for a long time and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.540
 it is actually the low cost iphone good 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.650
 market that all those who do not have the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.850
 ways to afford the very last 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.560
 model can afford to acquire 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.180
 and for cheap it's from elsewhere 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.590
 usually offered for any new 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.140
 subscription to a mobile operator 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.540
 on the other hand the iphone 5 c is a simple 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.190
 update the iphone 5 we observe a 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.560
 very slight improvement of the whole 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.060
 components and performance 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.400
 in clear there was no longer room for 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.959
 times for the 5th and 5th c is for this 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.489
 reason that apple decided to withdraw 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.500
 the iphone 5 of its catalog 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.940
 in short if you want to give you the iphone 5 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.790
 you can also do it by buying 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.350
 iphone 5 used or on sale a 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.610
 color shell and a machine to do 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.239
 holes and hu should have little 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.459
 near the same thing 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.840
 much cheaper it's friday as 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.860
 every Friday it's the Friday of 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.720

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.640

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.210
 a portable battery to recharge 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.010
 your mobile is the shape of nine 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.450

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.890
