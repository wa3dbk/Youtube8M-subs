00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
think that's something that maybe would

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
think that's something that maybe would
happen<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> think<00:01:09.509> other<00:01:09.630> sports<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.500> kind

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
happen you think other sports will kind

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.870 
happen you think other sports will kind
of<00:01:10.740> look<00:01:10.800> at<00:01:11.009> that<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.369> something<00:01:11.490> able<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of look at that it's something able to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.410 
of look at that it's something able to
try<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:13.670> possible<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.909> depends<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
try to do possible is it depends on

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.510 
try to do possible is it depends on
timing<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.440> basically<00:01:16.650> picasso<00:01:16.979> at

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
timing so it's all basically picasso at

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.649 
timing so it's all basically picasso at
the<00:01:17.580> same<00:01:17.790> time<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.869> no<00:01:19.759> but<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:21.030> things<00:01:21.540> are

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the same time but no but how things are

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.420 
the same time but no but how things are
fixed<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> game<00:01:22.080> goes<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.890> team<00:01:23.070> came<00:01:23.220> sign

everybody<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.030> mean<00:01:24.440> each<00:01:25.440> make<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.770> their<00:01:25.890> own

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
everybody I mean each make up their own

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.139 
everybody I mean each make up their own
choice<00:01:26.130> over<00:01:26.310> thinking<00:01:26.490> sign<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:26.940> how<00:01:27.060> much

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
choice over thinking sign for how much

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.240 
choice over thinking sign for how much
even<00:01:27.390> play<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.810> itself<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.920> let<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.190> make

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
even play for itself they let them make

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.000 
even play for itself they let them make
their<00:01:29.399> own<00:01:29.460> decisions

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
their own decisions

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.890 
their own decisions
what<00:01:31.640> are<00:01:31.760> some<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.060> things<00:01:32.150> are<00:01:32.600> seeing

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
what are some of the things are seeing

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.110 
what are some of the things are seeing
where<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.440> team<00:01:33.680> is<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:34.250> guess<00:01:34.760> it's<00:01:34.940> kind<00:01:35.090> of

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
where the team is I guess it's kind of

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.390 
where the team is I guess it's kind of
hard<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.360> say<00:01:35.540> a<00:01:35.570> team<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:35.930> improving<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.830> you

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
hard to say a team is improving and you

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.590 
hard to say a team is improving and you
know<00:01:37.490> you're<00:01:37.760> playing<00:01:37.850> about<00:01:38.210> your<00:01:38.360> night<00:01:38.450> in

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600

pads<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.110> what<00:01:39.590> are<00:01:39.710> some<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:39.980> things<00:01:40.040> you

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
pads but what are some of the things you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.580 
pads but what are some of the things you
do<00:01:40.520> kind<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:40.880> see<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.270> where<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.170> team<00:01:42.350> will<00:01:42.470> be

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
do kind of see is where the team will be

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.500 
do kind of see is where the team will be
improved<00:01:42.980> from<00:01:43.220> last<00:01:43.280> season<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:43.970> think<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
improved from last season I think the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.890
