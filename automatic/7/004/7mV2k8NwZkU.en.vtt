that's about it but this is my natural

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.480 
that's about it but this is my natural
hair<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> I'll<00:04:21.450> pull<00:04:21.690> it

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
hair and I'll pull it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.030 
hair and I'll pull it
down<00:04:24.490> so<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.820> can<00:04:25.060> see<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.290> guess<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.770> will

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
down so you can see and I guess I will

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.160 
down so you can see and I guess I will
measure<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.670> do<00:04:27.790> like<00:04:27.820> only<00:04:28.240> chick<00:04:28.720> as<00:04:28.930> well

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
measure it to do like only chick as well

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.980 
measure it to do like only chick as well
okay<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.800> have<00:04:30.010> my<00:04:30.040> tape<00:04:30.460> measure<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.420> I'll

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
okay so I have my tape measure and I'll

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.090 
okay so I have my tape measure and I'll
measure<00:04:33.630> its<00:04:34.630> backside<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.470> feel<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:35.890> it's

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
measure its backside I feel like it's

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:48.640 
measure its backside I feel like it's
been<00:04:36.280> asleep<00:04:36.550> for<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.970> while

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:05:07.500 

okay<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:49.280> it's<00:04:49.520> like<00:04:49.580> 10<00:04:49.970> inches<00:04:50.449> on<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:50.840> side

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.900 

it's<00:05:08.080> 11<00:05:08.560> inches<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.920> this<00:05:09.070> side<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:09.700> size

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
it's 11 inches on this side so this size
