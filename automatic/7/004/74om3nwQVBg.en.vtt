00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
on a 325 CI BMW first you're gonna need

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.599 
on a 325 CI BMW first you're gonna need
seventeen<00:00:16.010> millimeter<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.190> sixteen

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
seventeen millimeter and sixteen

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.320 
seventeen millimeter and sixteen
millimeter<00:00:17.970> sockets<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:20.460> take<00:00:20.640> off<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.000> under

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330

underneath<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.590> car<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.130> think<00:00:26.970> there's<00:00:27.119> like

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
underneath the car I think there's like

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.919 
underneath the car I think there's like
six<00:00:27.689> bolts<00:00:28.609> after<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.760> remove<00:00:30.060> those<00:00:30.359> bolts

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
six bolts after you remove those bolts

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.650 
six bolts after you remove those bolts
that<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:31.920> give<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.610> access<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that will give you access to the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.410 
that will give you access to the
bushings<00:00:34.170> underneath<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.219> car<00:00:35.430> or

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
bushings underneath the car or

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.209 
bushings underneath the car or
underneath<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.380> plate<00:00:38.809> there's<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.770> want

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
underneath that plate there's two I want

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.110 
underneath that plate there's two I want
to<00:00:41.309> say<00:00:41.430> Seventeen's<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.329> sixteen<00:00:42.840> either<00:00:43.140> one

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
to say Seventeen's or sixteen either one

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.490 
to say Seventeen's or sixteen either one
bolts<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> hold<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.070> bushing<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> car

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
bolts that hold that bushing to the car

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.189 
bolts that hold that bushing to the car
take<00:00:49.500> those<00:00:49.710> two<00:00:49.980> bolts<00:00:50.430> out<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:52.020> lower

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
take those two bolts out that lower

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.670 
take those two bolts out that lower
control<00:00:52.530> arm<00:00:52.800> would<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.250> drop<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:54.680> after

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
control arm would then drop down after

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.439 
control arm would then drop down after
it<00:00:55.710> drops<00:00:56.039> down<00:00:56.690> usually<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> fluid<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
it drops down usually all the fluid is

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.369 
it drops down usually all the fluid is
out<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> bushing<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.080> hit

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
out of the bushing you just you just hit

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.820 
out of the bushing you just you just hit
it<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> hammer<00:01:05.330> like<00:01:06.330> usually<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> big<00:01:07.290> like

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
it with a hammer like usually a big like

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
it with a hammer like usually a big like
32<00:01:08.310> ounce<00:01:08.520> hammer<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.299> it'll<00:01:09.630> break<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> rest

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
32 ounce hammer and it'll break the rest

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.080 
32 ounce hammer and it'll break the rest
of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> rubber<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.159> holding<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of the rubber that's holding the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.630 
of the rubber that's holding the
aluminum<00:01:13.490> piece<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> metal<00:01:15.840> core<00:01:16.640> once

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
aluminum piece to the metal core once

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.550 
aluminum piece to the metal core once
you<00:01:17.790> break<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.180> loose<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.780> aluminum<00:01:19.409> piece

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
you break that loose the aluminum piece

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
you break that loose the aluminum piece
of<00:01:19.680> basically<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.280> fall<00:01:20.490> off<00:01:22.939> then<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.180> put

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of basically just fall off then you put

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.310 
of basically just fall off then you put
the<00:01:24.570> puller<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:26.750> whatever<00:01:27.750> puller<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the puller on it whatever puller you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.670 
the puller on it whatever puller you
have<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> three<00:01:29.009> coil<00:01:29.790> puller<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.680> pull

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
have like a three coil puller and pull

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
have like a three coil puller and pull
the<00:01:31.799> rest<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.250> core<00:01:32.520> off<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.030> control

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the rest of that core off the control

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
the rest of that core off the control
arm<00:01:33.920> once<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.520> off<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> put<00:01:38.369> some

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
arm once that is off you then put some

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.980 
arm once that is off you then put some
grease<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.600> control<00:01:40.560> arm<00:01:40.590> itself<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
grease on the control arm itself and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.609 
grease on the control arm itself and
grab<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> new<00:01:43.350> bushing<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.210> install<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:46.020> not

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
grab the new bushing and install or not

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.310 
grab the new bushing and install or not
install<00:01:46.979> put<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.579> grease<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.720> inside<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
install put some grease on the inside of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.499 
install put some grease on the inside of
the<00:01:49.409> bushing<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> had<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.119> grind

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the bushing what I had to do is grind

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
the bushing what I had to do is grind
out<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> rubber<00:01:52.829> inside

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
out a little bit of the rubber inside

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
out a little bit of the rubber inside
the<00:01:53.399> bushing<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> seems<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.420> they

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the bushing because it seems like they

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080 
the bushing because it seems like they
had<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> little<00:01:55.829> extra<00:01:56.040> from<00:01:56.579> whatever<00:01:56.759> they

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
had a little extra from whatever they

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.289 
had a little extra from whatever they
molded<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.110> rubber<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> grinded<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
molded the the rubber so I grinded a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.380 
molded the the rubber so I grinded a
little<00:02:00.540> bit<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:02.090> just<00:02:03.090> made<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
little bit of that out just made it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.410 
little bit of that out just made it
easier<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> install<00:02:04.200> once<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.950> wasn't

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
easier to install once that wasn't

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.070 
easier to install once that wasn't
greased<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.190> grinded<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.670> little<00:02:08.910> bit

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
greased up and and grinded a little bit

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.430 
greased up and and grinded a little bit
then<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.470> hammered<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.780> metal<00:02:12.780> core

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
then I just hammered the metal core

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.580 
then I just hammered the metal core
to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> new<00:02:13.920> control<00:02:14.340> arm<00:02:15.050> try<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.440> hit

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
to the new control arm try not to hit

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.390 
to the new control arm try not to hit
the<00:02:16.800> aluminum<00:02:17.700> part<00:02:18.170> or<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.860> rubber<00:02:20.070> because

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the aluminum part or the rubber because

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.280 
the aluminum part or the rubber because
then<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.820> bust<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.300> bushing<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.140> it's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
then you bust the bushing and then it's

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.820 
then you bust the bushing and then it's
basically<00:02:22.680> ruined<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.490> once<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.620> hammer<00:02:25.620> that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
basically ruined so once you hammer that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.780 
basically ruined so once you hammer that
on<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:30.390> install<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.250> install<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.670> two

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
on you just install it install the two

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.880 
on you just install it install the two
bolts<00:02:33.030> back<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:34.080> control<00:02:34.320> arm<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.740> then

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
bolts back on the control arm and then
