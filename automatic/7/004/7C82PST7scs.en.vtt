00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.040
 hello to all, today came another 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.349
 I already opened the package to know what 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.439
 there will be a talk and let's show what 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.750
 it came this time means came out such 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.989
 here are the credit card knives that are now very 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.040
 popular on the internet is very common 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:37.980
 a lot of advertising and in 2 pieces cost 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.489
 about 120 rubles for 2 pieces 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.489
 let's open and see what of 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:52.710
 plastic and here we see the cardboard itself 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.679
 packaging is already instruction 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.050
 we fell and here is such a nakleechka 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.149
 which remove does not open the envelope with 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.580
 with a knife here we see the knife itself fixed and 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.560
 some inscriptions in English are also in 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.840
 we already had a manual 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.770
 It is written how to get the legs and what he 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.439
 cuts his functionality let's see 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:26.610
 with me it means so here it comes off 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:29.640
 again a plastic envelope and we take out 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.969
 scripture and so here's the knife itself with me 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.479
 it means it is made of plastic 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.159
 cosmos and blades are made of iron 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.600
 actually for looked at the pictures 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.329
 it seemed that we would be completely 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.909
 metal actually no such here 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.460
 plastic knife itself was able to day by size 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.789
 like regular credit cards just a little 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.979
 thicker means we have such a button 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.250
 retainer to reach the blade 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.490
 press and the blade pops up to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.850
 fold the knife you need to turn one side 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.369
 2 just nadovit ie we 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.690

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.370

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.959

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.110
 here a little and try to incise a little 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.239

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.760
