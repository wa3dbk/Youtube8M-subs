00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
detail into this more as you can see

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.950 
detail into this more as you can see
some<00:01:07.190> engine<00:01:07.640> detailing<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.330> side<00:01:08.689> of<00:01:08.719> the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960

some engine detailing on the side of the
wings<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.180> same<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:11.840> could<00:01:12.680> have

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
wings the is the same I could have

improved<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.130> cockpit<00:01:13.310> well<00:01:13.670> but<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:13.850> think<00:01:14.180> I

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
improved a cockpit well but I think I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.230 
improved a cockpit well but I think I
don't<00:01:15.079> know<00:01:15.170> snowspeeders<00:01:16.159> why<00:01:16.729> we<00:01:16.969> get<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.119> lot

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
don't know snowspeeders why we get a lot

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.270 
don't know snowspeeders why we get a lot
of<00:01:17.299> them<00:01:17.479> but<00:01:17.689> this<00:01:18.409> one's<00:01:18.590> more<00:01:18.770> gray<00:01:18.979> scale

maybe maybe there's an extra with the
three<00:01:29.509> spring-loaded<00:01:29.960> missiles<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:31.429> get

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
three spring-loaded missiles that I get

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.919 
three spring-loaded missiles that I get
that<00:01:31.939> we<00:01:32.329> get<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:32.539> don't<00:01:32.719> know<00:01:32.780> how<00:01:32.899> many

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
that we get I don't know how many

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.609 
that we get I don't know how many
launches<00:01:33.259> there<00:01:33.649> are<00:01:33.820> but<00:01:34.820> um<00:01:35.060> see<00:01:36.049> looks<00:01:36.530> like

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
launches there are but um see looks like

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.649 
launches there are but um see looks like
there's<00:01:36.770> two<00:01:36.890> monitors<00:01:37.159> okay<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.119> launchers

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
there's two monitors okay to launchers

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.380 
there's two monitors okay to launchers
and<00:01:38.749> three<00:01:39.679> missiles<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.700> they're<00:01:41.030> pushing

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
and three missiles so they're pushing

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.120 
and three missiles so they're pushing
that<00:01:41.570> I'm<00:01:41.780> loving<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:42.590> they're<00:01:42.799> replaced

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
that I'm loving that they're replaced

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.319 
that I'm loving that they're replaced
the<00:01:43.310> flick<00:01:43.520> fired<00:01:43.729> missiles<00:01:43.969> with<00:01:44.179> these

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
the flick fired missiles with these

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.419 
the flick fired missiles with these
because<00:01:44.539> these<00:01:44.689> works<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.320> much<00:01:45.350> better<00:01:45.679> you

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
because these works so much better you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.099 
because these works so much better you
can<00:01:46.670> shoot<00:01:46.850> all<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.149> way<00:01:47.240> across<00:01:47.359> a<00:01:47.569> room<00:01:47.899> it's

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
can shoot all the way across a room it's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.919 
can shoot all the way across a room it's
ridiculous<00:01:48.859> um<00:01:49.399> before<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.509> flick<00:01:50.689> fired

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
ridiculous um before the flick fired

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.569 
ridiculous um before the flick fired
missiles<00:01:51.109> going<00:01:51.469> out<00:01:51.590> like<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.770> few<00:01:51.979> inches<00:01:52.130> few

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
missiles going out like a few inches few

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
got different engine pieces that we see

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.110

droids is another top view of the
snowspeeder<00:04:04.730> I'm<00:04:05.000> not<00:04:05.239> liking<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:05.660> grayscale

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
snowspeeder I'm not liking the grayscale

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.430 
snowspeeder I'm not liking the grayscale
I'm<00:04:06.349> sorry<00:04:06.680> I'm<00:04:06.919> just<00:04:06.950> more<00:04:07.669> of<00:04:07.730> an<00:04:07.819> orange<00:04:08.000> fan

I'm sorry I'm just more of an orange fan
there's<00:04:09.440> another<00:04:09.650> side<00:04:09.889> of<00:04:09.919> the<00:04:10.040> snowspeeder

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
there's another side of the snowspeeder

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.860 
there's another side of the snowspeeder
can<00:04:10.639> see<00:04:10.760> what<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.000> flaps<00:04:11.239> up<00:04:11.480> right<00:04:11.660> there

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
can see what the flaps up right there

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.869 
can see what the flaps up right there
it's<00:04:12.019> got<00:04:12.169> some<00:04:12.379> nicer<00:04:12.829> and<00:04:13.040> you'd<00:04:13.549> be<00:04:13.669> tailing

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
it's got some nicer and you'd be tailing

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.550 
it's got some nicer and you'd be tailing
down<00:04:14.120> there<00:04:14.389> looks<00:04:15.019> like<00:04:15.169> some<00:04:15.290> sticker

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
down there looks like some sticker

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.770 
down there looks like some sticker
detailing<00:04:16.070> on<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.190> side<00:04:16.609> on<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.539> sides

detailing on the side on the sides

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.140 
detailing on the side on the sides
everywhere<00:04:18.260> looks<00:04:18.380> like<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.500> lot<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.739> stickers

everywhere looks like a lot of stickers
which<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.329> ok<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.079> guess<00:04:21.320> if<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.500> stickers<00:04:21.829> are

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
which is ok I guess if the stickers are

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.520 
which is ok I guess if the stickers are
you<00:04:22.250> know<00:04:22.820> large<00:04:23.180> enough<00:04:23.419> figures<00:04:24.110> look<00:04:24.260> once

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
you know large enough figures look once
