00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.530 

now<00:00:08.340> I've<00:00:08.460> talked<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.030> differences

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
now I've talked about the differences

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.780 
now I've talked about the differences
between<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:10.410> different<00:00:10.860> countries<00:00:11.490> that

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
between the different countries that

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.650 
between the different countries that
produce<00:00:12.240> seed<00:00:12.900> beads<00:00:13.250> like<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.639> Japanese<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
produce seed beads like the Japanese and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.170 
produce seed beads like the Japanese and
the<00:00:15.780> Czech<00:00:16.020> Republic<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> Chinese<00:00:17.850> on

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the Czech Republic and the Chinese on

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.960 
the Czech Republic and the Chinese on
the<00:00:18.240> Taiwanese<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:18.960> those<00:00:19.140> kinds<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.590> things

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
the Taiwanese all those kinds of things

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.929 
the Taiwanese all those kinds of things
but<00:00:20.970> even<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.990> ins<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> Japanese<00:00:23.550> seed

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
but even with ins just the Japanese seed

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.570 
but even with ins just the Japanese seed
bead<00:00:24.180> manufacturers<00:00:25.019> there<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.439> three<00:00:25.740> there

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
bead manufacturers there are three there

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.820 
bead manufacturers there are three there
are<00:00:26.900> differences<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:27.960> those<00:00:28.500> beads

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
are differences in those beads

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.389 
are differences in those beads
themselves<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.119> significant<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.399> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
themselves that are significant and the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.790 
themselves that are significant and the
three<00:00:32.610> manufacturers<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.510> Miyuki<00:00:34.020> mat<00:00:34.380> suno

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
three manufacturers are Miyuki mat suno

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.209 
three manufacturers are Miyuki mat suno
and<00:00:35.040> Toho<00:00:36.140> Miyuki<00:00:37.140> seed<00:00:37.380> beads<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
and Toho Miyuki seed beads are going to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.090 
and Toho Miyuki seed beads are going to
be<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> skinniest<00:00:38.820> seed<00:00:39.420> beads<00:00:39.710> they<00:00:40.710> have

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
be the skinniest seed beads they have

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
be the skinniest seed beads they have
the<00:00:41.309> most<00:00:41.489> rounded<00:00:42.120> profile<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> they're

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the most rounded profile and they're

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.490 
the most rounded profile and they're
they're<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.430> skinniest<00:00:44.899> Toho<00:00:45.899> beads<00:00:46.289> are

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
they're the skinniest Toho beads are

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.060 
they're the skinniest Toho beads are
going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.129> fatter<00:00:48.059> they're<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:49.440> tubular

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
going to be fatter they're more tubular

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.850 
going to be fatter they're more tubular
shaped<00:00:50.340> they're<00:00:50.730> almost<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.860> cylinder

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
shaped they're almost like a cylinder

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
shaped they're almost like a cylinder
bead<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.520> delica<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:54.270> IE<00:00:54.420> co<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
bead like a delica or an IE co or a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.260 
bead like a delica or an IE co or a
treasurer<00:00:55.379> almost<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.879> still

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
treasurer almost like that but still

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.060 
treasurer almost like that but still
with<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.480> rounded<00:00:58.020> softly<00:00:58.410> rounded<00:00:58.739> edges

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
with the rounded softly rounded edges

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.010 
with the rounded softly rounded edges
it's<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> fatter<00:01:00.210> seed<00:01:00.750> bead

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it's just that it's a fatter seed bead

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.590 
it's just that it's a fatter seed bead
and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> mat-su<00:01:02.309> no<00:01:02.699> seed<00:01:02.910> beads<00:01:03.180> are

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and then the mat-su no seed beads are

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.230 
and then the mat-su no seed beads are
the<00:01:03.629> most<00:01:04.409> irregular<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> Japanese<00:01:05.970> seed

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the most irregular of the Japanese seed

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.640 
the most irregular of the Japanese seed
beads<00:01:06.710> they<00:01:07.710> tend<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.520> more

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
beads they tend to have much more

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.640 
beads they tend to have much more
variation<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.760> width<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.450> their<00:01:13.140> beads<00:01:13.439> so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
variation in the width of their beads so

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.109 
variation in the width of their beads so
you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> lot<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.310> calling<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you have to do a lot more calling out of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.880 
you have to do a lot more calling out of
the<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.869> fat<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.619> skinny

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the really fat and the really skinny

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.870 
the really fat and the really skinny
ones<00:01:17.150> however<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.530> forth<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.640> very

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
ones however and so forth for that very

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
ones however and so forth for that very
reason<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.299> lot<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.479> people<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:22.259> use<00:01:22.619> mat-su

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
reason a lot of people don't use mat-su

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.969 
reason a lot of people don't use mat-su
no<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.110> Matz<00:01:25.500> uno<00:01:25.799> has

three swatches are all done with size 8
seed<00:01:47.070> beads<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.329> three<00:01:48.659> different

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
seed beads and these are three different

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
seed beads and these are three different
manufacturers<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
manufacturers so here this is the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
manufacturers so here this is the
skinniest<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:53.130> right<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.149> see

skinniest one right here you can see

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.690 
skinniest one right here you can see
where<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> seed<00:01:54.750> beads<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.380> smaller<00:01:56.280> than

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
where the seed beads are smaller than

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.450 
where the seed beads are smaller than
all<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.240> these<00:01:57.390> other<00:01:57.600> ones<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
all of these other ones here this is the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.450 
all of these other ones here this is the
one<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.759> done<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.180> Miyuki<00:02:00.689> seed<00:02:00.899> beads

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
one that's done with Miyuki seed beads

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.929 
one that's done with Miyuki seed beads
here<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:03.299> how<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.689> bead<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.530> wider<00:02:05.100> across

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
here see how this bead is wider across

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.809 
here see how this bead is wider across
and<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> looks<00:02:06.810> almost<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.320> cylinder

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
and it looks almost like a cylinder

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.460 
and it looks almost like a cylinder
that's<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.270> Toho<00:02:09.720> brand<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.440> then

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
that's the Toho brand and then

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.520 
that's the Toho brand and then
really<00:02:11.740> big<00:02:12.010> ones<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:13.150> they're<00:02:13.840> much<00:02:14.140> fatter

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
really big ones here they're much fatter

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.000 
really big ones here they're much fatter
and<00:02:14.950> wider<00:02:15.460> in<00:02:15.850> general<00:02:16.330> than<00:02:16.990> these<00:02:17.770> other

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
and wider in general than these other

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.730 
and wider in general than these other
ones<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.810> mat-su<00:02:19.990> nose

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
ones this is the mat-su nose

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.430 
ones this is the mat-su nose
so<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.850> for<00:02:22.210> functional<00:02:22.810> differences<00:02:23.260> let

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
so just for functional differences let

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.190 
so just for functional differences let
me<00:02:23.560> show<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.830> I'll<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.520> stack<00:02:25.000> these<00:02:25.330> so

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
me show you I'll as I stack these so

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.220 
me show you I'll as I stack these so
here<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> am<00:02:26.560> stacking<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.430> Miu<00:02:27.760> key<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:28.240> top<00:02:28.990> of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
here I am stacking the Miu key on top of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.040 
here I am stacking the Miu key on top of
the<00:02:29.320> Toho<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.910> can<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:31.360> where<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.020> a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
the Toho and you can see where this is a

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.710 
the Toho and you can see where this is a
full<00:02:32.910> bead<00:02:34.410> skinnier<00:02:35.460> than<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.520> Toho<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
full bead skinnier than the Toho so the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.200 
full bead skinnier than the Toho so the
Miu<00:02:38.230> key<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.710> skinniest<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.490> then<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.060> can

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
Miu key is the skinniest and then I can

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.620 
Miu key is the skinniest and then I can
take<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:41.080> stack<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:42.010> top<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
take that and stack that on top of the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.460 
take that and stack that on top of the
mat-su<00:02:43.840> nose<00:02:44.350> here<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.780> another

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
mat-su nose here and that is another

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.199 
mat-su nose here and that is another
full<00:02:47.980> seed<00:02:48.250> bead<00:02:49.380> skinnier<00:02:50.610> I'm<00:02:51.610> sorry<00:02:51.910> fatter

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
full seed bead skinnier I'm sorry fatter

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.320 
full seed bead skinnier I'm sorry fatter
on<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.780> bottom<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:54.190> can<00:02:54.370> see<00:02:54.610> we're<00:02:54.970> not

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
on the bottom so you can see we're not

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.870 
on the bottom so you can see we're not
all<00:02:55.390> size<00:02:56.020> 8<00:02:56.320> seed<00:02:56.530> beads<00:02:56.830> are<00:02:57.040> created<00:02:57.430> equal

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
all size 8 seed beads are created equal

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.970 
all size 8 seed beads are created equal
so<00:02:58.780> sometimes<00:02:59.200> you'll<00:02:59.470> be<00:02:59.500> working<00:02:59.860> on<00:02:59.920> a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
so sometimes you'll be working on a

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.740 
so sometimes you'll be working on a
project<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.790> you'll<00:03:00.940> start<00:03:01.209> having<00:03:01.420> some

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
project and you'll start having some

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.890 
project and you'll start having some
sizing<00:03:02.350> issues<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.700> may<00:03:03.880> just<00:03:04.270> be<00:03:04.390> a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
sizing issues and it may just be a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.110 
sizing issues and it may just be a
difference<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.830> manufacturer<00:03:06.760> that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
difference in the manufacturer that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.120 
difference in the manufacturer that
you're<00:03:07.270> using<00:03:07.540> from<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.500> one<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.920> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
you're using from the one that the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.580 
you're using from the one that the
designer<00:03:09.520> used<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.270> have<00:03:10.810> actually<00:03:11.290> run<00:03:11.410> into

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
designer used I have actually run into

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.500 
designer used I have actually run into
that<00:03:11.740> myself<00:03:12.280> where<00:03:12.640> occasionally<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.300> will

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
that myself where occasionally I will

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.020 
that myself where occasionally I will
make<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> design<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.709> sizing<00:03:15.220> works<00:03:15.370> perfectly

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
make a design the sizing works perfectly

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.360 
make a design the sizing works perfectly
because<00:03:16.540> I'm<00:03:16.720> using<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.530> case<00:03:17.890> let's<00:03:18.190> say

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
because I'm using in that case let's say

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.449 
because I'm using in that case let's say
all<00:03:18.580> Toho<00:03:19.060> seed<00:03:19.330> beads<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.959> send<00:03:20.769> my<00:03:20.950> design<00:03:21.280> out

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
all Toho seed beads I send my design out

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.800 
all Toho seed beads I send my design out
into<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.730> world<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.360> bunch<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.660> people

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
into the world and a bunch of people

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.630 
into the world and a bunch of people
will<00:03:23.200> start<00:03:23.590> making<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.310> start<00:03:24.489> having

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
will start making it and start having

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.780 
will start making it and start having
some<00:03:24.910> size<00:03:25.150> difficulties<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.290> we'll<00:03:27.010> do<00:03:27.489> some

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
some size difficulties and we'll do some

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.060 
some size difficulties and we'll do some
research<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.959> know<00:03:29.170> we'll<00:03:29.530> kind<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.860> boil

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
research you know we'll kind of boil

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.920 
research you know we'll kind of boil
down<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.550> details<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.480> turns<00:03:31.690> out<00:03:31.870> that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
down the details and it turns out that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.810 
down the details and it turns out that
it's<00:03:32.230> because<00:03:32.560> they're<00:03:32.769> using<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.280> mat-su<00:03:33.670> no

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
it's because they're using a mat-su no

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.540 
it's because they're using a mat-su no
seed<00:03:34.060> bead<00:03:34.269> where<00:03:34.870> I'd<00:03:35.019> maybe<00:03:35.290> used<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.769> Toho<00:03:36.280> or

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
seed bead where I'd maybe used a Toho or

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.910 
seed bead where I'd maybe used a Toho or
a<00:03:36.580> Miu<00:03:37.150> key<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.570> that<00:03:38.019> mat-su<00:03:38.410> knows<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.800> much

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
a Miu key and that mat-su knows so much

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.100 
a Miu key and that mat-su knows so much
fatter<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.640> it's<00:03:39.790> throwing<00:03:40.269> off<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.600> sizing

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
fatter that it's throwing off the sizing

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.289 
fatter that it's throwing off the sizing
so<00:03:41.799> just<00:03:42.010> know<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.220> occasionally<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.120> can

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
so just know that occasionally that can

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.780 
so just know that occasionally that can
happen<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.930> if<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.470> are<00:03:44.860> having<00:03:45.100> some<00:03:45.340> sizing

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
happen and if you are having some sizing

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.960 
happen and if you are having some sizing
issues<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.660> possibly<00:03:47.320> by<00:03:47.500> changing<00:03:48.190> which

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
issues and possibly by changing which

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.990 
issues and possibly by changing which
manufacturer<00:03:49.900> your<00:03:50.350> seed<00:03:50.709> bead<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.100> that<00:03:51.850> may

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
manufacturer your seed bead is that may

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.449 
manufacturer your seed bead is that may
actually<00:03:52.180> fix<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.750> problem<00:03:53.140> for<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.500> so

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
actually fix the problem for you so

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.620 
actually fix the problem for you so
don't<00:03:54.610> be<00:03:54.790> afraid<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.090> any<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:55.510> these

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
don't be afraid of any of these

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.320 
don't be afraid of any of these
manufacturers<00:03:56.470> are<00:03:56.650> all<00:03:56.830> perfectly<00:03:57.670> fine<00:03:57.970> and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
manufacturers are all perfectly fine and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.960 
manufacturers are all perfectly fine and
I<00:03:59.110> would<00:03:59.470> say<00:03:59.680> running<00:04:00.130> into<00:04:00.430> those<00:04:00.549> sizing

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
I would say running into those sizing

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.750 
I would say running into those sizing
issues<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.570> only<00:04:01.780> happens<00:04:02.290> maybe<00:04:02.799> once<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.459> 20

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
issues it only happens maybe once and 20

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.509 
issues it only happens maybe once and 20
projects<00:04:04.440> for<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.500> most<00:04:05.799> part<00:04:06.100> those<00:04:06.250> things

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
projects for the most part those things

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.670 
projects for the most part those things
tends<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.180> interchangeable<00:04:07.780> but<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.560> do

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
tends to be interchangeable but I do

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.199 
tends to be interchangeable but I do
like<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.190> know<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:09.730> happens

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
like you to know that that happens

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.030 
like you to know that that happens
because<00:04:10.720> if<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.019> do<00:04:11.170> run<00:04:11.320> into<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.590> problem<00:04:11.950> you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
because if you do run into a problem you

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.210 
because if you do run into a problem you
want<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> be<00:04:12.340> able<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.549> troubleshoot<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.209> right

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
want to be able to troubleshoot it right

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.219 
want to be able to troubleshoot it right
so<00:04:15.220> now<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.430> know<00:04:15.640> what<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.880> do<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.229> try

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
so now you know what to do just try

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.589 
so now you know what to do just try
another<00:04:17.560> seed<00:04:17.890> bead<00:04:17.919> look<00:04:18.910> at<00:04:19.030> that<00:04:19.180> profile

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
another seed bead look at that profile

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.080 
another seed bead look at that profile
of<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.840> seed<00:04:20.049> bead<00:04:20.289> you<00:04:21.070> can<00:04:21.099> actually<00:04:21.729> take

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
of the seed bead you can actually take

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.320 
of the seed bead you can actually take
two<00:04:22.300> seed<00:04:22.539> beads

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
two seed beads

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.080 
two seed beads
a<00:04:23.409> needle<00:04:24.409> or<00:04:24.560> something<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.340> put<00:04:25.789> them<00:04:25.909> up

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
a needle or something and put them up

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.960 
a needle or something and put them up
and<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.629> can<00:04:26.780> kind<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.169> identify<00:04:27.729> which<00:04:28.729> is

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
and you can kind of identify which is

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.330 
and you can kind of identify which is
bigger<00:04:29.270> which<00:04:29.569> is<00:04:29.599> smaller<00:04:30.050> if<00:04:30.409> you<00:04:30.680> know<00:04:30.889> and

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
bigger which is smaller if you know and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.520 
bigger which is smaller if you know and
and<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:32.030> can<00:04:32.150> adjust<00:04:32.240> your<00:04:32.539> sizing<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.319> way

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
and you can adjust your sizing that way

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.670 
and you can adjust your sizing that way
