anything touching or exceeding that top
much<00:00:22.730> is<00:00:22.999> overfilled<00:00:23.599> if<00:00:24.429> it's<00:00:25.429> overfilled

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
much is overfilled if it's overfilled

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.989 
much is overfilled if it's overfilled
then<00:00:26.239> you<00:00:26.329> need<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.599> drain<00:00:26.869> out<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.169> extra<00:00:27.560> oil

the drain plug on this car is very easy
to<00:00:30.829> reach<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:31.310> probably<00:00:31.609> can<00:00:32.029> do<00:00:32.180> it

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
without even jacking it up just unscrew

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.690 
without even jacking it up just unscrew
the<00:00:35.240> plug<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.860> let<00:00:37.040> a<00:00:37.070> little<00:00:37.370> bit<00:00:37.490> of<00:00:37.580> oil

drain<00:00:38.090> out<00:00:38.240> at<00:00:38.390> a<00:00:38.450> time<00:00:38.690> until<00:00:38.990> the<00:00:39.350> dipstick

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
drain out at a time until the dipstick

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.240 
drain out at a time until the dipstick
shows<00:00:40.010> where<00:00:40.310> you<00:00:40.460> want<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.760> be<00:00:41.860> to<00:00:42.860> check<00:00:43.070> the
