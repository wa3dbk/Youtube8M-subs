00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:09.390
 Brother is today a swordsman of Kamen Rider Drive deluxe drive driver 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.390
 I think that I want to play in the center of the play 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.460
 Let's look at a little shift mother 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.890
 I Yes 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:24.580
 Kedomo This It Is I shift Car wonder if this was another desune car mode of car 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.720
 If you turn this back around, the lever will stop 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.039
 Will be in mode 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.870
 It looks like the logo mark of each of those cars here . 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.910
 Let's look at this as there is a max flare in the school a little 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:44.400
 Yes it Toka cat in something like wonder if this is the a r 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 Something like this has a mark in it a bar even to the right 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:56.130
 All the materials on the left and both are made of plastic 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:03.360
 Well, I guess it's cheap if it's cheap . 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:04.420
 And or injured in that or a throw or be die cast and Kanyo children Whoa 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.420
 Or such a child 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.050
 It is here that you might be such of thinking 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.350
 Because it is made of soft material 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.780
 I do not think that it is broken or broken 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:22.790
 Here estuary What fine I'm straight 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.380
 It There is no longer Rutteyuu either but pleasant feel good feeling 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:31.090
 Let's go on making a change First of all, turn the key and start the engine 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.090
 Is it good with the expression of putting on the engine ? 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.450
 It's a special checker to change the bar mode 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.140
 skk 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.140
 There is none 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.540
 It sounds like this LED is displayed when you reply 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.369
 It feels like you get used to type speed now 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:14.100
 9 Although the screen I think is that it does not seem to quite choppy 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.760
 With the naked eye, it's beautifully reflected with a camera, so by all means depending on the settings 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.520
 this 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.810
 Oh my turn 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:24.340
 There is a gap between the timing to go and the timing when the camera is projected 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.200
 It's would seem to be missing here and there 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.690
 I apologize for the moment, but I can see all the truth 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.510
 Please understand that there is a feeling 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:40.400
 I think that I would like to do the next shift up 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.730
 As it may be noisy and hard to understand, I will go ahead by turning the key and then 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.450
 Defeat shift car before this can be done in the shift-up 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.230
 By the way, I 'm turning off the power now, but this belt is in a state to see the type speed 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.950
 is 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.950
 You can 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:14.820
 Yes I feel like this Shift-up is OK as I go in a row 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.150
 It seems like it can go up to 3 consecutive lines and I want to go out for a little while 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.150
 I'm sorry 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.510
 I said to high speed piece I will go three times next 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.570
 Ha 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.990
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:50.450
 Yes masu copy usp youth p 3 times to sleep in like this 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:55.609
 In the feeling that I did a few times a little by that sense of ticking that speed 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.609
 It seems that the timing also changes, and if it feels like 123 slowly speedo 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.560
 What I'd say speed speedo 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:06.150
 If you feel like an umbrella but you 're like Cess Peel 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.080
 It feels like it's changing depending on the timing of defeating this like little by little like that 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.620
 I will 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.220
 Next is Special Move 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:20.930
 To on by turning the sounds way key 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:23.320
 And this button of shift breath I push this to shift shift If you beat him Special move is 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.320
 go out 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.940

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.150
 Would like to do tire exchange play to the next It is you So that out deathblow at Yes like this 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.500
 I think you 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.460
 Tire exchange play the flame wherever ride conversion Emitai of place to say so-called special grade jar 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.520
 But 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.240
 Well prepare the next sound shift car Well this 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.080
 That the result is such a feeling like a to form change to replace 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.249
 It is the way it is correct key 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.849
 Haha 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:21.320
 The and shift car turn on the power 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.430
 Kill and remove 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:30.160
 To give and and finally a new shift car 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.160
 Pushed by Let's doing it is now complete was 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.289
 c ah ah 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:03.009
 Now I can exchange it now and it is about max 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.729
 Let's go back to type speed again 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.729
 Ha 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.520
 It seems that I do not say tire change when returning to type speed 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.480
 How to cancel the transformation put a key 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:36.910
 The shift car 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:36.910
 I'll stop pressing this button after removing in blue and removing 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:55.930
 Ha 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:07:00.100
 Yes the transformation is canceled by nice drive and all human falls 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:05.710
 I feel like I'm using a shift car that's a deluxe drive driver . 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:07.650
 But after this, there will be various shift cars, so I can hear many interesting sounds. 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.870
 I think it is not 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.870
 So we'll see you next video Baibai
