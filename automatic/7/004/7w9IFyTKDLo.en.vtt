want to worry about cleaning the chain

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400 
want to worry about cleaning the chain
just<00:00:53.160> spray<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.940> some<00:00:54.270> one-step<00:00:54.809> it'll

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
just spray on some one-step it'll

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
just spray on some one-step it'll
penetrate<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.370> push<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
penetrate in there and push all the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
other junk out leave behind

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
other junk out leave behind
nice<00:00:59.100> fresh<00:00:59.989> lubricant<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.789> right<00:01:02.969> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
nice fresh lubricant and you go right so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.460 
nice fresh lubricant and you go right so
that<00:01:04.080> easy<00:01:04.430> wet<00:01:05.430> once<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.840> wet<00:01:07.110> style

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that easy wet once that is a wet style

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
that easy wet once that is a wet style
lubricant<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.880> stays<00:01:09.330> wet<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> chain

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
lubricant so it stays wet on the chain

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.300 
lubricant so it stays wet on the chain
and<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.400> drier<00:01:12.020> dustier<00:01:13.020> climates<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and in some drier dustier climates you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
and in some drier dustier climates you
may<00:01:14.520> find<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:16.280> Dirty's<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.490> fairly<00:01:18.479> often

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
may find that it Dirty's up fairly often

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
may find that it Dirty's up fairly often
and<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.280> applying<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> find

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and so you're applying and if you find

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
and so you're applying and if you find
yourself<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> find<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.470> you're

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
yourself that you find that you're

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
yourself that you find that you're
applying<00:01:23.460> blue<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.570> then

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
applying blue more than you like then

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.940 
applying blue more than you like then
try<00:01:25.560> our<00:01:25.799> dry<00:01:26.390> Teflon<00:01:27.390> lube<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.229> attracts<00:01:28.680> less

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
try our dry Teflon lube it attracts less

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.469 
try our dry Teflon lube it attracts less
dirt<00:01:29.220> because<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.700> goes<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> chain<00:01:30.299> wet

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
dirt because it goes on the chain wet

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.980 
dirt because it goes on the chain wet
but<00:01:30.750> dries<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> you'll<00:01:32.790> notice<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> dry

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
but dries but you'll notice with the dry

Teflon movement does not have a built-in
cleaning<00:01:37.140> function<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> one-step<00:01:38.939> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
cleaning function like the one-step so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.469 
cleaning function like the one-step so
eventually<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.470> chain<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.640> part<00:01:42.240> will

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
eventually that chain or part will

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.789 
eventually that chain or part will
accumulate<00:01:42.810> enough<00:01:43.200> dirt<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.680> need

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
accumulate enough dirt they don't need

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.440 
accumulate enough dirt they don't need
to<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.979> cleaning<00:01:44.250> you'll<00:01:44.490> need<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.420> of
