00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.270
 then in this period 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.770
 you can see on the channel that we are not 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.480

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:10.340
 easel and then not at the moment 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.220
 he doesn't want me 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.330
 framework I was saying 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.990
 I also stopped doing a bit of 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.810
 video 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.209
 because why is he making it now 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 of the images below my voice 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.039
 because I resumed shooting 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.770
 this morning I don't know what day it was 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.060
 he refers, however, to my house because 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.060

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.690
 commitments to come here to help others 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.300

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.620
 I have no time to continue any video 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:31.700
 and therefore nothing is now things in 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.700
 these two poetic worlds he is not 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.120

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.850
 video 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.820

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.680
 of torque godfathers nothing this series 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:02.970

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.560
 kind the gesture case the eat like 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.530
 many will have seen various videos of 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.410

 therefore among these kind of videos 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.100
 yes but tied for a reason 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.690
 mainly because it is common that is a 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.010
 part like a player, however, the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.830
 I like to eat food 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.800

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.060

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.860
 video no no 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.940

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.270

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.470
 flour the challenge of pleasure to stay today 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.510
 we will proceed with another kind of challenge 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.389
 so today's challenge will be to eat 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.310
 this hot pepper and you will say but you know 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.260
 what this chili will already need 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.419
 and instead we want to eat this 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.860
 first round because spicy fucking 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:37.139
 I don't know why I'm doing it and then 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.139
 they eat this nice red pepper 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.260
 because I know it all 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.770
 after at least a minute without shining 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.920

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:25.190
