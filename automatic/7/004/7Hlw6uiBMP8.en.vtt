00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
looking at here is way it should look

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.170 
looking at here is way it should look
when<00:00:15.170> it's<00:00:15.290> all<00:00:15.470> done<00:00:15.710> nice<00:00:16.250> even<00:00:16.640> gap<00:00:16.849> along

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
when it's all done nice even gap along

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.329 
when it's all done nice even gap along
the<00:00:17.390> body<00:00:17.599> pulled<00:00:18.349> up<00:00:18.529> tight<00:00:18.769> close<00:00:19.070> to<00:00:19.249> the

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
the body pulled up tight close to the

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.759 
the body pulled up tight close to the
body<00:00:19.490> a<00:00:19.789> small<00:00:20.570> gap<00:00:20.810> at<00:00:20.990> each<00:00:21.140> end<00:00:21.409> where<00:00:21.679> the

body a small gap at each end where the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.560 
body a small gap at each end where the
end<00:00:21.919> cap<00:00:22.159> is<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:22.609> there's<00:00:22.789> no<00:00:22.909> contact<00:00:23.419> with

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
end cap is so there's no contact with

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.809 
end cap is so there's no contact with
the<00:00:23.689> body<00:00:24.099> and<00:00:25.099> you<00:00:25.220> will<00:00:25.400> notice<00:00:25.609> in<00:00:25.789> the

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:25.819 
the body and you will notice in the

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.509 
the body and you will notice in the
front<00:00:26.150> there<00:00:26.630> is<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.810> slight<00:00:27.230> larger<00:00:28.130> gap<00:00:28.279> than

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
front there is a slight larger gap than

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.679 
front there is a slight larger gap than
the<00:00:28.609> rest<00:00:28.759> of<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:28.939> board<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:29.359> that's<00:00:29.480> due<00:00:29.659> to

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
the rest of the board and that's due to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.989 
the rest of the board and that's due to
the<00:00:29.810> body<00:00:30.079> shape<00:00:30.470> it<00:00:30.679> turns<00:00:30.919> in<00:00:31.249> and<00:00:31.489> under<00:00:31.819> at

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
the body shape it turns in and under at

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.940 
the body shape it turns in and under at
that<00:00:32.060> point<00:00:32.540> but<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.470> is<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:33.710> way<00:00:33.829> it<00:00:33.890> should

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
that point but this is the way it should

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.490 
that point but this is the way it should
look<00:00:34.280> now<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:35.420> we're<00:00:35.539> going<00:00:35.629> to<00:00:35.690> do<00:00:35.870> is<00:00:36.109> show

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
look now what we're going to do is show

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.319 
look now what we're going to do is show
you<00:00:36.559> some<00:00:36.649> things<00:00:37.100> where<00:00:37.370> people<00:00:37.640> run<00:00:38.149> into

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
you some things where people run into

you some things where people run into
some<00:00:38.480> problems<00:00:38.570> on<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:38.989> install<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.739> that

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
some problems on the install and that

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.889 
some problems on the install and that
due<00:00:40.670> mainly<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.269> not<00:00:41.539> reading<00:00:41.809> the

be a tight fit once the board is removed

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.580 
be a tight fit once the board is removed
then<00:01:23.570> we're<00:01:23.660> going<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.810> loosen<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.200> linkages

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
then we're going to loosen the linkages

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.250 
then we're going to loosen the linkages
next<00:01:25.450> okay<00:01:26.450> once<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.750> running<00:01:27.020> board<00:01:27.170> has

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
next okay once the running board has

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.930 
next okay once the running board has
been<00:01:27.290> removed<00:01:27.650> ensure<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:28.370> your<00:01:28.490> t-nuts

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
been removed ensure that your t-nuts

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.960 
been removed ensure that your t-nuts
slide<00:01:29.720> freely<00:01:30.320> in<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.590> board<00:01:30.800> if<00:01:31.580> these<00:01:31.790> are

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
slide freely in the board if these are

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.970 
slide freely in the board if these are
tight<00:01:32.180> at<00:01:32.390> all<00:01:32.540> they've<00:01:33.080> got<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.350> be<00:01:33.530> made<00:01:33.710> fit
