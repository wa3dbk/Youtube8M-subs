 spoon or not for measuring 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.640
 don't look to see so now we wait 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.640
 until the water is boiling 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.600

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.060
 customer becomes a bit sticky 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.520
 click that scene almost knocked 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.590
 so you still have to go round and round 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.400
 no laying in the household foil 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.390
 then let it cool down 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.730
 you can do it you can also foil over the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.440
 pan while the customer is still in it 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.720
 sit 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.130
 but the point is that you can do it 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:52.100

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:59.510

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.280
 on the counter and when it is ready then 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.790
