00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.460
 many diseases harmful to plants 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.200
 are caused by land 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.840
 contaminated by various types of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.960
 microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 nematodes and prevention has always depended 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.990
 the use of chemicals and also 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.820
 toxic 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.000
 but now a new technique is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.020
 solving this problem is the call 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 solarization of soil 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.130
 you will follow right here to serve 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 culture step by step how it is made 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 how it works on earth and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.430
 importance in the crops under 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:41.969
 mainly for system 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:44.489
 agro-ecological production in countries 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.030
 systems of organic farming are more 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.280
 developed technologies 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.520
 used for soil disinfestation 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.860
 called solarization is what we 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 Let's meet here in the station. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.050
 experimental research with the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.260
 agronomist engineer José Ângelo rebelo the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.869
 Rebel started showing us the unit 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 already ready to grow in shelter with the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.229
 solarization process already in progress 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.590
 explaining all the details of how 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.780
 its efficacy works and its 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.890
 importance in systems 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.500
 agroecological production both have 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.250
 shelter as in open areas 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.579
 ideal according to him is to make the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.790
 solarization already in the first cultivation 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.520
 when a new planting area is debuted 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.860
 silvano the preparation of the soil for 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.630
 solarization is the same as the preparation for 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 the crop for planting 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.649
 that is, the soil must first be turned 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.100
 that can be done with step with the idea 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.619
 questioned by a tractor is peace is 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.079
 widely used because it is fast and effective 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.659
 right cheap simple instrument for the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.549
 depth and depth as I 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.680
 said it is the same as that of cultivation 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.710
 that 25 to 30 centimeters there 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.410
 spore so this area we have to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.120
 analyze and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.620
 and this area I had to protect the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.740
 plant is the depth and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.100
 opportunity for root exploitation is the 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.140
 normal work that everyone now 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.880
 Are you still going to do that so I said 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.800
 which is the preparation for cultivation 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.420
 you can make fertilization in the case of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 conventional agriculture with fertilization 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.880
 chemistry with the liming without problem 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.310
 in the case of morgan using matter 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.100
 organic using compound we do not 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.940
 recommend its application before your 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.010
 achievement 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.560
 so that there is not too much decomposition 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.350
 rapid change in organic matter was to be 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.310
 so good and should be used later 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.800
 plaguing joe and applying the juice and grave 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.000
 Why do not you want to get involved in the sun? 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.660
 again with the land well settled is 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.480
 made the humidification of the sun in a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.880
 uniformity which is very important for 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.880
 avoid waterlogging beyond what is necessary 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.340
 silvano one of the things we have to 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.310
 be very careful not to be taken 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.950
 to think that because he put water 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.400
 on the surface all the profile you want 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.459
 update is wet and tre those 30 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.080
 centimeters I want the heat act 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.720
 then it is verified through withdrawal 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.150
 a slice of approximately 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.330
 depth that I intend to finish 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.860
 see that the color of the soil is the same from 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.720
 until the end of shift 1 on the 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.400
 including the farmer or the 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.790
 person concerned may have a 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.090
 experience so if I push a 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.280
 clod in the hand should not pour water 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.780
 between the fingers and means that they have no 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.060
 excess moisture 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.340
 but otherwise I may be missing 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.760
 opening the hand it should not break if 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.570
 so if I squeeze in the pouring water not 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.600
 there is too much 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.959
 if I open that the tone will not break 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.959
 there is a lack 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.859
 the next step is the ground cover 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.690
 with transparent plastic a task 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:28.360
 simple but requires careful 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.320
 in places where the plastic 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.590
 find 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.949
 there is a basket for all the soil 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.479
 be solarized here a detail would 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.490
 to highlight silvana 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.710
 there are times behind some people 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.840
 They tend to do this by locking the 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.860
 edge of the plastic bound to the edge with 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.650
 land and this land will finally remain 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.710
 the soil that I want to socialize then 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.650
 correct is to lock the edge with the ground 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.949
 that I'm going to signal or lock and 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.960
 leaving behind the plastic that remained and 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:08.080
 gets stuck plus stamps reviewed too 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.210
 At 2 knots we should not be so over 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.979
 classic here and finally explains about 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.979
 the area that I'm going to work 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.440
 and so is done throughout the area 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.710
 crops and shelter the plastic is 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.930
 cut to pass through the columns and will be 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.350
 applied for at least one meter more 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.980
 of the children 's area 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.320
 we are now going to enter a ready area and the 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.080
 first care is the use of the so-called 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.590
 foot bath which is simply the 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.580
 container with disinfectant for the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.690
 shoes do not contaminate and up and it is here 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.170
 that we understand how solarization is 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.440
 the hydrothermal process where the heat 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.280
 generated naturally reduces the number of 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.320
 weeds flows bacteria and even 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.690
 the harmful insects 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.180
 Silvano here is very clear to 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.280
 importance of uniting the soil before 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.280
 to put the plastic 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.310
 these drops here in form in those that have 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.130
 evaporation of moisture bringing the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.980
 even the plastic prevented the 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.920
 water condensed and returns to the 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.920
 just making this circle of temperature 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.280
 increase and it is this effect that makes 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.560
 successful in the 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.510
 thermometers confirms the lifting 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.180
 soil temperature in the various 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.170
 moments facilitating control of the 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.260
 process 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:49.500
 the type of plastic used must be 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.540
 trained by a technician and can be 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.200
 recycled 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.710
 the time of exposure is the most important 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.120
 than the temperature and varies from region 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.010
 for region 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.970
 depending on the conditions 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:10.790
 climatic conditions such as cloudy or cold 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.790
 we can vary from 30 to 60 days 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.110
 the process must be repeated after several 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.300
 crops 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.860
 symptoms of 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:26.689
 soil as fusariose nematodes and 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:29.129
 bacteriosis another detail 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:32.639
 use of rainwater to 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:34.139
 irrigation that are not polluted 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.669
 then the water that fell on the roof 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:38.009
 run down that face that has a 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:39.749
 tilt into a carton. 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.969
 five thousand liters where the water is 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:44.490
 deposited and stored for the 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:46.110
 future in water drip irrigation 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.699
 from a region where there is no 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.759
 industries that pollute drinking water 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:52.490
 be using euro falls from the sky is a water
