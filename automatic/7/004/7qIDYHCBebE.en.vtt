craft super cast out it's called whipped

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.470 
craft super cast out it's called whipped
spackle<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.650> it<00:00:25.650> works<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.279> same<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.640> gesso

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
spackle and it works the same as gesso

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.450 
spackle and it works the same as gesso
except<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.230> kind<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.710> leaves<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.189> different

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
except this kind of leaves a different

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.120 
except this kind of leaves a different
texture<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.480> consistency<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.099> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
texture of consistency on it this is a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
texture of consistency on it this is a
little<00:00:32.430> bit<00:00:32.579> more<00:00:32.730> fluffy<00:00:33.030> than<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> gesso<00:00:33.899> as

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
little bit more fluffy than the gesso as

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.590 
little bit more fluffy than the gesso as
you<00:00:34.230> apply<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> down<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.300> apply<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you apply it down so if you apply a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.970 
you apply it down so if you apply a
heavy<00:00:36.899> coat<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.410> get<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.890> cool

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
heavy coat you can get some really cool

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.060 
heavy coat you can get some really cool
textures<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> apply<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:40.040> thin<00:00:41.040> coat

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
textures and if you apply a thin coat

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
textures and if you apply a thin coat
like<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.670> doing<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:42.540> you'll<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
like I'm doing here I'm you'll get a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
like I'm doing here I'm you'll get a
nice<00:00:43.530> creamy<00:00:44.010> look<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.520> I'll<00:00:44.610> show<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
nice creamy look and I'll show you the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
nice creamy look and I'll show you the
difference<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> put<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> geladas<00:00:46.920> down

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
difference when I put the geladas down

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.250 
difference when I put the geladas down
because<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.059> already<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> board<00:00:49.020> that's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
because I already have a board that's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
because I already have a board that's
done<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.520> applied<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> gesso<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
done where I applied the gesso as a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.869 
done where I applied the gesso as a
primer<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> wanted<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
primer and in this what I wanted to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.970 
primer and in this what I wanted to
apply<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> whipped<00:00:54.809> spackle<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> primer

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
apply the whipped spackle as a primer

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.369 
apply the whipped spackle as a primer
and<00:00:56.280> create<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> same<00:00:57.329> canvas<00:00:57.629> boards<00:00:58.199> with

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and create the same canvas boards with

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.319 
and create the same canvas boards with
basically<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> same<00:00:59.160> colors<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.730> see<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
basically the same colors and see if you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.959 
basically the same colors and see if you
can<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> difference<00:01:01.020> between<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.469> two

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
can see the difference between the two

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
can see the difference between the two
now<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.629> 5<00:01:03.840> by<00:01:04.049> 7<00:01:04.080> candidate

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
now this is just a 5 by 7 candidate

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
now this is just a 5 by 7 candidate

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
that it leaves behind this is totally

00:05:58.819 --> 00:07:16.620 
that it leaves behind this is totally
something<00:05:59.000> you<00:05:59.240> can<00:05:59.389> skip<00:05:59.659> if<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.900> wanted<00:06:00.169> to

your ideas now the top one is actually

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.460 
your ideas now the top one is actually
primed<00:07:29.000> with<00:07:29.120> gesso<00:07:29.660> and<00:07:29.690> the<00:07:29.990> bottom<00:07:30.290> one<00:07:30.440> is

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
primed with gesso and the bottom one is

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.320 
primed with gesso and the bottom one is
primed<00:07:30.980> with<00:07:31.130> the<00:07:31.370> whip<00:07:31.490> spackle<00:07:32.000> and<00:07:32.030> you<00:07:32.180> can

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
primed with the whip spackle and you can

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.940 
primed with the whip spackle and you can
kind<00:07:32.510> of<00:07:32.570> see<00:07:32.720> the<00:07:32.840> difference<00:07:33.200> the<00:07:33.380> gesso<00:07:33.680> one

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:33.950 
kind of see the difference the gesso one

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.590 
kind of see the difference the gesso one
has<00:07:34.550> more<00:07:34.760> of<00:07:34.820> the<00:07:34.970> white<00:07:35.150> showing<00:07:35.420> through

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.600 
has more of the white showing through

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.330 
has more of the white showing through
it's<00:07:35.960> got<00:07:36.080> more<00:07:36.230> texture<00:07:36.680> versus<00:07:37.070> the<00:07:37.190> whip

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.340 
it's got more texture versus the whip

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.060 
it's got more texture versus the whip
spackle<00:07:37.910> the<00:07:38.600> whip<00:07:38.750> stop<00:07:38.990> spackle<00:07:39.680> seems<00:07:39.860> to

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.070 
spackle the whip stop spackle seems to

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.380 
spackle the whip stop spackle seems to
be<00:07:40.250> a<00:07:40.280> little<00:07:40.490> bit<00:07:40.670> more<00:07:40.790> smoother<00:07:41.240> and

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:41.390 
be a little bit more smoother and

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.970 
be a little bit more smoother and
creamier<00:07:41.780> I<00:07:41.960> love<00:07:42.230> them<00:07:42.440> both<00:07:42.620> I<00:07:42.950> think

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:42.980 
creamier I love them both I think

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.190 
creamier I love them both I think
they're<00:07:43.250> both<00:07:43.600> wonderful<00:07:44.600> and<00:07:44.810> I<00:07:44.840> don't<00:07:45.020> think

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.200 
they're both wonderful and I don't think

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.930 
they're both wonderful and I don't think
you<00:07:45.290> can<00:07:45.440> go<00:07:45.560> wrong<00:07:45.590> with<00:07:45.770> either<00:07:45.920> one<00:07:46.310> but<00:07:46.790> the

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:46.940 
you can go wrong with either one but the

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.570 
you can go wrong with either one but the
key<00:07:47.120> is<00:07:47.270> to<00:07:47.300> make<00:07:47.870> sure<00:07:48.050> you<00:07:48.200> prime<00:07:48.470> your<00:07:48.710> your

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:49.580 
key is to make sure you prime your your

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.250 
key is to make sure you prime your your
canvas<00:07:50.000> there<00:07:50.210> so<00:07:50.450> it's<00:07:50.780> hard<00:07:50.870> to<00:07:51.080> take

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:51.260
