00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.400
 hello system friends sum in this 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.080
 chance let's see how to change the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.570
 battery in this case what we do 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.620
 a team of the inspiron in table 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 40 30 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.620
 or that we're going to see if it's an operation 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.010
 regularly so simple in others 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.730
 equipment good because to do this there are 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.440
 that completely disarm the equipment well 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.990
 let's go here in the back where 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.450
 we have already gone ahead a bit 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.750
 we have removed the cover 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.120
 we have removed the battery and what we are going 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.780
 to do now is to withdraw all 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 screws that we have here in the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.420
 back cover this screw here 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.690
 he was the one who held on what is the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.540
 optical unit in this case we have already 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.360
 removed the screws that hold the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.850
 keyboard in this case is this screw 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.070
 that we have here that we had here 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.960
 way the objective then we're going to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.790
 proceed to withdraw all this we 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.570
 we remove the screws 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.980
 let's remove the hard drive 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.420
 we are going to 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.420
 back to the team 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.760
 and we are going to proceed to remove what is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.150
 the keyboard keyboard we will remove it with 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.810
 very careful we will look for the insurance that 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.530
 have 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.550
 and only once we have 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.300
 retired we will raise 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:52.340
 yes we will speak it out 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.230
 and in this case we will release the flex in 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.590
 We had gone ahead with this trip 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.030
 little bit 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.369
 the east flex of this equipment is released 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.620
 releasing this tab and as you put it 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.780
 putting the flex and it's called 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.680
 well the next thing will be to remove the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.710
 screws one two three four five 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.830
 screws that hold the cover 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.880
 In addition, it will be necessary to release 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.640
 flex of the mouse and the flex of the panel or the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.550
 this power button in the flex us 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.830
 let's stop a little bit because this 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.040
 flex is different this flex is in 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.610
 vertical sense then what you have to 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.360
 do is pull up 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.520
 this sure is the one that holds the flex 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.370
 this one you see here in the one in color 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.130
 gray yes to be able to pull out the flex without 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.190
 hurt a quicker lie of all that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.150
 let's place 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.470
 on the side of the team and we're going to start 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.300
 with a fine-tipped screwdriver or with 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.580
 one one 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.280
 While you starts to rise 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.710
 but it starts to lift easily 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.270
 then we will remove what is the 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.970
 roof cover what is the roof 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.150
 higher then what follows 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.110
 then it will be to withdraw the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.830
 screws that are going to hold what is the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.830
 Motherboard 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.409
 then we're going to withdraw that with 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:31.010
 very careful and at home and we are going to 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:33.889
 disconnect also these here that 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.249
 this is the connector if what are the 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.249
 horns 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.940
 we already disconnected 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.940
 well then 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.710
 let's proceed with that 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.210
 we lift the card 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:00.450
 we have returned it and here is what 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.270
 we came to change what the battery is 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.500
 series burst 32 then what are we going to 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.310
 do is remove it and place a new 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.410
 so 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.849
 we put it understood the and 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:18.200
 we press and this is not necessary 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.200
 just pushing 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.180
 or 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.300
 pushing lightly and lifting and 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.760
 to put it in there we have 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.770
 then that's the other one we take away 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.070
 well the battery they know like in all 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.070
 the equipment is a CR 2032 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.350
 ok then we proceed to 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:50.110
 back again 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.110
 to put everything here this is very 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.510
 important this here is the socket that 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.640
 connection between this plate and this 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.920
 plate then you have to have a lot 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:05.360
 Care and connect perfectly 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:08.220
 now we will place the top cover 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.820
 first we will adjust it 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.820
 sure this time after that 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:24.620
 we will place or locate the flex and 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:28.590
 we will place the 245 screws that the 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:32.160
 they held the keyboard flex 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.960
 on the keyboard enters 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.700
 slightly under pressure in state 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.080
 we just press but they are 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.740
 the bots well 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.740
 we leave 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.530
 at this point we will not continue closing 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.100
 placing him here closing all the equipment 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:06:00.890
 but we will place hard disk 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.890
 we will place the unit 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.299
 and we will place the battery 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.370
 remember very important always never 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.380
 they finish closing on Friday with 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.990
 equipment and before verifying that it works 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.630
 completely then we need to place 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.510
 the screws but let's try 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.390
 and that everything works correctly until 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.430
 what we have is connected because 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.820
 in this case we were wrong food 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:44.190
 of good I passed the time to put the 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:47.470
 date and there is no way to go back 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.350
 when in exchange the value then I had 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.410
 to come and in 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.530
 change the date here from windows 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:58.080
 correct it and leave everything well 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.840
 then what we need is to turn off 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.550
 the equipment and place all the screws 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.590
 that are on the bottom and 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.290
 finish closing we are placing the 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.570
 screws here in the back of 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.540
 the hand down the bottom we're going to 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.120
 place that hard drive screws 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.610
 and nothing else here you have to remind them of 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.040
 an observation that the disc is not mine 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.220
 hard to place them here are about 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.900
 screws that are shorter than the 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.560
 rest of the screws of this equipment 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.560
 s 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:36.640
 so that we will not be confused 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.640
 we 're going to be damaged the disk 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.990
 well examined 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:45.310
 well we have finished placing the 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:48.100
 cover after the meal that we 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:50.350
 gives access to ram memory and well then 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.440
 that's all in regards to what is the 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.479
 change of battery in a team of at 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.350
 less in these models in which the 

00:07:55.479 --> 00:08:03.130
 access to them is quite complicated 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:04.479
 well remember we are waiting for your 

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.840
 comments 

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:10.600
 is your suggestion regarding the videos and 

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:15.930
 We hope to have contact with 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.930
 you in a next video see you
