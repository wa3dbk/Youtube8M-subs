key effect so what we're gonna need are
two<00:01:22.830> things<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.340> create<00:01:23.640> our<00:01:23.850> effect<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
two things to create our effect one is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.149 
two things to create our effect one is
that<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> good<00:01:25.830> well

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
good clean chroma key there yet let's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.979 
good clean chroma key there yet let's
set<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.079> back<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.459> default<00:03:15.660> I'll<00:03:16.660> move<00:03:16.870> this

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989

keyer<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.419> recommend<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.959> check<00:03:56.319> this<00:03:56.500> box

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
keyer I recommend you check this box

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.619 
keyer I recommend you check this box
here<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.010> says<00:03:57.190> show<00:03:57.430> mask<00:03:57.790> only<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
here it says show mask only on the

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.839 
here it says show mask only on the
option<00:03:59.019> screen<00:03:59.290> this<00:04:00.069> is<00:04:00.280> going<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.609> show<00:04:00.790> you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
option screen this is going to show you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.559 
option screen this is going to show you
what<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.989> key<00:04:02.290> effect<00:04:02.769> will<00:04:03.220> not<00:04:03.579> remove<00:04:04.209> and

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
what the key effect will not remove and

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.629 
what the key effect will not remove and
so<00:04:04.900> it's<00:04:05.079> best<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.560> put<00:04:05.919> that<00:04:06.129> in<00:04:06.310> there<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
so it's best to put that in there and

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.490 
so it's best to put that in there and
then<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.910> adjust<00:04:07.419> or<00:04:07.660> fine-tune<00:04:08.200> low

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
then to adjust or fine-tune low

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.550 
then to adjust or fine-tune low
threshold<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.340> high<00:04:09.910> threshold<00:04:10.269> until<00:04:11.199> we

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
threshold and high threshold until we

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.490 
threshold and high threshold until we
can<00:04:11.799> see<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.549> mask<00:04:12.910> over<00:04:13.540> what<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:13.930> want<00:04:14.319> to

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
can see the mask over what we want to

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500 
can see the mask over what we want to
see<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.980> then<00:04:15.310> we<00:04:15.370> see<00:04:15.639> transparency<00:04:16.389> all

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
see and then we see transparency all

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.580 
see and then we see transparency all
around<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.900> let<00:04:16.989> me<00:04:17.019> show<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.260> what<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.410> mean<00:04:17.530> by

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
around it let me show you what I mean by

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.409 
around it let me show you what I mean by
that<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.190> just<00:04:18.370> take<00:04:18.699> the<00:04:18.910> low<00:04:19.090> threshold

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
that and you just take the low threshold

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.569 
that and you just take the low threshold
slider<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.229> watching<00:04:20.859> in<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.070> preview<00:04:21.400> panel

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
transparent at all we're not seeing

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.580 
transparent at all we're not seeing
anything<00:04:52.719> through<00:04:53.169> him

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
anything through him

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.589 
anything through him
and<00:04:53.680> now<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.009> can<00:04:54.219> turn<00:04:54.370> off<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.729> mask<00:04:54.939> and<00:04:55.539> I

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
and now I can turn off the mask and I

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.420 
and now I can turn off the mask and I
can<00:04:55.780> do<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.110> some<00:04:56.289> fine-tuning<00:04:56.800> maybe<00:04:57.219> what

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
can do just some fine-tuning maybe what

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.580 
can do just some fine-tuning maybe what
I'll<00:04:57.520> do<00:04:57.610> is<00:04:57.759> just<00:04:57.939> put<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.270> very<00:04:58.330> fine<00:04:59.110> blur<00:04:59.349> not

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
I'll do is just put a very fine blur not

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.619 
I'll do is just put a very fine blur not
too<00:04:59.770> much<00:04:59.979> just<00:05:00.219> enough<00:05:00.849> so<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.210> he<00:05:01.419> looks

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
too much just enough so that he looks

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.749 
too much just enough so that he looks
natural<00:05:02.169> in<00:05:02.349> front<00:05:02.409> of<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.740> background<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.550> I

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
natural in front of the background and I

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.730 
natural in front of the background and I
think<00:05:03.969> we've<00:05:04.090> got<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.330> pretty<00:05:04.840> good<00:05:05.080> key<00:05:05.409> effect

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
think we've got a pretty good key effect

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.830 
think we've got a pretty good key effect
let's<00:05:05.949> play<00:05:06.219> it<00:05:06.400> on<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.669> timeline<00:05:06.909> move<00:05:07.719> the

very<00:05:17.289> very<00:05:17.560> nice<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:19.090> chroma<00:05:19.479> keyer<00:05:19.779> that

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
very very nice the chroma keyer that

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.869 
very very nice the chroma keyer that
comes<00:05:20.169> with<00:05:20.379> Vegas<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:21.009> a<00:05:21.039> fairly<00:05:21.370> simple<00:05:21.669> one

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
comes with Vegas is a fairly simple one

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.209 
comes with Vegas is a fairly simple one
yet<00:05:22.240> it's<00:05:22.389> usually<00:05:22.689> tremendously<00:05:23.620> effective

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
yet it's usually tremendously effective

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.089 
yet it's usually tremendously effective
too<00:05:24.460> but<00:05:25.150> remember<00:05:25.270> how<00:05:25.779> well<00:05:26.080> any<00:05:26.439> chroma<00:05:26.889> key

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
too but remember how well any chroma key

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.159 
too but remember how well any chroma key
effect<00:05:27.129> works<00:05:27.699> though<00:05:28.090> is<00:05:28.360> going<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:29.020> depend

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
effect works though is going to depend

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.200 
effect works though is going to depend
an<00:05:29.469> awful<00:05:29.949> lot<00:05:30.129> on<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.460> quality<00:05:30.969> of<00:05:31.120> your

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210
