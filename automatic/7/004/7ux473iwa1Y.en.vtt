this that I was going like does he think

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.130 
this that I was going like does he think
we're<00:02:42.210> idiots<00:02:42.330> something<00:02:42.720> no<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> don't<00:02:43.110> think

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
we're idiots something no I don't think

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.230 
we're idiots something no I don't think
you're<00:02:43.290> idiots<00:02:43.470> I'm<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.000> there's<00:02:45.180> a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
you're idiots I'm just that there's a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.750 
you're idiots I'm just that there's a
lot<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.480> people<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.680> because<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.490> their<00:02:47.580> age

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
lot of people that because of their age

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.180 
lot of people that because of their age
or<00:02:48.090> whatever<00:02:48.420> reason<00:02:48.960> didn't<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.800> into<00:02:49.950> call

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
or whatever reason didn't get into call

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.000 
or whatever reason didn't get into call
of<00:02:50.220> duty<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> modern<00:02:51.000> warfare<00:02:51.150> 2<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.350> that's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
of duty to a modern warfare 2 so that's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.360 
of duty to a modern warfare 2 so that's
why<00:02:53.280> I'm<00:02:53.460> bringing<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.600> part<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:56.070> actually

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
why I'm bringing that part up I actually

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.650 
why I'm bringing that part up I actually
got<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.610> lot<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.820> messages<00:02:57.240> from<00:02:57.360> people<00:02:57.510> saying

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
got a lot of messages from people saying

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.850 
got a lot of messages from people saying
well<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.140> don't<00:02:58.410> really<00:02:58.470> need<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.800> explain

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
well you don't really need to explain

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.270 
well you don't really need to explain
that<00:02:59.190> I'm<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.400> what<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.180> do<00:03:00.330> actually

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
that I'm like what I think I do actually

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.920 
that I'm like what I think I do actually
and<00:03:02.280> oh<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.630> think<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.900> should<00:03:04.140> get<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.290> death<00:03:04.710> and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
and oh I think I should get a death and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.390 
and oh I think I should get a death and
um<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.640> those<00:03:09.060> game<00:03:09.360> types<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.890> back<00:03:11.130> cod

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
um so in those game types like back cod

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.190 
um so in those game types like back cod
for<00:03:11.700> knifing<00:03:12.120> only<00:03:12.330> was<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> challenge<00:03:12.870> enough

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
for knifing only was a challenge enough

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.620 
for knifing only was a challenge enough
and<00:03:13.560> when<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.250> say<00:03:14.460> knife<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.850> only<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.210> guess

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and when I say knife and only I guess

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.100 
and when I say knife and only I guess
the<00:03:16.820> derivative<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> would<00:03:18.240> be<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.959> you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
the derivative of it would be that you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.310 
the derivative of it would be that you
don't<00:03:19.290> shoot<00:03:19.590> guns<00:03:19.860> use<00:03:20.160> grenades<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.320> but

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
don't shoot guns use grenades so but

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.960 
don't shoot guns use grenades so but
also<00:03:22.500> if<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.040> five<00:03:23.250> people<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.820> row

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
also if you get five people in a row

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.030 
also if you get five people in a row
stabbing<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.570> world<00:03:24.780> at<00:03:24.900> war<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.260> cod4<00:03:25.740> I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
stabbing and world at war and cod4 I

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.800 
stabbing and world at war and cod4 I
feel<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.580> deserve<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.090> airstrike<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
feel like you deserve the airstrike and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.540 
feel like you deserve the airstrike and
you<00:03:28.260> deserve<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.680> helicopter<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.190> don't<00:03:29.459> know

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
you deserve the helicopter I don't know

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.780 
you deserve the helicopter I don't know
but<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:29.910> modern<00:03:30.180> warfare<00:03:30.300> 2<00:03:30.630> with<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> knife<00:03:31.200> is

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
but in modern warfare 2 with a knife is

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.570 
but in modern warfare 2 with a knife is
so<00:03:32.790> good<00:03:33.150> um<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.980> know<00:03:38.130> that

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
so good um that the you know that

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.400 
so good um that the you know that
killstreaks<00:03:39.060> aren't<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.930> killstreaks

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
killstreaks aren't that that killstreaks

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.370 
killstreaks aren't that that killstreaks
aren't<00:03:40.680> necessary<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.370> well<00:03:41.690> um<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.780> don't

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
aren't necessary to do well um I don't

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.940 
aren't necessary to do well um I don't
know<00:03:43.820> but<00:03:44.820> uh<00:03:44.880> obviously<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:46.560> killstreaks

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
know but uh obviously the killstreaks

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.580 
know but uh obviously the killstreaks
and<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.190> give<00:03:47.400> me<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.580> lot<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.030> kills<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:49.560> I

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
and this give me a lot of kills so I

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.410 
and this give me a lot of kills so I
don't<00:03:49.980> know<00:03:50.070> we'll<00:03:50.550> see<00:03:50.580> when<00:03:51.000> black<00:03:51.300> ops

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420

the corner and think about what you did
there<00:04:02.209> obviously<00:04:03.209> these<00:04:03.660> guys<00:04:03.959> were<00:04:04.530> not<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
there obviously these guys were not the
