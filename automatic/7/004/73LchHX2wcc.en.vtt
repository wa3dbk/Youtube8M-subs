00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.110 

against<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.000> cordon<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> backing<00:03:03.810> track

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
against the cordon the backing track

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.869 
against the cordon the backing track
then<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:07.290> VAT<00:03:07.590> does<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.459> reason<00:03:08.730> is

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
then the VAT does and the reason is

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.569 
then the VAT does and the reason is
because<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.680> backing<00:03:11.010> track<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.400> is

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
because the the backing track is is

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.270 
because the the backing track is is
emphasizing<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.329> flat<00:03:12.599> third<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:14.220> it

emphasizing this flat third so it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.530 
emphasizing this flat third so it
doesn't<00:03:14.489> sound<00:03:14.549> too<00:03:14.760> bad<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:15.000> play<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.329> one

transition between those would look like

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:36.050 
transition between those would look like
this

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060

doing that and you notice one night when
I<00:05:01.260> do<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.470> over<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.770> over<00:05:01.800> again<00:05:01.950> sometimes

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.940 
I do that over and over again sometimes
I<00:05:03.050> approach<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.200> double<00:05:04.440> stop<00:05:04.590> from<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.800> Down

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
I approach the double stop from a Down

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.440 
I approach the double stop from a Down
stroke<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.430> sometimes<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:05.970> approach<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.240> from

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
stroke and sometimes I approach it from

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.600 
stroke and sometimes I approach it from
an<00:05:06.510> upstroke

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.059

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
being able to do that consistently is

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.740 
being able to do that consistently is

trademark blues lick but Stevie Ray

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.559 
trademark blues lick but Stevie Ray
Vaughn<00:05:23.770> would<00:05:24.159> add<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.729> he'd<00:05:25.150> add<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.449> it<00:05:25.509> a

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
Vaughn would add to it he'd add to it a

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.360 
Vaughn would add to it he'd add to it a
little<00:05:25.689> bit<00:05:25.780> more<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.289> that's<00:05:27.099> what<00:05:27.219> this

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
little bit more and that's what this

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.300 
little bit more and that's what this
look<00:05:27.520> illustrates<00:05:28.000> so<00:05:28.210> we<00:05:28.719> start<00:05:29.250> by<00:05:30.250> doing

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
look illustrates so we start by doing

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.240 
look illustrates so we start by doing
that<00:05:30.699> then<00:05:31.379> instead<00:05:32.379> of<00:05:32.500> bending<00:05:32.740> on<00:05:33.069> our

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
that then instead of bending on our

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.879 
that then instead of bending on our
g-string<00:05:33.909> we<00:05:34.569> Bend<00:05:34.810> on<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.110> B<00:05:35.289> string<00:05:35.349> same

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
g-string we Bend on the B string same

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.749 
g-string we Bend on the B string same
fret<00:05:36.189> thirteenth<00:05:36.909> fret<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:39.310> we<00:05:39.460> do<00:05:39.610> that

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
fret thirteenth fret and we do that

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.080 
fret thirteenth fret and we do that
twice<00:05:40.060> so

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.370 

then<00:05:45.960> we<00:05:46.740> bend<00:05:46.980> 13th<00:05:47.580> fret<00:05:47.940> high<00:05:48.720> e-string

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
then we bend 13th fret high e-string

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.540 
then we bend 13th fret high e-string
keeping<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.400> same<00:05:50.760> kind<00:05:51.090> of<00:05:51.150> groove<00:05:51.419> going

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.450 

now<00:05:56.550> that's<00:05:56.729> hard<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.150> keep<00:05:57.300> clean<00:05:57.360> because

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
now that's hard to keep clean because

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.920 
now that's hard to keep clean because
you're<00:05:59.460> you're<00:05:59.850> strumming<00:06:00.150> these<00:06:00.510> two<00:06:00.780> or

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
you're you're strumming these two or

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.150 
you're you're strumming these two or
you're<00:06:01.050> picking<00:06:01.320> these<00:06:01.470> two<00:06:01.740> and<00:06:02.010> then<00:06:02.130> you

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
you're picking these two and then you

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.820 
you're picking these two and then you
want<00:06:02.460> this<00:06:02.699> one<00:06:03.080> to<00:06:04.080> come<00:06:04.320> through<00:06:04.560> without

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
want this one to come through without

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.589 
want this one to come through without
you<00:06:05.010> know<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.930> don't<00:06:07.050> want<00:06:07.260> that<00:06:07.320> happening

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.679 

so<00:06:11.169> we're<00:06:11.409> using<00:06:11.589> a<00:06:11.800> complex<00:06:12.300> muting<00:06:13.300> kind<00:06:13.599> of

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:13.689 
so we're using a complex muting kind of

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:14.820 
so we're using a complex muting kind of
thing<00:06:13.869> if<00:06:14.020> you<00:06:14.110> if<00:06:14.259> you're<00:06:14.379> not<00:06:14.499> used<00:06:14.740> to

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
thing if you if you're not used to

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.139 
thing if you if you're not used to
string<00:06:15.129> muting<00:06:15.460> with<00:06:15.490> your<00:06:15.729> left<00:06:15.939> and<00:06:16.059> right

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.149 
string muting with your left and right

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.419 
string muting with your left and right
hand<00:06:16.649> definitely<00:06:17.649> check<00:06:17.830> out<00:06:17.919> some<00:06:18.129> lessons

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:18.429 
hand definitely check out some lessons

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:23.850 
hand definitely check out some lessons
on<00:06:18.520> that<00:06:21.899> okay<00:06:22.899> so<00:06:22.990> this<00:06:23.259> whole<00:06:23.439> section<00:06:23.469> is

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
on that okay so this whole section is

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.689 
on that okay so this whole section is
going<00:06:23.949> to<00:06:24.009> look<00:06:24.129> like<00:06:24.219> this<00:06:25.830> one<00:06:26.830> then<00:06:27.309> two
