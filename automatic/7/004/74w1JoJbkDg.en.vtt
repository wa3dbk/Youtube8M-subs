00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
weird little things that I do when I

weird little things that I do when I
read<00:00:25.279> although<00:00:25.880> some<00:00:26.239> of<00:00:26.269> them<00:00:26.359> are<00:00:26.539> not

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630

really that little but you'll see the
first<00:00:29.749> quark<00:00:30.169> is<00:00:30.409> definitely<00:00:31.069> the<00:00:31.159> one<00:00:31.310> that

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
first quark is definitely the one that

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.450 
first quark is definitely the one that
influences<00:00:32.359> my<00:00:32.570> reading<00:00:33.109> the<00:00:33.379> most<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.010> that

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
something else at the same time whether

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.510 
something else at the same time whether
it's<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.200> don't<00:05:20.200> know<00:05:20.290> juggling<00:05:20.590> my<00:05:20.860> knee<00:05:20.919> or

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
it's I don't know juggling my knee or

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.190 
it's I don't know juggling my knee or
like<00:05:21.729> fidgeting<00:05:22.150> with<00:05:22.180> something<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.750> my<00:05:22.870> hand

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
things like that and so when I'm reading

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.969 
things like that and so when I'm reading
I<00:05:33.400> want<00:05:33.640> to<00:05:33.729> be<00:05:33.880> able<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.479> move<00:05:35.229> my<00:05:35.440> me<00:05:35.620> like<00:05:35.860> I'm

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.290 
doing right now while I'm reading it it
just<00:05:37.600> helps<00:05:38.020> me<00:05:38.169> focus<00:05:38.410> I<00:05:38.860> don't<00:05:39.669> know<00:05:39.760> why<00:05:39.970> I'm

just helps me focus I don't know why I'm

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.719 
just helps me focus I don't know why I'm
sure<00:05:41.200> there's<00:05:41.380> some<00:05:41.590> sort<00:05:41.830> of<00:05:41.979> scientific

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
sure there's some sort of scientific

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.580 
sure there's some sort of scientific
explanation<00:05:43.390> like<00:05:43.570> when<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:43.780> chew<00:05:43.990> gum<00:05:44.229> it

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
explanation like when you chew gum it

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.140 
explanation like when you chew gum it
helps<00:05:44.860> you<00:05:44.950> study<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.490> then<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.729> chew<00:05:45.940> during

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
helps you study and then you chew during

the<00:05:46.270> test<00:05:46.510> I've<00:05:46.780> heard<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.110> before<00:05:47.289> but<00:05:47.620> I

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
the test I've heard that before but I

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.110 
the test I've heard that before but I
think<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.220> kind<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.520> works<00:05:48.729> for<00:05:48.880> me<00:05:48.970> with

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
think that kind of works for me with

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.700 
think that kind of works for me with
reading<00:05:49.510> when<00:05:49.720> I<00:05:49.750> know<00:05:49.900> there<00:05:50.320> are<00:05:50.350> so<00:05:50.620> many

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
reading when I know there are so many

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.770 
reading when I know there are so many
other<00:05:50.830> things<00:05:51.010> I<00:05:51.340> could<00:05:51.370> be<00:05:51.610> doing<00:05:51.789> is<00:05:52.600> when

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
other things I could be doing is when

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.990
