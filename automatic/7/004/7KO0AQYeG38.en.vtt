 day more to my channel and here we are with a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.549
 word warcraft step by step guide of the 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.740
 paladin pipes and as you can see is this 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.719
 very nice people are doing here 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.530
 tests with a boom and that is pedal and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.230
 maximum with this of good conversion 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.500
 be equal that is a colleague we are going to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.060
 do in this video the skills worth 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 that they have put us and we are going to try them 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 in the mupis we are going to see the book of 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.830
 spells as you see have put here then 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.809
 about the brotherhood of professions that 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.329
 are the 10 most professions of mining 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.770
 I do not know by what principal faculties 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.260
 ok this is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 a small sentence guide use it 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 when available, it generates a point 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.130
 of sacred power crossed blow 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.080
 they are also those signs that use it 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.250
 every time inquisition is activated 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.330
 keep the applied to yourself when 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.100
 have this point of sacred power 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.230
 verdict the Templar who uses it when 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.580
 have three points and martÃ­nez de anger 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.110
 good we already know and what has changed 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.240
 OK 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.950
 in the first step we have the talents 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.940
 many of the old talents have 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.250
 turned into spells of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.020
 specialization the classrooms the classrooms already 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.450
 there are no stamps now are in the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 bar of auras and three sacred power the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.660
 sacred power is generated faster and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.060
 you can end up having up to five 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.360
 sacred power points and let's see 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.979
 with the spells guys well this is 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 the shits you're training 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.780
 pets this what the brotherhood is worth 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.780
 so let's see the repression what 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 field this new this is therefore equal to 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.130
 a devotion us equal 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.750
 Repentance I have it there now 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 We have a sacred shield. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 paladins of tri before were activated the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 activated cards when you have less left 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.550
 30% of life was almost activated only 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.410
 now we can activate it every 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.060
 whenever we want and as you see it puts 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.149
 protect the target with a light shield 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 sacred for 27.92 seconds the shield 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.640
 It also absorbs up to seven thousand points 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.440
 of damage every five seconds so only 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.240
 you can have that you can not be 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.340
 active on a target at a time so 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 It can be used every six seconds 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.960
 all the time so it's going to be pretty 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.909
 quoted as soon as it is given 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.860
 you go the sacred shield do so 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.959
 you throw the escudito and already did another 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.520
 It is worth here, because here we see the shield 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.060
 You see God has also changed 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.610
 the way in which the one that was cast 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.870
 beam of light 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.870
 25 houses 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.000
 amina boys in the emancipation untie 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.190
 your spirit what frees you from your effect 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.400
 of motion reduction this is new 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.660
 OK 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.670
 what the fuck is 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.670
 now that I can use it twice this 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.350
 I can take it twice before the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.800
 time of use as you see is worth and 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.930
 this also spends mana points to see 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.690
 this out spends mana points 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.010
 emancipation 3,000 mana points but 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.800
 it frees me also from the effects of 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.959
 reduce movement so as you see 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.510
 may be casting all the time so 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.300
 it's pretty pretty good straight fury 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.980
 hit crossed good the guardian here what 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.240
 You see they have put a little aura on him 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.030
 out under my laying on of hands 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.239
 see if they have changed anything is still 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.420
 Equal worth is stop by buffo 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.980
 inquisition clean tight so what 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.660
 more sure that you go see the video 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.760
 of the aggregate but good good hand of 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.890
 protection to see if I can take it to 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.980
 myself I can not at the moment manuel 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.020
 sacrifice 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.450
 I can not even hands of salvation is 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.190
 time to cast melo I feel the same 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.190
 cholera hammer has changed 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.480
 hammer of justice is still valid 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.790
 equal hammer of the honored look this has 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.470
 changed guys two hammers the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.030
 current goal that inflicts a 20 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.470
 hundred of the year with weapons what causes 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.960
 a wave of light that hits all 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.940
 objectives within a radius of 8 meters 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.340
 Deals 35% damage with the most 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.660
 sacred and applies the effect of the auto vale 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.100
 thing that guys do not skill 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.910
 I'm going to put it 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.130
 here and here I will make a macro 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.190
 to put it there so this is a 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.519
 new skill that adds a point of 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.519
 sacred power 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.350
 the martyrs to the current goal that 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.590
 deals 20 percent year 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.590
 weapons 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.870
 It's worth that and you will see guiding guys 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.880
 OK 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.710
 lesson is still the same reprimand 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.320
 it's worth saying yes, saying that 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.360
 as well 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.360
 the divine storm sentence 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.880
 the divine storm has put new 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.880
 Boys 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.449
 but where can I put the storm 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:54.449
 divine 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.009
 Well let's put it for now 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:07.050
 until I see 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.330
 the divine storm is used only when 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.999
 when they have the three power charges 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.349
 sacred a divine storm that will make the 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.460
 Union area will only be used when 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.809
 when there are enough enemies together 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.740
 Well, as you can see, the 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:21.740
 paladin movement 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.850
 good your clemency 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.610
 now crusader heart that what we 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.480
 increased to our effect of the saddle 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.480
 they have put it 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.710
 they have put him on passive liabilities 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.380
 and a divine supplication was no longer had 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.380
 taken away 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.210
 animals 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.069
 they have changed everything so good is 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.750
 up here the east 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.750
 we are going to try these moves 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.239
 and this I'll have to go 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.860
 so well let's do a rotation 

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:04.679
 how are the points of sacred power 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.409
 now you accumulate up to five 

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:09.670
 we put and inquisition as it is no longer 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:14.190
 bigotry worth guys 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.190
 when you remove this is a cows 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:20.039
 I do not get married 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.039
 good good good good 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.350
 let's throw the guard is not 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.350
 guardian 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.099
 when is the guardian 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.060
 here is guardian I can not take it 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:37.590
 still 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.590
 today we are going to throw ourselves inquisition 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.500
 let's throw wings when you remove 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:54.020
 good the points of sacred power as 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.020
 you see now they are much faster 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.449
 well until I get used to it now 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.289
 paladin guys 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.289
 it's going to cost me 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.540
 but good everything is getting used not the 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.440
 I really like that they have made it a 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.440
 little harder 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.839
 the storm 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:20.219
 we throw ourselves the sacred shield manna not 

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:23.300
 spend nothing for what I'm seeing now 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:23.300
 same nothing is spent 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.050
 Well the truth is that I think 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:31.580
 quite well as the 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.470
 paladin 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.180
 these rhombus dances 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.740
 I suppose that when there are many people 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.740
 in area as it will use 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:46.629
 so good as you see the paradigm in 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.789
 change also how it moves in some 

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:50.469
 attacks look when he throws the verdict 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:52.780
 of the Templar what it does that gives a 

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:54.610
 half a turn and hit 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.139
 the sentence when you criticize some ray 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.249
 up 

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:02.709
 the divine storm is still the same 

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:05.679
 so good guys up here the video 

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:07.670
