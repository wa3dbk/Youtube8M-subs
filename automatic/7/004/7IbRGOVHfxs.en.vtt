wants to play and there's nothing cool

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.660 
wants to play and there's nothing cool
out<00:00:43.510> there<00:00:43.780> so<00:00:44.079> that's<00:00:44.680> kind<00:00:44.920> of<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.100> start<00:00:45.370> I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
out there so that's kind of the start I

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.210 
out there so that's kind of the start I
build<00:00:46.240> something<00:00:46.540> that<00:00:47.170> older<00:00:47.590> kids<00:00:47.860> would

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
build something that older kids would

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.680 
build something that older kids would
strive<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:49.300> drive<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.540> other

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
strive to drive so and then the other

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.390 
strive to drive so and then the other
aspect<00:00:53.110> is<00:00:53.500> they<00:00:53.650> build<00:00:53.890> all<00:00:54.010> these<00:00:54.160> Lego

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
aspect is they build all these Lego

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.889 
aspect is they build all these Lego
models<00:00:54.820> were<00:00:54.940> totally<00:00:55.210> into<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.810> they

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
models were totally into it and they

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.720 
models were totally into it and they
build<00:00:56.110> them<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.470> I<00:00:56.920> literally<00:00:57.280> would<00:00:57.550> say

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
build them and I literally would say

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.430 
build them and I literally would say
that's<00:00:58.360> really<00:00:58.630> cool<00:00:58.780> can<00:00:58.899> I<00:00:58.960> touch<00:00:59.020> it<00:00:59.350> and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
that's really cool can I touch it and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.590 
that's really cool can I touch it and
they<00:00:59.500> would<00:00:59.620> say<00:00:59.800> no<00:01:00.280> no<00:01:00.880> when<00:01:01.180> they<00:01:01.270> put<00:01:01.420> up<00:01:01.540> on

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
they would say no no when they put up on

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.940 
they would say no no when they put up on
the<00:01:01.720> shelf<00:01:01.960> don't<00:01:02.230> touch<00:01:02.559> it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
the shelf don't touch it

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.649 
the shelf don't touch it
and<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:03.520> we<00:01:03.640> wanted<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.880> make<00:01:03.970> something<00:01:04.210> super

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
and so we wanted to make something super

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.899 
and so we wanted to make something super
durable<00:01:04.869> that<00:01:05.649> once<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.040> build<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.490> when<00:01:06.790> you

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909

automobiles<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.960> know<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.289> something<00:05:43.500> that

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
automobiles you know is something that

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.430 
automobiles you know is something that
is<00:05:44.509> it's<00:05:45.509> really<00:05:45.750> not<00:05:45.840> done<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.259> know<00:05:46.380> you

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
is it's really not done you know you

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.629 
is it's really not done you know you
build<00:05:46.650> your<00:05:46.740> own<00:05:46.800> Legos<00:05:47.130> but<00:05:47.280> it<00:05:47.370> looks<00:05:47.520> like<00:05:47.610> a

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
build your own Legos but it looks like a

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.129 
build your own Legos but it looks like a
pile<00:05:47.880> of<00:05:47.909> bricks<00:05:48.180> on<00:05:48.360> wheels<00:05:48.599> right<00:05:48.960> it

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
pile of bricks on wheels right it

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.050 
pile of bricks on wheels right it
doesn't<00:05:49.289> look<00:05:49.650> like<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.889> car<00:05:50.190> so<00:05:50.820> this<00:05:50.909> is

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
doesn't look like a car so this is

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.089 
doesn't look like a car so this is
really<00:05:51.210> carefully<00:05:51.780> built<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.199> that<00:05:52.380> any

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
really carefully built so that any

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.270 
really carefully built so that any
combination<00:05:53.909> any<00:05:54.690> way<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.440> do<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:56.070> looks

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
combination any way you do it it looks

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.800 
combination any way you do it it looks
like<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.460> cool<00:05:56.759> design<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.419> that<00:05:57.509> was<00:05:57.599> a<00:05:57.659> real

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
like a cool design and that was a real

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.260 
like a cool design and that was a real
challenge<00:05:58.380> but<00:05:58.669> what<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.789> kid<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.000> have<00:06:00.120> some

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
challenge but what the kid to have some

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.700 
challenge but what the kid to have some
ownership<00:06:00.389> over<00:06:00.780> that<00:06:00.900> design<00:06:01.289> and<00:06:01.500> this<00:06:01.560> will

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
ownership over that design and this will

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.950 
ownership over that design and this will
give<00:06:01.830> him<00:06:01.949> even<00:06:02.070> further<00:06:02.430> ownership<00:06:03.090> by<00:06:03.690> being

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
give him even further ownership by being

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.540 
give him even further ownership by being
able<00:06:04.080> to<00:06:04.199> actually<00:06:04.440> modify<00:06:05.159> it<00:06:05.340> themselves

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
able to actually modify it themselves

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.309 
able to actually modify it themselves
and<00:06:06.180> they<00:06:06.360> they<00:06:06.630> can<00:06:06.659> actually<00:06:06.900> build<00:06:07.139> in

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
and they they can actually build in

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.320 
and they they can actually build in
parameters<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:08.009> make<00:06:08.430> sure<00:06:08.460> that<00:06:08.729> the<00:06:08.909> you

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
parameters so make sure that the you

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.760 
parameters so make sure that the you
know<00:06:09.419> tires<00:06:09.599> don't<00:06:09.870> rub<00:06:10.080> on<00:06:10.229> the<00:06:10.319> parts<00:06:10.620> and

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
know tires don't rub on the parts and

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.860 
know tires don't rub on the parts and
things<00:06:10.979> but<00:06:11.520> give<00:06:11.880> them<00:06:12.000> enough<00:06:12.270> freedom<00:06:12.509> to

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
things but give them enough freedom to

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.420 
things but give them enough freedom to
have<00:06:13.020> some<00:06:13.229> real<00:06:13.349> ownership<00:06:13.650> and<00:06:14.009> maybe

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
have some real ownership and maybe

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.459 
have some real ownership and maybe
inspire<00:06:14.849> some<00:06:15.210> future<00:06:15.509> automobile<00:06:15.990> designers
