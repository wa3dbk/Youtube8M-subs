00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 as the whole project is also 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.619
 like asking a blind man if he wants 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.329

 college exit to fund ing or 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.700
 again you should go back to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.880
 dough workshops that te 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.110
 would accomplish something 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.329
 well finally we make it a state affair 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.159
 but hey it will not have taken more than six 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.719
 days for our blond to re 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.950
 phase of his and not suffice his 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.600
 team 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.399
 arcane hoc this great genius of com 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.930
 try to take the place of the clips sia 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.539
 whose white business has reported 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.959
 a few millions anyway even mine 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.610
 nothing the drama it pays well we can not 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.780
 laugh all the time no longer the sad 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.459
 news of the week it's 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.110
 the cancellation of the video game festival 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.540
 danger because of lack of budget which had to have 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.489
 place in early March she had to 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.200
 host free play conferences 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.970
 but mostly tournaments while the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.770
 video game has become the hobby the most 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.569
 popular in France it is still difficult to 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.060
 find funding we would fool ourselves 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.739
 not a bit of our mouth by chance we 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.569
 will still cheer up with 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.830
 the trailer for the lyon-ii sport because 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.050

 keep 101 for a little later 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.989
 besides level economy dailymotion a 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.550
 typed in the eye of microsoft the world 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.319
 in his article does not even gratify us 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.700
 not a word about video games 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.590
 which nevertheless represent a good 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.050
 part of the site's French-language traffic 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.150
 hope that crosoft beds if that 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.040
 exists one day will offer a bigger cpm 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.390
 internationally which will open the door to 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.760
 new webtv especially a beautiful 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.560
 expansion of the esport 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.110
 the innovation on the web tv is 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.060
 always pokemon with now more 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.920
 28 million views in twelve 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.549
 days the switchblade stream pokemon 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.099
 advance well 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.689
 it must be said that there are more than 50,000 they 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.430
 have still managed to capture one of 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.370
 drives with a good torball mass 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.129
 Where are the guys the same? 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.650
 and gamesvideo.com even offers a summary 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.360
 very complete and romanticized of the adventurous 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.159
 and quite frankly it's worth the detour 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.620
 almost as much as the subdray says 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.420
 even history progress the community 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.980
 in demand even more after the advice 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.019
 of the 4 it could be that we attack 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.430
 the second generation that is said 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.599
 would focus on two streams 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.849
 dispute with some small 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.980
 subtleties the buzz will have made its way 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.840
 and the guardian who offers a very 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.340
 good analysis of the unexpected success of the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.829
 most watched stream of the world 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.389

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.810

 stress when you stream the game 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.889
 on twitch it's a sadistic hair when 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.440

 the one in the utility makes still doubt 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.579

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.579
 with a little luck it will help them to 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.410
