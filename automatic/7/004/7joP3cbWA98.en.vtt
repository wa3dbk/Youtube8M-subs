that I the sound that I liked the most

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.510 
that I the sound that I liked the most
was<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.240> throwing<00:00:19.109> some<00:00:19.260> EQ<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.430> know

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
was just throwing some EQ on you know

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.870 
was just throwing some EQ on you know
cut<00:00:20.760> some<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.119> low-end<00:00:21.420> mud<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:22.850> let<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
cut some of the low-end mud out let the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.300 
cut some of the low-end mud out let the
bass<00:00:24.330> take<00:00:24.720> all<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.109> stuff<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.769> area<00:00:26.130> right

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
bass take all this stuff this area right

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.269 
bass take all this stuff this area right
in<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:28.789> try<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.380> bring<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> high<00:00:32.040> end

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
in here try to bring down the high end

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.880 
in here try to bring down the high end
just<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.940> little<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> vocals<00:00:34.680> can

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
just a little bit just so the vocals can

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740 
just a little bit just so the vocals can
cut<00:00:35.070> through<00:00:35.219> make<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.850> dip<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:36.510> here

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
cut through make a little dip right here

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
cut through make a little dip right here
also<00:00:37.399> between<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.700> point<00:00:38.940> six<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> four

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
also between one point six and four

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.920 
also between one point six and four
kilohertz<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.930> vocals

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
kilohertz because that's the vocals

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.950 
kilohertz because that's the vocals
strongest<00:00:43.649> areas<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.969> right

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
strongest areas right in here right

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
strongest areas right in here right
about<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.320> area<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.280> create<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
about that area so if you can create a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.069 
about that area so if you can create a
little<00:00:48.030> dip<00:00:48.379> such<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:50.010> really

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
little dip such that you don't really

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.770 
little dip such that you don't really
notice<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.469> there's<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.160> dip<00:00:53.640> their<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
notice that there's a dip their the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450 
notice that there's a dip their the
vocals<00:00:55.199> will<00:00:55.350> shine<00:00:55.620> through<00:00:55.949> even<00:00:56.219> more

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
vocals will shine through even more

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.170 
vocals will shine through even more
there<00:00:56.699> than<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:58.640> like<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.730> said<00:00:59.789> bring

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
there than go for it like I said bring

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.670 
there than go for it like I said bring
down<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> top<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:00.930> bit<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.440> can

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
down to the top a little bit if you can

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.500 
down to the top a little bit if you can
dab<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> depending<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> EQ<00:01:03.030> setting<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
dab it depending on the EQ setting that

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.219 
dab it depending on the EQ setting that
you<00:01:03.570> record<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.229> guitar<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:06.229> but

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
sound and I was like you know what let's

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.320 
sound and I was like you know what let's
let's<00:01:45.439> fiddle<00:01:45.649> with<00:01:45.770> something<00:01:46.070> else<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:47.299> I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
let's fiddle with something else so I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.450 
let's fiddle with something else so I
did<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.110> just<00:01:48.409> filled<00:01:48.710> with<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.159> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
did and I just filled with the the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.609 
did and I just filled with the the
built-in<00:01:49.850> dynamics<00:01:50.450> processor<00:01:51.259> that's<00:01:51.439> in

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
built-in dynamics processor that's in

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.660 
built-in dynamics processor that's in
garage<00:01:51.950> band<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:53.259> i<00:01:54.259> don't<00:01:55.220> know<00:01:55.280> why<00:01:55.520> i<00:01:55.550> never

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
garage band and i don't know why i never

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.969 
garage band and i don't know why i never
tried<00:01:56.240> this<00:01:56.420> all<00:01:56.659> along<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:57.950> awesome

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
tried this all along but it's awesome

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:14.760 
tried this all along but it's awesome
check<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.100> out

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.420 

it's<00:02:15.770> basically<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.340> compressor<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:18.430> it's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
it's basically a compressor and it's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
it's basically a compressor and it's
visual<00:02:20.060> too<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:20.690> see<00:02:21.020> where<00:02:21.260> it's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
visual too so you see where it's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.229 
visual too so you see where it's
capturing<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.099> here<00:02:22.310> when<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.580> turns<00:02:22.760> red<00:02:23.000> that

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
capturing it here when it turns red that

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.660 
capturing it here when it turns red that
that's<00:02:23.599> sound<00:02:24.020> that's<00:02:24.260> not<00:02:24.530> going<00:02:24.920> up<00:02:25.040> that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's sound that's not going up that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.570 
that's sound that's not going up that
it's<00:02:25.910> stopping<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.830> you're

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
it's stopping and if you you're

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.520 
it's stopping and if you you're
basically<00:02:28.760> squashing<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.050> if<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.290> can<00:02:30.410> add

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
basically squashing it so if you can add

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.640 
basically squashing it so if you can add
a<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.830> bit<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.040> squash<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.080> dynamics

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
a little bit of squash with the dynamics

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.059 
a little bit of squash with the dynamics
compressor<00:02:34.160> with<00:02:34.459> some<00:02:34.880> EQ<00:02:35.300> that's<00:02:35.510> really

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
compressor with some EQ that's really

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.370 
compressor with some EQ that's really
you<00:02:37.069> know<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:38.150> follow<00:02:38.390> your<00:02:38.540> ears<00:02:38.930> but<00:02:39.349> I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
you know just follow your ears but I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.290 
you know just follow your ears but I
found<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.610> sound<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.090> works

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
found that this is a sound that works

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.020 
found that this is a sound that works
for<00:02:41.540> me<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:41.810> pretty<00:02:41.959> basic<00:02:42.200> just<00:02:43.190> some<00:02:43.670> basic

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
for me it's pretty basic just some basic

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.500 
for me it's pretty basic just some basic
EQ<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:48.019> dynamics<00:02:48.560> processor<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:50.360> back

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
EQ and the dynamics processor going back

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.509 
EQ and the dynamics processor going back
to<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.750> EQ<00:02:51.140> by<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.350> way<00:02:51.530> there's<00:02:51.980> always<00:02:52.280> some

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
to the EQ by the way there's always some

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.370 
to the EQ by the way there's always some
hideous<00:02:52.910> frequency<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.720> bleeds<00:02:54.110> through

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
hideous frequency that bleeds through

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.710 
hideous frequency that bleeds through
the<00:02:54.590> mix<00:02:54.830> when<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.670> record<00:02:56.030> guitars<00:02:56.390> so

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
the mix when you record guitars so

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.270 
the mix when you record guitars so
that's<00:02:56.930> why<00:02:57.319> some<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.620> these<00:02:57.709> knobs<00:02:58.040> are<00:02:58.250> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
that's why some of these knobs are a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.470 
that's why some of these knobs are a
little<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.670> kaflooey<00:02:59.349> but<00:03:00.349> um<00:03:00.700> yes<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:02.269> is

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
little like kaflooey but um yes this is

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.890 
little like kaflooey but um yes this is
me<00:03:02.720> just<00:03:03.010> following<00:03:04.010> my<00:03:04.040> ears<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:05.780> know<00:03:05.870> I

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
me just following my ears and you know I

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.080 
me just following my ears and you know I
record<00:03:06.650> my<00:03:06.769> guitar<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.160> exactly<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.730> same<00:03:07.940> at

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
record my guitar is exactly the same at

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.199 
record my guitar is exactly the same at
this<00:03:08.239> point<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.720> because<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:10.519> makes<00:03:11.030> it

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
this point just because it makes it

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.699 
this point just because it makes it
simpler<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.599> record<00:03:12.019> because<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.440> allows<00:03:12.680> me

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
simpler to record because it allows me

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.310 
simpler to record because it allows me
to<00:03:13.069> use<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.430> same<00:03:13.670> presets<00:03:14.420> which<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.140> is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
to use the same presets which is this is

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.310 
to use the same presets which is this is
a<00:03:16.180> preset<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.299> but<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:17.570> basically<00:03:17.900> guitar

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
a preset it but it's basically guitar

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.220 
a preset it but it's basically guitar
one<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:20.030> click<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.329> guitar<00:03:20.660> one<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.019> it's

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
one you click on guitar one is it's

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.220 
one you click on guitar one is it's
going<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.440> come<00:03:21.560> up<00:03:22.239> that's<00:03:23.239> how<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.480> saved<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:24.049> I

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
going to come up that's how I saved it I

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.229 
going to come up that's how I saved it I
always<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.040> some<00:03:25.459> issues<00:03:25.640> with<00:03:25.940> this

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
always have some issues with this

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.900 
always have some issues with this
frequency<00:03:26.630> 0<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.079> 1<00:03:27.470> kilohertz<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:28.640> just

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
frequency 0 and 1 kilohertz so I just

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.990 
frequency 0 and 1 kilohertz so I just
bring<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.390> down<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.569> little<00:03:29.810> bit<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:31.280> anyways

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
bring it down a little bit so anyways

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.520 
bring it down a little bit so anyways
that's<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.209> guitar<00:03:32.569> is<00:03:32.720> I'll<00:03:33.079> show<00:03:33.319> you<00:03:33.410> what

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
that's the guitar is I'll show you what

00:03:33.530 --> 00:04:02.110 
that's the guitar is I'll show you what
they<00:03:33.620> all<00:03:33.739> sound<00:03:34.010> like<00:03:34.069> together

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.940 

I<00:04:02.180> do<00:04:02.690> want<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:02.989> show<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.230> something<00:04:03.470> cool<00:04:03.590> at

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
I do want to show you something cool at

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.119 
I do want to show you something cool at
the<00:04:03.980> end<00:04:04.129> one<00:04:04.819> of<00:04:04.909> my<00:04:05.000> favorite<00:04:05.420> parts<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:06.129> this

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
the end one of my favorite parts is this

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.420 
the end one of my favorite parts is this
ultra<00:04:07.940> section<00:04:08.860> basically<00:04:09.860> when<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.040> double

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
ultra section basically when the double

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:30.540 
ultra section basically when the double
double<00:04:10.940> time<00:04:11.090> part<00:04:11.360> kicks<00:04:11.629> in

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.129 

that's<00:04:31.120> it

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
that's it

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:39.119 
that's it
let<00:04:32.919> me<00:04:33.039> so<00:04:34.030> sister<00:04:35.009> show<00:04:36.009> you<00:04:36.069> how<00:04:37.800> all<00:04:38.800> this

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
let me so sister show you how all this

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.399 
let me so sister show you how all this
layering<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:40.060> it's<00:04:40.389> pretty<00:04:40.659> cool<00:04:40.900> i<00:04:40.960> just<00:04:41.229> want

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
layering is it's pretty cool i just want

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.429 
layering is it's pretty cool i just want
to<00:04:41.439> show<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.680> because<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:42.009> I<00:04:42.279> love<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.669> part

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.920 

but<00:04:47.439> the<00:04:47.680> compression<00:04:48.460> on<00:04:48.669> here<00:04:49.569> it<00:04:49.659> really

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
but the compression on here it really

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.640 
but the compression on here it really
makes<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.979> sound<00:04:51.729> kind<00:04:52.539> of<00:04:52.599> orchestral<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.409> love

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
makes it sound kind of orchestral I love

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:15.909 
makes it sound kind of orchestral I love
it

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.439 

now<00:05:16.919> you'll<00:05:17.069> notice<00:05:17.159> the<00:05:17.550> guitar<00:05:17.909> sound<00:05:18.240> is<00:05:18.419> a

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
now you'll notice the guitar sound is a

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.369 
now you'll notice the guitar sound is a
little<00:05:18.750> thin<00:05:19.280> by<00:05:20.280> itself<00:05:20.699> but<00:05:21.229> really<00:05:22.229> that's

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
little thin by itself but really that's

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.850 
little thin by itself but really that's
not<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.650> bad<00:05:22.949> thing<00:05:22.979> if<00:05:23.729> you<00:05:24.240> can<00:05:24.650> make<00:05:25.650> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
not a bad thing if you can make the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.129 
not a bad thing if you can make the
guitar<00:05:26.159> is<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.310> little<00:05:26.639> thinner<00:05:26.969> like<00:05:27.330> if<00:05:27.840> it's

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
guitar is a little thinner like if it's

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.749 
guitar is a little thinner like if it's
a<00:05:28.259> song<00:05:28.500> where<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.889> guitar<00:05:29.189> is<00:05:29.310> never<00:05:29.550> going

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
a song where the guitar is never going

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.879 
a song where the guitar is never going
to<00:05:29.819> get<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.330> rest<00:05:30.659> anywhere<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:31.409> whole<00:05:31.560> band

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
to get a rest anywhere the whole band

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.390 
to get a rest anywhere the whole band
doesn't<00:05:32.189> get<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> rest<00:05:32.699> together<00:05:32.879> then<00:05:34.280> it's<00:05:35.280> a

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
doesn't get a rest together then it's a

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.429 
doesn't get a rest together then it's a
good<00:05:35.550> opportunity<00:05:35.879> to<00:05:36.360> cut<00:05:36.659> some<00:05:36.870> low<00:05:37.050> end<00:05:37.259> of

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:37.439 
good opportunity to cut some low end of

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.649 
good opportunity to cut some low end of
it<00:05:37.620> gets<00:05:37.800> hard<00:05:37.979> because<00:05:38.280> um<00:05:38.729> if<00:05:39.360> it's<00:05:39.599> not

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
it gets hard because um if it's not

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.129 
it gets hard because um if it's not
standing<00:05:40.139> out<00:05:40.229> by<00:05:40.439> itself<00:05:40.770> um<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.930> probably

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
standing out by itself um you probably

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.200 
standing out by itself um you probably
don't<00:05:43.590> need<00:05:43.800> those<00:05:44.009> low<00:05:44.280> frequencies<00:05:44.909> there

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
don't need those low frequencies there

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.700 
don't need those low frequencies there
because<00:05:45.509> the<00:05:45.659> base<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.840> going<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:46.259> fill<00:05:46.469> it<00:05:46.590> out

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
because the base is going to fill it out

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.219 
because the base is going to fill it out
it's<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.610> good<00:05:47.789> opportunity<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.539> just<00:05:48.810> get<00:05:49.050> rid

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
it's a good opportunity to just get rid

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:57.589 
it's a good opportunity to just get rid
of<00:05:49.289> some<00:05:50.449> mix<00:05:51.449> mud<00:05:56.030> so<00:05:57.030> anyways<00:05:57.330> this<00:05:57.449> the

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
of some mix mud so anyways this the

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.809 
of some mix mud so anyways this the
guitars<00:05:58.879> eq<00:05:59.879> dynamics<00:06:00.599> processor<00:06:01.080> BAM<00:06:01.979> done<00:06:02.490> I

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
guitars eq dynamics processor BAM done I

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.610 
guitars eq dynamics processor BAM done I
had<00:06:03.419> a<00:06:03.449> little<00:06:03.690> fun<00:06:03.900> with<00:06:04.139> this<00:06:04.349> so

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
had a little fun with this so

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.790 
had a little fun with this so
chugga-chugga<00:06:05.550> part<00:06:06.289> basically<00:06:07.289> it's<00:06:07.440> a<00:06:07.560> very

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
chugga-chugga part basically it's a very

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.920 
chugga-chugga part basically it's a very
brief<00:06:08.219> clip<00:06:08.490> that<00:06:08.699> I<00:06:08.819> have<00:06:08.940> during<00:06:09.270> two<00:06:09.690> of<00:06:09.840> the

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
brief clip that I have during two of the

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.800 
brief clip that I have during two of the
choruses<00:06:10.639> you<00:06:11.639> can<00:06:11.759> see<00:06:11.940> it<00:06:12.000> is<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.330> first<00:06:12.539> one

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
choruses you can see it is the first one

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:21.680 
choruses you can see it is the first one
but<00:06:13.080> um<00:06:20.029> i'ma<00:06:21.029> show<00:06:21.210> you<00:06:21.270> what<00:06:21.300> sounds<00:06:21.659> like

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
but um i'ma show you what sounds like

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:29.269 
but um i'ma show you what sounds like
with<00:06:21.930> just<00:06:22.169> that<00:06:27.560> this<00:06:28.560> you<00:06:28.830> can<00:06:28.949> hear<00:06:29.129> there's

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279 
with just that this you can hear there's

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.050 
with just that this you can hear there's
a<00:06:29.340> little<00:06:29.550> bit<00:06:29.669> more<00:06:29.789> low<00:06:30.120> end<00:06:31.759> you<00:06:32.759> can<00:06:32.909> see

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
a little bit more low end you can see

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.059 
a little bit more low end you can see
these<00:06:33.240> frequencies<00:06:33.870> are<00:06:34.080> here<00:06:34.680> where<00:06:34.860> they

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
these frequencies are here where they

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:36.890 
these frequencies are here where they
were<00:06:35.129> not<00:06:35.430> on<00:06:35.759> the<00:06:35.819> other<00:06:36.210> guitar<00:06:36.569> tracks

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
were not on the other guitar tracks

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.890 
were not on the other guitar tracks
that's<00:06:37.289> because<00:06:37.940> you<00:06:38.940> will<00:06:39.120> basically<00:06:39.599> want

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
that's because you will basically want

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.209 
that's because you will basically want
to<00:06:39.990> bring<00:06:40.139> out<00:06:40.259> that<00:06:40.379> to<00:06:40.650> be<00:06:40.770> too<00:06:40.949> good<00:06:41.069> to

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
to bring out that to be too good to

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:43.909 
to bring out that to be too good to
great<00:06:41.370> part<00:06:41.699> of<00:06:41.759> the<00:06:41.849> song<00:06:42.120> so<00:06:42.589> you<00:06:43.589> know<00:06:43.680> just

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
great part of the song so you know just

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.980 
great part of the song so you know just
leave<00:06:44.129> it<00:06:44.310> in<00:06:44.400> there<00:06:44.610> for<00:06:44.669> that<00:06:44.969> part<00:06:45.000> it's<00:06:45.870> a

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
leave it in there for that part it's a

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.740 
leave it in there for that part it's a
cool<00:06:46.199> little<00:06:46.400> add<00:06:47.400> some<00:06:48.240> coal<00:06:48.419> production

value<00:06:50.659> whenever<00:06:51.659> you<00:06:51.719> have<00:06:51.810> a<00:06:51.870> guitar<00:06:52.050> solo

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
value whenever you have a guitar solo

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.939 
value whenever you have a guitar solo
throw<00:06:54.060> a<00:06:54.089> little<00:06:54.180> bit<00:06:54.479> of<00:06:54.599> delay<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:55.409> little<00:06:55.860> bit

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
throw a little bit of delay a little bit

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.439 
throw a little bit of delay a little bit
of<00:06:56.039> reverb<00:06:56.310> doesn't<00:06:56.909> have<00:06:57.029> to<00:06:57.180> be<00:06:57.270> anything

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
of reverb doesn't have to be anything

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:58.820 
of reverb doesn't have to be anything
special<00:06:57.629> just<00:06:57.990> a<00:06:58.259> little<00:06:58.500> bit<00:06:58.589> of<00:06:58.710> the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
special just a little bit of the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.980 
special just a little bit of the
built-in<00:06:59.219> stuff<00:06:59.610> and<00:06:59.789> GarageBand<00:07:00.360> it<00:07:00.479> usually

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
built-in stuff and GarageBand it usually

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.649 
built-in stuff and GarageBand it usually
does<00:07:01.139> the<00:07:01.289> trick<00:07:01.319> I<00:07:01.800> mean<00:07:02.490> follow<00:07:03.150> your<00:07:03.389> ears

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
does the trick I mean follow your ears

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:18.999 
does the trick I mean follow your ears
but<00:07:03.960> it<00:07:04.860> usually<00:07:05.009> works<00:07:05.339> for<00:07:05.580> me

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.370
