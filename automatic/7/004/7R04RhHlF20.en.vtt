in this toy spot we're going to be
having<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.550> look<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.120> DC<00:00:33.600> superheroes<00:00:34.200> wave

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
3 as real as real probably was one of
the<00:00:38.400> hardest<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.239> find<00:00:39.270> characters<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:40.230> this

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
the hardest to find somewhat ironic

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.719 
the hardest to find somewhat ironic
however<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> fact<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.220> I<00:01:02.250> bought<00:01:02.519> this

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
however the fact that when I bought this

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.380 
however the fact that when I bought this
figure<00:01:03.089> I<00:01:03.269> as<00:01:04.460> ludicrous<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.030> sounds<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
figure I as ludicrous as it sounds I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
figure I as ludicrous as it sounds I
probably<00:01:06.600> paid<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:07.020> $50<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.040> figure

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
probably paid around $50 for this figure

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.050 
probably paid around $50 for this figure
the<00:01:09.390> figure<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.320> limited<00:01:11.100> chase<00:01:11.430> figure<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the figure was a limited chase figure of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.930 
the figure was a limited chase figure of
the<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> wave<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.220> even<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> find<00:01:14.640> him<00:01:14.880> at

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
the of the wave and even to find him at

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.609 
the of the wave and even to find him at
the<00:01:15.090> time<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.510> this<00:01:15.630> wave<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:16.080> released<00:01:16.409> was

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the time that this wave was released was

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.740 
the time that this wave was released was
next<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> impossible<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.670> did<00:01:18.090> pick<00:01:18.270> him<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
next to impossible I did pick him up and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.109 
next to impossible I did pick him up and
again<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> paid<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
again I paid a little more for it than I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570 
again I paid a little more for it than I
really<00:01:21.360> wanted<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.650> ironic<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
really wanted to it is ironic now to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.080 
really wanted to it is ironic now to
think<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.320> figure<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.090> quite

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
think that to get this figure is quite

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.750 
think that to get this figure is quite
easily<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.689> easy<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.409> find<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.460> this

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
easily not easy to find now because this

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.990 
easily not easy to find now because this
figure<00:01:30.150> got<00:01:30.360> released<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:33.289> Batgirl

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
figure got released with the Batgirl

figure got released with the Batgirl
yes<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.479> Batgirl<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.350> two<00:01:37.649> of<00:01:37.740> them

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
yes with the Batgirl the two of them

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.609 
yes with the Batgirl the two of them

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
initial one let me tell you I I do

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.950

regret<00:02:05.369> painting<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.060> much<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.479> did<00:02:06.659> for

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
regret painting as much as I did for

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.389 
regret painting as much as I did for
this<00:02:07.109> guy<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.679> a<00:02:07.710> nice<00:02:07.950> figure

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
this guy it is a nice figure

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.690 
this guy it is a nice figure
but<00:02:09.410> while<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.619> we'll<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> mean<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
but while what we'll do I mean the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
but while what we'll do I mean the
packaging<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.420> same<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.080> other

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
packaging is the same as the other

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
packaging is the same as the other
figures<00:02:13.650> there's<00:02:13.950> nothing<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.819> different

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
figures there's nothing really different

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.450 
figures there's nothing really different
to<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.750> mean<00:02:16.140> they've<00:02:16.260> still<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> backdrop

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
to I mean they've still got the backdrop

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.190 
to I mean they've still got the backdrop
splash<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.690> put<00:02:18.810> behind<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
splash that you can put behind the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.570 
splash that you can put behind the
characters<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:19.920> that's<00:02:20.069> just<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.370> waste

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
characters I think that's just a waste

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.410 
characters I think that's just a waste
of<00:02:20.730> time<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:22.550> there<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> packaging

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
of time but there you have the packaging

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.510 
of time but there you have the packaging
what<00:02:24.780> I'll<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.140> all<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.770> want<00:02:26.040> spending<00:02:26.400> more

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
what I'll do is all I want spending more

though<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.280> when<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.460> took<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.820> figure<00:02:58.060> out

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
though that when I took the figure out

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.290 
though that when I took the figure out
of<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.390> package<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.830> wasn't<00:03:00.340> as<00:03:00.490> nice<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:01.090> what

I thought he would be the sculpt on him

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
hand is molded shut I guess there is no

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.080 
hand is molded shut I guess there is no
reason<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.800> give<00:04:06.010> him<00:04:06.130> an<00:04:06.220> accessory<00:04:06.790> but<00:04:06.970> it

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
reason to give him an accessory but it

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.340 
reason to give him an accessory but it
would<00:04:07.180> have<00:04:07.239> been<00:04:07.360> nice<00:04:07.510> if<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.810> actually<00:04:07.959> had

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
would have been nice if you actually had

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.070 
would have been nice if you actually had
a<00:04:08.380> hole<00:04:08.739> there<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:10.450> know<00:04:10.540> if<00:04:10.690> he<00:04:10.810> wanted<00:04:11.019> to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
a hole there you know if he wanted to

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.500 
a hole there you know if he wanted to
hold<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.380> Batarang<00:04:11.709> or<00:04:12.040> something<00:04:12.340> else<00:04:12.489> but<00:04:13.360> he

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
hold a Batarang or something else but he

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.330 
hold a Batarang or something else but he
has<00:04:13.630> articulation<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.560> shoulders<00:04:15.010> he<00:04:15.250> has

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
has articulation in the shoulders he has

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.570

what<00:04:18.580> disappointed<00:04:19.359> me<00:04:19.450> about<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.780> figure

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
what disappointed me about the figure

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.900 
what disappointed me about the figure
first<00:04:20.350> of<00:04:20.560> all<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> fact<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.430> figure

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
first of all is the fact that the figure

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.420 
first of all is the fact that the figure
itself<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.660> really<00:04:23.050> loose<00:04:23.380> at<00:04:24.010> least<00:04:24.250> my

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
itself is really loose at least my

about Azrael was this really cool cape

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.090 
about Azrael was this really cool cape
that<00:06:08.610> they<00:06:08.789> they<00:06:09.270> drew<00:06:09.570> on<00:06:09.750> him<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.979> the

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
that they they drew on him and that the

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.610 
that they they drew on him and that the
character<00:06:11.340> or<00:06:11.760> the<00:06:11.940> figure<00:06:12.180> does<00:06:12.510> sport<00:06:13.470> that

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
character or the figure does sport that

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.110 
character or the figure does sport that
same<00:06:13.919> cape<00:06:14.190> which<00:06:14.400> is<00:06:14.550> really<00:06:14.789> really<00:06:14.940> nice

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
same cape which is really really nice

same cape which is really really nice
it's<00:06:16.020> just<00:06:16.110> a<00:06:16.350> shame<00:06:16.700> that<00:06:17.700> we've<00:06:17.880> got<00:06:18.060> this

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
it's just a shame that we've got this

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.450

really<00:06:18.510> weird<00:06:18.630> stance<00:06:19.470> on<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.830> character<00:06:20.250> I

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
really weird stance on the character I

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.670 
really weird stance on the character I
don't<00:06:21.090> even<00:06:21.390> think<00:06:21.539> they<00:06:21.840> improved<00:06:22.289> on<00:06:22.500> this

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
don't even think they improved on this

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.290 
don't even think they improved on this
when<00:06:22.890> they<00:06:23.010> released<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.580> 2-pack<00:06:24.030> of<00:06:24.240> the

characters they just essentially kept

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.029

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
the exact same mold so if you guys go

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.790 
the exact same mold so if you guys go
and<00:06:29.220> find<00:06:29.550> this<00:06:29.729> mole<00:06:30.000> the<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.630> 2-pack<00:06:31.110> you're

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
and find this mole the the 2-pack you're

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.409 
and find this mole the the 2-pack you're
gonna<00:06:31.889> end<00:06:32.250> up<00:06:32.460> getting<00:06:32.729> the<00:06:32.820> exact<00:06:33.150> same
