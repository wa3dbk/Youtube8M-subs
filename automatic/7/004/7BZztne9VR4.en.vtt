00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.900
 9 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.429
 9 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.429
 the 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.239
 louis van gaal it is a top coach the case 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.529
 therefore a source of inspiration for me 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.090
 his expertise is unquestionable, he has recently appeared 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.800
 against 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.410
 the moderate results in the bundesliga and a chairman who jokes that he does not 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.770
 communicates well 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.400
 if I don't look you up he admits that the physical hurts but none 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.090
 panic 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.850
 we are certainly not 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.360
 well i think this year is a very difficult year that it has to do 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.800
 with the a world championship that has to do with 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.700
 also the fact that all those players from bayern munich are actually great 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.080
 have performed 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 and they will come back and they must try again 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.760
 to focus on oneself 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.110
 opera different order victories or titles and that is quite difficult 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.680
 everyone can generally handle a physical fit but made it 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.250
 that's a festive thing 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.680
 nevertheless proved a bit difficult so I suspect we thought rain 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.040
 we ensure some success 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.130
 and then we have to next year 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.220
 then we must have another fantastic year for the long term 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.130
 it was all for us to set up a booth four days later 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.230
 therefore not as a leader in a direct attack on nothing 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.149
 yet 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.290
 houses 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.870
 9 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.770
 On training it appears that was always in the vvd 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.220
 his success has led me to the characteristic of his game of coach 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.510
 to ask and that turns out to have been ten and to raise awareness 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.250
 You can of course watch everything on the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 it is an option throw 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.410
 in my opinion, that is the least important aspect of the football association 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.739
 sit at bayern munich on leave or at sparta on at feyenoord 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.079
 selected 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.019
 the sitting already differs rather people 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.319
 so it is generally good that you only have to do it there until now 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.129
 grab bag and then it is also handy if you have the 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.710
 measure and that it is therefore confirmed 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.119
 in what you see 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.939
 m and that you can therefore make better decisions as a trainer coach 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.909
 but the most important thing is a difference 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.770
 that I am in the trainer's brain 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.079
 that here is trained very hard on the physical 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.489
 in there the players must of course also be clear 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:54.559
 the sec of i train in the brain what do we mean exactly what are 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.439
 then the differences both players are normally getting used to 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.930
 that they become aware 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.590
 wait the opponent becomes what we then have to do as a group 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.769
 not as an individual but as a team yes and that you must work together as a result 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.460
 with each other because be aware this is a lot of footballers that 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.180
 be intuitive you shouldn't be intuitive later but they do 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.280
 did let us know what the team mail and teammates should than the intuitive 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.789
 players can again 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:30.109
 followed by work of making sure that you as a team can have a samurai sword fun 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.699
 the last elections 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.679
 it is nl 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.679
 in addition, there are not yet 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.139
 I saw this morning at the training the 88 having a family for the keeper to measure up 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.119
 9 to 9 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.389
 his training form in the small field 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.049
 and what do you say the were four periods seems like water polo the interior is 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.609
 the five minutes and 55 years and older we expect we have a great 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.239
 from 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.860
 15 9 that has one of the first half and then of course there is as much as possible 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.579
 the fall will be during the concert of young people who request assistance 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.479
 convey a understood message but what do I say then 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.209
 my party was the victory away from the party but then you also know what you are behind 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.019
 let you 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.410
 and in July and were not always on our play in the first party 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.219
 only then can you, for the last time, have a lot of room behind them, I knew that 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.300
 in advance then I say you should take care 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.450
 that you have more space around the car 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.289
 only before they have a lot of trouble with that 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.969
 But then you must also be able to ensure that their oppressors and in the first game 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.430
 he has kept my party the boat under pressure making them easy that 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.439
 could play balls in this space 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.759
 the first period 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.039
 last year also that the long ball painted muller but by the john f 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.780
 that was dangerous yes but someone like the killer is that is worrying 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.780
 and I cannot defend that freedom 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.900
 the love for ajax is over 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.550
 For Sparta a starter cherish club that still has warm feelings 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.259
 but lead to a possible return to the castle 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.080
 I still have dreams and that is once again experiencing a World Cup 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 but if that was not so yes then that is a pity 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.150
 but i have my sweater 7 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.949
 Believers welcome to stop 55 and the A59 my contract expires because sir 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.889
 61 so yes I think I am also done at the end of my 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.270
 career that i would be so simple it he thank you very much 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.110
 want to receive where you enjoyed we have seen a nice training 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.900
 and also were allowed to come back 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.530
 but to sell then
