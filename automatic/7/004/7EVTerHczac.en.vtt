00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.259
 I am gilberto lÃ³pez veterinarian 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.629
 clinical clinic clinic owner 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.440
 veterinary and canine aesthetics 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.820
 obviously we are dedicated to the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.919
 veterinary medicine to medicine 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.320
 veterinary of small species this 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.470
 it means that we serve puppies 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.439
 cats some series of exotic pets 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.449
 like snake drones, well, well, 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.060
 we have some years dedicated to these 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.599
 precisely in this clinic we have a 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.400
 seniority of 20 years serving then 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.810
 mainly to the community of otay 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600
 but in general to what has been 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.510
 the entire Tijuana area and in some 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.050
 cases clients clients of the state 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.539
 from california that veterinary clinic 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.160
 It has different headquarters sections what 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.600
 obviously the attention 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.820
 Regarding the public consultation 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 vaccines but we also handle the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.410
 radiology aspect and everything 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.920
 confers in relation to medicine 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.379
 internal diagnosis of problems 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.590
 internal kidney problems in 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.750
 oncology without a doubt and also 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.750
 we have the area of aesthetics that at the level 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.470
 in case we receive animals that 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.440
 they come to consultation for some problem of 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.900
 health, the first thing we do is take 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.900
 the weight of the body weight this situation 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.970
 of body weight is of paramount importance 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.160
 because all medicines everything 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.250
 that is going to occupy the aspect ratio 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.110
 of therapy to save the problem by 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.210
 which is crossing because it has to be 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.040
 dosed according to precisely 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.470
 That weight must be taken into consideration 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.350
 that all medications 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.450
 then they are dosed according to the weight 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.300
 body of each copy of each 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.450
 pet takes the weight either in pounds 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.190
 or in kilos of international way all 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.140
 the medicines in veterinary medicine 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.570
 come dosed according to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.979
 milligram per kilo of weight and if by 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.320
 example as in the case of this one 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.450
 short that weighs 22 pounds or the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.460
 equivalent of 10 kilos then we are going to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.320
 multiply the amount of milligrams 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.750
 per kilogram of live weight according to 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.700
 the formula according each drug and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.400
 so let's multiply by 10 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.020
 kilos of weight of this short and thus 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.240
 then we will know the amount of 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 milligrams that we're going to use 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.280
 to calculate effectively and safely 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.890
 the medicine you need to 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.890
 Obviously recover the state of health 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.850
 a veterinarian must know a 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.040
 direct proportion not knowing how to use 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.100
 since he works with animals 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.930
 different size different weight and it is not 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.540
 the same thing the medicine that is put 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.319
 a small animal or one that is very 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.290
 big therefore this ratio is 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.080
 valid since if the weight goes up it 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.660
 you have to increase the medication 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.510
 here let's suppose that for a certain 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.340
 standard measurement is no longer calculated the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.690
 incognita and you can know the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 medication that you have to put 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.590
 when we have a medication we put the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.350
 example of amoxicillin that are 220 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.590
 milligrams there are times when 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.840
 for ease of administration 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.820
 we're going to have to do a rounding but 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.300
 always always round it's going to have 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.300
 to be to the highest degree ever 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.120
 we are going to dose less because a 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.060
 dosage below the standard 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.230
 normal below what is required 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.080
 it will probably cause us a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.610
 resistance of the bacteria problem 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.650
 that we are attending and that 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.290
 obviously we seek to fight and 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.700
 solve and in such a way that we do not go 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.740
 never to dose then to the term below 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.810
 We will always look for the term 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.570
 superior in this case using of 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.810
 new account the example of the capsule of 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.080
 250 milligrams if this friend requires 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.060
 of 220 milligrams true old like that is if 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.920
 It requires 220 milligrams because 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.770
 let's go to the comfort of the capsule 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.630
 of 250 milligrams in this way 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.710
 we're only going to give you 30 milligrams 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.900
 more 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.590
 I'm definitely going to repeat again 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.390
 be preferable instead of using a 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.420
 lower dosage we always go to 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.810
 look for a very important light a very 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.210
 light dosage of more based on 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.450
 rounding way but always looking 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.340
 the benefit of our pet when 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.430
 rounds a number is important 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.600
 say if it's the position in the units 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.390
 tens of hundreds oppositions in decimal 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.030
 one digit is taken and if it is equal or greater 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.960
 to 5 the number is changed to multiple 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:52.440
 greater close to 10 and if it is less than 5 the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.070
 digit the number is changed to the multiple 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.680
 less than 10 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.639
 in the case of the veterinarian always 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.069
 round in a way 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.139
 positive you can not go up and 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.689
 we commented a moment ago also the 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.159
 importance of some products that 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.039
 can be administered topically 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.409
 superficial way on the skin there 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.719
 some skin problems that require 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.789
 of medicated baths and we also know that 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.129
 there are conversions that there are tables that 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.650
 according to volume to khor to volume 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.749
 body to the size of the copy in 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.490
 also related to its weight we are going to 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.560
 calculate the amount of medication that 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.539
 we will use in the case of medicine 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.580
 veterinary of puppies we need 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.529
 also take into consideration no 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.289
 only the volume of the weight but in 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.750
 some cases the thickness and the amount of 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.529
 fur that they can have in such a way 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.569
 that we need to know how to apply 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:47.240
 correctly the mathematical calculation for 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:50.800
 achieve the therapeutic effects for 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.449
 obviously achieve the redundancy 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.240
 obtain and recover health status 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.219
 of each pet of each specimen 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.400
 then as you can see the 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.810
 mathematics because they are of very high value 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.910
 an overdose as we are going to 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.330
 end up causing problems to our 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.270
 j that pet that we want to return the 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.790
 return to health and obviously a 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.460
 inadequate dosage because it's going to 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.100
 thus give an inappropriate result also 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.780
 you have to apply those mathematics of 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.780
 right way in the right way 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.570
 no no 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.450
 if you like to say he saw and I understood him 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.970
 what you just saw give us a like and
