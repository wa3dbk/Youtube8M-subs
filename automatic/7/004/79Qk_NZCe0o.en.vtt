00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.019
 with this very first installment of use 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.160
 up your week with mitchell and in this 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.190
 very first episode I want it 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.990
 with you the lemon and this fruit 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.609
 morning frosting every morning 3 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.590
 did not own glass of lemon water and went 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.369
 I do that through a whole lemon from the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.099
 presses in the user and can be extended with 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 yes water and detour as clean as possible 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.800
 do initially is Vitamin C 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.899
 is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 is a lemon packed with fell for 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.969
 packed with vitamin c and yes we know with 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.090
 its all that this is a very good one 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.730
 In addition, the immune system booster is the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.110
 lemon is also an alkalizing fruit 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.539
 though the lemon of itself 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 of course it is very acidic make sure it is 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.800
 for an alkalizing effect for you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.879
 body that means that it is ph 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 level 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.719
 so hourly basis hourly basic level of yours 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.780
 body is very well regulated 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.840
 by taking a lemon 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.250
 in addition, the lemon is the lemon water 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.290
 is very hydrating too, is the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.970
 lemon is really good for the liver 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.840
 a very good one that cactus delivers 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.360
 detox sailing 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.189
 and these are all actually reasons 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.540
 why do I drink lemon water first 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.820
 thing in the morning i also know that as 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 let you true what i drink during 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.799
 make better choices for food every day 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 which to my one i also know that all 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.799
 lemon mate that drinks the following 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 meal that I take gets better 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.400
 absorbed by my body and so on 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.189
 but lemon water is finally good 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.619
 for a whole lot of things and therefore 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.939
 a glass of lemon water 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.829
 actually made lemon water 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.710
 by cutting the lemon into one 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.040
 few pieces so that they are neat in the user 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 I can then be Hurom slowjuicer 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.140
 and therefore I must have the fruits 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.700
 I cut something smaller so I cut them 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.710
 in segments 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.860
 i then turn on the user and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.280
 here above for my pieces 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.280
 lemon 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.860
 them piece 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.740
 and the juice now contains 1 in the shower 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.060
 lemon 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:35.200
 well i love this nice cup below and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.200
 I will run one more time 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.810
 so in this cup is now the juice of 1 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.400
 lemon and then I pour cake 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.170
 distilled water with you this is 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.239
 basically water from a bottle try it 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.980
 take out glass bottles or very thick 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.810
 and otherwise perhaps just tap water 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.879
 but for this video i take it 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.580
 good example and just take care of one 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.180
 clean water and I prefer to make that 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.180
 just a little longer 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:15.430
 hot and so here I have half a liter 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.690
 pure sparkling lemon water what i like 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.690
 fortress in the morning urge 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.079
 delicious and that is why i 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.970
 drink lemon water i hope you like it
