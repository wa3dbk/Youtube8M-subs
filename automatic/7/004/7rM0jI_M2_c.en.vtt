00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
around the top of the keg my cutting

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.699 
around the top of the keg my cutting
wheel<00:02:08.429> started<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.910> wear<00:02:09.420> down<00:02:09.690> I've<00:02:10.500> actually

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
wheel started to wear down I've actually

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.830 
wheel started to wear down I've actually
started<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.220> cut<00:02:11.430> through<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.390> top<00:02:12.630> in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
started to cut through the the top in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.230 
started to cut through the the top in
some<00:02:13.080> sections<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.680> what's<00:02:14.370> happening<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.970> is

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
some sections so what's happening is is

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.440 
some sections so what's happening is is
the<00:02:15.510> wheels<00:02:15.720> hitting<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.970> couple<00:02:17.970> different

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the wheels hitting a couple different

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.449 
the wheels hitting a couple different
surfaces<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> same<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.010> it's

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
surfaces at the same time and it's

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.110 
surfaces at the same time and it's
wearing<00:02:20.910> down<00:02:21.030> very<00:02:21.240> quickly<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.730> figured

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
wearing down very quickly so I figured

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.199 
wearing down very quickly so I figured
go<00:02:24.300> ahead<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.630> put<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> new<00:02:25.230> disc<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.209> just

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
go ahead and put a new disc on and just

00:02:27.209 --> 00:04:58.250 
go ahead and put a new disc on and just
finish<00:02:27.510> out<00:02:27.720> cutting

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.340 

now<00:04:59.260> that<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.590> tops<00:04:59.860> cut<00:05:00.220> off<00:05:01.020> what<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.169> want

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
now that the tops cut off what you want

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.610 
now that the tops cut off what you want
to<00:05:02.410> do<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.740> blind<00:05:03.130> out<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:04.840> edge<00:05:05.110> because

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
to do is blind out that edge because

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.590 
to do is blind out that edge because
it's<00:05:05.770> very<00:05:05.949> sharp<00:05:06.370> there's<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.300> lot<00:05:07.479> of

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
it's very sharp there's a lot of

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.890 
it's very sharp there's a lot of
splinters<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:09.280> just<00:05:09.520> want<00:05:09.699> to<00:05:09.900> remove

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
splinters and you just want to remove

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.260 
splinters and you just want to remove
anything<00:05:11.199> that<00:05:11.410> uh<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:12.490> know<00:05:12.580> could<00:05:12.880> cut<00:05:13.090> you

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
anything that uh you know could cut you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:06:08.250 
anything that uh you know could cut you
so<00:05:13.600> just<00:05:14.350> take<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.590> grinding<00:05:15.100> wheel<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:15.340> um

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
all right well there you have it the top

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.519 
all right well there you have it the top
of<00:07:08.159> the<00:07:08.219> kegs<00:07:08.460> been<00:07:08.699> cut<00:07:08.939> off<00:07:09.089> I<00:07:09.389> know<00:07:10.229> the<00:07:10.469> edge

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:10.529 
of the kegs been cut off I know the edge

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.790 
of the kegs been cut off I know the edge
has<00:07:10.710> been<00:07:10.860> smoothed<00:07:11.189> down<00:07:11.659> so<00:07:12.659> now<00:07:13.589> we'll<00:07:13.770> be

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
has been smoothed down so now we'll be

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.180
