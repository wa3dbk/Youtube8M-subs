game<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.089> played<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.480> scored<00:00:16.139> 10<00:00:16.440> goals<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
game that I played I scored 10 goals and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.890 
game that I played I scored 10 goals and
got<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.490> assist<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.000> guy<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.750> must

say<00:00:19.109> when<00:00:19.859> using<00:00:20.310> him<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.270> felt<00:00:21.539> like

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
say when using him I I kind of felt like

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.090 
say when using him I I kind of felt like
he<00:00:21.779> needed<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.109> get<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> bit<00:00:22.439> warming<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.010> as

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
he needed to get a bit warming up in as

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.380 
he needed to get a bit warming up in as
well<00:00:23.250> as<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.400> could<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.760> medium<00:00:24.119> medium

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
well as you could see is medium medium

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.660 
well as you could see is medium medium
work<00:00:24.570> right<00:00:24.750> there<00:00:24.930> he<00:00:25.740> kind<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> stays<00:00:26.430> back<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
work right there he kind of stays back a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
work right there he kind of stays back a
bit<00:00:26.910> his<00:00:27.060> positioning<00:00:27.599> was<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.199> annoying

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
bit his positioning was a bit annoying

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.970 
bit his positioning was a bit annoying
for<00:00:28.830> me<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> used<00:00:30.240> them<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.980> 451

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
for me so I used them up in the 451

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.549 
for me so I used them up in the 451
second<00:00:32.730> formation<00:00:33.149> he<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.410> just

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
second formation he just it was just

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.959 
second formation he just it was just
something<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> push<00:00:35.100> him<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.340> quite<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
something to push him up quite a bit and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.450 
something to push him up quite a bit and
as<00:00:36.180> soon<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.570> did<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.260> did<00:00:37.530> notice<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.100> lot

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
as soon as I did that I did notice a lot

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040 
as soon as I did that I did notice a lot
more<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> him<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.120> more<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
more out of him it was just more the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.750 
more out of him it was just more the
problem<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.469> generally<00:00:40.950> having<00:00:41.190> him<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.670> an

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
problem of generally having him in an

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.310 
problem of generally having him in an
attacking<00:00:42.090> position<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> time

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
attacking position because a lot of time

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590 
attacking position because a lot of time
I<00:00:43.559> found<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.070> midfielders<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> lot<00:00:45.149> higher<00:00:45.300> not

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I found my midfielders a lot higher not

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.910 
I found my midfielders a lot higher not
just<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.870> midfield<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.350> most<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
just one midfield up most one with the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.709 
just one midfield up most one with the
fielders<00:00:47.250> were<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> lot<00:00:48.030> further<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.450> than<00:00:48.570> he

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
fielders were a lot further up than he

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.750 
fielders were a lot further up than he
was<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.770> apart<00:00:50.160> from<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.640> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
was but I'm apart from that he was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.549 
was but I'm apart from that he was
actually<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.510> awesome<00:00:51.809> player<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> use

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
actually a really awesome player to use

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.950 
actually a really awesome player to use
I<00:00:52.710> didn't<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:54.000> much<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> his<00:00:54.600> paces

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
I didn't really think much of his paces

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020 
I didn't really think much of his paces
or<00:00:55.050> ATT<00:00:55.320> pace<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.190> admittedly<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.910> quite

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
or ATT pace and admittedly that is quite

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
or ATT pace and admittedly that is quite
a<00:00:57.090> bit<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.539> again<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> same<00:00:58.140> time<00:00:58.320> he<00:00:58.620> felt

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
a bit but again at the same time he felt

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
a bit but again at the same time he felt
kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> sluggish<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.940> times<00:00:59.969> every<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
kind of sluggish at times every now and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
kind of sluggish at times every now and
then<00:01:01.140> he'd<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> little<00:01:02.190> break<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:02.609> from

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
then he'd make a little break out from

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.039 
then he'd make a little break out from
the<00:01:02.940> defenders<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> absolutely

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the defenders which is absolutely

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.870 
the defenders which is absolutely
awesome<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.439> believe<00:01:04.769> me<00:01:04.799> he's<00:01:05.460> got<00:01:05.670> some

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
awesome because believe me he's got some

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
awesome because believe me he's got some
incredible<00:01:06.689> physical<00:01:06.900> stats<00:01:07.380> he<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:08.010> powers

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
incredible physical stats he just powers

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
incredible physical stats he just powers
through<00:01:08.670> everyone<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.950> lot<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> other

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
through everyone but a lot the other

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
through everyone but a lot the other
time<00:01:11.340> he<00:01:11.520> did<00:01:11.700> feel<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:11.909> sluggish<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.630> he

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
time he did feel really sluggish and he

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
time he did feel really sluggish and he
did<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.110> took<00:01:13.770> him<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.100> time<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
did it took him a bit of time just to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
did it took him a bit of time just to
pick<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.540> his<00:01:15.630> pace<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.890> something<00:01:17.009> a

pretty Oh piece easy I think he's 6 for
26<00:02:29.830> 13<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:31.710> yeah<00:02:32.710> as<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.040> probably

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
26 13 so I'm yeah as you can probably

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.340 
26 13 so I'm yeah as you can probably
tell<00:02:33.310> he's<00:02:34.000> going<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.450> win<00:02:34.630> motives<00:02:35.110> headers

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and get them in goes was that the main

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.420 
and get them in goes was that the main
obvious<00:02:38.020> thing<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.350> his<00:02:38.530> strength<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.280> is
