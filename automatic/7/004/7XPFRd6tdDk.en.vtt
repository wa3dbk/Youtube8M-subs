00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello is teaching you to do 205 thousand 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.320
 tales in 30 days 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:18.199
 is for this you will need to have light 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:21.380
 listener will need is opened the option 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.380
 cauliflower 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.480
 and make this option in the period of 12 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:35.500
 hours day 12 hours day you want to do 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.290
 24 hours I find it difficult but 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.330
 She's tried 12 hours ago. 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:48.930
 have 15 free spaces here until the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:51.610
 11 in em t 15 free spaces in the field 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.180
 What are you going to do to the account is a lot? 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.180
 simple 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.030
 I do not take 20 you have an account in 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.900
 following way 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.800
 It's every four minutes you get one 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.920
 energy 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.790
 then it means that in an hour you have 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.290
 15 energies ok 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.050
 again every four minutes you win 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:26.030
 an energy in the period of one hour you 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:28.460
 You have one hour to have 15 energies in the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.380
 here if you have to understand that in 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.899
 case of the one hour period you have a 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.910
 limit that reaches its energies it does not 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.090
 It depends on what I do in my case. 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.100
 It takes 20 to 35 if this is merely 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.149
 limit 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.970
 so that's why you have to enter 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.740
 practically every one hour in the case 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.330
 here you will enter in an hour and a half 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:54.800
 every hour and a half because what the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.910
 item here is the corot it is a period of 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.610
 a half hour 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:05.210
 so what are you to do your planting 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:07.659
 body with was planted here just this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.659
 stayed 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.450
 fine 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.330
 we set up a good team 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:39.110
 let's now look look 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:56.180
 good is important to do and if this 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.909
 action and you have is balanced in case 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.540
 your energies at planting at harvest 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:06.590
 so you will stay a period 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.569
 long to do this here to run a 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.139
 time that you placed the account is 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.060
 very simple every after an hour 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.120
 and a half you know here you're going to reap 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.980
 15 I make each foot of lettuce 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:27.760
 as it is written there I do not 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:31.040
 Cauliflower foot cauliflower it goes 38 contos 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.069
 for each unit 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.030
 in that you planted 15 units 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.239
 you will get 570 contos that you will 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.099
 receive this implantation plan here 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.430
 so it's easy to do the math on 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:51.099
 12 hours 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.099
 It's an hour and a half will give 720 minutes 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:57.169
 seven hundred and twenty minutes in néné 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:06.290
 period there goes of the energy will give 180 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:11.319
 of energy then 180 divided is x 38 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:15.919
 Are you going to have it there at the end of 12 hours? 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:20.090
 6,840 bills to receive on the day 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:25.669
 then this in 30 days 6,840 in 30 days 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.889
 of 2k with 205 thousand and 200 contos but you 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.840
 You can vary this by doing in case 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.840
 12 hours because normally the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.990
 person sleeps, will not you do this 24 hours? 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.490
 then in that period you can 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.710
 winning may have 205 thousand 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.230
 another video when you then determine 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.770
 and I'll prove it to you, it's okay. 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.020
 205,000 of mine is doing here. 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:58.880
 to spend $ 205,000 worth a lot of money 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:01.710
 why just look, let's see who sees the 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.200
 accent is a place here, no, I did not go 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.000
 wrong place so I'll go here 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:12.110
 you see how much it costs you 205 000 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.680
 buy here you see you have to have 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:20.820
 1500 with is money no money account 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.690
 even to exchange for 120 thousand exchanges 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.400
 usually you had 3 thousand to give 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.200
 this value he will make during a 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.750
 month and without and 205 thousand you can count 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.740
 A lot of you observe data and 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.440
 buy a lot on my lighter than a 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:45.090
 most expensive decoration if changed to 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:51.800
 see that it costs seven thousand and five hundred 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:55.850
 about thirteen thousand 16 thousand to 19 thousand twenty thousand 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.250
 30 thousand an entry copy costs 30 thousand 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.020
 the statement is from the heart here then 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.890
 worth doing in 30 days is not enough 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.510
 time 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.510
 I went to enjoy a tan
