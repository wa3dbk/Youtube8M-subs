00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.850
 text the mother god pack 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.059
 well I will close well of what they are 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.650

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.650
 here we have the diamond swords 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.880
 I like them a lot because they are 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.380
 little girls here we have the enchanted 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.360
 it would be with this animation has a 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.940
 delighted so do not eat it 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.270
 with alcohol and its particles that are 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.270
 those of 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.920
 normal is the enchanted arch no longer 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.470
 delighted here we see that the bank has 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.900
 three powers perceive that is to say the three 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.910
 charging modes we have the green the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.800
 orange 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.800
 from the orange you can go to 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.589
 but good 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.940
 that's already your thing here I have some 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.940
 dates that are pretty cool 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.739
 the peaks 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.340
 h 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.370
 then we have the iron sword 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.229
 the stone is ready 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.540
 and the stone that we are 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.080
 pretty cool 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.860
 and theirs 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.150
 I'll put 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.150
 is called 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.310
 and I pray like that in that order we would be 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.580
 good as you can see the diamond is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580
 different 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 not talking between the and pretty good 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.560
 enchanted looks like this 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.970
 normal 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.610
 but this and the subject 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.620
 normalito without anything special here 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.850
 we have some armor 'iron man' 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.450
 that I'm not going to teach because it 's all 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.450

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 Diamond 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.340
 which are obviously the same fruits 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.580
 of the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.370
 good are the particles 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.970
 here we see the carrot 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.600
 the salmon 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.570
 to children 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.570
 and that's how I would be burning 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.990
 here we have the poster that goes very 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.990

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.230
 and all types of wood and things 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.000
 that I love the lamps of the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.210
 subway that water how would it look like 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.210

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.590
 and we have 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.440
 the asset made is a serious process so 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.290
 bitter 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.290
 and what would be the water current 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.290
 quite 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.180
 Thank you 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.180

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.220
 in his special touch we are going to take 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.960
 a little of mechel 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.790

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.060
 here you have seen here what is the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.780
 house bar 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.780

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.190
 then we go 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.190
 Now let's choose this 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.290
 now that you see everything is pretty 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.290
 pimp 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.139

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.860
 circuits these all 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.860
 very easy 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.190
 It is a very normal night that has 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.060
 more special 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.060

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.310
 At the end of the whole we get at least 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.050
 to me 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.880
