infantry I've got to the triarii as well
but<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.590> trickiest<00:02:28.980> bit<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.880> just

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
but the trickiest bit really is just

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.750 
but the trickiest bit really is just
well<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.769> wouldn't<00:02:32.070> say<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> trickiest<00:02:32.519> bit

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
well I wouldn't say the trickiest bit

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.130 
well I wouldn't say the trickiest bit
the<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.239> bit<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.510> takes<00:02:33.690> longest<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the the bit that takes longest is the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.380 
the the bit that takes longest is the
shields<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.800> be<00:02:34.920> fair<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.150> they're
