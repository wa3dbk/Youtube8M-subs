00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 two 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.260
 at this moment he comes to talk 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.660
 passion 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.700
 as a sheath and to seven 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.280
 mature suggestive times is for you 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.500
 You can protect it before it 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.160
 discard the seeds let's see with 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.160
 these examples 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.890
 as you can see in this pod 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.130
 is not a rule but those are that 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.010
 they come from colored flowers 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.810
 they are going to start presenting a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.210
 pigmentation the sheath as it goes 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.650
 maturing this week of account that 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.250
 has a green dot even has 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.250
 like a month 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.369
 and that the pod came out 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.369
 still here 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.320
 an example that is already advanced such 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 once a month and a half we can see in this 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.400
 that the back is already grabbing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.350
 a coloration 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.110
 but still in the part of here in the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.970
 still do not present and I do not know no 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.090
 you get to open the pod completely 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.090
 is still closed like these too 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.120
 still missing that color change in 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.710
 this part 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.890
 so you can know if you're already 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.350
 soon to start opening 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.370
 now I 'm going to show you a pod that 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.370
 it's almost ready 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 is for example these in fact already has 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.140
 your mesh as you can see 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.119
 this pod is already beginning to present 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.979
 a darker coloration and also 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.509
 where is the where is the opening of 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.460
 where the seeds are going to go where 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.740
 to start drying is already starting to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.869
 changing color in this area indicates that 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.630
 it already has about two months to 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.700
 two months ten days or less 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.310
 critical moment of the pods if the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.940
 they are monitoring from the second 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.190
 month is when they have to do this 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.130
 look for a mesh in tubul mosquitero lo 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.770
 they want 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.480
 to tie protect them 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.340
 because literature tells us that the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.870
 pods mature from two and a half months to 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.849
 three 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.030
 then the second month is the month 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.299
 critical in which if you do not realize and 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.370
 you do not see it in time when it says open that 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.700
 opening 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.040
 or almost at 24 hours this pod carries 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.220
 start to dry and it's going to open it's going to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.650
 completely collapse and all the seeds 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.629
 they will be starting to dry what they are 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.909
 the hairs they have for 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.079
 spread that is through the air and 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.590
 you are going to escape 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.239
 the tulle is going to help you so that when 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.409
 open if you did not notice that when 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.540
 open all the seeds are going to be 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.430
 captured here 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.219
 What do I want to teach you in this 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.769
 moment a pod of two months what if 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.930
 you can calculate it already they have to 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.930
 tie up but in the young pods that 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.989
 they have a month and a half editions and 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.140
 means still have the time have 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.000
 time to avoid covering them for 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.980
 let them give them the light that they 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.670
 give the sun there is no problem there is no 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.670
 no detail 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.870
 the advantages it has that are plants 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.239
 these are totally sun plants 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.950
 what are the recommendations 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.319
 main things you have to have in your 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.760
 plants first the subscriber has to see 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.650
 speaking we have coupled has to be 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.480
 sufficiently paid for 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.550
 when the bees come or if you 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.630
 pollinate grow large pages and 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.990
 strong so that the sun 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.070
 or what is the use of the sun 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.600
 really what you have noticed is that when 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.580
 the pod even when it is already 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.310
 point of ripening the sun also helps you 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.070
 to totally sneak in what is the 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.420
 capsule that the pods release but 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.420
 as they are completely flat ground 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.030
 then obviously they require that 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.889
 light intensity 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.690
 Now I 'm going to show you an example of 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.380
 a page in the case of flowers 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.870
 white 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.120
 these that cost little bit 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.420
 pigment these are more complicated of 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.910
 know how much how long they have because 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.200
 they will never change color although I 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.950
 I will tell you that from experience the best 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.800
 way of knowing whether if the chair is more 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.320
 or less arriving at two months is with 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.560
 this opening you see that they are already well 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.090
 defined also marked and that you more 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.400
 or less it gives you to understand that it is already 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.729
 soon to be two months old or already 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.370
 he's two months old and he's going to be next 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.050
 maybe 30 days on someone what's going to 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.589
 start to open and dry to release 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.199
 the seeds a method that I do 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:08.779
 I dedicate myself to observe them daily then 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.569
 are every 24 hours then I observed 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:13.639
 what I do is take one side and the 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.800
 other doing a little bit of pressure as if 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.539
 I would like to open it 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.310
 but the cyber is doing it right now 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.870
 the pressure and it does not open for anything this 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.129
 it means that it still matures 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.639
 pod when you open it and you see that it 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.190
 free 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.319
 begins to open means that it is already 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.050
 about 24 to 48 hours 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.099
 This page will dry and will mature and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.020
 at that moment you will release the 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.240
 seeds that's the right time to 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.919
 know if you can not be watching 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.699
 so they have to do the method 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.800
 of the mesh cover it and take it from its 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.240
 time to be agreed should go 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.440
 to visit them and they do not have to have 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.729
 worry that they will go to 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.620
 escape the seeds because that what 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.900
 important the seeds I do not have any 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.430
 example here but the seeds have the 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.840
 hair lights on both sides of the 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.800
 capsule to fly with the wind 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.159
 everything I wanted to talk to them about 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.159
 moment 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.360
 this
