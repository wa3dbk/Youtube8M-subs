00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.259
 Hello dear friends of the well-groomed 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 Household today we want one another 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.029
 take care of your upholstered furniture 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.070
 because it happened and nobody 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 knows what to do in an emergency 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 the speech is of stain accidents 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.859
 the upholstered furniture but I have mine 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.210
 beloved girls asked what the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.580
 most common and especially the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 most visible spots are and how 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.739
 the pistol shot came the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.629
 Grease stains from eating china food pizza 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.430
 Chips whole piggy is just important 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.559
 when something falls on the sofa and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.610
 you do not notice it directly what already 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.550
 can happen 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.750
 I love these things I show you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.699
 times because you do not notice it right the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.469
 nationwide you are still really nice 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.660
 firmly 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.670
 then you should first with the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.500
 Dull side of a knife on it 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.500
 go and the whole line carefully 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.290
 but mostly you have it anyway 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.400
 producing a stain and wanting that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.860
 we do not necessarily on the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 couch tastes best with warm 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.259
 water so 30 degrees warm and detergent 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 I do not do it for you now 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.840
 very good little squads purely then go 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.460
 I just come in with a rag and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.490
 dab not after drifting but 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.670
 really only use 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.829
 We are not so good for the fabric though 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.810
 you should know what else you can 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.060
 wash petrol simply rework 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.970
 give a little rag and said 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.649
 After dabbing an important info if you 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.360
 then try these mediocre 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.860
 best in an invisible place 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.560
 because depending on the substance, it can be here too 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.560
 discoloration comes the typical 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.909
 TV drinks are of course red wine 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.649
 and cola 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.840
 both dark liquids the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.880
 cause terrible stains formation 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 yes and what we do as we turn in 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.179
 best case our salt trick at the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.830
 I have you ever 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.750
 Carpets showed that works 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.640
 wonderful I'll show you here now 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.350
 on a pillow because I have the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.000
 entire surface has not been tried there 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.910
 we have our red wine stain 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.769
 Now I give a lot 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.080
 conventional salt on the stain that 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.790
 May be really much for that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.840
 salt sucks the wine from the fabric house 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.720
 that I'm a bit tough you can see it 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.630
 already and club for now with one 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.109
 Clean cloth after remaining salt can 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.260
 Just to the side stroke 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.790
 You see, I already what happens when 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.410
 a little bit more left over 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.359
 Of course, repeat as often as you like 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.430
 we can also do that best 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.109
 sprudelwasser try the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.040
 Carbonic acid does the same thing 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.600
 Carbonic acid sees the red wine from the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.090
 fabric you see it also bubbles properly 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.829
 nice if he was lying then it should be gone 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.390
 let her dry all too 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.280
 again with a dry cloth over it 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.230
 and an absolute professional tip though 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.660
 the whole thing is dried once more 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.000
 to seam with distilled water over it 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.639
 go and look for vision so can rand 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.900
 education are avoided 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.000
 my girlfriend anna has the habit 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.630
 always on the couch the nails too 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.400
 paint 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.200
 Every other day needs a different color 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.340
 serve and then there can be something 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.720
 land on the fabric 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.579
 I would like to do that now 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.019
 show we have a nice spot the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.880
 I like to remove for you now 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.120
 want and there comes again 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.440
 wash petrol for use 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.180
 I give a little bit of attention to it 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.190
 dry cloth and now here again 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.699
 do not drive important but really 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.699
 just dab 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.220
 Of course they say a really nice 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.620
 and here it can be a bit 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.060
 take but patience pays off and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.849
 So I promise you nice of 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.340
 dab the outside inwards and so on 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.019
 few minutes would have the stain on the ball 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.610
 his 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.720
 Of course, this also applies to fashion 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.670
 in Syria on the couch 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.500
 sluts can be like pens or 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.970
 you do not have to have colored pencils of course 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.079
 with a big rag wrestling here 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.100
 works great too 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.959
 cotton swab 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.580
 Here you can work punctually and 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.620
 edit the spot exactly 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.380
 if you have the spots removed then 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.210
 you can use the entire surface once 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.070
 a mixture of vinegar is dance and 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.850
 burn alcohol in the relationship 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.590
 one to one 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.870
 here the liquid is very important 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.720
 first on the rag and then the 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.760
 entire surface edited so now comes 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.229
 still an absolute men phenomenon that 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.860
 I show you at another couch 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.330
 some men really want to 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.860
 to be comfortable their dirty 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.479
 take off work clothes if they 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.949
 come home and also the kiddies 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.210
 keep getting it the couch 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.410
 nice to get dirty 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.270
 therefore sometimes one has to 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.830
 basic cleaning ago and I have one 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.530
 good solution and a mixture of 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.090
 warm water and glass cleaner I think 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.030
 I can give that a shot 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.250
 then a microfiber cloth 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.440
 clean and a bright especially and 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.210
 here is very important that the cloth 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.539
 not wet but really only 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.320
 wet and then I go really nice 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.300
 about it 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.830
 It may be that he does the process a few 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.600
 would have to repeat and that he too 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.730
 you can change the water 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.650
 see there is a lot of dirt off 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.090
 much is spotty far indeed a 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.430
 new couch made this direction with it 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.970
 the whole area and if you then 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.710
 believes that enough is the couch clean 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.600
 then you go with a dry one 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.820
 cloth over it and planing something nice 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.810
 after just over the entire surface then 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.060
 I still have a sticky one 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.940
 a matter for you who mean mine 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.140
 friend kathrin recommended and indeed 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.570
 Bubble gum is said to be in the best of families 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.730
 Occurs when he lands on the couch 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.730
 you take the best ice cubes or the 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.160
 Cool away and have the chewing gum right 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.110
 beautiful from the whole can then one 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.610
 little while take in connection could the 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.800
 chewing gum then break and in one 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.780
 Brushing may even help 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.430
 to rework her gasoline 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.460
 By the way, that works as well 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.840
 wonderful with candle wax and chocolate 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.150
 I have you in another house 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.070
 would have watched but there also times 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.410
 dear friends you see what with my 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.240
 circle of friends on the sofa I go 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.140
 hope you are better with your furniture 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.140
 makes courage
