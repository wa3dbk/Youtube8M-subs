when you go to the actual post and you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.949 
when you go to the actual post and you
refresh<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:34.170> will<00:02:35.170> auto<00:02:35.319> play<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:37.780> that

refresh it and will auto play see that

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.140 
refresh it and will auto play see that
so<00:02:38.200> when<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.410> actually<00:02:38.530> starts<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.640> starts<00:02:40.030> at

find the URL youtube.com go to the very
end<00:03:23.820> where<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:24.970> got<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.269> zero<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.660> then<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
end where it's got the zero and then the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.440 
end where it's got the zero and then the
quotations<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.680> do<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.850> toe<00:03:29.760> play<00:03:30.760> equals

quotations and do and I toe play equals
1<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.110> then<00:03:32.530> there's<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.769> second<00:03:33.459> URL<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:34.510> write

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
1 and then there's a second URL to write

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.710 
1 and then there's a second URL to write
there<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.820> there's<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.970> ending<00:03:37.329> right<00:03:37.450> there

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
there and there's the ending right there

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.530 
there and there's the ending right there
and<00:03:38.610> okto<00:03:39.640> play<00:03:40.769> equals<00:03:41.769> 1<00:03:42.160> all<00:03:43.150> right<00:03:43.329> so

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
and okto play equals 1 all right so

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.449 
and okto play equals 1 all right so
there's<00:03:43.720> two<00:03:43.989> sections<00:03:44.350> there<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:45.340> it's<00:03:45.430> a

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
there's two sections there so it's a

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.759 
there's two sections there so it's a
little<00:03:45.489> bigger<00:03:45.810> I'm<00:03:46.810> going<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.019> update<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.440> and

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
little bigger I'm going to update it and

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.210 
little bigger I'm going to update it and
it<00:03:48.250> should<00:03:48.430> work<00:03:48.930> using<00:03:49.930> either<00:03:50.170> either<00:03:50.920> one

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
it should work using either either one

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.620 
it should work using either either one
for<00:03:51.430> at<00:03:51.579> least<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.940> theme<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.269> I'm<00:03:52.390> using

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
for at least the theme that I'm using

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.289 
for at least the theme that I'm using
for<00:03:53.110> my<00:03:53.290> website<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.790> let's<00:03:54.820> go<00:03:55.120> ahead<00:03:55.209> and

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
for my website so let's go ahead and

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.420 
for my website so let's go ahead and
refresh<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:58.239> it's<00:03:58.900> out<00:03:59.049> of<00:03:59.079> playing<00:03:59.430> and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
refresh it and it's out of playing and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.890 
refresh it and it's out of playing and
it<00:04:00.790> will<00:04:00.970> auto<00:04:01.209> play<00:04:01.480> from<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.750> very

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
it will auto play from the very

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.060 
it will auto play from the very
beginning<00:04:02.019> it's<00:04:02.500> just<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:02.829> was

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
beginning it's just that I was

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.120 
beginning it's just that I was
originally<00:04:04.140> had<00:04:05.140> already<00:04:05.380> which<00:04:05.680> watched

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
originally had already which watched

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.470 
originally had already which watched
part<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.519> video<00:04:06.700> that's<00:04:06.790> why<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.030> started

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
part of the video that's why it started

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.940 
part of the video that's why it started
but<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:07.989> will<00:04:08.140> start<00:04:08.500> from<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.739> very

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
but it will start from the very

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.680 
but it will start from the very
beginning<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:09.489> if<00:04:09.850> you've<00:04:10.000> got<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.209> really<00:04:10.420> cool

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
beginning so if you've got a really cool

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.060 
beginning so if you've got a really cool
intro<00:04:11.260> at<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.590> beginning<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:11.860> your<00:04:11.950> video

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
intro at the beginning of your video

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.949 
intro at the beginning of your video
then<00:04:12.940> as<00:04:13.120> soon<00:04:13.299> as<00:04:13.420> they<00:04:13.540> go<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.780> your<00:04:13.900> page

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
then as soon as they go to your page

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.740 
then as soon as they go to your page
