00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.280
 these photos are from japan are 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.230
 been taken by masaru emoto and sir 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.870
 motorcycle has developed a great interest 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.810
 for the molecular structure of water e 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.790
 for what influences the water is 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.310
 certainly the most receptive of the four 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.380
 elements for this reason and motorcycle has 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.270
 thought that maybe he could also react to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.160
 non-physical stimuli 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.650
 therefore he set up a series of studies 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.570
 has applied mental stimuli and has 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.630
 photographed the result with a 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:26.780
 field microscope I suck the first picture 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.660
 shows the water from the dam to shoot in 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.509
 this instead you see the same water 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.800
 after he received a blessing from 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.800
 a Zen Buddhist monk 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.880
 in this second series of photos the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.170
 motorcycle ladies printed the words 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.780
 has glued on water bottles 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.360
 distilled that he left outside 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.190
 during the night the first photo shows 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.740
 there is pure distilled water 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.940
 only its essence, in short, the photos 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.690
 successive 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.580
 as you can see they are all different 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.980
 this is the symbol of love and here 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.929
 we have a thank you 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.840
 you can see where it has it 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:17.240
 attached to the bottle but who of 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.570
 you know how to read Japanese you already know e 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.150
 motion claims that the driving force of 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.670
 all this is thought 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.650
 the intention even if nobody knows how 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.200
 it actually affects the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.040
 molecules except water molecules 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.720
 of course it is very charming 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.850
 if you think our body is 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.850
 composed of 90 percent water 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.719
 makes you think it's not true if your thoughts 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.129
 they can do this to water images 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.129
 what they can do to us
