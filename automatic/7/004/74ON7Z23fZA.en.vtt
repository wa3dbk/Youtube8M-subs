framework<00:00:46.430> I<00:00:47.430> keep<00:00:47.640> fumbling<00:00:48.000> over<00:00:48.120> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
framework I keep fumbling over that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.920 
framework I keep fumbling over that
basically<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.379> does<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.770> sucks<00:00:50.070> down

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
basically what it does is it sucks down

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.450 
basically what it does is it sucks down
exploits<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.590> gives<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.100> list<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
exploits and it gives you like a list of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
exploits and it gives you like a list of
exploits<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.480> perform<00:00:54.600> with

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
exploits you can you can perform with

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
exploits you can you can perform with
the<00:00:55.350> payload<00:00:55.890> yeah<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> space<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> like

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the payload yeah and you space it like

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
the payload yeah and you space it like
point<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.320> click<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> web<00:00:59.309> interface

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
point and click it's got a web interface

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.080 
point and click it's got a web interface
so<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.840> makes<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.699> ridiculously<00:01:02.699> script

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
so it makes it like ridiculously script

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.810 
so it makes it like ridiculously script

a matter of fact oh what'd you do oh
well<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> explain<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.640> bit

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
well I want to explain a little bit

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
well I want to explain a little bit
about<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> framework<00:01:45.420> first<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.990> actually

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
about the framework first it's actually

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.990 
about the framework first it's actually
got<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> lot<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> exploit<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
got a lot of exploit so you can do like

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.139 
got a lot of exploit so you can do like
for<00:01:48.420> example<00:01:48.479> once<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.960> target<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:50.670> think

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
for example once a target is I think

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.490 
for example once a target is I think
it's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.570> SharePoint<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.320> you're<00:01:52.439> running

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it's a SharePoint if you're running

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.410 
it's a SharePoint if you're running
frontpage<00:01:52.890> extensions<00:01:53.340> right<00:01:53.850> even<00:01:54.240> like

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
frontpage extensions right even like

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.649 
frontpage extensions right even like
Oracle<00:01:54.990> 9<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.920> Microsoft<00:01:56.700> sequel<00:01:57.390> service

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
Oracle 9 and Microsoft sequel service

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780 
Oracle 9 and Microsoft sequel service
hardcore<00:01:58.259> seeing<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.619> even<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> think<00:01:59.369> apples

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
hardcore seeing like even I think apples

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
hardcore seeing like even I think apples
samba<00:02:00.479> server<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.899> well<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.530> been<00:02:01.680> pretty

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
samba server as well it's been pretty

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
samba server as well it's been pretty
well<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> exploits<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
well but one of the exploits is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
well but one of the exploits is
microsoft<00:02:03.990> windows<00:02:04.290> XP<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.979> service<00:02:05.189> pack<00:02:05.310> 1

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
microsoft windows XP for service pack 1

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.370 
microsoft windows XP for service pack 1
right<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
right and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.749 
right and
so<00:02:07.189> you<00:02:07.959> can<00:02:08.959> pull<00:02:09.170> up<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.380> web<00:02:09.530> interface<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
so you can pull up the web interface and

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.800 
so you can pull up the web interface and
select<00:02:11.599> you<00:02:11.959> know<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.110> think<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.440> was<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.610> RPC

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
select you know I think it was the RPC

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.390 
select you know I think it was the RPC

were able to shut down my machine no no
no<00:02:19.190> actually<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:20.000> kind<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.599> takes<00:02:21.019> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
no actually it kind of like takes the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.259 
no actually it kind of like takes the
same<00:02:21.349> attack<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:22.040> then<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.849> can<00:02:23.000> choose

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
same attack and then you can choose

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.440 
same attack and then you can choose
which<00:02:23.540> payload<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.050> want<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.410> was<00:02:24.709> actually<00:02:24.860> a

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
for example I selected the exploit the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.400 
for example I selected the exploit the
next<00:02:31.790> page<00:02:31.970> was<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.330> select<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.690> payload<00:02:33.050> it's

it<00:03:43.100> up<00:03:43.190> with<00:03:43.459> like<00:03:44.530> security<00:03:45.530> focus<00:03:46.040> ex-boy

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
can go out and search and find an

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.970 
can go out and search and find an
