00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
you don't write in an agenda but I mean

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.060

everyone<00:02:08.150> is<00:02:08.360> different<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.470> don't<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.860> to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
everyone is different you don't have to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.760 
everyone is different you don't have to
write<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.670> an<00:02:11.150> agenda<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.110> like<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.530> would

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
write in an agenda but like I would

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
write in an agenda but like I would
highly<00:02:13.130> recommend<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.390> second<00:02:14.720> tip

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
highly recommend it so the second tip

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.160 
highly recommend it so the second tip
that<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.050> have<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.800> not<00:02:16.040> procrastinate<00:02:16.310> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
that I have is to not procrastinate and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.170 
that I have is to not procrastinate and
I<00:02:18.170> mean<00:02:18.620> procrastination<00:02:19.580> can<00:02:19.700> be<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.880> real

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
I mean procrastination can be a real

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.650 
I mean procrastination can be a real
problem<00:02:20.870> for<00:02:21.200> some<00:02:21.350> people<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.480> I'm<00:02:23.480> not

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
problem for some people and I'm not

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.410 
problem for some people and I'm not
going<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> lie<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:25.070> procrastinated

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
going to lie I have procrastinated

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.240 
going to lie I have procrastinated
before<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.930> learned<00:02:27.230> from<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:28.190> no

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
before but I learned from it and I no

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.160 
before but I learned from it and I no
longer<00:02:28.550> procrastinate<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.570> don't<00:02:29.810> think<00:02:29.900> I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
longer procrastinate I don't think I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.010

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
doing something because then you'll just

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.190

like<00:02:54.800> rush<00:02:55.040> through<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.430> or<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.300> will

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
like rush through it or you or you will

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.710 
like rush through it or you or you will
just<00:02:57.350> not<00:02:57.560> get<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.160> best<00:02:58.730> grade<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.510> you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
just not get the best grade that you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.570 
just not get the best grade that you
would<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.080> if<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.320> did<00:03:00.740> not<00:03:00.860> procrastinate

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
would have if you did not procrastinate

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.410 
would have if you did not procrastinate
so<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.150> took<00:03:02.540> for<00:03:03.020> like<00:03:03.320> procrastinate

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
so I took for like procrastinate

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.730 
so I took for like procrastinate
procrastination<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.900> work<00:03:06.110> on<00:03:06.320> like<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.620> big

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
procrastination is to work on like a big

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.740 
procrastination is to work on like a big
project<00:03:07.100> or<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.580> big<00:03:07.730> assignment<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.720> you

have<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.530> little<00:03:09.920> bit<00:03:10.070> each<00:03:10.250> nut<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.880> will

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
have a little bit each nut you will

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.250 
have a little bit each nut you will
really<00:03:11.240> feel<00:03:11.390> good<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.020> don't

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
really feel good if you don't

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.000 
really feel good if you don't
procrastinate<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:13.130> if<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:15.500> work<00:03:15.680> on<00:03:15.830> it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
procrastinate and if you just work on it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.860 
procrastinate and if you just work on it
a<00:03:16.070> little<00:03:16.220> bit<00:03:16.340> each<00:03:16.640> night<00:03:16.970> then<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.690> will

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
a little bit each night then it will

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.290 
a little bit each night then it will
really<00:03:18.080> help<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.850> will<00:03:20.030> probably

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
really help you and it you will probably

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.690 
really help you and it you will probably
get<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.750> better<00:03:20.840> grade<00:03:21.260> if<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.830> don't

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
get a better grade if you don't

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.210 
get a better grade if you don't
procrastinate<00:03:23.350> rather<00:03:24.350> than<00:03:24.620> if<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:25.010> do

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
procrastinate rather than if you do

the<00:03:46.070> third<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.430> final<00:03:46.520> tip<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.090> have<00:03:47.390> is

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the third and final tip that I have is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.560 
the third and final tip that I have is
to<00:03:48.140> ask<00:03:48.440> your<00:03:48.650> teachers<00:03:48.980> for<00:03:49.280> help<00:03:49.550> it's<00:03:49.880> like

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
to ask your teachers for help it's like

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.520 
to ask your teachers for help it's like
you<00:03:50.900> don't<00:03:51.650> understand<00:03:52.130> something<00:03:52.370> I

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
you don't understand something I

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.800 
you don't understand something I
to<00:03:53.709> ask<00:03:53.920> for<00:03:54.550> help<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:54.970> many<00:03:55.120> times<00:03:55.390> in<00:03:55.600> middle

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
to ask for help so many times in middle

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.870 
to ask for help so many times in middle
school<00:03:56.080> because<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:56.800> don't<00:03:57.250> understand

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880
