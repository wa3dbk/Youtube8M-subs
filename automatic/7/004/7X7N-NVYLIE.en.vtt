these three tanks in my room and in

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
these three tanks in my room and in
these<00:00:20.340> two<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:22.769> has<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.580> small<00:00:24.320> male

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500 
these two this one has a small male
crested<00:00:25.859> gecko<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> believe<00:00:26.640> his<00:00:26.910> name<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.119> Roo

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
crested gecko I believe his name is Roo

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.919 
crested gecko I believe his name is Roo
and<00:00:27.830> then<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.250> cage<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> much<00:00:30.359> larger

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and then this cage has a much larger

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.440 
and then this cage has a much larger
female<00:00:31.800> crested<00:00:32.279> gecko<00:00:32.640> named<00:00:33.210> moose<00:00:33.540> um<00:00:35.450> he's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
female crested gecko named moose um he's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
female crested gecko named moose um he's
he's<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.800> smaller<00:00:38.129> enclosure

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
he's in a little smaller enclosure

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.430 
he's in a little smaller enclosure
because<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:39.360> he<00:00:39.870> doesn't<00:00:39.899> really<00:00:40.320> want

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
because right now he doesn't really want

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.790 
because right now he doesn't really want
the<00:00:40.980> big<00:00:41.160> space<00:00:41.600> whereas<00:00:42.600> she's<00:00:43.020> gotten<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> lot

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the big space whereas she's gotten a lot

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500 
the big space whereas she's gotten a lot
bigger<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.190> she<00:00:44.489> used<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.850> live<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.329> one

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
bigger and she used to live in this one

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.319 
bigger and she used to live in this one
before<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.870> got<00:00:46.140> him<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.340> she<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.910> pretty<00:00:48.090> big

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
before I got him but she was pretty big

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.630 
before I got him but she was pretty big
so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> decided<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> get<00:00:50.430> her<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
so I decided it was time to get her a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.119 
so I decided it was time to get her a
larger<00:00:51.090> cage<00:00:51.360> um<00:00:54.020> he<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.050> quite<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> bit<00:00:55.949> smaller

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
larger cage um he is quite a bit smaller

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.680

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
pane of glass for the top so then I can

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.180 
pane of glass for the top so then I can
put<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> heat<00:02:15.989> lamp<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.410> top<00:02:16.650> right<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:16.950> she

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190

put a heat lamp on top right now she
kind<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.640> shares<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.120> heat<00:02:18.390> lamp<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
kind of shares this heat lamp with that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.240 
kind of shares this heat lamp with that
one<00:02:19.230> um<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:21.000> then<00:02:21.959> she<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> small<00:02:22.709> heat<00:02:23.040> pad

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
one um and then she is a small heat pad

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.530 
one um and then she is a small heat pad
on<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.520> bottom<00:02:23.610> 24<00:02:24.300> at<00:02:24.420> night<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:27.330> her

is<00:03:20.910> glass<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:26.370> cage<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:26.880> kept<00:03:27.120> humid<00:03:27.540> i

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
is glass but this cage is kept humid i

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.610 
is glass but this cage is kept humid i
have<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:29.600> humidifier<00:03:30.600> back<00:03:31.079> here<00:03:31.410> behind

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
have this humidifier back here behind

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.410 
have this humidifier back here behind
the<00:03:31.950> cage<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.489> fill<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.880> with<00:03:32.970> water<00:03:33.239> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
the cage and you fill it with water and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.710 
the cage and you fill it with water and
then<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:35.010> hooks<00:03:35.370> up<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.579> an<00:03:35.820> air<00:03:36.000> pump<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.630> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
then it hooks up to an air pump and it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.170 
then it hooks up to an air pump and it
pumps<00:03:36.959> humid<00:03:37.680> air<00:03:37.859> into<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> enclosure<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
pumps humid air into the enclosure and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.930 
pumps humid air into the enclosure and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.810 
so i put this stuff on here this plastic
wrap<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.150> keep<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.900> humidity<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.130> it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
wrap to keep in the humidity and it

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.099 
wrap to keep in the humidity and it
works<00:03:45.000> pretty<00:03:45.180> well<00:03:46.040> um<00:03:47.630> I'll<00:03:48.630> let<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.959> guys

up here I have the little fluker's

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.510 
up here I have the little fluker's
thermometer<00:05:09.029> hygrometer<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.289> that's<00:05:11.219> pretty

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
thermometer hygrometer and that's pretty

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.439 
thermometer hygrometer and that's pretty
handy<00:05:12.259> um<00:05:13.259> I<00:05:13.349> know<00:05:14.279> what<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.520> looks<00:05:14.879> like<00:05:15.000> but

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
handy um I know what that looks like but

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.409 
handy um I know what that looks like but
it's<00:05:15.569> just<00:05:15.779> plastic<00:05:16.349> leaves<00:05:16.889> from<00:05:17.419> petsmart

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
it's just plastic leaves from petsmart

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.369 
it's just plastic leaves from petsmart
so<00:05:18.839> don't<00:05:19.319> get<00:05:19.439> any<00:05:19.500> bad<00:05:19.830> ideas<00:05:20.279> and<00:05:21.199> I<00:05:22.199> think

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
so don't get any bad ideas and I think

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.019 
so don't get any bad ideas and I think
she's<00:05:22.560> pretty<00:05:22.800> happy<00:05:23.099> in<00:05:23.189> this<00:05:23.310> cage<00:05:23.550> it's<00:05:23.849> big

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
she's pretty happy in this cage it's big

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.990 
she's pretty happy in this cage it's big
enough<00:05:24.060> for<00:05:24.330> her<00:05:24.659> needs<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.339> I'm<00:05:26.339> thinking<00:05:26.759> of

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
enough for her needs and I'm thinking of

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.760 
enough for her needs and I'm thinking of
maybe<00:05:27.180> at<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.479> next<00:05:27.719> reptile<00:05:28.110> show<00:05:28.379> looking

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
maybe at the next reptile show looking

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.610 
maybe at the next reptile show looking
for<00:05:28.979> an<00:05:29.129> another<00:05:29.789> adult<00:05:30.180> gecko<00:05:30.719> to<00:05:30.779> maybe<00:05:31.319> put

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
for an another adult gecko to maybe put

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.129 
for an another adult gecko to maybe put
in<00:05:31.680> with<00:05:31.979> her<00:05:32.189> and<00:05:32.599> possibly<00:05:33.599> get<00:05:34.050> him

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
in with her and possibly get him

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.709 
in with her and possibly get him
breeding<00:05:34.639> because<00:05:35.639> right<00:05:35.939> now<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.180> other<00:05:36.449> guy

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
breeding because right now the other guy

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.619 
breeding because right now the other guy
is<00:05:36.779> a<00:05:36.990> little<00:05:37.259> too<00:05:37.409> small<00:05:38.240> for<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:39.800> but<00:05:40.800> I

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
is a little too small for that but I

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.360 
is a little too small for that but I
think<00:05:42.629> she<00:05:43.050> weighs<00:05:43.379> enough<00:05:43.589> for<00:05:44.039> it<00:05:44.159> she's

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
think she weighs enough for it she's

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.079 
think she weighs enough for it she's
about<00:05:44.550> 30<00:05:44.909> grams<00:05:45.240> right<00:05:45.539> now<00:05:46.159> or<00:05:47.159> 30<00:05:47.669> ounces

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
about 30 grams right now or 30 ounces

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:55.789 
about 30 grams right now or 30 ounces
sorry<00:05:48.509> but<00:05:49.819> so<00:05:52.339> guess<00:05:53.339> that's<00:05:53.580> it
