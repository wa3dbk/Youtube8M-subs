00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all and welcome to the blog 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 new technologies so 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.540
 today I did not come to introduce you 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.049
 the lg g2 so you may have already 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.370
 discover during previous videos 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.760
 but rather this accessory which 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.420
 accompany it here since it is therefore 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 of the queen queen cut of okaidi so the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.699
 official shell for this lg g2 and who has 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.429
 the particularity therefore to arrive with a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 little window here that will offer some 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.570
 many features as we go 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.860
 see later in this video 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.360
 so regarding this set this hull so 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.920
 already the first observation that can be made 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.940
 it's easy to use 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.910
 just insert the smartphone into 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.090
 and we find ourselves directly so with 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.530
 one with a smartphone protect so park 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 this hull so the queen dockers to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.090
 the back what is on this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.649
 hull so we find a little a 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 texture a little streaked that we can have 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.630
 on the back shell of the g2 so I'm going 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.420
 show you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.340
 you see here so here is the hull 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.040
 directly from the smartphone is here we are 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.380
 on the hull so from there on the facade 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.880
 back of the hull of this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.160
 two jerks windows found 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.680
 also of course the famous 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.410
 location so here to have access 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.120
 so to the camera as well as to the buttons 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:38.280
 specific to g2 ng so once 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.860
 that we insert the other smartphone into the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.350
 in the case so we have access here well 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.710
 obviously to the volume buttons at 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.729
 power button to the camera as well as 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.180
 flash led 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.820
 nothing is hidden by the hull so 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.630
 it is rather that quite well and 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.550
 will also have here below here 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.490
 so the edges that are protected so 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.830
 the angles here and here also 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.210
 we will see the strange on the side so 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.920
 as soon as you drop your 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.929
 smartphone 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.650
 there is little chance that for that 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.270
 this one crumbles on the sides since 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.120
 it's the hull that will take first 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.310
 finally logically finally on top 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.980
 so we're going to have more protection here 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.660
 more chip him nicer with a 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.310
 finish I do not know if you have good 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.370
 see it but here we have a finish 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.110
 so here so the model that I have is 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.510
 gray model with with a little streak a 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.360
 little bit we will find here so the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.890
 reference to model lg 2 on the facade 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.959
 before we will find this window 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.519
 here that goes that will allow to display 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.790
 information as we will see by 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.850
 next we will have the speaker who 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.370
 will be cleared as well as the little the 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.290
 dio from here that allows us to 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.090
 alert according to notifications 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.239
 we can receive on our smartphone 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.410
 and we will also have the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.270
 Possibility of 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.790
 directly open and it closes 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.620
 automatically so you see as soon as 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.850
 I open here I have my smartphone - lg2 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.140
 who is unlocked 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.940
 as soon as I'm going to close the holster I'm going 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.790
 see here a smaller window so 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.580
 here is an audio player that is launched 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.020
 so I can interact 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.700
 I will redo so I can interact 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.240
 directly with this one so I can 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.840
 for example launched the music so there the 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.290
 music and dance and that's it I can 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.880
 sure interact with this one so you have to 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.120
 move on to the next song at 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.900
 directly I can pause 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.930
 I can also slide to see their 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.210
 so here I 'm going to have different 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.280
 different way to display them either 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.560
 like these to these technologies so there 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.000
 you have different colors 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.400
 either you will find here the menu one 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.260
 little lg 2 that you can have here 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.840
 like this so this is your 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.040
 wallpaper that is taken directly 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.050
 in this little window 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.720
 you will also have more 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.549
 classic the display of them in 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.480
 function as a way watch 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.680
 shows here also here again here we 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.199
 back to version 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.539
 analog with different colors 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:36.800
 so if for example I change the background 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:42.919
 of screen here so hop like this so 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.919
 here i will change my tac wallpaper 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.449
 so I do not know if I'm taking the bear 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.889
 polar I do not know what it's going to do 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.539
 never done so the gemmi the polar bear 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.870
 on my wallpaper and if I close 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.000
 no I do not have my polar bears ah ok 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.949
 so we can only have one type of 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.590
 wallpapers here I do not know so 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.419
 this is actually we can only have one 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.550
 a single wallpapers that is the bottom 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.289
 classic screen that we find on 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.740
 our on our lg2 when we 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.330
 when we install it so you can its 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.680
 ideas like these have finally the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.649
 last thing I can access 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.039
 from this window his access to the 

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:24.319
 weather 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:29.029
 so here I want to be able to directly 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:32.180
 see the weather of the day as well as the eure 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:35.180
 and the temperature I currently have 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.449
 so that's this little girl 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.909
 small window so to summarize so 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.339
 this small window allows to have 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.409
 receive them weather information is 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:48.559
 also to interact with your music 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:51.229
 and all that without having the need 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:53.119
 to open to open osce martha finally 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.219
 where to turn your vote on the phone 

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.939
 it's directly from this little 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.330
 window 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.909
 so to activate it a classic one puts 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.059
 we tap it twice and then 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.869
 directly has the information that comes to 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:10.009
 we will also be able to 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:10.719
 receive calls so I'm going 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.909
 show you 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:15.969
 so here I want to make a call 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:18.050
 directly toc 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.490
 so there normally we should have the 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.050
 contact information that will 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:27.019
 to appear during a call if it wants 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.399
 alright so here's the here I can 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:33.259
 directly answer on the call I can 

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:35.620
 also refuse the call so here if I 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.710
 answer I am in communication 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.880
 directly 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:44.040
 with with the person and if I open if 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.930
 I open the phone I realize 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.140
 that I am directly on the window 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.370
 of call here so I can also 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.830
 return to it 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.620
 and there I can end the call all 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.210
 simply by sliding while doing 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.310
 drag the icon so here I ended 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.270
 the call is automatically it's up to 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.640
 hang up the mobile so that's for 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.640
 this for this hull so I thank

 mobilefun point fr to have me to have me 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.340
 allowed to combine my lg g2 with power the 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.230
 also protect from power so 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.780

 I will also have to test on the on the 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:49.350
