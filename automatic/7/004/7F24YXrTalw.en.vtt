00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:12.030
 I write on Facebook to be perfect . I can meet the filter in bulk. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.830
 It's fast, the language is pleasant . 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.490
 I told you about unboxing , but I can not help it. It's thin. Oh, Muffler. 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.420
 But also those who never heard the opening maneusi there anything in the US In fact, this is Ms. 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.830
 I do not mean it. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.220
 A felony is very nice, but the writer is just changing the brand and selling it. 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.470
 It's easy, so I sell a lot of things, 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.610
 8 9 minutes This is the US 8 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.969
 You can see Juni Lee's Life 5.5. Let's see it briefly. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 The receiver has a Max color front camera 4 point 8 inch comp 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.250
 There is a display nail polish tip bicycle, 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.539
 There's a lot of sim card slums . It's neat here . 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.170
 How clean 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.520
 If you move to the left, you have a volume key washer in and a Bloom Peer power key 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.910
 The bottom of the microphone and the microphone escort uncle to the earphone jack you see yogeol 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.549
 Roughly how wide it would not be caught this sense 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.390
 And on the back is a cammax camera, led flash and speakers here 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.280
 there is 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.970
 Look here, I'm here to speakers speakers here this has got to the bottom 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.229
 There at the bottom of all this is not completely flat, without any watering the degree 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.650
 The sound has almost tempted to reply, open the floor I can not hear this kind of most likely 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.659
 Problems together long thin Become a friend Foresight this more fully in the assessment 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 Itjyo serious side beats But I look back, but when talking about fancy 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.869
 I guess I've seen it a lot. 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.400
 I feel like I can make a sound whenever I change something logo 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.900
 I feel it . 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.640
 But because it is near to the rank of the hand, you say that you mix too much 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.840
 When the extent that I do not know whether what exactly went're doing now meokgetda 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.420
 I think it's a little bit like that. 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.619
 Yes, I do not think so. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.869
 In any case , the fact that this friend's thread is thin is actually too big for us 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.799
 It does not appeal to me. 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:06.030
 But the price that I'm born the basic nature of the low rattling 199 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.970
 In fact, the fact that you can buy just plain from Amazon 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.470
 Among the more accessible pawns, this is probably 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:18.330
 Managed would like to belong to a decent axis cpu cpu is another MediaTek 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 There For media book that is always mt MediaTek cpu is here in January, 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.190
 Difficult mt MT 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.520
 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, back at the uvo chemi mansion. 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.569
 There's no a7 here. There are ten cone a7 's. 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.290
 A 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.709
 The a7 enters the 2 quad cores, the starting point is 402, and the i7 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 That already have Mansion nt 2592, which entered into octa there since yesterday 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.989
 Try it. Midi. I 've been drinking since I 've been drinking. 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.359
 Hey, I'm really sseulman report sent to him under and projecting into the talk 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.870
 There is no problem in the first year . 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:55.439
 Well the fact is manhadago Eun Sil hopefully the $ 200 optimized motors anything suspicious 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.459
 This looks good enough, but it's root. This friend is better than I thought. 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.540
 I was a little surprised. 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.790
 I went to this've also contacted the score still fly That is in fact score Everything 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.090
 I did not judge it , 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:13.650
 It's gotta have like a genuine life notneunde Romans cloth jjokkeum iPhone seventh place 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.040
 But that is just the number of icons displayed on the bottom with the other apps without even 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.549
 Inde way the truth and not once laid joteunge programs by order of something like this 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.180
 This can quit if you have liver can not be in alphabetical there is alignment 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.930
 There's no such thing as a person who always feeds on this. 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.329
 It is more than just a hair performance 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:38.430
 But the problem is roneun andoeyo the Korean native language support so finely bit 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:42.449
 Problems together, even though that did not control anything for granted IO itself 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.930
 Because I support it, I can input it by typing the keyboard, and the output is 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:49.259
 Can I have basically Joowon But now in my gut enthusiasts built the menu 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.449
 It would be a bit of a disappointment to not have support. 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:58.019
 So now it's true that there is some performance in thin 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:04:01.949
 Surprisingly, it's not surprising that thin flip performance at $ 199 is okay . 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.709
 Now I wonder what the multimedia basics are all about. 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:08.519
 Its gonna feel different this time looking at Vivo 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.449
 I do not know if I'm thin or something else. 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.129
 I do not know what to do. 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:19.049
 not too bad 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:22.830
 The camera is just plain average, just about $ 200 for a cell phone 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:27.630
 Show me your pictures, and I can not tell you what to say next. 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.759
 I do not have a sound. 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.820
 Uh word deuryeotjyo sounds, which are open does nothing 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:36.479
 Inserting this app was really good to hear that sound, which are so well 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:40.800
 Does this really sound like a crap state ears nine films in the sound that can not be written 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.940
 Because of sounding like tear the eardrum 4 eat right this clause field image 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.139
 Help me. 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.560
 Let's empty the slam, but let's go. Do not imagine. 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.570
 In fact, I have a problem I deunga bowler phone battery and the battery suddenly neolttwigi 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.169
 And so I measured it. 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:00.570
 But it is strange yiraetdeon this phone has got a little translation errors 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:04.349
 For example let 's go to the display which is weak here 2 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:08.460
 You know the soft key expansion backlight backlit softkeys There are so vivo 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.860
 I mean, the surf back 200 lighter's on now, but the soft key backlight 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.000
 Press 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.020
 Why ? 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.460
 Relax softkey backlight is off, the backlight is l 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.390
 There's a strike off and dragging the key to this is the same error I developed 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.510
 It looks like a similar phenomenon on the battery, but obviously the power save mode 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.170
 There is a thing, but it has to be a power save . 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.590
 It hangs 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:37.290
 I do not know why but yes it's not what Can Bench Shoulder difference 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:40.450
 I do not know what the difference is, but if you did not put this Watson sleep mode on , 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.720
 Four to four and a half hours battery high screen on 2 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:47.710
 Is this what injin least favorite to three and a half hours when you turn lo 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:55.120
 2100 is also better than I thought to open it, but 2100 wheat 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.980
 If the seat battery is soaked, it is not so small on the screen. 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.850
 It's possible if you hold it. 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:05.530
 One problem I'm having a problem with it in the second axis of aggression 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:09.520
 This is how it went down so much, and here it is again about 24% 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.980
 Also not so far daljido Then a sudden bang from 3% 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.820
 I have it with me. 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:19.300
 Oh how true is this a serious problem I can write to my phone 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.900
 I do not know if there are two surveys that suddenly make me jump like this 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.740
 It's a serious problem, but I do not know if it will be a software patch . 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:30.430
 Oh, it's very well done overall, especially considering the price for 199 balls. 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:34.450
 When thin and clean design, front and rear where 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:38.260
 It's a very well made phone, including this metal, for the 10 countries . 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:41.979
 It's also okay to hand out good performance write speed but some critical issues 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:46.419
 The first is when the sound is garbage and the second is when the camera is just average 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:49.180
 Third, I think that battery reconstruction is so unstable. 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:52.479
 It's a bit critical because I can not believe it. 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.260
 I do not know if it will be solved by a software patch , 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:07:00.970
 I wonder if it's difficult to make a recommendation 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:05.260
 I only worked fine except the two I Author Handsome advice a few years, such as 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:08.650
 Side is also a lot of the Chinese market and Southeast Asia, this arm has gotta deoraguyo and 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.550
 Thinking about changing the name like this and making the growth fairly faithful 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.630
 I think there is. 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:18.070
 Nowadays, what is big like a shower or maze , 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:23.050
 Jetty tyrosinase What stood profusely except for these big name players in China 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:27.550
 A lot of companies are coming up . 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:29.529
 I think air support bowed'll also look at the development that China phones 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.749
 It was Blue B Bohair. 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:33.749
 I'll see you again next time.
