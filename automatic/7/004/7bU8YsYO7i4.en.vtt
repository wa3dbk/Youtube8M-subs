00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
this is more of a camping knife and

this is more of a camping knife and
outdoors<00:04:11.650> knife<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:12.910> would<00:04:13.209> take<00:04:13.450> with<00:04:13.690> me

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.509 
in a survival situation and Baton wood I
think<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.709> will<00:04:17.859> stand<00:04:18.160> up<00:04:18.370> to

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
think that this will stand up to

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.949 
think that this will stand up to
anything

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
anything

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.710
