00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.860 
she said yes and I bought it back as a
matter<00:07:44.130> of<00:07:44.220> fact<00:07:44.460> from<00:07:44.850> the<00:07:45.000> time<00:07:45.210> I<00:07:45.240> sold<00:07:45.630> it

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
matter of fact from the time I sold it

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.280 
matter of fact from the time I sold it
to<00:07:46.050> the<00:07:46.560> time<00:07:46.770> I<00:07:46.800> purchased<00:07:47.670> it<00:07:47.880> had<00:07:48.630> gone<00:07:48.810> less

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290 
to the time I purchased it had gone less

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:56.909 
to the time I purchased it had gone less
than<00:07:49.460> 25<00:07:50.460> miles

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.270 

the<00:07:57.430> best<00:07:57.669> thought<00:07:58.180> is<00:07:58.539> the<00:07:59.469> fact<00:07:59.710> that<00:07:59.860> I

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 
the best thought is the fact that I

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.510 
the best thought is the fact that I
decided<00:08:01.240> to<00:08:01.509> get<00:08:01.659> one<00:08:01.719> again<00:08:02.199> join<00:08:03.069> the<00:08:03.250> club

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 
decided to get one again join the club

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.110 
decided to get one again join the club
and<00:08:03.759> found<00:08:04.750> my<00:08:05.139> old<00:08:05.379> car<00:08:05.710> I<00:08:06.039> think<00:08:06.580> that's<00:08:06.909> just

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 
and found my old car I think that's just

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.520 
and found my old car I think that's just
so<00:08:08.520> unbelievable
