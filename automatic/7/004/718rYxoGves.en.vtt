00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.689 
knees wolves although they do drop in
about<00:04:35.180> five<00:04:35.419> seconds<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.229> they<00:04:37.039> do<00:04:37.099> get<00:04:37.430> crit

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.020 

I'm<00:04:47.380> going<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.590> find<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.889> few<00:04:48.130> more<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:48.940> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
I'm going to find a few more just to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.900 
I'm going to find a few more just to
show<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.240> how<00:04:49.480> fast<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.170> whiptail<00:04:50.910> respond

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
show you how fast the whiptail respond

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.460 
show you how fast the whiptail respond
they<00:04:52.090> respond<00:04:52.480> pretty<00:04:52.720> much<00:04:52.990> every<00:04:53.230> five

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
they respond pretty much every five

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.580 
they respond pretty much every five
minutes<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:55.150> in<00:04:55.240> 15<00:04:55.750> minutes<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.410> want

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
minutes so in 15 minutes you want

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.409 
minutes so in 15 minutes you want
average<00:04:57.520> 30<00:04:58.450> whiptail<00:04:59.160> 245<00:05:00.160> whiptail<00:05:00.850> depend

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
average 30 whiptail 245 whiptail depend

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:09.060 
average 30 whiptail 245 whiptail depend
on<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.840> drop<00:05:02.110> rate<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:06.930> yeah<00:05:07.930> this<00:05:08.860> is<00:05:09.040> a

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
on the drop rate and yeah this is a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.920 
on the drop rate and yeah this is a
great<00:05:09.340> firing<00:05:09.730> spot<00:05:09.970> in<00:05:10.150> my<00:05:10.270> opinion<00:05:10.570> it's<00:05:10.780> the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
great firing spot in my opinion it's the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.690 
great firing spot in my opinion it's the
best<00:05:11.169> in<00:05:11.350> Cataclysm<00:05:11.980> right<00:05:12.130> now<00:05:12.280> if<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.580> have
