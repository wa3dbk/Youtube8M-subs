we know that people's habits and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.480 
we know that people's habits and
preferences<00:00:22.210> change<00:00:23.100> slower<00:00:24.100> than

preferences change slower than

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:47.580 
preferences change slower than

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.800 

my<00:00:48.590> first<00:00:49.160> project<00:00:49.430> since<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:50.060> moved<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.420> Tokyo

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
my first project since I moved to Tokyo

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.160 
my first project since I moved to Tokyo
was<00:00:50.990> of<00:00:51.200> how<00:00:52.010> will<00:00:52.730> people<00:00:53.090> use<00:00:53.510> location

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
was of how will people use location

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.680 
was of how will people use location
information<00:00:54.470> on<00:00:55.130> mobile<00:00:55.520> mobile<00:00:56.060> phones<00:00:56.420> in

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
information on mobile mobile phones in

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.410 
information on mobile mobile phones in
the<00:00:56.780> future<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:57.920> had<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.100> pick<00:00:58.910> six

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
the future so we had to pick six

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.030 
the future so we had to pick six
locations<00:01:00.460> based<00:01:01.460> on<00:01:01.900> those<00:01:02.900> criteria<00:01:03.770> which

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
locations based on those criteria which

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.760 
locations based on those criteria which
is<00:01:04.280> about<00:01:04.760> how<00:01:05.420> complicated<00:01:05.870> the<00:01:06.290> serious

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
is about how complicated the serious

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.090 
is about how complicated the serious
city<00:01:07.190> is<00:01:07.450> how<00:01:08.450> well<00:01:08.690> public<00:01:09.260> transportation

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
city is how well public transportation

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.469 
city is how well public transportation
is<00:01:10.220> developed<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:12.100> also<00:01:13.100> how<00:01:13.430> online<00:01:13.970> system

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
is developed and also how online system

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.150 
is developed and also how online system
is<00:01:14.690> developed<00:01:14.960> like<00:01:15.500> for<00:01:15.680> instance<00:01:15.740> people

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
is developed like for instance people

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.719 
is developed like for instance people
using<00:01:16.670> online<00:01:16.820> maps<00:01:17.270> may<00:01:17.660> have<00:01:17.900> more<00:01:18.729> ideas

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
using online maps may have more ideas

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.230 
using online maps may have more ideas
about<00:01:20.390> how<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.750> use<00:01:21.430> those<00:01:22.430> information<00:01:23.090> on

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
about how to use those information on

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.060 
about how to use those information on
mobile<00:01:23.540> phones<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.530> countries<00:01:24.770> like

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
mobile phones but in countries like

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.150 
mobile phones but in countries like
India<00:01:26.000> where<00:01:26.210> even<00:01:27.080> normal<00:01:27.440> maps<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.920> quite

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
India where even normal maps is quite

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.580 
India where even normal maps is quite
hard<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.610> find<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.990> would<00:01:30.170> have<00:01:30.320> been<00:01:30.410> very

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
hard to find it would have been very

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.680 
hard to find it would have been very
different<00:01:30.890> when<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.520> design<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.910> workshop<00:01:32.450> we

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
different when you design a workshop we

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.060 
different when you design a workshop we
also<00:01:33.640> do<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> pilot<00:01:34.970> study<00:01:35.600> as<00:01:35.930> well<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.740> try

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
also do a pilot study as well so we try

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.520 
also do a pilot study as well so we try
to<00:01:37.990> find<00:01:38.990> out<00:01:39.200> whether<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.890> format<00:01:40.580> or<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:40.970> I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
to find out whether the format or the I

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.350 
to find out whether the format or the I
in<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.650> way<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:42.950> are<00:01:42.979> facilitating<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:43.940> creative

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
in a way we are facilitating a creative

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.600 
in a way we are facilitating a creative
session<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.020> try<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.649> find<00:01:46.070> out<00:01:46.310> before

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
session so we try to find out before

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.060 
session so we try to find out before
before<00:01:47.360> we<00:01:47.509> actually<00:01:47.630> run<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.440> real<00:01:48.740> thing

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
before we actually run the real thing

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.370 
before we actually run the real thing
whether<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:50.240> are<00:01:50.360> doing<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.750> right<00:01:50.899> thing<00:01:51.140> to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
whether we are doing the right thing to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.370 
whether we are doing the right thing to
give<00:01:51.740> people<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.460> creative<00:01:52.880> space<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:54.110> right

give people the creative space the right
spark<00:01:54.830> for<00:01:55.399> them<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.880> think<00:01:56.450> about<00:01:56.750> new<00:01:57.500> ideas

mobile<00:02:04.490> phones<00:02:04.729> are<00:02:05.000> now<00:02:05.600> functioning<00:02:06.319> for

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
mobile phones are now functioning for

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.820 
mobile phones are now functioning for
very<00:02:07.399> predetermined<00:02:08.390> acquaintances<00:02:09.289> you

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
very predetermined acquaintances you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.650 
very predetermined acquaintances you
have<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.610> phone<00:02:10.789> number<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.360> that's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
have to know the phone number and that's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.840 
have to know the phone number and that's
the<00:02:11.840> only<00:02:11.990> way<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.980> mobile<00:02:13.280> phones<00:02:13.520> actually

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the only way that mobile phones actually

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.540 
the only way that mobile phones actually
function<00:02:14.630> as<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> communication<00:02:15.500> medium<00:02:15.620> but

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
function as a communication medium but

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.250 
function as a communication medium but
mobile<00:02:16.880> phones<00:02:17.120> do<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> ability<00:02:18.230> to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
mobile phones do have the ability to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.090 
mobile phones do have the ability to
connect<00:02:18.860> people<00:02:18.920> who<00:02:19.400> are<00:02:19.520> not<00:02:19.880> yet<00:02:20.150> that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
connect people who are not yet that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.860 
connect people who are not yet that
definite<00:02:22.100> state<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.670> relationship<00:02:23.360> meaning

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
definite state of relationship meaning

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.860 
definite state of relationship meaning
we<00:02:24.410> are<00:02:24.470> sharing<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.010> same<00:02:25.190> space<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.030> maybe

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
we are sharing the same space and maybe

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.949 
we are sharing the same space and maybe
we<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:28.130> already<00:02:28.490> is<00:02:28.730> something<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:29.750> common

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
we that already is something in common

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.890 
we that already is something in common
and<00:02:30.530> maybe<00:02:30.940> mobile<00:02:31.940> phone<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.360> function

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
and maybe mobile phone can function

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.290 
and maybe mobile phone can function
without<00:02:33.140> me<00:02:34.040> necessarily<00:02:34.760> having<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.060> know

without me necessarily having to know
you<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.569> advance<00:02:35.930> but<00:02:36.560> mobile<00:02:37.010> phone<00:02:37.250> can

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
you in advance but mobile phone can

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.470 
you in advance but mobile phone can

year<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:26.230> believe<00:03:27.230> personally<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:28.069> we<00:03:28.700> will

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
year I believe personally that we will

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.170 
year I believe personally that we will
show<00:03:29.420> something<00:03:29.959> around<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.010> area<00:03:31.519> in<00:03:31.879> the

show something around that area in the

show something around that area in the
near<00:03:32.359> future<00:03:32.389> as<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.900> product<00:03:40.450> iPhone<00:03:41.450> had<00:03:41.870> such

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
near future as a product iPhone had such

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.849 
near future as a product iPhone had such
a<00:03:42.230> media<00:03:42.799> hype<00:03:43.159> and<00:03:43.900> influence<00:03:44.900> in<00:03:45.409> the<00:03:45.650> sense

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
a media hype and influence in the sense

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.819 
a media hype and influence in the sense
that<00:03:45.950> we<00:03:46.639> were<00:03:46.670> like<00:03:46.940> RV<00:03:47.780> late<00:03:47.989> are<00:03:48.230> related

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
that we were like RV late are related

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.500 
that we were like RV late are related
but<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.159> course<00:03:49.400> we<00:03:49.579> have<00:03:49.730> been<00:03:49.879> working<00:03:50.120> on

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
but of course we have been working on

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.189 
but of course we have been working on
this<00:03:51.260> touch<00:03:51.500> input<00:03:52.010> for<00:03:52.480> years<00:03:53.480> but<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.959> course

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
this touch input for years but of course

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.050 
this touch input for years but of course
touch<00:03:54.440> base<00:03:54.709> product<00:03:55.129> is<00:03:55.340> not<00:03:55.519> for<00:03:55.579> everyone

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
touch base product is not for everyone

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.319 
touch base product is not for everyone
and<00:03:56.930> Nokia<00:03:57.769> is<00:03:57.829> more<00:03:58.730> conscious<00:03:59.299> about

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
and Nokia is more conscious about

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.930 
and Nokia is more conscious about
covering<00:04:00.199> the<00:04:00.319> whole<00:04:00.530> product<00:04:01.250> portfolio

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
covering the whole product portfolio

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.270 
covering the whole product portfolio
rather<00:04:02.510> than<00:04:02.750> focusing<00:04:03.199> one<00:04:03.500> product<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.220> I

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
rather than focusing one product and I

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.220 
rather than focusing one product and I
think<00:04:04.519> we<00:04:04.699> were<00:04:04.790> actually<00:04:05.180> quite<00:04:05.329> happy<00:04:05.629> to

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
think we were actually quite happy to

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.250 
think we were actually quite happy to
see<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.010> product<00:04:07.519> that's<00:04:07.780> very<00:04:08.780> high<00:04:09.019> quality

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
see a product that's very high quality

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.240 
see a product that's very high quality
and<00:04:10.329> most<00:04:11.329> importantly<00:04:11.900> it<00:04:12.290> functions<00:04:12.980> to

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
and most importantly it functions to

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.180 
and most importantly it functions to
expand<00:04:14.060> broden<00:04:14.930> people's<00:04:15.440> mindset<00:04:16.039> about

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
expand broden people's mindset about

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.759 
expand broden people's mindset about
what<00:04:16.489> mobile<00:04:16.699> thing<00:04:17.030> one<00:04:17.359> can<00:04:17.599> do<00:04:17.840> because<00:04:18.470> I

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
what mobile thing one can do because I

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.039 
what mobile thing one can do because I
phone<00:04:19.039> is<00:04:19.220> so<00:04:19.820> different<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.750> sense<00:04:20.780> of

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
phone is so different in the sense of

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.860 
phone is so different in the sense of
it<00:04:22.590> features<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.340> lot<00:04:23.699> of<00:04:23.879> other<00:04:24.060> functions<00:04:24.360> on

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
it features a lot of other functions on

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.869 
it features a lot of other functions on
the<00:04:24.900> phone<00:04:25.259> and<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.650> think<00:04:25.680> for<00:04:26.099> us<00:04:26.280> as<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.610> whole

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 
the phone and I think for us as a whole

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.480 
the phone and I think for us as a whole
industry<00:04:27.300> it's<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.110> good<00:04:28.289> change<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:29.220> just

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
industry it's a good change it just

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.730 
industry it's a good change it just
pushed<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:30.060> people's<00:04:30.629> perception<00:04:31.259> one<00:04:31.440> step

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
pushed the people's perception one step

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.670 
pushed the people's perception one step
ahead<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.729> think<00:04:33.270> in<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.900> way<00:04:34.020> it's<00:04:34.229> also

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
ahead and I think in a way it's also

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.879 
ahead and I think in a way it's also
good<00:04:35.099> for<00:04:35.129> internal<00:04:35.879> nokia<00:04:36.270> teams<00:04:36.569> too<00:04:36.990> it's

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
good for internal nokia teams too it's

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.270 
good for internal nokia teams too it's
like<00:04:38.069> a<00:04:38.220> getting<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.610> little<00:04:38.849> push
