if you started as you tell a lot has

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.240 
if you started as you tell a lot has
changed<00:00:29.359> my<00:00:30.359> whole<00:00:30.599> road<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:30.990> dug<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.980> dug

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
changed my whole road is dug up I dug

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.690 
changed my whole road is dug up I dug
the<00:00:32.369> hole<00:00:32.520> road<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:33.829> I'm<00:00:34.829> making<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.250> new<00:00:35.430> road

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the hole road up I'm making a new road

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
the hole road up I'm making a new road
design<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.450> road<00:00:36.660> i<00:00:36.690> had<00:00:36.989> was<00:00:37.230> too<00:00:37.410> skinny<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
design the road i had was too skinny and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
design the road i had was too skinny and
it<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.610> lumpy<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.210> some<00:00:40.079> parts

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it was just all lumpy and some parts

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
it was just all lumpy and some parts
were<00:00:40.559> powdery<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.700> my<00:00:41.879> trucks<00:00:42.149> would<00:00:42.270> just

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
were powdery so my trucks would just

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.770 
were powdery so my trucks would just
sink<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.960> i<00:00:43.170> am<00:00:44.129> estimating<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.480> sword

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
sink in it i am estimating with my sword

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
sink in it i am estimating with my sword
200<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.829> rogers<00:00:47.039> lowboy<00:00:48.950> i'll<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.129> through

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
200 and my rogers lowboy i'll go through

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.950 
200 and my rogers lowboy i'll go through
and<00:00:50.430> actually<00:00:50.520> turn<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> lowboy<00:00:51.360> stuff<00:00:51.690> like

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and actually turn the lowboy stuff like

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.889 
and actually turn the lowboy stuff like
it<00:00:52.140> would<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> stop<00:00:52.920> motion<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.640> it'd<00:00:54.360> be

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it would be in a stop motion and it'd be

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
it would be in a stop motion and it'd be
either<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> ditch<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.070> wide<00:00:56.550> enough

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
either in the ditch or not wide enough

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.130 
either in the ditch or not wide enough
or<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.899> stuck<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.440> part<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.989> that's<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
or it get stuck some part so that's the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.299 
or it get stuck some part so that's the
sward<00:01:01.559> 200<00:01:02.430> though<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> mac<00:01:03.120> ministered

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
sward 200 though in the mac ministered

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.060 
sward 200 though in the mac ministered
to<00:01:05.309> axial<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:05.970> three<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> back<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.650> may

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to axial not three in the back so it may

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.030 
to axial not three in the back so it may
be<00:01:08.520> good<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.540> may<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.740> how<00:01:10.890> long

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
be good it may not I don't know how long

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.750 
be good it may not I don't know how long
the<00:01:11.310> logging<00:01:11.850> trailers<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:14.430> anyway<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the logging trailers are so but anyway I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.840 
the logging trailers are so but anyway I
did<00:01:15.030> until<00:01:15.119> i<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> roadway<00:01:16.530> wider<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
did until i got the roadway wider in the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.100 
did until i got the roadway wider in the
turn<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> feller<00:01:18.780> buncher

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
turn right here with a feller buncher

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
turn right here with a feller buncher
sitting<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.920> wider<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.689> when<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> turn<00:01:22.020> in

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
sitting it's wider and when you turn in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
sitting it's wider and when you turn in
its<00:01:22.409> wider<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.340> had<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> fill<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.119> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
its wider up I had to fill in this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
its wider up I had to fill in this
little<00:01:24.810> spot<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:26.040> was<00:01:26.220> real<00:01:26.400> powdery<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
little spot that was real powdery and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.539 
little spot that was real powdery and
rocky<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.780> didn't<00:01:28.590> tell<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> don't<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.490> you

rocky I didn't tell I don't know if you
can<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.090> how<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.540> breaking<00:01:30.840> up

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
can to see how it's like breaking up

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.399 
can to see how it's like breaking up
right<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.530> I'm<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.369> cut<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.509> feel

right there I'm a cut that off and feel

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.609 
right there I'm a cut that off and feel
that<00:01:34.590> whole<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.009> section<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:36.439> low<00:01:37.439> of
