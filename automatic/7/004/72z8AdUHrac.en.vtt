around 1850 and he introduced this wacky
idea<00:01:19.140> called<00:01:19.920> evolution<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.299> everything

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
idea called evolution that everything

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410 
idea called evolution that everything
came<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.650> nothing<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.759> organized

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
came out of nothing it got all organized

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.280 
came out of nothing it got all organized
and<00:01:24.630> became<00:01:25.020> everything<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:26.610> by<00:01:26.939> itself<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and became everything all by itself and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.030 
and became everything all by itself and
so<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.450> Charles<00:01:30.780> Darwin's<00:01:31.409> theory<00:01:32.009> of
