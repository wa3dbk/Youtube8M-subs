our opponent will be well the easy one

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.300 
our opponent will be well the easy one
is<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.080> are<00:03:09.350> opponent<00:03:09.770> will<00:03:09.890> be<00:03:09.980> because<00:03:10.280> we

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
is we are opponent will be because we

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.460 
is we are opponent will be because we
just<00:03:10.610> heard<00:03:10.760> it's<00:03:10.970> going<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.209> be<00:03:11.300> h2k<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.230> we

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
just heard it's going to be h2k and we

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.170 
just heard it's going to be h2k and we
face<00:03:12.680> them<00:03:12.890> against<00:03:13.190> come<00:03:13.400> before<00:03:13.700> them<00:03:14.060> out

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
face them against come before them out

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.620 
face them against come before them out
20<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:15.800> think<00:03:16.100> they<00:03:16.820> actually<00:03:17.209> have<00:03:17.480> to

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
20 and I think they actually have to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.070 
20 and I think they actually have to
roast<00:03:17.840> or<00:03:18.080> changes<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:19.810> don't<00:03:20.810> know<00:03:20.930> if<00:03:21.020> it

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
roast or changes so I don't know if it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.870 
roast or changes so I don't know if it
will<00:03:21.170> be<00:03:21.290> better<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.560> them<00:03:21.830> they<00:03:22.070> might<00:03:22.250> be<00:03:22.850> a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
will be better for them they might be a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.900 
will be better for them they might be a
little<00:03:23.090> bit<00:03:23.270> behind<00:03:23.540> in<00:03:23.660> synergy<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.910> guess

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
little bit behind in synergy so I guess

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.300 
little bit behind in synergy so I guess
we'll<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.060> take<00:03:26.270> them<00:03:26.450> out<00:03:26.570> tonight<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.220> a

good<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.570> go<00:03:53.660> said<00:03:54.080> because<00:03:54.410> it's<00:03:54.590> grants

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
good to go said because it's grants

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.830 
good to go said because it's grants
magic<00:03:55.100> damage<00:03:55.220> that's<00:03:56.120> one<00:03:56.300> approach<00:03:56.540> and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
magic damage that's one approach and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.810 
magic damage that's one approach and
then<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.020> second<00:03:57.260> approach<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.560> if<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.670> want

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
then the second approach is if you want

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.300 
then the second approach is if you want
to<00:03:58.880> get<00:03:59.000> entirely<00:03:59.630> attacks<00:04:00.470> per<00:04:00.620> item<00:04:00.770> you<00:04:01.190> can

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
to get entirely attacks per item you can

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.310 
to get entirely attacks per item you can
get<00:04:01.460> stuck<00:04:01.640> even<00:04:01.880> just<00:04:02.270> with<00:04:02.450> push<00:04:02.630> like<00:04:02.900> it

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
get stuck even just with push like it

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.420

special<00:04:04.910> ash<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.270> pretty<00:04:05.480> good<00:04:05.570> because<00:04:05.720> you

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
special ash is pretty good because you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.510 
special ash is pretty good because you

can wash off the waves with basic attack

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.420 
can wash off the waves with basic attack
in<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.880> passive<00:04:08.240> ending<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.810> body<00:04:09.250> sound<00:04:10.250> good

how<00:04:39.530> come<00:04:39.770> we<00:04:40.040> suddenly<00:04:40.940> play<00:04:41.360> Corky<00:04:41.840> knows

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
how come we suddenly play Corky knows

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.570 
how come we suddenly play Corky knows
every<00:04:42.350> game<00:04:42.530> when<00:04:42.770> he<00:04:42.800> was<00:04:43.010> so<00:04:43.190> out<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.430> the

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
every game when he was so out of the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.730 
every game when he was so out of the
meta<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.870> think<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.140> question<00:04:45.500> is<00:04:45.590> for

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
meta and I think the question is for

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.760 
meta and I think the question is for
Martin<00:04:46.070> once<00:04:46.220> again<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:47.360> my<00:04:47.930> opinion<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.410> Corky

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
Martin once again so my opinion a Corky

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.410 
Martin once again so my opinion a Corky
a<00:04:48.800> pretty<00:04:49.040> much<00:04:49.190> is<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.400> they<00:04:50.030> know<00:04:50.210> if<00:04:50.300> these

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
a pretty much is that they know if these

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.710 
a pretty much is that they know if these
manacles<00:04:50.870> on<00:04:51.170> both<00:04:51.550> bad<00:04:52.550> Korean<00:04:52.880> his<00:04:53.150> velvet

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
the poem phosphorus my post personal

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.950 
the poem phosphorus my post personal
it's<00:04:57.260> cute<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.770> so<00:04:58.550> he's<00:04:59.420> very<00:04:59.690> effective

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
it's cute and so he's very effective

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.470 
it's cute and so he's very effective
knowledge<00:05:00.440> because<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:00.890> can<00:05:01.270> make<00:05:02.270> use<00:05:02.450> of

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
knowledge because you can make use of

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.780 
knowledge because you can make use of
his<00:05:02.690> early<00:05:03.170> like<00:05:03.470> trades<00:05:03.770> because<00:05:04.250> before<00:05:04.730> you

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
his early like trades because before you

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.050 
his early like trades because before you
got<00:05:05.060> home<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.480> just<00:05:05.780> from<00:05:05.870> using<00:05:06.050> q<00:05:06.380> or<00:05:06.590> W<00:05:07.160> in

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
got home like just from using q or W in

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.060 
got home like just from using q or W in
early<00:05:08.360> level<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:08.780> think<00:05:08.900> he<00:05:09.530> has<00:05:09.740> turned

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
early level so I think he has turned

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.909 
early level so I think he has turned
into<00:05:10.280> like<00:05:10.750> be<00:05:11.750> able<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.140> survive<00:05:12.500> early<00:05:12.800> game

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
into like be able to survive early game

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.350 
into like be able to survive early game
I<00:05:13.070> think<00:05:13.310> that's<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.580> step<00:05:13.760> one<00:05:13.970> of<00:05:14.150> his

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
I think that's the step one of his

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.840 
I think that's the step one of his
strengths<00:05:14.720> now<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.320> then<00:05:15.620> they<00:05:16.070> both<00:05:16.490> strange

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
strengths now and then they both strange

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.780 
strengths now and then they both strange
horse<00:05:17.120> as<00:05:17.210> well<00:05:17.390> so<00:05:18.040> it<00:05:19.040> gives<00:05:19.190> him<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.520> like

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
horse as well so it gives him a like

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.850 
horse as well so it gives him a like
huge<00:05:20.060> power<00:05:20.270> spike<00:05:20.570> because<00:05:20.780> he<00:05:21.050> fits<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:21.830> well

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
huge power spike because he fits so well

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.640 
huge power spike because he fits so well
did<00:05:22.130> she<00:05:22.570> do<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.600> his<00:05:23.840> heart<00:05:24.110> like<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.500> can

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
did she do to his heart like you can

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.990 
did she do to his heart like you can
spend<00:05:24.860> with<00:05:24.950> our<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:25.250> hard<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.610> get<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.820> sheen

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
spend with our so hard and get the sheen

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.440 
spend with our so hard and get the sheen
probe<00:05:26.210> every<00:05:26.510> time<00:05:26.800> so<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:28.100> think<00:05:28.330> he<00:05:29.330> was

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
probe every time so I think he was

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.640 
probe every time so I think he was
probably<00:05:29.570> not<00:05:29.870> too<00:05:30.020> strong<00:05:30.200> as<00:05:30.320> it<00:05:30.410> is<00:05:30.500> right

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
probably not too strong as it is right

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.119 
probably not too strong as it is right
now

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129
