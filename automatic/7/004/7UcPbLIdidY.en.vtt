00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
she does get a little fizzy oh she does

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.690 
she does get a little fizzy oh she does
little<00:01:07.049> frizzy<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
little frizzy which is what I have to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.640 
little frizzy which is what I have to
use<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.270> cocoa<00:01:10.020> butter<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> water

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
use the cocoa butter and water

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.670 
use the cocoa butter and water
concoction<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.490> she<00:01:11.729> does<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.150> tangled<00:01:12.680> she

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
concoction and she does get tangled she

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.219 
concoction and she does get tangled she
does<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.700> tangled<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.360> she's<00:01:15.600> still<00:01:15.870> pretty

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
does get tangled but she's still pretty

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.520 
does get tangled but she's still pretty
for<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.100> cost<00:01:17.370> I<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:18.450> there's<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:19.320> lower

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
for the cost I think there's some lower

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.830 
for the cost I think there's some lower
cost<00:01:19.830> units<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> tangled

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
cost units that don't get this tangled

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.050 
cost units that don't get this tangled
