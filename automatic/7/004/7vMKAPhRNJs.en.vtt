00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.810 
the outside shows better outside is more
easier<00:02:03.170> it's<00:02:03.590> because<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.369> don't<00:02:04.549> have<00:02:04.579> any

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
easier it's because you don't have any

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.700 
easier it's because you don't have any
room<00:02:04.939> acoustics<00:02:05.450> or<00:02:05.570> anything<00:02:05.960> it's<00:02:06.259> kind<00:02:06.590> of

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
room acoustics or anything it's kind of

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.400 
room acoustics or anything it's kind of
outside<00:02:07.369> gigs<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.850> actually<00:02:08.479> get<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.690> mix<00:02:09.050> but

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
outside gigs you actually get to mix but

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.140 
outside gigs you actually get to mix but
then<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.800> got<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> problem<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.490> wind<00:02:10.729> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
then you got a problem with the wind and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.630 
then you got a problem with the wind and
weather<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.990> other<00:02:12.110> stuff<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.890> both<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.400> them

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
weather and other stuff so both of them

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.360 
weather and other stuff so both of them
are<00:02:13.790> pretty<00:02:13.880> challenged<00:02:14.600> yeah<00:02:14.960> so<00:02:15.560> if<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.160> get

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
are pretty challenged yeah so if I get

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.060 
are pretty challenged yeah so if I get
like<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.700> 3<00:02:17.570> degrees<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.440> temperature<00:02:18.470> and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
like a 3 degrees in temperature and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.100 
like a 3 degrees in temperature and
change<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.660> weather<00:02:20.840> outside

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
change in the and the weather outside

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.560 
change in the and the weather outside
how<00:02:21.830> bad<00:02:22.160> does<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.370> play<00:02:22.610> through<00:02:22.820> sound<00:02:22.970> not

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
how bad does that play through sound not

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.720 
how bad does that play through sound not
really<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:24.290> not<00:02:24.350> actually<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.460> weather

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
really it's not actually the weather

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.040 
really it's not actually the weather
it's<00:02:26.000> more<00:02:26.180> about<00:02:26.300> their<00:02:26.570> like<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.840> air

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
it's more about their like the air

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.850 
it's more about their like the air
humidity<00:02:27.620> which<00:02:28.070> affects<00:02:28.460> more

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
humidity which affects more

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.400 
humidity which affects more
the<00:02:28.920> Hawaiians<00:02:29.100> it's<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.210> haven't<00:02:31.170> really

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the Hawaiians it's I haven't really

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.890 
the Hawaiians it's I haven't really
outside<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.970> temperature<00:02:33.240> doesn't<00:02:33.660> really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
outside the temperature doesn't really

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.690 
outside the temperature doesn't really
affect<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.290> much<00:02:34.530> inside<00:02:35.190> maybe<00:02:35.400> more

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
affect that much inside maybe more

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.920 
affect that much inside maybe more
because<00:02:36.000> usually<00:02:36.150> when<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.570> temperature

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
because usually when the temperature

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.190 
because usually when the temperature
goes<00:02:37.140> up<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.590> humidity<00:02:37.980> goes<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
goes up the humidity goes up to so and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.020 
goes up the humidity goes up to so and
that's<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.220> thing<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.550> guys<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:42.000> got

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
that's one thing that you guys have got

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.850 
that's one thing that you guys have got
to<00:02:42.300> remember<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.440> said<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.680> teach

students has got to remember that there
are<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.410> many<00:02:46.560> variables<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:47.640> many<00:02:47.730> things

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
are so many variables and so many things

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
that you got to deal with in the studio

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.990 
that you got to deal with in the studio
environment<00:02:49.860> everything<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.700> controlled

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
5074 alexia so do you run anything from

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.740 
5074 alexia so do you run anything from
are<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.070> probably<00:03:26.340> from<00:03:26.550> yonni<00:03:26.910> do<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.390> run

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
are you probably from yonni do you run

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.270 
are you probably from yonni do you run
every<00:03:27.930> anything<00:03:28.470> director<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.980> see<00:03:29.100> have<00:03:29.190> an

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
every anything director to see have an

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.910 
every anything director to see have an
amplifier<00:03:29.670> Yama<00:03:30.570> has<00:03:30.720> an<00:03:30.870> own<00:03:31.020> tube<00:03:31.470> preamp

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
amplifier Yama has an own tube preamp

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160 
amplifier Yama has an own tube preamp
and<00:03:32.160> there's<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.459> DI<00:03:32.640> after<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.690> a

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
and there's a DI after that so it's a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.380 
and there's a DI after that so it's a
direct<00:03:35.130> line<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.580> stop<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:36.000> comes<00:03:36.180> out<00:03:36.360> of

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
direct line to stop what comes out of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.960 
direct line to stop what comes out of
there<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.530> easier<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.130> mix<00:03:38.280> him<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.820> rest

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
there is it easier to mix him the rest

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.970 
there is it easier to mix him the rest
of<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.120> bandwidth<00:03:39.570> with<00:03:40.110> standing<00:03:40.650> waves<00:03:40.799> and

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
of the bandwidth with standing waves and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.860 
of the bandwidth with standing waves and
all<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.160> stuff<00:03:41.280> or<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.820> still<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.450> a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
all that stuff or is it still just a

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.520 
all that stuff or is it still just a
bunch<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.230> challenge<00:03:43.739> controlling<00:03:44.160> him<00:03:45.530> of

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
bunch of challenge controlling him of

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.440 
bunch of challenge controlling him of
course<00:03:46.860> it's<00:03:47.040> easier<00:03:47.430> with<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.640> line<00:03:47.910> stuff

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
course it's easier with the line stuff

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.270 
course it's easier with the line stuff
it's<00:03:48.750> always<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.590> don't<00:03:49.620> have<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.040> fight<00:03:50.250> for

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
it's always you don't have to fight for

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.699 
it's always you don't have to fight for
like<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.510> much<00:03:51.780> with<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.200> acoustics

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
like that much with the acoustics

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.830 
like that much with the acoustics
because<00:03:53.220> Mike's<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.940> course<00:03:54.209> on<00:03:54.360> stage<00:03:54.600> they

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
because Mike's of course on stage they

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.300 
because Mike's of course on stage they
pick<00:03:54.989> up<00:03:55.110> everything<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:55.890> when<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.130> an

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
pick up everything but when you have an

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.130 
pick up everything but when you have an
isolated<00:03:56.820> line<00:03:57.030> coming<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.630> board<00:03:57.900> it's

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
isolated line coming to a board it's

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.280 
isolated line coming to a board it's
much<00:03:58.620> easier<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:59.010> control<00:03:59.250> everywhere

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
much easier to control everywhere

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.990 
much easier to control everywhere
