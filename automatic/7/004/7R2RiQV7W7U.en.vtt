00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 but note that other directors 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.629
 smart of the time I'm talking 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.980
 steven spielberg joe dante director of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.530
 great that will be today in 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.200
 record s note that said here number 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 absurd but we go wrong so much and as well as 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.949
 the Amazonian woman came out on the moon and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.109
 this what can be understood as the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.730
 worst day of your life and all the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.730
 pins also at work 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.619
 a mystery 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.879
 the beer with the love that we are 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.480
 watching remarkable movies as very 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.480
 exaggerated 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.130
 and that happens is dangerous but manages to take 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.820
 out with the tie constraints good 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.600
 let's see the movie 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.600
 [Music] 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.940
 it's time 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.500
 to the extreme what we are seeing women 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.880
 about the moon is a movie that is 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.680
 simulating a penalty is one thing that 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.540
 another painted by loose tide has 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.979
 the palentino you want to die no 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.380
 because it's the name of a movie that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.970
 I tell you in the night the lie I read 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.970
 something better that comes to me the web 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 of cats raised the studies of mind 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.140
 it's like that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.979
 we went through a story and this all 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.229
 segments of the movie 'he is finally 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.450
 He managed to date the girl he likes 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:09.209
 he says buy titan brand and he knows him 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.209
 you know him, he's going to buy it 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.860
 the question begins is that it does not matter 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:22.720
 teaching or we're already letting go and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.670
 suddenly he remembers the laughter that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.530
 the life that he likes all his life because 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.550
 is ready for action and has already sent 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.450
 to buy with a double over top 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.450
 Lets go buy 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:53.890
 this explains I wanted to go through old 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.859
 they are waiting for the client a million 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.250
 this mark of the world happens to him but 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.250
 we started
