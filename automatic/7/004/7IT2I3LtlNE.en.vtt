00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:05.052
 Neil has a piece of sodium here. Sodium is a very reactive metal, 

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:12.062
 so that it does not oxidize, does not respond. 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.058
 you must keep it under oil to prevent the addition of air or moisture 

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:16.033
 As you can see, it is a very soft metal, so he sticks his knife in it and removes the lump of sodium. 

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:20.085
 We have around 2 kilos of sodium here. Quite a big bar actually. 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.032
 We now cut a small piece off and we look 

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.091
 Really pretty. 

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:26.089
 whether we can investigate its chemistry. 

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:57.021
 This creates hydroxide, which is the white crust on the outside. 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:34.063
 Sodium is a light metal, just like lithium, and it has a melting point of approximately 

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:36.066
 96 degrees Celsius. 

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:41.013
 Sodium is a shiny metal and you can see it mostly 

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:45.028
 when Neil cuts off a piece. It is beautiful shiny material. 

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:50.058
 It reacts very quickly with air and also with water. 

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:53.071
 of the reaction causes the hydrogen to ignite 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.011
 Many of you know that if you drop sodium in water, it can react explosively. 

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:09.068
 So we are going outside now to get some bigger responses 

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:16.068
 with the alkali metals. This is a stone bowl for dog food, very hard, so it won't break easily 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.050
 unless I drop it on my toes. 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.068
 Here it is sodium, the metal that we have just cut off. 

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:26.085
 It's a big chunk and we're going to throw it in the water 

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:32.053
 and see if we get a response. Here is a basin of water and here we have approximately 

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:36.096
 one gram of sodium. Well, let's see what happens, what response we get. 

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:45.042
 It reacts really quickly and quite violently with the water. You can see it buzzing around, 

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:49.074
 and that it generates quite a bit of hydrogen gas. We see the heat 

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:37.026
 There he goes. 

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:50.036
 Whoa! Exciting! 

00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:55.098
 and you see such a typical orange sodium flame. 

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:20.046
 SODIUM IS DANGEROUS. USE ONLY UNDER SUPERVISION FROM AN EXPERT! 

00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:01.064
 That was right! 

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:06.021
 That's a piece of sodium that came out, buddy! 

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:09.039
 Let's burn that up. 

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.049
 Oh, it's on your camera. 

00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:13.073
 Yes really! 

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:22.018
 Sodium chloride is transparent to infrared light. We have a slice of sodium chloride here 

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:27.016
 that is stuck on a glass container, where the infrared light is 

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:30.086
 goes through. Well this copy was broken by my students, 

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:37.087
 We need a needle, Neil, or tweezers. 

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:43.018
 Here you see the broken material. An interesting aspect 

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:49.034
 of sodium chloride is that if it breaks, the cracks make a right angle with each other. 

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.003
 Why is that? 

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:56.034
 That has to do with the structure in the crystal, with the atoms in a kind 

00:02:56.034 --> 00:03:03.034
 cubic order. I also have a beautiful crystal of sodium chloride here. 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.040
 I don't know if you can see it, but it has been made into a table lamp. If you enable it, then 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.060
 highlight the material. This is just a lump of natural sodium chloride from somewhere below 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.038
 ground, probably in Cheshire or anywhere else 

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:26.026
 have large underground salt deposits. 

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:30.087
 Here we have another lump of sodium. You can see that it is beautifully shiny. 

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:35.081
 We throw that in a large bucket of water. Look at the chemical reaction! 

00:03:40.013 --> 00:03:44.068
 You can see the orange color of sodium again 

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:48.077
 if the sodium is excited by the burning hydrogen that generates all that heat. 

00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.063
 That is beautiful! 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.039
 That is much better. 

00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:15.052
 So sodium and water: excellent response. 

00:04:15.057 --> 00:04:16.069
 That was amazing. 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.009
 I love sodium because it has the Na symbol and that was my mother's nickname, the real Ena. 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.056
 When she was a child, everyone knew her as Na. So every time I use sodium in a formula 

00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:34.041
 look, it gives me a kind of warm maternal feeling. 

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:41.043
