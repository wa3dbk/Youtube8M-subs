another edition of Japan Tech why am i
on<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.350> floor<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.920> don't<00:00:17.550> know<00:00:17.699> let<00:00:18.300> me<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.539> up

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
on the floor I don't know let me get up

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.790 
on the floor I don't know let me get up
okay<00:00:19.490> I'm<00:00:20.490> focusing<00:00:21.150> today<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.320> Japanese

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
okay I'm focusing today on the Japanese

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.269 
okay I'm focusing today on the Japanese
kerosene<00:00:23.430> heater<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.500> this<00:00:25.500> particular<00:00:25.830> one

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
kerosene heater and this particular one

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.689 
kerosene heater and this particular one
is<00:00:26.570> electrically<00:00:27.570> driven<00:00:27.980> which<00:00:28.980> means<00:00:29.250> most

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
is electrically driven which means most

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.330 
is electrically driven which means most
of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> almost<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.289> energy<00:00:31.340> that's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
of the almost all of the energy that's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
of the almost all of the energy that's
being<00:00:32.579> used<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.149> heater<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.950> from

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
being used by this heater is from

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.049 
being used by this heater is from
burning<00:00:35.370> kerosene<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:36.380> some<00:00:37.380> form<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.059> I'm

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
burning kerosene or some form of it I'm

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240 
burning kerosene or some form of it I'm
not<00:00:39.270> sure<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> exact<00:00:40.050> chemical<00:00:40.410> makeup<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
not sure the exact chemical makeup of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.950 
not sure the exact chemical makeup of
the<00:00:41.399> heating<00:00:41.700> fuel<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.210> used<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.780> but

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the heating fuel that's used here but

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.330 
the heating fuel that's used here but
it's<00:00:43.079> very<00:00:43.559> similar<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.280> kerosene<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
it's very similar to kerosene if not a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.959 
it's very similar to kerosene if not a
kerosene<00:00:47.340> itself<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.890> said<00:00:50.219> these

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
kerosene itself now with that said these

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.540 
kerosene itself now with that said these
heaters<00:00:51.270> despite<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.410> stereotypes<00:00:53.190> back

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
heaters despite these stereotypes back

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.520 
heaters despite these stereotypes back
home<00:00:54.199> they're<00:00:55.199> very<00:00:55.590> safe<00:00:56.750> just<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.989> anything

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
home they're very safe just as anything

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.850 
home they're very safe just as anything
in<00:00:58.680> Japan<00:01:00.649> people<00:01:01.649> expect<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.940> use<00:01:03.120> things

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
in Japan people expect you to use things

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.090 
in Japan people expect you to use things
with<00:01:04.860> common<00:01:05.250> sense<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.350> usually<00:01:07.350> you'll<00:01:07.890> be

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
with common sense and usually you'll be

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.080 
with common sense and usually you'll be
fine<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:12.030> are

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
fine so if you think about it these are

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
fine so if you think about it these are
very<00:01:12.450> efficient<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> money<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.950> can

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
very efficient and for the money you can

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
very efficient and for the money you can
heat<00:01:14.369> an<00:01:14.549> entire<00:01:14.760> small<00:01:15.420> apartment<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
heat an entire small apartment with the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
heat an entire small apartment with the
right<00:01:16.560> size<00:01:16.830> unit<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.820> particular<00:01:18.509> unit<00:01:18.869> has

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
right size unit this particular unit has

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.370 
right size unit this particular unit has
two<00:01:19.320> modes<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.040> has<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.330> full<00:01:21.600> apartment<00:01:22.170> mode

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
two modes it has a full apartment mode

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.450 
two modes it has a full apartment mode
and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.290> single<00:01:25.290> room<00:01:25.619> mode<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and then it has a single room mode and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
and then it has a single room mode and
somehow<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> circuitry<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
somehow the circuitry in the way that it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.050 
somehow the circuitry in the way that it
puts<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.820> BTUs<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:31.430> thermal<00:01:32.430> units<00:01:32.790> however

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
puts out BTUs or thermal units however

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100 
puts out BTUs or thermal units however
you<00:01:33.360> count<00:01:33.750> them<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:36.150> more<00:01:36.570> efficient

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you count them it is more efficient

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.219 
you count them it is more efficient
depending<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.189> selection<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.180> use<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
depending on which selection you use so

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.039 
depending on which selection you use so
if<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.590> putting<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.159> small<00:01:41.460> room<00:01:42.049> then

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
if I'm putting it in a small room then

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.530 
if I'm putting it in a small room then
it's<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.189> small<00:01:44.340> room<00:01:44.729> mode<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
it's going to be in small room mode if I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.230 
it's going to be in small room mode if I
hit<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> right<00:01:45.840> button<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> won't<00:01:47.240> short

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
hit the right button and it won't short

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.719 
hit the right button and it won't short
cycle<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> heat<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> room<00:01:49.950> really<00:01:50.310> fast

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
cycle and heat up the room really fast

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.270 
cycle and heat up the room really fast
and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.750> turn<00:01:51.990> itself<00:01:52.290> off<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.009> turn

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and then turn itself off and then turn

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
and then turn itself off and then turn
itself<00:01:53.549> back<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:54.000> again<00:01:54.590> okay<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:57.110> also<00:01:58.110> I'd

once they're running there really isn't

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.620 
once they're running there really isn't
much<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.150> an<00:04:38.420> odor<00:04:38.630> or<00:04:39.050> any<00:04:39.350> kind<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:39.680> noxious

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
much of an odor or any kind of noxious

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.710 
much of an odor or any kind of noxious
fumes<00:04:41.630> at<00:04:41.870> all<00:04:42.100> but<00:04:43.100> this<00:04:44.030> is<00:04:44.210> what<00:04:44.390> they<00:04:44.510> use

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
fumes at all but this is what they use

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.320 
fumes at all but this is what they use
and<00:04:45.080> this<00:04:45.920> is<00:04:46.160> really<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.640> best<00:04:46.790> one<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.150> have

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
and this is really the best one to have

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.420 
and this is really the best one to have
I<00:04:47.360> think<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.820> electric<00:04:49.820> kerosene<00:04:50.360> heater

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
I think is the electric kerosene heater

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.740 
I think is the electric kerosene heater
so<00:04:52.430> just<00:04:52.700> be<00:04:52.820> smart<00:04:53.210> about<00:04:53.330> it

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
so just be smart about it

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.830 
so just be smart about it
make<00:04:54.170> sure<00:04:54.350> you<00:04:54.470> use<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.830> right<00:04:54.980> fuel<00:04:55.840> that's

make sure you use the right fuel that's
the<00:04:57.230> main<00:04:57.440> problem<00:04:58.010> here<00:04:58.040> is<00:04:58.430> people<00:04:58.760> putting

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
the main problem here is people putting

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.190 
the main problem here is people putting
the<00:04:59.270> wrong<00:04:59.480> fuel<00:04:59.840> in<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:01.750> causing<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.990> fire

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
because the unit was not designed to

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.800 
because the unit was not designed to
burn<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.590> type<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.830> fuel<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:08.330> fuel<00:05:08.600> is
