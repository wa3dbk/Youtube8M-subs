super super natural I'm unable to wear
my<00:01:04.500> hair<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.909> currently

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
my hair out because I'm currently

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
my hair out because I'm currently
letting<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.110> hair<00:01:07.260> lock<00:01:07.670> great<00:01:08.670> braid<00:01:09.150> locks

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
letting my hair lock great braid locks

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.109 
letting my hair lock great braid locks
so<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:11.240> like<00:01:12.240> variety<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.350> think<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.860> this

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
so I like variety and I think that this

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.510 
so I like variety and I think that this
closure<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:20.040> closure

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
closure is it for me and I think closure

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.200 
closure is it for me and I think closure
closer<00:01:21.420> closures<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.740> general<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.369> good<00:01:23.610> but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
closer closures in general are good but

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
closer closures in general are good but
they're<00:01:24.360> too<00:01:24.570> expensive<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.189> here

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
they're too expensive and this one here

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
they're too expensive and this one here
