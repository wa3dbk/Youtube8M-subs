00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.050 

welcome<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.740> subtracting<00:00:02.370> four-digit

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
welcome to subtracting four-digit

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.670 
welcome to subtracting four-digit
numbers<00:00:03.449> with<00:00:04.020> regrouping<00:00:05.359> now<00:00:06.359> what<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.440> a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
numbers with regrouping now what is a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.890 
numbers with regrouping now what is a
subtraction<00:00:08.370> anyway<00:00:09.179> basically<00:00:09.630> a

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
subtraction anyway basically a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.890 
subtraction anyway basically a
subtraction<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.070> difference<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.910> you

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
subtraction is the difference and you

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.390 
subtraction is the difference and you
always<00:00:13.080> hear<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.469> term<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> difference<00:00:14.280> but

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
always hear this term is difference but

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.279 
always hear this term is difference but
not<00:00:14.610> too<00:00:14.849> many<00:00:15.030> students<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:15.780> understand

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
not too many students really understand

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.900 
not too many students really understand
but<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.619> really<00:00:16.890> break<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.130> down<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.760> what

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
but if you really break it down to what

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
but if you really break it down to what
the<00:00:18.000> difference<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.050> difference<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the difference is the difference is the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.330 
the difference is the difference is the
number<00:00:20.359> between<00:00:21.359> two<00:00:21.840> numbers<00:00:22.050> or<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
number between two numbers or the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
number between two numbers or the
difference<00:00:23.699> between<00:00:23.880> two<00:00:24.240> numbers<00:00:24.600> so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
difference between two numbers so

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.710 
difference between two numbers so
basically<00:00:25.500> if<00:00:25.680> you're<00:00:25.830> giving<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.720> subtraction

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
basically if you're giving a subtraction

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
basically if you're giving a subtraction
question<00:00:28.340> such<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:29.849> written

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
question such as the one that's written

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.410 
question such as the one that's written
over<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.560> seven<00:00:32.279> thousand<00:00:32.759> two

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
over here we have seven thousand two

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080 
over here we have seven thousand two
hundred<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.989> thirty<00:00:34.320> eight<00:00:34.640> minus<00:00:35.640> two

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
hundred and thirty eight minus two

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.470 
hundred and thirty eight minus two
thousand<00:00:36.870> five<00:00:37.020> hundred<00:00:37.200> seventy-nine<00:00:38.480> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
thousand five hundred seventy-nine the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.319 
thousand five hundred seventy-nine the
difference<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.879> number

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
difference is going to be the number

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
difference is going to be the number
that's<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.780> between<00:00:43.250> these<00:00:44.250> two<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.910> that's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that's in between these two and that's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.549 
that's in between these two and that's
what<00:00:45.329> subtraction<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.289> trying<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
what subtraction is you're trying to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
what subtraction is you're trying to
find<00:00:46.890> anything<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.360> between<00:00:48.719> these

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
find anything that's in between these

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
find anything that's in between these
two<00:00:49.230> numbers<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.899> as<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.230> begin<00:00:52.469> over<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:52.770> we

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
two numbers so as we begin over here we

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
two numbers so as we begin over here we
have<00:00:53.730> seven<00:00:54.000> thousand<00:00:54.360> two<00:00:54.390> hundred<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
have seven thousand two hundred and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.029 
have seven thousand two hundred and
thirty<00:00:55.440> eight<00:00:56.030> minus<00:00:57.500> two<00:00:58.500> thousand<00:00:58.890> five

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
thirty eight minus two thousand five

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
thirty eight minus two thousand five
hundred<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> seventy<00:00:59.699> nine<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.870> said

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
hundred and seventy nine now as I said

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.150 
hundred and seventy nine now as I said
we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.379> doing<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.800> with

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we're going to be doing this with

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.050 
we're going to be doing this with
regrouping<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.870> once<00:01:04.830> again<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.369> start<00:01:05.790> from

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
regrouping now once again you start from

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
regrouping now once again you start from
right<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.930> left<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> same<00:01:08.159> thing<00:01:08.400> as

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
right to left just the same thing as

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760 
right to left just the same thing as
addition<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.630> we're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> starting<00:01:10.470> with

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
addition so we're going to starting with

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.820 
addition so we're going to starting with
the<00:01:11.220> ones<00:01:11.670> place<00:01:12.030> value<00:01:12.510> chart<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.619> we're

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the ones place value chart so we're

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.580 
the ones place value chart so we're
going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.070> starting<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.729> over<00:01:15.030> here

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
going to be starting right over here

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.580 
going to be starting right over here
with<00:01:16.590> 8<00:01:18.110> minus<00:01:19.110> 9<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> possible

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
with 8 minus 9 now is that possible

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
with 8 minus 9 now is that possible
no<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.970> bottom<00:01:24.420> number<00:01:24.780> 9<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
no because the bottom number 9 is

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.539 
no because the bottom number 9 is
greater<00:01:26.610> than<00:01:27.090> 8<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:29.220> really

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
greater than 8 so it's not really

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.160 
greater than 8 so it's not really
possible<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.930> somehow<00:01:31.530> subtract<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.170> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
possible to somehow subtract this so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
possible to somehow subtract this so
what<00:01:34.380> are<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:35.030> we're<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
what are we going to do we're going to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.969 
what are we going to do we're going to
actually<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> borrow<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.740> value<00:01:38.310> from<00:01:39.979> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
actually have to borrow a value from the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.660 
actually have to borrow a value from the
next<00:01:41.340> column<00:01:41.700> over<00:01:43.070> which<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.280> tens

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
next column over which is the tens

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.510 
next column over which is the tens
column<00:01:45.259> now<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.619> we're<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:46.920> doing<00:01:47.100> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
column now what we're actually doing is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
column now what we're actually doing is
we're<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.000> borrowing<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.689> we're

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we're going to be borrowing this we're

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.190 
we're going to be borrowing this we're
going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.710> taking<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.340> ten<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:52.079> going

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
going to be taking a ten and we're going

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.460 
going to be taking a ten and we're going
to<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.380> moving<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> towards<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:54.899> column

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to be moving it towards the one column

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.950 
to be moving it towards the one column
over<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> allow<00:01:57.719> us

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
over here now this is going to allow us

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.410 
over here now this is going to allow us
to<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.890> 18<00:02:01.340> minus<00:02:02.340> 9<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.969> opposed<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
to actually do 18 minus 9 as opposed to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.289 
to actually do 18 minus 9 as opposed to
8<00:02:03.630> minus<00:02:03.869> 9<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:04.619> 18<00:02:05.340> minus<00:02:05.759> 9<00:02:05.969> is

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
8 minus 9 because now 18 minus 9 is

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.830 
8 minus 9 because now 18 minus 9 is
possible<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:09.080> we<00:02:10.129> regroup

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
possible so we regroup

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.670 
possible so we regroup
or<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:12.230> borrow<00:02:13.239> from<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.890> tens<00:02:16.459> column<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.680> we

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
or we borrow from the tens column and we

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.100 
or we borrow from the tens column and we
put<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.160> one<00:02:19.489> right<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.150> here<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:20.750> think<00:02:21.020> of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
put a one right in here and we think of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.920 
put a one right in here and we think of
it<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.410> 18<00:02:21.890> minus<00:02:22.310> 9<00:02:22.550> now<00:02:22.849> since<00:02:23.209> we<00:02:23.390> borrowed

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
it as 18 minus 9 now since we borrowed

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.900 
it as 18 minus 9 now since we borrowed
something<00:02:24.290> from<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.980> 10th<00:02:25.280> column

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
something from the 10th column

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.970 
something from the 10th column
we're<00:02:26.390> now<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:26.989> scratch<00:02:27.620> this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
we're now going to have to scratch this

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.009 
we're now going to have to scratch this
out<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:29.360> becomes<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:30.610> 2<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.510> now<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.750> can

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
out and this becomes a 2 so now we can

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.630 
out and this becomes a 2 so now we can
do<00:02:33.110> 18<00:02:33.709> minus<00:02:34.130> 9<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.700> 18<00:02:35.330> minus<00:02:35.810> 9<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.769> 9<00:02:37.099> and<00:02:37.519> we

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
do 18 minus 9 and 18 minus 9 is 9 and we

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.750 
do 18 minus 9 and 18 minus 9 is 9 and we
can<00:02:37.790> place<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.209> value<00:02:38.709> underneath<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:40.489> one

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
can place that value underneath the one

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.300 
can place that value underneath the one
is<00:02:40.940> called<00:02:41.349> all<00:02:42.349> right<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.650> now<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:43.069> same

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
is called all right so now the same

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.830 
is called all right so now the same
thing<00:02:43.519> is<00:02:43.550> adding<00:02:44.000> we're<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.330> move<00:02:44.540> over

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
thing is adding we're going to move over

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.170 
thing is adding we're going to move over
and<00:02:45.260> we're<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.100> go<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.580> text<00:02:46.910> color

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and we're going to go to the text color

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.000 
and we're going to go to the text color
but<00:02:47.840> now<00:02:47.989> we're<00:02:48.200> no<00:02:48.319> longer<00:02:48.440> dealing<00:02:48.680> with

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
but now we're no longer dealing with

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.250 
but now we're no longer dealing with
this<00:02:49.340> 3<00:02:49.700> over<00:02:49.819> here<00:02:49.940> now<00:02:50.269> we<00:02:50.299> have<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.690> do<00:02:50.870> 2

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
this 3 over here now we have to do 2

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.640 
this 3 over here now we have to do 2
minus<00:02:52.250> 7<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:54.940> once<00:02:55.940> again<00:02:56.349> that's<00:02:57.349> not

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
minus 7 and once again that's not

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.390 
minus 7 and once again that's not
possible

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
possible

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.900 
possible
because<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> 2<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.720> group<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.860> smaller<00:03:01.610> than

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
because the 2 is group is smaller than

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.960 
because the 2 is group is smaller than
the<00:03:02.150> 7<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:03.530> we're<00:03:04.069> going<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.640> regroup

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
the 7 so we're going to have to regroup

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.600 
the 7 so we're going to have to regroup
once<00:03:05.480> again<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.140> borrow<00:03:06.530> from<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.190> next

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
once again and borrow from the next

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.339 
once again and borrow from the next
column<00:03:08.060> over<00:03:08.180> which<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.690> our<00:03:08.810> hundreds<00:03:09.290> column

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
column over which is our hundreds column

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.949 
column over which is our hundreds column
so<00:03:09.769> we're<00:03:09.920> going<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.130> cross<00:03:10.430> out<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.880> 2<00:03:11.120> we're

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
so we're going to cross out that 2 we're

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.949 
so we're going to cross out that 2 we're
going<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.200> subtract<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.830> by<00:03:12.860> 1<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:14.180> becomes<00:03:14.390> 1

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
going to subtract it by 1 this becomes 1

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.729 
going to subtract it by 1 this becomes 1
and<00:03:15.200> now<00:03:15.500> we're<00:03:15.709> going<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.920> think<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.370> as<00:03:16.549> 12

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
and now we're going to think of it as 12

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.229 
and now we're going to think of it as 12
minus<00:03:18.739> 7<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.340> 12<00:03:20.269> minus<00:03:20.660> 7<00:03:21.250> becomes<00:03:22.250> 5<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
minus 7 and 12 minus 7 becomes 5 and

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.580 
minus 7 and 12 minus 7 becomes 5 and
once<00:03:23.720> again<00:03:23.870> we<00:03:24.170> can<00:03:24.470> put<00:03:25.420> our<00:03:26.420> 5<00:03:27.049> underneath

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
once again we can put our 5 underneath

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.800 
once again we can put our 5 underneath
the<00:03:27.739> tens<00:03:27.980> column<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.519> now<00:03:29.480> we're<00:03:29.630> going<00:03:29.750> to

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
the tens column and now we're going to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.509 
the tens column and now we're going to
just<00:03:29.959> keep<00:03:30.140> repeating<00:03:30.319> so<00:03:30.980> now<00:03:31.160> we're<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.430> the

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
just keep repeating so now we're in the

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.690 
just keep repeating so now we're in the
hundreds<00:03:31.880> column<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.840> have<00:03:32.870> 1<00:03:33.470> minus<00:03:33.920> 5<00:03:34.160> once

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
hundreds column we have 1 minus 5 once

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.270 
hundreds column we have 1 minus 5 once
again<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.750> cannot<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.410> 1<00:03:37.040> minus<00:03:38.000> 5<00:03:38.239> our<00:03:39.280> 5

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
again we cannot do that 1 minus 5 our 5

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.539 
again we cannot do that 1 minus 5 our 5
is<00:03:40.519> greater<00:03:40.670> than<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> 1<00:03:41.859> so<00:03:42.859> we're<00:03:43.370> going<00:03:43.489> to

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
is greater than the 1 so we're going to

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.349 
is greater than the 1 so we're going to
have<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.910> regroup

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
have to regroup

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.599 
have to regroup
once<00:03:44.989> again<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.560> borrow<00:03:45.829> so<00:03:46.040> we<00:03:46.160> cross<00:03:46.400> off

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
once again and borrow so we cross off

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.550 
once again and borrow so we cross off
the<00:03:46.670> 7<00:03:47.120> we<00:03:47.239> borrow<00:03:47.510> from<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.900> thousands

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
the 7 we borrow from the thousands

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.629 
the 7 we borrow from the thousands
column<00:03:48.769> this<00:03:49.549> becomes<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.209> 6<00:03:50.799> we<00:03:51.799> put<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.250> 10

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
column this becomes the 6 we put a 10

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.680 
column this becomes the 6 we put a 10
and<00:03:53.030> we<00:03:53.209> can<00:03:53.389> think<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.780> now<00:03:54.019> as<00:03:54.049> 11<00:03:55.010> minus<00:03:55.370> 5

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
and we can think of it now as 11 minus 5

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.789 
and we can think of it now as 11 minus 5
we<00:03:56.690> could<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:56.989> 11<00:03:57.440> minus<00:03:57.739> 5<00:03:57.950> which<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.310> 6

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
we could do 11 minus 5 which is 6

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.199 
we could do 11 minus 5 which is 6
therefore<00:04:00.799> we<00:04:01.130> put<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.430> under<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> hundreds

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
therefore we put it under the hundreds

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.120 
therefore we put it under the hundreds
column<00:04:02.299> so<00:04:02.750> far<00:04:02.959> we're<00:04:03.139> at<00:04:03.170> 690<00:04:04.720> 659<00:04:05.720> and

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
column so far we're at 690 659 and

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.009 
column so far we're at 690 659 and
finally<00:04:07.130> we<00:04:07.700> have<00:04:07.790> our<00:04:07.819> 6<00:04:09.819> minus<00:04:10.819> 2<00:04:11.120> which<00:04:11.840> we

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
finally we have our 6 minus 2 which we

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.479 
finally we have our 6 minus 2 which we
don't<00:04:12.109> need<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.440> regroup<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.889> our<00:04:13.040> final

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
don't need to regroup is our final

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.800 
don't need to regroup is our final
number<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:15.079> we<00:04:15.260> have<00:04:15.910> 4<00:04:16.910> which<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.510> four

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
number and we have 4 which is four

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.430 
number and we have 4 which is four
thousand<00:04:18.410> six<00:04:18.739> hundred<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.510> fifty-nine<00:04:20.539> so

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
thousand six hundred and fifty-nine so

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440 
thousand six hundred and fifty-nine so
basically<00:04:21.950> we're<00:04:22.280> always<00:04:22.640> borrowing<00:04:23.150> from

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
basically we're always borrowing from

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.290 
basically we're always borrowing from
the<00:04:23.630> next<00:04:23.990> column<00:04:24.260> over

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
the next column over

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.589 
the next column over
our<00:04:25.569> place<00:04:25.900> value<00:04:26.349> chart<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:27.400> r1<00:04:27.610> will<00:04:28.449> be

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
our place value chart so r1 will be

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.439 
our place value chart so r1 will be

now we could check it in order to check

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.719 
now we could check it in order to check
it<00:04:44.139> all<00:04:44.289> we<00:04:44.409> have<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.590> do<00:04:44.740> is<00:04:44.889> add<00:04:45.099> our<00:04:46.319> answer

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
it all we have to do is add our answer

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.089 
it all we have to do is add our answer
to<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:49.360> number<00:04:49.690> right<00:04:50.110> above<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.830> now<00:04:51.039> to

to the number right above so now to

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.070 
to the number right above so now to
check<00:04:51.669> we<00:04:52.569> to<00:04:52.720> go<00:04:52.870> four<00:04:53.199> thousand<00:04:54.930> six<00:04:55.930> hundred

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
check we to go four thousand six hundred

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.860 
check we to go four thousand six hundred
and<00:04:56.379> fifty<00:04:56.770> nine<00:04:56.909> and<00:04:58.530> then<00:04:59.530> we<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.830> add<00:05:00.870> two

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
and fifty nine and then we can add two

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.950 
and fifty nine and then we can add two
thousand<00:05:03.479> five<00:05:04.479> hundred<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.199> seventy-nine
