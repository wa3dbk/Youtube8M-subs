00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.400 
the rounded jig did the mole we working
with<00:04:16.930> for<00:04:17.930> barbless<00:04:18.730> 1/32<00:04:19.730> out<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:21.200> we're

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
with for barbless 1/32 out and we're

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.200 
with for barbless 1/32 out and we're
gonna<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:21.769> clean<00:04:22.040> out<00:04:22.250> every<00:04:22.670> cavity<00:04:23.090> on

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
gonna just clean out every cavity on

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.100 
gonna just clean out every cavity on
this<00:04:23.450> side

router bit to a brand new do it move but
as<00:06:56.660> you<00:06:56.840> can<00:06:56.960> see<00:06:57.040> that<00:06:58.040> router<00:06:58.310> bits<00:06:58.640> gonna

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
as you can see that router bits gonna

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.540 
as you can see that router bits gonna
stop<00:06:59.240> cutting<00:06:59.750> once<00:07:00.200> it<00:07:00.470> reaches<00:07:00.890> the<00:07:01.040> factory
