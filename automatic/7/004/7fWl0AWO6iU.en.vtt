00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.990
 buying a baby room 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.249
 because what exactly are you paying attention to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.280
 For example, it is important to have a crib 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.680
 that is the width of the crib 55 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.470
 centimeter is it should not be sharp 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.530
 have edges or protrusions the space 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 between the bars must be at least four and 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.530
 half to six and half centimeters 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.760
 to be 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.620
 buy your crib at a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.749
 reliable store then you can go there 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.309
 Obviously it is up to this 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:37.859
 requirements 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.390
 copies of a second hand bed or you 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.640
 makes a crib yourself then 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.079
 important that you pay attention 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.269
 most cots have one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.640
 adjustable bottom that makes it give out 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.949
 make your baby so easy 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.569
 when your babies can sit independently 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.510
 then it's time to lower your bottom 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:57.239
 the risk that your child will stand up and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 the bed falling is therefore not here either 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.050
 are differences in soils of the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.569
 cot there are cots with a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.420
 board bottom or with a slatted base and 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.189
 board bottom is a bottom with holes and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.640
 because your children still lose a lot of moisture 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.689
 a slatted base is the most ventilating 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 ventilation is very important to you 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.619
 baby 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 even if you have a heaven or a mosquito net 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.530
 make sure the fabric is not in the bit 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.229
 hand 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.600
 the baby cannot take the fabric 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.149
 your chest of drawers must be at least 75 centimeters 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.869
 wide and at least 55 centimeters 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.240
 deep 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.600
 the working height is the finest between 90 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.430
 and 105 centimeters is a large work surface 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.200
 nice because you have a lot of stuff on you 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.170
 changing table 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.619
 such as wipes diapers 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.439
 care products 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.060
 clothes and so on is you 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.340
 worksheet somewhat smaller than one 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 wall rack very easily raised 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.939
 Edges around the commode can also be whole 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.340
 be easy so nothing from you 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.189
 commode can fall off if you use the commode 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.289
 buy new then meet the requirements 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.179
 are you going to make one yourself then there is one 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.950
 number of things to look out for 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.810
 the chest of drawers must be smoothly finished and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.420
 should not have sharp edges or corners 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.330
 Contain the commode must be stable on the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.540
 ground also stand as the drawers or doors 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.019
 are open and the drawers must have a stop 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.700
 to have 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.280
 so are there are not 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.989
 Also it is easy if you book 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.709
 feet a little suppress fashion 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.540
 can lose 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.950
 so you automatically have a natural 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.360
 attitude 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.519
 when your feet and not a piece 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.470
 Lost among you or counter sting 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.300
 not a piece off 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.660
 you automatically take an unnatural 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.459
 attitude to what is not good for your back 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.680
 the height of the commode is important 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.690
 because both parents with a straight back 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.430
 baby must be able to hide 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.780
 you differ a lot in length 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.970
 then a compromise 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.610
 and pay attention to the correct height for the old ones 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.440
 who will change the most frequent baby 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.110
 a good mattress is at least 8 centimeters 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.549
 thick and should not be too soft 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.010
 it must also connect well to the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.880
 the walls of the bed fit well 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.260
 mattress 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.640
 you get easy in the bit and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.120
 the space between the mattress and without difficulty 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.799
 bed can be a maximum of 2 centimeters 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.049
 standing behind me to your neighborhood lights 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.000
 also want go tell your babies let the 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.590

 to be close to mommy and crib is whole 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.319
 suitable to put next to your bed 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.810
 so you can hold your hand at night 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.329
 stick out to stroke your baby like him 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.200
 whether she is restless and it is easy 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.540
 feeding 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.430
 especially when you are breastfeeding 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.319
 your baby so the bed and take it 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.299
 or its already at your bed 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.970

 as a child are in cribs that you wear 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.600
 can handle your bed like your baby 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.340
 completely close to you 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.329
 there are both oval and rectangles 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.609
 weights 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.290
 and standard dimensions that are not there 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.569
 babies lose a lot of fluid during sleep 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.150
 the bed base must therefore be well ventilated 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.310
 the mattress must be firm and good 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.230
 the cradle fit the chassis of the cradle 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.940
 must be firm and must not tilt 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.459
 as an old brother or sister at the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.109
 edge of the crib pull at a 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.540
 swing cradle you need the rocking cradle 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.190
 mechanism can be blocked as 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.109
 they must have wheels on the cradle 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.639
 these can be locked 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.530
 be careful when hanging cradle on the 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.000
 construction again at the cradle and stable 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.590
 and is sturdy 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 and if you have a heaven above the cradle 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 it then always pay close attention to it 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.289
 heaven does not come in the bed she did 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.289
 the baby cannot grasp the fabric
