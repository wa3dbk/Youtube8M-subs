lost<00:02:50.500> one<00:02:51.250> game<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.330> was<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> new<00:02:52.960> 19<00:02:53.380> team

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
lost one game and I was to a new 19 team

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.980 
lost one game and I was to a new 19 team
in<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:54.160> friendly<00:02:54.340> game<00:02:54.640> over<00:02:55.000> Lithuania<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
in a friendly game over Lithuania and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.360 
in a friendly game over Lithuania and
they<00:02:56.110> were<00:02:56.230> very<00:02:56.260> upset<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.070> because<00:02:57.190> I

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
they were very upset with that because I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.010 
they were very upset with that because I
really<00:02:58.150> felt<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.630> should<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.870> won<00:02:58.990> that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
really felt that we should have won that

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.930 
really felt that we should have won that
game<00:02:59.290> as<00:02:59.440> well<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.160> think<00:03:00.220> any<00:03:00.520> time<00:03:00.580> that<00:03:00.730> we

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
game as well so I think any time that we

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.670 
game as well so I think any time that we
have<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> shooting<00:03:01.450> contest<00:03:01.630> or<00:03:02.110> defensive

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
have a shooting contest or defensive

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.620 
have a shooting contest or defensive
contest<00:03:03.100> these<00:03:03.580> guys<00:03:03.760> want<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.209> win<00:03:04.390> and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
contest these guys want to win and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.660 
contest these guys want to win and
because<00:03:05.530> they<00:03:05.739> want<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.070> win<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.459> every

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
because they want to win in every

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.940 
because they want to win in every
competition<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:07.420> think<00:03:07.870> that's<00:03:08.050> what<00:03:08.320> their

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
competition I think that's what their

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.830 
competition I think that's what their
DNA<00:03:09.400> that's<00:03:09.580> what<00:03:09.730> makes<00:03:10.030> them<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.510> great

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
DNA that's what makes them the great

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.630 
DNA that's what makes them the great
players<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.290> they<00:03:11.410> are<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.800> collectively

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
players that they are and collectively
