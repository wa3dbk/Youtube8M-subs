00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.000 
so not familiar with this here's what
we're<00:00:25.960> doing<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.380> we're<00:00:26.500> starting<00:00:26.800> on<00:00:26.950> B<00:00:27.570> mmm

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
fourth fret of the next string of the D

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.780 
fourth fret of the next string of the D
string

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.110 

but<00:00:42.600> I've<00:00:42.690> also<00:00:42.840> got<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.110> pinky<00:00:43.670> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> fourth

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but I've also got my pinky on the fourth

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.069 
but I've also got my pinky on the fourth
fret<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.630> g-string

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
fret of the g-string

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.250 
fret of the g-string
now<00:00:48.040> this<00:00:49.000> is<00:00:49.120> what's<00:00:49.329> called<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.600> power<00:00:49.840> cord

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
now this is what's called a power cord

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.740 
now this is what's called a power cord
it's<00:00:50.590> also<00:00:50.739> called<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.430> 5<00:00:51.879> chord<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.420> I'm<00:00:52.540> gonna

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
it's also called a 5 chord and I'm gonna

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
it's also called a 5 chord and I'm gonna
tell<00:00:53.379> you<00:00:53.500> why

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
tell you why

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.700 
tell you why
so<00:00:55.030> we<00:00:55.480> could<00:00:55.720> actually<00:00:55.960> just<00:00:56.140> forget<00:00:56.590> the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
so we could actually just forget the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.380 
so we could actually just forget the
pinkie<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.070> play<00:00:57.280> these<00:00:57.430> two

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
pinkie and play these two

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.780 
pinkie and play these two
and<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.440> different<00:01:01.130> version<00:01:01.340> of<00:01:01.520> a<00:01:01.610> Power

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
and it's a different version of a Power

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.509 
and it's a different version of a Power
Board

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
Board

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.360 
Board
so<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.850> little<00:01:05.479> bit<00:01:05.630> about<00:01:05.720> music<00:01:06.200> theory<00:01:06.409> if

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
so a little bit about music theory if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.450 
so a little bit about music theory if
you<00:01:07.550> were<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.790> start<00:01:08.409> counting<00:01:09.409> notes<00:01:09.650> from

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
you were to start counting notes from

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.990 
you were to start counting notes from
the<00:01:10.640> major<00:01:11.300> scale<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:13.460> we're<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.700> key<00:01:13.850> of<00:01:13.940> B

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
the major scale so we're the key of B

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.149 
the major scale so we're the key of B
and<00:01:14.510> if<00:01:14.840> we<00:01:14.869> went<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.260> B<00:01:15.380> major<00:01:15.560> scale<00:01:18.159> we

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
and if we went to the B major scale we

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.490 
and if we went to the B major scale we
count<00:01:19.400> up<00:01:19.490> five<00:01:19.700> notes<00:01:21.610> that's<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.759> fifth<00:01:23.030> okay

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
count up five notes that's a fifth okay

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.400 
count up five notes that's a fifth okay
and<00:01:24.500> then<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.250> next<00:01:25.490> note<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.030> actually

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
and then this next note is actually

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.280 
and then this next note is actually
another<00:01:27.410> B<00:01:27.680> which<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.100> called<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.400> octave<00:01:29.290> so

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
another B which is called the octave so

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.930 
another B which is called the octave so
it's<00:01:30.440> one<00:01:30.650> octave<00:01:31.100> higher<00:01:31.130> but<00:01:31.580> it's<00:01:31.700> all<00:01:31.790> miss

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
it's one octave higher but it's all miss

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.399 
it's one octave higher but it's all miss
still<00:01:32.150> at<00:01:32.240> B<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.690> we<00:01:32.780> have

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.320 

so<00:01:38.409> all<00:01:38.770> we're<00:01:39.010> doing<00:01:39.369> on<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:39.760> rift<00:01:40.060> is

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
so all we're doing on this rift is

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.260 
so all we're doing on this rift is
sliding<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:41.110> same<00:01:41.440> shape<00:01:41.830> up<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.850> down<00:01:42.970> so

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
sliding this same shape up and down so

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.560 
sliding this same shape up and down so
I'm<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.600> go<00:01:45.000> I'm<00:01:46.000> actually<00:01:46.180> just<00:01:46.390> going

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
I'm going to go I'm actually just going

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.600 
I'm going to go I'm actually just going
to<00:01:46.630> pick<00:01:46.869> one<00:01:46.900> so<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.409> slide<00:01:47.770> up

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
to pick one so you slide up

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.010 
to pick one so you slide up
and<00:01:50.180> then<00:01:50.300> pick<00:01:50.510> again

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and then pick again

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.289 
and then pick again
you<00:01:52.189> notice<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.609> that<00:01:53.729> again<00:01:53.789> pics

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you notice or just do that again pics

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.980 
you notice or just do that again pics
slide<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:58.939> now<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.570> gonna<00:02:00.750> slide

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
slide so it's like now I'm gonna slide

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.559 
slide so it's like now I'm gonna slide
all<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.289> up<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:02.929> it's<00:02:03.929> all<00:02:04.049> slides

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
all the way up to here it's all slides

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.580 
all the way up to here it's all slides
can<00:02:06.569> be<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> little<00:02:06.899> tricky<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.409> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
can be a little tricky to get that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.800 
can be a little tricky to get that
rhythm

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.280 

so<00:02:13.090> let<00:02:14.090> me<00:02:14.210> just<00:02:14.360> tell<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> names<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.230> the
