00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 how to sow wingers of india a 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.970
 useful flower to the pleasure garden and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.970
 especially in the kitchen garden 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.929
 young people are flowers that fear 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.020
 jelly if you want to have a bloom 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.699
 hastily from the month of may june he 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.220
 is obligatory to sow them 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.619
 inside to heat and to 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.669
 light then for that we will use a 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.140
 terrine a terrine already pierced we go 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.559
 to put the soil inside even before 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.390
 to put potting soil we will drain the 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.530
 bottom of our terrine for that we go 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.840
 have a little potting soil and 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:48.470
 everything that is ruder is put 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:54.770
 deep down now we will complete with 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.989
 our potting soil a seedbed have for 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:03.130
 fill your terrine well we will 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.130
 spread the potting soil over the entire surface 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.200
 game you have lightly with the end of 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.079
 fingers insisting around our 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.139
 terrines and we will complete by sieving 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.819
 potting soil on top to always 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.819
 to have the finest soil possible 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.869
 now here is our terrine epr was 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.509
 to sow then for that would have used 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.039
 carnations of india 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.520
 then the seed is pretty enough 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.859
 coarse there it's easy to sow it 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.719
 Nevertheless, it is necessary to sow them the most 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.719
 clear possible so we will take his 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.649
 fingers and we're going to spread the seeds over 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.869
 the entire bowl of your garnet 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.590
 is lying down i'm going to bring 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.609
 now once again from the earth 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.609
 fine over 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 in fact it's still my 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:04.860
 seedling seedling with a board game 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:10.360
 as the seeds are well applied 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.459
 on the potting soil and I water the first 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.810
 time copiously but without doing 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.810
 run off the water slowly 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.810
 gently 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.820
 here we are now mourning seeds 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.850
 hans have sown know that the seeds 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.680
 at 20 degrees after 4 to 5 days 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.570
 a week they will start to rise 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.880
 as soon as they have reached 2 sheets 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.310
 we can already start to transplant them 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.080
 another technique is to associate 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.410
 have them in automata 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.300
 so for that there is already a method 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.130
 seasonal repique of a at the foot of 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.750
 tomatoes or so another solution 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.420
 it's at the time of sowing if you come 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.610
 to transplant tomatoes is to put 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.050
 seeds at the foot of your tomatoes then 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.600
 that's why we'll put a single 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.600
 seed one seed per tomato 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.060
 we will discover slightly with a small 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.650
 little loam over and here you go 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.750
 now we queen of yÃ©dagne go 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.610
 to lift at the foot of my tomatoes 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.049
 carnations of india which are nematicides which 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.400
 will repel nematodes from 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.110
 nematodes that are small larvae 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.239
 that are gnawing at the roots of our 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.640
 tomatoes so that will allow you to have 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.640
 nice tomatoes thanks to the dad wingers
