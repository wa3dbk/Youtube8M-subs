salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.990

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.350
You know I made this awesome pesto sauce yesterday and when a pesto sauce is sitting

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.660
in the fridge freshly done in a pestle it is difficult to sleep yesterday night

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.099
I dreamed but it's going to be a reality
that I'm going to cook pasta with this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.850
awesome pesto sauce. For this pasta I am using farfele, farfele is bow-tie pasta and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.770
we're going to boil this pasta, I suggest you go and see the video i made on

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.690
how to boil pasta; what i'm going to do is I'm going to boil this pasta

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
till al dante, al dante is just done it should not be over boiled otherwise it'll

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
be like your mashed rice, with this pesto
sauce you can use any kind of pasta even

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.420
you can use the spaghetti so let's go
ahead and make this; pasta is getting

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.950
boiled do not add oil just appropriate
amount of salt and just one minute to go

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.350
when you think the pasta is going to be
ready we're going to get the sauce ready

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.210
because in this we're not going to cook the pesto sauce, pesto sauce is that not

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.680
supposed to be cooked it is just to be
finished in the last moment that's when you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.430
get a real awesome flavor of the pesto. Pasta is almost getting done that's

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.189
when in a pan you can add little bit of the water from the boiling pasta the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.490
pan should not be too hot okay it should be just warm

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.549
that's when add little bit of cream and add pinch of salt

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.000
once this cream slightly kind of heats up
you know you don't want this to cook or

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.560
anything just slightly when this is heated up you can see these bubbles

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.899
forming that's when you add the hot
pasta look at this it's really really

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.579

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.009
