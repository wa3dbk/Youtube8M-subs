game<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.520> mean<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.640> got<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.000> deal<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.180> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
game I mean you just got to deal with it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.289 
game I mean you just got to deal with it
but<00:01:33.780> other<00:01:34.079> than<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:35.640> recommend<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
but other than that I don't recommend it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.020 
but other than that I don't recommend it
and<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.619> reason<00:01:37.920> why<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> don't<00:01:38.310> recommend<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
and the reason why I don't recommend it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.990 
and the reason why I don't recommend it
is<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.680> KSG<00:01:41.009> handles<00:01:41.759> very

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is because the KSG handles very

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
is because the KSG handles very
differently<00:01:42.619> from<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:44.490> other<00:01:44.729> shotgun<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
differently from any other shotgun and I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
differently from any other shotgun and I
know<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:48.149> pretty<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.479> only<00:01:48.780> use

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
know this because I pretty much only use

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.700 
know this because I pretty much only use
shotguns<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.340> 80%<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.320> time<00:01:52.500> I'm

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
shotguns like 80% of the time I'm

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100 
shotguns like 80% of the time I'm
playing<00:01:52.979> I'm<00:01:53.340> using<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.790> shotgun<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.509> other

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
playing I'm using a shotgun the other

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
playing I'm using a shotgun the other
20%<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:57.079> random<00:01:58.079> weapons<00:01:58.469> so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
20% is other random weapons so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.410 
20% is other random weapons so
I<00:02:00.149> could<00:02:00.810> definitely<00:02:00.929> tell<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.710> KSG

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
I could definitely tell that the KSG

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.709 
I could definitely tell that the KSG
handles<00:02:03.420> differently<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:06.000> animation

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
handles differently and the animation

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.619 
handles differently and the animation
the<00:02:07.380> pump-action<00:02:07.890> animation<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> very<00:02:09.239> slow

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the pump-action animation is very slow

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.740 
the pump-action animation is very slow
compared<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.649> past<00:02:10.890> 12<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.599> would

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
compared to these past 12 and I would

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.780 
compared to these past 12 and I would
say<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> model<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:13.739> that's<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.280> lever-action

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
say the model but that's a lever-action

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.920 
say the model but that's a lever-action
shotgun<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.590> specific<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.569> model<00:02:18.870> is

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
shotgun to be specific but the model is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.330 
shotgun to be specific but the model is
also<00:02:19.080> very<00:02:19.379> slow<00:02:19.709> as<00:02:19.920> well<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.890> problem

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
also very slow as well so the problem

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.630 
also very slow as well so the problem
with<00:02:23.489> using<00:02:23.700> steady<00:02:24.120> aim<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.830> KSG<00:02:26.190> is

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
with using steady aim is that the KSG is

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.670 
with using steady aim is that the KSG is
already<00:02:26.910> accurate<00:02:27.420> enough<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.590> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
already accurate enough like it is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
already accurate enough like it is
probably<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.099> most<00:02:29.190> accurate<00:02:29.700> shotgun<00:02:30.510> out

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
probably the most accurate shotgun out

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.870 
probably the most accurate shotgun out
of<00:02:30.810> all<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.140> them

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
of all of them

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.330 
of all of them
besides<00:02:32.880> probably<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> use<00:02:33.630> s12<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.680> one<00:02:34.890> is

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
besides probably the use s12 that one is

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.839 
besides probably the use s12 that one is
pretty<00:02:35.579> accurate<00:02:36.380> but<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.650> KSG<00:02:39.110> for<00:02:40.110> me<00:02:40.290> I

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
pretty accurate but the KSG for me I

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.550 
pretty accurate but the KSG for me I
have<00:02:41.849> pretty<00:02:42.090> good<00:02:42.299> accuracy<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.349> can

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
have pretty good accuracy like I can

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.960 
have pretty good accuracy like I can
maintain<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> 22<00:02:45.480> percent<00:02:45.690> accuracy

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
maintain like a 22 percent accuracy

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.509 
maintain like a 22 percent accuracy
throughout<00:02:47.970> all<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.269> call<00:02:48.510> duty<00:02:48.720> games<00:02:49.519> not

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
throughout all the call duty games not

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.520 
throughout all the call duty games not
with<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:51.000> shotguns<00:02:51.569> with<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:52.110> every

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
with just shotguns with like every

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.940 
with just shotguns with like every
weapon<00:02:53.400> fully<00:02:53.910> auto<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.480> all<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.799> have

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
weapon fully auto and all that so I have

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.680 
weapon fully auto and all that so I have
pretty<00:02:56.129> good<00:02:56.340> accuracy<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.269> some<00:02:57.420> reason

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
pretty good accuracy but for some reason

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.280 
pretty good accuracy but for some reason
when<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> use<00:02:58.049> KS<00:02:58.410> g12<00:02:59.239> like<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.269> miss<00:03:00.750> more<00:03:01.260> than

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
when I use KS g12 like I miss more than

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.670 
when I use KS g12 like I miss more than
any<00:03:01.739> other<00:03:02.209> shotgun<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.420> use<00:03:03.720> there's<00:03:04.440> any

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
any other shotgun that I use there's any

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.220 
any other shotgun that I use there's any
other<00:03:04.889> gun<00:03:05.160> for<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.609> matter<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.959> I'm<00:03:07.079> not

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
other gun for that matter and I'm not

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.650 
other gun for that matter and I'm not
missing<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.739> lot<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.790> might<00:03:09.480> be

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
missing a lot it's just I might be

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.690 
missing a lot it's just I might be
slightly<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.410> left<00:03:10.650> or<00:03:10.950> slightly<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
slightly to the left or slightly to the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.289 
slightly to the left or slightly to the
right<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.709> I<00:03:13.709> just<00:03:13.799> figured<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.760> needed<00:03:15.209> to

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
right and I just figured I needed to

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.819 
right and I just figured I needed to
take<00:03:15.420> steady<00:03:15.750> aim<00:03:15.959> off<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:16.799> a

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
take steady aim off so I can have a

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.250 
take steady aim off so I can have a
wider<00:03:17.130> spread<00:03:17.579> of<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:18.000> pellets<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:19.049> have<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
wider spread of the pellets and have a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.620 
wider spread of the pellets and have a
better<00:03:19.500> chance<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:20.010> hitting<00:03:20.130> people<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.970> I

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
better chance of hitting people and I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
better chance of hitting people and I
found<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.500> very<00:03:24.079> very<00:03:25.079> good<00:03:26.389> because

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
found that to be very very good because

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.589 
found that to be very very good because
having<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.000> wider<00:03:30.209> spread<00:03:30.599> means<00:03:32.599> well

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
having a wider spread means well

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.809 
having a wider spread means well
obviously<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.980> have<00:03:35.099> an<00:03:35.220> easier<00:03:35.430> chance<00:03:35.609> of

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
obviously you have an easier chance of

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.879 
obviously you have an easier chance of
hitting<00:03:35.970> people<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:36.989> any<00:03:37.230> chance<00:03:37.560> of

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
hitting people so you have any chance of

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.440 
hitting people so you have any chance of
killing<00:03:38.250> them<00:03:39.109> but<00:03:40.109> if<00:03:40.829> you<00:03:41.819> are<00:03:42.030> extremely

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
killing them but if you are extremely

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.610 
killing them but if you are extremely
accurate<00:03:42.889> with<00:03:43.889> your<00:03:44.099> weapons<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:46.410> can

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
accurate with your weapons and you can

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.259 
accurate with your weapons and you can
use<00:03:46.829> steady<00:03:47.099> aim<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.459> don't<00:03:47.700> have<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:47.880> problem

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
use steady aim you don't have a problem

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.550 
use steady aim you don't have a problem
with<00:03:48.389> it<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:48.750> go<00:03:48.959> for<00:03:49.290> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
with it then go for it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.069 
with it then go for it
but<00:03:49.799> for<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.220> people<00:03:50.569> who<00:03:51.569> have<00:03:53.030> not<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.750> good

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
but for the people who have not so good

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.409 
but for the people who have not so good
accuracy<00:03:56.120> or<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:58.200> also<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.799> tough<00:03:59.130> time

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
accuracy or you also have a tough time

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.640 
accuracy or you also have a tough time
aiming<00:04:00.419> with<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.660> shotgun<00:04:00.989> especially<00:04:01.620> a

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
aiming with the shotgun especially a

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.680 
aiming with the shotgun especially a
pump-action<00:04:02.130> which<00:04:02.579> it's<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.090> shot<00:04:03.120> and

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
pump-action which it's one shot and

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.330 
pump-action which it's one shot and
basically<00:04:04.319> if<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.500> miss<00:04:04.739> you're<00:04:04.950> dead

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
basically if you miss you're dead

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.920 
basically if you miss you're dead
then<00:04:06.520> don't<00:04:07.270> use<00:04:07.540> studying<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:09.280> that's<00:04:09.459> it

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
then don't use studying and that's it

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.979 
then don't use studying and that's it
like<00:04:10.930> that's<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.709> only<00:04:11.739> tip<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.370> really<00:04:12.730> need

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
like that's the only tip you really need

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.960 
like that's the only tip you really need
and<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.370> guys<00:04:15.489> want<00:04:15.849> to<00:04:15.940> use<00:04:16.000> my<00:04:16.780> set<00:04:17.470> up

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
and if you guys want to use my set up

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.610 
and if you guys want to use my set up
for<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.180> KSG<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:19.870> could<00:04:20.049> see<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.410> when<00:04:20.590> I

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
for the KSG you could see it when I

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.090 
for the KSG you could see it when I
spawned<00:04:21.100> in<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.579> beginning<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.830> used

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
spawned in in the beginning and I used

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.040 
spawned in in the beginning and I used
some<00:04:24.220> text<00:04:24.820> flash<00:04:25.030> grenades

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
some text flash grenades

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.900 
some text flash grenades
I<00:04:26.080> believe<00:04:26.800> my<00:04:26.919> secondary<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.639> akimbo

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
I believe my secondary is akimbo

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.230 
I believe my secondary is akimbo
scorpions<00:04:28.919> extended<00:04:29.919> mags<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.490> damage<00:04:30.940> on

scorpions extended mags and damage on

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.400 
scorpions extended mags and damage on
the<00:04:31.389> KSG<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:33.180> specialists<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.570> whatever
