sasco<00:01:20.640> came<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.300> me<00:01:21.480> with<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.870> concept<00:01:22.500> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
sasco came to me with the concept of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
sasco came to me with the concept of
baking<00:01:23.340> made<00:01:23.520> easy<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.570> something<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
baking made easy it's something that I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
baking made easy it's something that I
feel<00:01:25.230> very<00:01:25.500> strongly<00:01:25.890> about<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.280> people

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
feel very strongly about that people

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.360 
feel very strongly about that people
don't<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> bake<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.620> it<00:01:29.130> always

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
don't like to bake because it always

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.730 
don't like to bake because it always
flops<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.600> too<00:01:30.780> complicated<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.530> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
flops or it's too complicated or they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.290 
flops or it's too complicated or they
have<00:01:31.890> two<00:01:32.010> major<00:01:32.190> too<00:01:32.430> much<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.970> basically

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
have two major too much and basically

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.160 
have two major too much and basically
SAS<00:01:33.930> goes<00:01:34.170> whole<00:01:34.440> theory<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
SAS goes whole theory is that you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.770 
SAS goes whole theory is that you
bake<00:01:36.680> with<00:01:37.100> these<00:01:37.130> quick<00:01:37.610> treats<00:01:37.939> by<00:01:38.479> just

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
bake with these quick treats by just

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.899 
bake with these quick treats by just
adding<00:01:38.960> three<00:01:39.439> products<00:01:39.950> okay<00:01:40.430> we've<00:01:40.759> got

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
adding three products okay we've got

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.120 
adding three products okay we've got
eggs<00:01:41.150> we've<00:01:41.330> got<00:01:41.540> multi-part<00:01:42.110> oil<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:42.830> this<00:01:43.100> is

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
eggs we've got multi-part oil so this is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.429 
eggs we've got multi-part oil so this is
the<00:01:43.340> muffin<00:01:43.700> mix<00:01:43.909> now<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.689> muffin<00:01:45.110> mix<00:01:45.290> we're

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
the muffin mix now the muffin mix we're

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.960 
the muffin mix now the muffin mix we're
gonna<00:01:45.530> use<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.860> make<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> cake<00:01:46.310> pops<00:01:46.580> because

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
gonna use to make the cake pops because

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.910 
gonna use to make the cake pops because
it's<00:01:47.119> interchangeable<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.080> we<00:01:48.470> can<00:01:48.619> just<00:01:48.770> use

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
it's interchangeable so we can just use

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.600 
it's interchangeable so we can just use
that<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.250> make<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.430> plain<00:01:50.240> sheet<00:01:50.600> okay<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:52.250> now

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
that to make a plain sheet okay so now

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.630 
that to make a plain sheet okay so now
once<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.149> just<00:01:53.539> uh<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:54.170> will<00:01:54.649> start<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:54.979> okay

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
once you just uh I will start this okay

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.039 
once you just uh I will start this okay
tell<00:01:55.850> me<00:01:55.880> what<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.180> need<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.390> do<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.780> could

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
just gonna throw that in the bowl all of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.070 
just gonna throw that in the bowl all of
it<00:01:58.700> yeah<00:01:59.000> or<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.450> in<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.630> bone<00:01:59.780> dry
