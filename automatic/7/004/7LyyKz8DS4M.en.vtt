Flash Thompson veneman the hood would be

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.509 
Flash Thompson veneman the hood would be
at<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.540> tie<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.410> probably<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.859> a<00:03:17.889> switch<00:03:18.280> out

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
at a tie so you probably do a switch out

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.670 
at a tie so you probably do a switch out
thing<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.060> know<00:03:19.239> probably<00:03:19.870> more<00:03:20.200> likely<00:03:20.470> for

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
thing you know probably more likely for

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.550 
thing you know probably more likely for
Flash<00:03:21.579> Thompson<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.269> fantomex<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.380> know

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
Flash Thompson and fantomex you know

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.670 
Flash Thompson and fantomex you know
maybe<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.280> don't<00:03:24.639> know<00:03:24.730> but<00:03:25.600> um<00:03:25.780> yeah<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.500> that's

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
maybe I don't know but um yeah so that's

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.440 
maybe I don't know but um yeah so that's
that<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.190> then<00:03:27.400> who<00:03:27.910> would<00:03:28.000> make<00:03:28.209> more<00:03:28.389> sense

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
that and then who would make more sense

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.229 
that and then who would make more sense
to<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:28.930> anti<00:03:29.410> venom<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.920> Flash<00:03:30.130> Thompson<00:03:30.400> to

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
to have anti venom and Flash Thompson to

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.849 
to have anti venom and Flash Thompson to
do<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.750> change<00:03:32.019> outright<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.650> would<00:03:32.769> be

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
do the change outright that would be

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.039 
do the change outright that would be
pretty<00:03:33.040> sweet<00:03:33.280> wouldn't<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.870> then<00:03:34.959> the

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
pretty sweet wouldn't it and then the

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.199 
pretty sweet wouldn't it and then the
build<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.319> figure<00:03:35.560> would<00:03:35.709> be<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.829> bomb<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.700> that's

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
build a figure would be a bomb so that's

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.240 
build a figure would be a bomb so that's
it<00:03:37.420> there's<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.079> lot<00:03:38.139> of<00:03:38.349> them<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.650> came<00:03:38.859> you
