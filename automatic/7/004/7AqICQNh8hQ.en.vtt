00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.210 
read that out there and then we have a
cutting<00:00:50.870> plier<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.739> has<00:00:51.890> this<00:00:52.040> little

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
cutting plier that has this little

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.920 
cutting plier that has this little
circle<00:00:52.640> thing<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.090> can<00:00:53.210> clamp<00:00:53.480> down<00:00:53.690> and

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
circle thing so you can clamp down and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.220 
circle thing so you can clamp down and
then<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:54.650> need<00:00:54.800> some<00:00:55.070> bent<00:00:55.489> wires<00:00:56.230> that's

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
then we need some bent wires that's

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.640 
then we need some bent wires that's
circular<00:00:57.739> let's<00:00:58.489> get<00:00:58.610> started<00:00:59.260> so<00:01:00.260> first

what you're gonna do is you're gonna get
two<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.460> them<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:18.820> you're<00:01:19.820> going<00:01:20.330> to<00:01:21.700> bend

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
two of them and you're going to bend

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.020 
two of them and you're going to bend
them<00:01:22.909> toi<00:01:23.360> they're<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.720> circular<00:01:24.760> like<00:01:25.760> that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
them toi they're in a circular like that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.550 
them toi they're in a circular like that
make<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.960> ends<00:01:27.290> meet

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
make the ends meet

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.760 
make the ends meet
you're<00:01:28.370> just<00:01:28.490> gonna<00:01:28.640> pull<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
you're just gonna pull this this is the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.899 
you're just gonna pull this this is the
most<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.460> best<00:01:31.790> way<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.740> get<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.890> that's<00:01:34.670> what

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
most the best way to get it that's what

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.420 
most the best way to get it that's what
I<00:01:34.940> think<00:01:35.270> instead<00:01:36.079> just<00:01:36.229> folding<00:01:36.680> them<00:01:36.799> do

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
I think instead just folding them do

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.100 
I think instead just folding them do
them<00:01:37.610> evenly<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:40.299> so<00:01:43.570> okay<00:01:44.570> after<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:44.990> do

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
them evenly and so okay after you do

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.910 
them evenly and so okay after you do
that<00:01:45.140> you're<00:01:45.409> gonna<00:01:45.590> get<00:01:45.770> these<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:48.409> you're

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that you're gonna get these and you're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.609 
that you're gonna get these and you're
gonna<00:01:49.009> put<00:01:49.969> this<00:01:50.240> little<00:01:50.600> circular<00:01:51.259> part

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
gonna put this little circular part

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.090 
gonna put this little circular part
you're<00:01:52.070> gonna<00:01:52.250> slide<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.090> bend<00:01:53.359> it<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.659> and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
you're gonna slide and bend it in and

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.340 
you're gonna slide and bend it in and
you're<00:01:55.100> gonna<00:01:55.189> put<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.490> together<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.930> press

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
you're gonna put it together and press

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.010 
you're gonna put it together and press
down<00:01:57.619> until<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:59.240> touches<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.719> can't<00:01:59.899> go

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
down until it touches it you can't go

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.980 
down until it touches it you can't go
any<00:02:00.170> more<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.770> then<00:02:01.609> you're<00:02:01.789> gonna<00:02:01.969> like<00:02:02.750> this

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
you're gonna put one right there

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.550 
you're gonna put one right there
like<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.619> okay<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.610> we're<00:02:11.450> gonna<00:02:11.510> twist<00:02:12.200> it

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
like that okay and we're gonna twist it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.730 
like that okay and we're gonna twist it
twice<00:02:13.040> by<00:02:13.460> holding<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.560> getting<00:02:15.560> this

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
twice by holding this and getting this

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.630 
twice by holding this and getting this
and<00:02:16.360> twisting<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:18.560> wood<00:02:19.000> like<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:21.640> okay

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
and twisting this wood like that okay

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.080 
and twisting this wood like that okay
and<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.530> base<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
and that is like the base this is the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:35.470 
and that is like the base this is the
base<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:28.400> rig<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:32.950> we're<00:02:33.950> going<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
base of this rig and now we're going to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.690 
base of this rig and now we're going to
put<00:02:36.319> those<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.530> there<00:02:36.860> just<00:02:37.130> make<00:02:37.520> sure<00:02:37.670> that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
put those in there just make sure that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.020 
put those in there just make sure that
they<00:02:38.209> don't<00:02:38.270> go<00:02:38.510> out<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.730> we're

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
they don't go out like that and we're

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.010 
they don't go out like that and we're
going<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:42.400> get<00:02:43.400> our<00:02:43.700> third<00:02:44.300> wire<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:47.020> we're

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
going to get our third wire and we're

00:02:48.020 --> 00:03:03.850 
going to get our third wire and we're
going<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:58.239> this<00:03:01.360> put<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:03.170> anymore<00:03:03.470> that

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
going to this put this in anymore that

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.699 
going to this put this in anymore that
works<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:05.360> right<00:03:05.540> there<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.470> we're<00:03:06.620> just

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
works like right there and we're just

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.280 
works like right there and we're just
going<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.950> start<00:03:07.099> twisting<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.670> around<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.600> we

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
going to start twisting it around so we

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.570 
going to start twisting it around so we
already<00:03:09.620> twisted<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.160> little<00:03:10.280> bit<00:03:10.459> but

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
already twisted it a little bit but

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.900 
already twisted it a little bit but
we're<00:03:10.760> going<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.060> better<00:03:11.360> base<00:03:12.519> for<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.670> so

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
we're going to better base for it so

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.190 
we're going to better base for it so
that<00:03:14.090> doesn't<00:03:14.269> come<00:03:14.480> apart<00:03:14.569> when<00:03:15.049> you're

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
that doesn't come apart when you're

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.320 
that doesn't come apart when you're
fishing<00:03:15.380> does<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.830> be<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.010> bad<00:03:16.220> thing<00:03:16.330> and

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
fishing does that be a bad thing and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.240 
fishing does that be a bad thing and
we're<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:17.569> gonna<00:03:17.690> start<00:03:18.069> twisting<00:03:19.069> like

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
we're just gonna start twisting like

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:30.520 
we're just gonna start twisting like
this

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
