00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello how about my name is Leon I dedicate myself 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.009
 to canine training and this is the 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.740
 third video that he made in the first 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.870
 two I showed you how to teach your dog to 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.110
 that feels and in the second how 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.819
 throw it in these first two videos in 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.069
 none of you saw that you use chain 

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:20.419
 punishment was only based on 

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:22.220
 reward 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.140
 in this third video I'm going to show you 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.929
 something that is obedience in general 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.169
 all the sitting of the cast on the assist 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.729
 to the call among other things you're never going to 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.630
 see that he mistreats the dog or that 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:36.230
 force to do something 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.230
 shows 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.960
 certainly 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.379
 lying 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.660
 yes 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.340
 Note how I'm not giving awards 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500
 for everything you do but go 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.970
 being much more things that come to 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.460
 perform and I'm giving you only one prize 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.089
 although there are several things that there 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.089
 check 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.160
 the awards are small 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 but it is something that he likes very much when he sees 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.980
 If you do not like what you are 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.980
 giving you will not have the attention 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.340

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.990
 wait 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.170
 he spoke 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.900
 it's like he's paying attention 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.520

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.500
