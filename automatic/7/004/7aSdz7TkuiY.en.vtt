00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:21.160
 [Music] 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.760
 ayoye you know everyone knows where we 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.710
 says today we find ourselves on black 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.210
 f2 on mission time and destiny 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.339
 I hope you 're fine because 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.079
 I have the shape as usual then 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.790
 the one that will allow you to go out 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.519
 of maps and on a sumptuous one mission 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.619
 but also on hand so that's it 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.940
 so for each shot of the amap it's 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.239
 quite simple you got on the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.470
 panel in front of you here against I 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.920
 I'm done so I did a little 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.680
 cut 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.729
 once you are in a good position 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 you wished straight ahead 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.110
 you without stadium without anything and you 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.920
 so come on what is joca 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.030
 you are at height 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.170
 mc i want to say why not this 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.600
 that you see the structures very well 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.680
 are therefore completely bugged once 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.240
 that it's done you 're going to skip everything 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.640
 right in front of you so that you fall 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.990
 on the house or on the floor it changes 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.509
 nothing but me, I preferred to fall 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.350
 on the ground of course I'm kidding no but 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.460
 as I told you that it comes back 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.619
 completely the same 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.310
 so there once it's done you 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.640
 go here go of course go under the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.280
 map 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.630
 good so it's pretty simple to do well 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.429
 sure i'm not showing you everything for that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.479
 you can do it and that less 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.759
 the one who serve me for something that 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.460
 you discover by yourself and that's it 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.719
 so I hope this video chip you 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.679

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.990
