now<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:01.399> is<00:01:01.550> neutral<00:01:01.940> all<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.270> way<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.720> the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
now this is neutral all the way to the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.950 
now this is neutral all the way to the
side<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:03.649> about<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:04.009> much<00:01:04.299> so<00:01:05.320> 1st<00:01:06.670> 2nd<00:01:07.670> 3rd

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
side it's about that much so 1st 2nd 3rd

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.050 
side it's about that much so 1st 2nd 3rd
4th<00:01:09.159> 3rd<00:01:10.180> 4th<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.409> 6th<00:01:13.100> through<00:01:13.909> that

4th 3rd 4th and 6th through that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.209 
4th 3rd 4th and 6th through that
whole<00:01:14.240> range<00:01:14.619> reverse<00:01:15.619> all<00:01:15.889> the<00:01:15.979> way<00:01:16.069> in<00:01:16.159> that

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
whole range reverse all the way in that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.139 
whole range reverse all the way in that
there<00:01:16.960> but<00:01:17.960> it's<00:01:18.139> uh<00:01:18.350> it's<00:01:19.149> significantly

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
there but it's uh it's significantly

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.029 
there but it's uh it's significantly
better<00:01:20.299> once<00:01:20.569> it's<00:01:20.689> in<00:01:20.899> gear<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:21.950> know

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
better once it's in gear you know

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.559 
better once it's in gear you know
there's<00:01:22.219> no<00:01:22.369> play<00:01:22.609> in<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:22.880> at<00:01:22.999> all<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:23.329> seriously

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
there's no play in it at all I seriously

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.459 
there's no play in it at all I seriously
had<00:01:23.810> like<00:01:23.960> this<00:01:24.170> much<00:01:24.229> play<00:01:24.679> in<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:24.979> before<00:01:25.389> the

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
had like this much play in it before the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.179 
had like this much play in it before the
pedal<00:01:28.359> imagine<00:01:29.359> you<00:01:29.450> can't<00:01:29.659> see<00:01:29.990> very<00:01:30.799> well<00:01:30.979> if

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
pedal imagine you can't see very well if

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.209 
pedal imagine you can't see very well if
at<00:01:31.310> all<00:01:31.399> it<00:01:32.179> has<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.079> much<00:01:33.319> plane<00:01:33.649> where<00:01:34.100> it

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
at all it has this much plane where it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.520 
at all it has this much plane where it
doesn't<00:01:34.369> feel<00:01:34.639> like<00:01:34.729> there's<00:01:34.939> anything<00:01:35.530> it's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
doesn't feel like there's anything it's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.959 
doesn't feel like there's anything it's
kind<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.829> difficult<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.340> see<00:01:37.369> I'll<00:01:37.639> see<00:01:37.789> if<00:01:37.880> I

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
kind of difficult to see I'll see if I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.069 
kind of difficult to see I'll see if I
can<00:01:38.149> get<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.329> better<00:01:38.450> angle<00:01:39.939> yeah<00:01:40.939> that<00:01:41.810> much

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
can get a better angle yeah that much

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.559 
can get a better angle yeah that much
play<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:43.729> we're<00:01:43.909> not<00:01:44.119> doing<00:01:44.389> anything

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
play in it so we're not doing anything

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.629 
play in it so we're not doing anything
and<00:01:44.810> then<00:01:44.929> it<00:01:44.959> catches<00:01:45.229> from<00:01:45.590> here<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.549> the

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
and then it catches from here to the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:51.489 
and then it catches from here to the
floor<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:50.630> know<00:01:50.719> about<00:01:50.779> half<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.200> pedals

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
floor so you know about half the pedals

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:52.690 
floor so you know about half the pedals
not<00:01:51.619> doing<00:01:51.920> anything<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.279> rest<00:01:52.399> of<00:01:52.579> it's

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
not doing anything the rest of it's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.929 
not doing anything the rest of it's
actually<00:01:52.849> being<00:01:53.299> caught<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:55.340> main<00:01:55.579> reason

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
actually being caught the main reason

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.809 
actually being caught the main reason
for<00:01:56.119> making<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:57.829> lot<00:01:58.490> of<00:01:58.549> people<00:01:58.700> talk

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
for making this is a lot of people talk

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.169 
for making this is a lot of people talk
about<00:01:58.849> chatter<00:01:59.299> when<00:01:59.539> they<00:01:59.630> get<00:01:59.779> a<00:01:59.810> new<00:01:59.990> clutch

comes to the transmission we'll see if
you<00:02:18.829> guys<00:02:18.950> can<00:02:19.010> actually<00:02:19.459> hear<00:02:19.730> it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.350 

I<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.920> no<00:02:24.100> idea<00:02:24.340> how<00:02:24.430> good<00:02:24.670> or<00:02:24.820> bad<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.090> audio

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
I have no idea how good or bad the audio

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:34.869 
I have no idea how good or bad the audio
is<00:02:25.450> gonna<00:02:25.570> be<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:25.990> my<00:02:26.140> apologies

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.520 

it<00:02:35.269> seems<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.569> be<00:02:35.629> making<00:02:35.780> less<00:02:36.079> noise<00:02:36.319> in<00:02:36.500> my

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
it seems to be making less noise in my

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:54.320 
it seems to be making less noise in my
first<00:02:36.829> gut<00:02:37.040> it

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.450 

so<00:02:54.870> love<00:02:55.230> more<00:02:55.590> wine<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.010> coming<00:02:56.250> from<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
so love more wine and coming from the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.250 
so love more wine and coming from the
transmission<00:02:57.710> then<00:02:58.710> stock<00:02:59.870> got<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.930> truck

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
transmission then stock got a truck

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:10.670 
transmission then stock got a truck
coming<00:03:01.710> part<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.100> me<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.930> kind<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.260> rattling

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
coming part of me that kind of rattling

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:23.270 
coming part of me that kind of rattling
noise

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.550 

it<00:03:23.760> was<00:03:23.940> making<00:03:24.330> actually<00:03:25.050> funny<00:03:25.230> enough<00:03:25.320> a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
it was making actually funny enough a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.110 
it was making actually funny enough a
lot<00:03:25.740> more<00:03:25.950> noise<00:03:26.160> when<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.700> guess<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.000> was<00:03:27.090> a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
lot more noise when I guess it was a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.710 
lot more noise when I guess it was a
little<00:03:27.270> cooler<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.750> morning<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:29.720> you

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
little cooler this morning it's you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.930 
little cooler this morning it's you
can't<00:03:30.930> read<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.560> 97<00:03:32.250> outside<00:03:32.640> right<00:03:32.910> now

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
can't read that so 97 outside right now

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.290 
can't read that so 97 outside right now
super<00:03:33.930> super<00:03:34.200> hot<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.710> have<00:03:35.670> my<00:03:35.790> condition<00:03:36.210> I

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
super super hot I have my condition I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.430 
super super hot I have my condition I
should<00:03:36.330> probably<00:03:36.570> do<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.750> love<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
should probably do that but I love the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.990 
should probably do that but I love the
play<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.860> feel<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.459> shifter<00:03:41.850> it

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
play in the feel and the shifter it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.949 
play in the feel and the shifter it
feels<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:42.390> much<00:03:42.540> nicer<00:03:42.959> um<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:45.480> I've<00:03:45.720> got<00:03:45.930> a

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
feels so much nicer um so I've got a

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.510 
feels so much nicer um so I've got a
good<00:03:46.320> amount<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.590> break-in<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.130> put<00:03:47.280> him<00:03:47.400> on

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
good amount of break-in to put him on

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.710 
good amount of break-in to put him on
this<00:03:47.640> clutch<00:03:49.010> yeah<00:03:50.060> probably<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.240> lot<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.540> noise

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
this clutch yeah probably a lot of noise

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.570 
this clutch yeah probably a lot of noise
right<00:03:51.900> there<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.830> lot<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.070> break-in<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.459> do

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
right there but a lot of break-in to do

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.060 
right there but a lot of break-in to do
on<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.760> clutch<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.680> hopefully<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.800> noise

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
on the clutch and hopefully the noise

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.310 
on the clutch and hopefully the noise
kind<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.400> settles<00:03:56.940> down<00:03:57.090> as<00:03:57.300> it<00:03:57.450> has<00:03:57.780> already<00:03:58.020> I

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
kind of settles down as it has already I

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.060 
kind of settles down as it has already I
imagined<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.920> woman<00:03:59.130> get<00:03:59.280> much<00:03:59.459> better<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:01.070> it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
imagined the woman get much better so it

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.890 
imagined the woman get much better so it
gives<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.520> little<00:04:02.820> bit<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.060> idea<00:04:03.239> of<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.780> how

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
gives a little bit of idea of just how

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.210 
gives a little bit of idea of just how
much<00:04:04.050> noise<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.500> either<00:04:04.590> does<00:04:04.860> or<00:04:04.890> does<00:04:05.190> not

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
much noise it either does or does not

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.510 
much noise it either does or does not
have<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:07.020> getting<00:04:07.530> onto<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.920> front<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.430> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:22.099 
have and getting onto the front of the
road<00:04:08.640> here

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:33.210 

engine<00:04:22.800> braking

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.360 

a<00:04:33.250> lot<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.880> transmission<00:04:34.600> noise

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.300 

now<00:04:41.370> I'm<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.520> neutral<00:04:42.560> let's<00:04:43.560> go<00:04:43.740> sit<00:04:44.100> down

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
now I'm a neutral let's go sit down

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.490 
now I'm a neutral let's go sit down
idea<00:04:45.120> if<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.390> can<00:04:45.570> hear<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:45.960> there's<00:04:46.350> one

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
idea if you can hear that there's one

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.140 
idea if you can hear that there's one
other<00:04:46.620> example<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:47.190> chatter

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.050 

there's<00:04:54.630> airplane<00:04:55.110> overhead

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.700 

just<00:05:02.060> tap<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.479> break<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:05.509> went<00:05:05.719> away<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.500> dude

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
just tap the break it went away the dude

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.369 
just tap the break it went away the dude
is<00:05:06.860> again<00:05:07.810> rattling<00:05:08.810> with<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.020> certain

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
is again rattling with a certain

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:24.029 
is again rattling with a certain
frequency<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:10.009> the<00:05:10.069> motor

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.790 

20<00:05:24.729> miles<00:05:24.879> an<00:05:25.059> hour

engine<00:05:28.220> braking

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.930 

so<00:05:50.790> I'm<00:05:51.060> at<00:05:51.210> my<00:05:51.240> house<00:05:52.250> back<00:05:53.250> into<00:05:53.520> my<00:05:53.640> driveway

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
so I'm at my house back into my driveway

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:15.330 
so I'm at my house back into my driveway
here

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:43.890 

they're<00:06:16.340> not<00:06:16.460> used<00:06:16.669> to<00:06:16.760> that<00:06:16.900> Christmas

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.660 

now<00:06:44.410> the<00:06:44.470> trick<00:06:44.800> is<00:06:44.980> to<00:06:45.010> make<00:06:45.130> sure<00:06:45.280> it<00:06:45.430> goes

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
now the trick is to make sure it goes

00:06:45.670 --> 00:07:07.700 
now the trick is to make sure it goes
away<00:06:45.970> after<00:06:46.780> a<00:06:47.020> few<00:06:47.200> animals<00:06:47.350> when<00:06:47.710> I<00:06:47.740> should
