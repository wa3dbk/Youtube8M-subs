00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
before I try to we believe that if you
if<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.699> strengthen<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:04.110> instructional<00:01:04.920> team

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
if you strengthen the instructional team

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.590 
if you strengthen the instructional team
and<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:06.810> optimize<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.310> teachers<00:01:08.820> knowledge

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and you optimize the teachers knowledge

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
and you optimize the teachers knowledge
that<00:01:09.990> will<00:01:10.170> translate<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.939> best
