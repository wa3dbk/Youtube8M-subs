00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.920 
loving this I think it's a great color
for<00:03:34.590> me<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> little<00:03:35.910> yellow<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.690> think

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
for me it is a little yellow and I think

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.840 
for me it is a little yellow and I think
I'd<00:03:37.019> rather<00:03:37.140> have<00:03:37.410> yellows<00:03:37.799> in<00:03:37.829> orange<00:03:38.519> some

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
I'd rather have yellows in orange some

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.479 
I'd rather have yellows in orange some
people<00:03:39.090> may<00:03:39.209> rather<00:03:39.570> be<00:03:39.810> orange<00:03:40.109> then<00:03:40.380> yellow

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
people may rather be orange then yellow

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.670 
people may rather be orange then yellow
but<00:03:41.489> i<00:03:41.760> think<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.150> yellow<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:43.410> kind<00:03:43.650> of

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
but i think the yellow just kind of

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.229 
but i think the yellow just kind of
compliments<00:03:44.280> my<00:03:44.400> skin<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> little<00:03:44.910> bit<00:03:45.030> better

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
compliments my skin a little bit better

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.500 
compliments my skin a little bit better
i<00:03:45.420> think<00:03:45.510> i<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.230> little<00:03:46.620> bit<00:03:46.859> better<00:03:47.040> um

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
i think i like it a little bit better um

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.840 
i think i like it a little bit better um
I<00:03:49.040> can't<00:03:50.040> say<00:03:50.430> how<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:50.880> really<00:03:51.239> compare<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.840> to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
I can't say how I really compare it to

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.520 
I can't say how I really compare it to
Chanel<00:03:53.850> because<00:03:54.060> Chanel<00:03:54.510> matt<00:03:55.019> is<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> little

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
Chanel because Chanel matt is a little

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.309 
Chanel because Chanel matt is a little
bit<00:03:55.680> as<00:03:55.920> almost<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.760> little<00:03:56.880> bit<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.299> much<00:03:58.049> more

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
bit as almost a little bit is much more

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.400 
bit as almost a little bit is much more
pigmented<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.700> sheer<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:01.260> just

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
pigmented so this is sheer and it just

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.960 
pigmented so this is sheer and it just
seemed<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.680> go<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:01.920> well<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.609> only<00:04:02.790> problem

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
seemed to go on well the only problem

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.039
