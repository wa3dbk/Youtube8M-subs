00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.029
 good day my ladies and gentlemen and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.069
 Welcome to a new series of call 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.080
 of duty modern warfare where we are right now 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.429
 At the end of the year she is ready to play 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 to collect few kills 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.199
 we need parabolic microphone though we do 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.580
 already have 40 kills with the visor 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 we already have some abo microphone 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.160
 I forgot to equip 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.050
 but we still do her some kids 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.539
 with there he is my manager is about more 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.210
 to get essays 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:36.120
 switch redpoint if not on it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.950
 visor and full handle so firings 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.360
 confirm the dog tags collect too 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.710
 those who do not belong to us were the goods 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.440
 anyway father displayed 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.010
 especially the guy who got killed 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.559
 yes the dog tags counted the points 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.149
 I only believe when he lives and not 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.410
 I did not know 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.870
 It can also be that we come up with it 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.870
 that what she gets 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 protected does not bring me much 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:19.110
 robert was better holy shit 150 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.790
 We still need points either 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.390
 one kill and one sun and one more 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.940
 collect or collect kill and collect 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.780
 Reclaiming is also prohibited 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.030
 underrated 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.250
 But how do you get good ones? 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.640
 earn points but not protected 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.360
 automatically I have to change that 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 You realize that you keep that first of all 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.630
 Confirmed at conclusion is unprotected 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.680
 not so effective 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:55.890
 Although the kills are there but the true 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:57.660
 You have to collect the stamps yourself 85 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.310
 We need points to win than 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.520
 I your information because I believe 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.560
 as on youtube watch the video 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.910
 Do not see the infected because they see 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.910
 yes anyway when the video ends 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:18.360
 conclusion I confirmed in black 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.620
 ops 2 liked to gamble too 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.660
 So we both have shown it 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.670
 together like to gambled so confirmed 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.750
 denied 200 points 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.540
 good combination protected interested 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.540
 but not me it does not work 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.430
 slow time 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.150
 damn no that can not be 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.560
 Not be 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 for opponents at a spot damned 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.270
 what is your group cuddling gangbang 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.270
 meeting 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.660
 that gives security that 's not us 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.660
 Almost at the top 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.660
 You also have to hustle and bustle everywhere 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.090
 Exploded view is everywhere you look 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:58.740
 shoot people 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:04:01.800
 something going on here drone was there 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.860
 not bad would have a chin and 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.340
 his graduation confirm fuck that 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.400
 can not be true that can not be true 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.780
 his 50 points were missing the team 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.780
 deathmatch has droned me again 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.830
 bullshit 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.669
 is three people have come out since 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.550
 even alone do what can you do there 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:40.610
 alone against do not think much 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:47.510
 I was nothing 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.510
 17 10h purchase confirmed with what 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.210
 at least at night it does not have any 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.210
 sense if we go back by this 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:12.050
 have to go outside but that is too 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:12.050
 not so easy is not easy 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.920
 except the opponent jumps in front of a 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.390
 then the others come and immediately 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:26.680
 Also want a piece of cake or 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:30.360
 a piece of you always has to 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.360
 keep an overview here 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:56.440
 they were not there this time 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:58.770
 strangely enough , so much to much 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.770
 lots 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.560
 I have been refused conclusion 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:16.740
 would say what is going on in there 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.130
 Explosive consequences what's going on here 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.710
 that was just blatant then saw 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.290
 Where do all of them come from? Twelve teachers 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:30.680
 wanted to quickly regulate the first 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:36.720
 are always so fast I wonder if 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:39.440
 the next to detail with the ranks 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.880
 anything is achieved 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.600
 great unlocked or something 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:49.890
 whether that too or someday 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.600
 Just like always it's just okay 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.860
 now but I eat sometime 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.330
 we can give nothing can 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.760
 then choose yourself extra 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.230
 unlock weapons or so you can 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.800
 I do not know. I'm curious 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.640
 we do not know anything yet but so far 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.810
 that will eventually happen 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.810
 change bye next time
