you
you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.680 

it<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.430> really<00:01:39.700> interesting<00:01:40.180> because<00:01:40.330> I've

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
it is really interesting because I've

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.290 
it is really interesting because I've
worked<00:01:40.900> with<00:01:40.990> rafa<00:01:41.500> three<00:01:42.280> years<00:01:42.580> he's<00:01:42.880> got<00:01:43.090> a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
worked with rafa three years he's got a

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.530 
worked with rafa three years he's got a
caliber<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.200> steps<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.130> way<00:01:45.280> he<00:01:45.640> moves<00:01:46.210> and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
caliber of steps in a way he moves and

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.330 
caliber of steps in a way he moves and
the<00:01:46.990> structures<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.740> kind<00:01:47.980> of<00:01:48.100> was<00:01:48.310> a

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
the structures so it kind of was a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.670 
the structures so it kind of was a
little<00:01:48.610> bit<00:01:48.700> easier<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.530> understand<00:01:50.530> because

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
little bit easier to understand because

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.610 
little bit easier to understand because
