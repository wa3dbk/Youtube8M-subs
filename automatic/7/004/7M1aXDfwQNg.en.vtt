00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.740 
tree so for being six feet tall it's not
bad<00:04:14.100> at<00:04:14.190> all<00:04:14.310> but<00:04:15.270> that's<00:04:15.390> probably<00:04:15.630> because

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
bad at all but that's probably because

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.630 
bad at all but that's probably because
my<00:04:16.080> tree<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.320> really<00:04:16.620> really<00:04:16.950> skinny<00:04:17.160> too<00:04:17.430> I

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
like it another reason I went with gold

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.800 
like it another reason I went with gold
is<00:05:00.400> because<00:05:00.789> i<00:05:00.819> had<00:05:01.210> bought<00:05:01.360> these<00:05:01.539> nate

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
is because i had bought these nate

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.540 
is because i had bought these nate
berkus<00:05:02.229> pillows<00:05:02.590> at<00:05:02.740> target<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.190> while<00:05:03.340> back

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
berkus pillows at target a while back

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.510 
berkus pillows at target a while back
and<00:05:03.819> they<00:05:03.940> have<00:05:04.090> um<00:05:05.020> some<00:05:05.530> gold<00:05:05.830> on<00:05:06.009> it<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:06.490> i

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
and they have um some gold on it so i

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.650 
and they have um some gold on it so i
thought<00:05:06.759> it<00:05:06.940> would<00:05:07.000> be<00:05:07.120> pretty<00:05:07.300> because<00:05:07.539> it

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
thought it would be pretty because it

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.409 
thought it would be pretty because it
just<00:05:07.750> kind<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.050> matches<00:05:08.280> everything<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:09.759> it

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
just kind of matches everything so it

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.300 
just kind of matches everything so it
matches<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.900> pillows<00:05:11.289> on<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.470> couch<00:05:11.680> I

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
matches the pillows on the couch I

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.600 
matches the pillows on the couch I
thought<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.180> would<00:05:13.300> be<00:05:13.419> cute<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.720> get<00:05:14.050> this
