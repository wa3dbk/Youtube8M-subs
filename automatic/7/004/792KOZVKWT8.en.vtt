cup of egg wash one egg we like this
baking<00:00:32.730> mix<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.360> very<00:00:33.719> low<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
baking mix because it's very low in

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.520 
baking mix because it's very low in
sugar<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.100> made<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.579> brown<00:00:35.880> rice<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
sugar it is made with brown rice and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
sugar it is made with brown rice and
regular<00:00:37.530> rice<00:00:37.739> flour<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.550> has<00:00:39.120> almond<00:00:39.420> meal

regular rice flour and has almond meal

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540 
regular rice flour and has almond meal
in<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.079> protein<00:00:40.260> we'll<00:00:40.920> add<00:00:41.070> 1

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
in it so it has protein we'll add 1

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.830

tablespoon<00:00:42.090> coconut<00:00:42.540> oil<00:00:44.030> we<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.300> coconut

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
tablespoon coconut oil we like coconut

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
tablespoon coconut oil we like coconut
oil<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> medium<00:00:47.610> chain<00:00:47.910> fatty

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
oil because it is a medium chain fatty

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360 
oil because it is a medium chain fatty
acid<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.050> body<00:00:49.230> uses<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.920> fat<00:00:50.160> as

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
acid and your body uses that fat as

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.130 
acid and your body uses that fat as
energy<00:00:50.550> instead<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.090> storing<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> your<00:00:51.989> body

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
energy instead of storing in your body

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
energy instead of storing in your body
so<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.649> means<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.100> eat<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.489> many<00:00:53.670> pancakes

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so it means you can eat as many pancakes

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
so it means you can eat as many pancakes
as<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.600> never<00:00:54.750> gain<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> single<00:00:55.440> out
