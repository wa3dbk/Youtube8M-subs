00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.540
 the best viewers 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 In the course of the morning, the clearings have become wider while they 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.769
 in the meantime, we have some more stacking clouds on the news 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.309
 locally you there have also fallen a few drops and maybe it arrived 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 We thought that in some places 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.060
 the first have to take the umbrella but many will not imagine what on the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.900
 most places 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.450
 shall we keep it dry 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.270
 and yes here and there still still 3 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.169
 that is by no means a coincidental day 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.049
 with also not seeing places is possible but mostly dry weather and 

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:34.480
 temperature falls back past twenty years climbing to 22 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.089
 who knows it maybe up to a 23 degrees 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.230
 18 degrees for too high doses it usually appears 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.350
 he was talking it cost on the coast it can sometimes be a pretty powerful one 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 and then tonight no and tonight it is still prevalent 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.520
 once again dry with depression 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.090
 but about the Bay of Biscay and the persistent failures of a fixed 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.380
 France has come closer, but for the time being I don't feel like it 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.659
 but run for a historic opportunity 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.719
 what the clouds and first was mainly high clouds during the night 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.490
 that's for sure you can get that narrow veil and then after 

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:11.100
 midnight 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.020
 also what a lower pick up first is still what the clearances and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 then we will still keep the image dry for the most part 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.530
 Tomorrow morning and tomorrow also temperatures dropping to the eighth 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.010
 on the thirteen strokes 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.340
 and never during the course of the day gradually more and more face 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.300
 at 10 more and more a lower globe institute north some more first 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.690
 clearings but in the end it is everywhere anyway 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.060
 in a bit of a touch of rice in the late afternoon or evening 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 do not tell at the beginning of this year from the French coast from the French border 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.530
 you never know 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.549
 and also the Sunday there are only those failures 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.159
 with lots of clouds 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 turn with this spring 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.630
 with storm also canceled 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.649
 and also early next week the nvj had changeable weather with a lot of possibilities 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.870
 interflex is falling so even on Monday that they don't keep it dry and 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.070
 Tuesday 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.690
 and that you, on the other hand, still continue to slaughter 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.940

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.490
 clearing clearings again after midnight from all over france 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.269
 and nature in the city kanaker 8 to 13 degrees 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.480
 you may need some sun in the north of the country first 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.390
 the south-west gradually gets more clouds 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.109
 and by the end of the day a little bit breaks with you and thunder 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.629
 the French border 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.500
 temperature of 17 to 24 degrees so it gets hot 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.320
 and remain warm after that, but from now on very changeable weather 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.320
 with his bees he has a chance of a thunderstorm 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.439
 what are the viewers 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.520
 more cumulus clouds 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.949

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.469
 but tonight and tonight the team is also gradually on more 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.400
 disappear more sleep will come 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.940
 and then you again get more broad clearances meanwhile one 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.419
 france this bad weather our own racing team lost 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.059
 and it will not be aimed directly for tomorrow against tomorrow night city 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.929
 bad weather 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:17.579
 recently stumbled racing stable and across our country will be sitting here one 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.099
 bit in principle at in 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.590
 ok we order ds the set apple does not look so good but tonight and 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.670
 last night dike made it 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.530
 mostly dry weather maybe that tonight it's still raining 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.750
 falls and then later, especially from France, more clouds as a leading role 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.219
 child 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.669
 crawls and that will drop after 8 to 13 degrees 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.869
 and then the previous day after tomorrow we had it dried up first 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:41.710
 depression 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.170
 with one time up 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.179
 the golf of biskaje and also above france you and the associated failures 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:51.369
 gradually comes the closer to that it might be a bit 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.860
 precipitation there is of course the cloudiness already 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.970
 and in the course of today they cocks 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.740
 of all unless the west got almere and secondhand smoke but the precipitation the 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.450
 malfunction 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.430
 with the rain showers and thunderstorms 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.289
 breaks in the late afternoon or the abyss our country m 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.199
 then but especially the night from saturday to sunday that bad weather of his dna 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.349
 from east across the country that will especially in the north of it 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.100
 country will also have some clearings tomorrow 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.440
 on the coast it can sometimes blow fairly forcefully and then gradually 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.350
 to moor and first clouds 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.419
 in the late afternoon or evening 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.830
 there is a relatively good chance of some precipitation there 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.909
 even during the day a cylinder flex can fall a shower but then 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.529
 we had it mostly dry thys pass against 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.129
 In the evenings after being really here and there a whole cabinet is that tent 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.499
 it it still stays at warm temperatures until 23 19 24 year old jan 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.419
 somewhat the same temperatures as today 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.060
 he has pictures again the night from Saturday to Sunday coming as country and also 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.490
 after that performance will not really be good by staying under the lofts 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.520
 stay under its influence and depression 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.500
 With that, when it comes to associated malfunctions, you thrive and the media locally 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.970
 others at times saw quite a bit more falling the night of 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.169
 Saturday to Sunday in advance that it can be locally 5 to 10 liters per square 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.830
 meter all take a little bit under the influence of it next week 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.409
 depressions thyssen that is also not good for the beginning of next week 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.129
 except for the temperatures that remain fairly high 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.990
 but Sunday will be there and that every day 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.970
 still reasonably warm temperatures around 21 degrees and a 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.389
 moderate east wind 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.249
 and then the predictions open tomorrow will be that often do not know to tell 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:32.930
 nevertheless times start
