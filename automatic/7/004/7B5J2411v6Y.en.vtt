frosting in a blender before but the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.950 
frosting in a blender before but the
reason<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:18.869> is

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
reason I like to do it in here is

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080 
reason I like to do it in here is
because<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:20.010> kind<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.490> gets<00:00:20.640> everything

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
because it's kind of gets everything

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.140 
because it's kind of gets everything
very<00:00:21.510> evenly<00:00:22.170> smooth<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.920> creamy<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.490> also
