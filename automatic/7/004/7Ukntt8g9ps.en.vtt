00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.190 

from<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.500> very<00:00:01.650> beginning<00:00:02.300> the<00:00:03.300> iPad<00:00:04.020> was

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
from the very beginning the iPad was

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.410 
from the very beginning the iPad was
designed<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.890> be<00:00:05.100> very<00:00:05.210> powerful<00:00:06.210> very

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.610 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:07.280> but<00:00:08.280> also<00:00:08.960> remarkably<00:00:09.960> simple<00:00:10.500> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.410 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> our<00:00:13.769> goal<00:00:14.099> was<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.910> take<00:00:15.059> all<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
use so our goal was to take all the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.570 
use so our goal was to take all the
amazing<00:00:15.750> things<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
amazing things that you can do the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.880 
amazing things that you can do the
full-size<00:00:18.029> iPad<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:19.080> pack<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.619> into<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
full-size iPad but pack them into a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.359 
full-size iPad but pack them into a
product<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.060> much<00:00:21.300> smaller<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
product that is so much smaller and

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.920 
product that is so much smaller and
that's<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.730> did<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> new<00:00:24.900> iPad

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that's what we did with the new iPad

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.429 
that's what we did with the new iPad
Mini<00:00:26.449> one<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> things<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.990> makes<00:00:28.140> iPad

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
Mini one of the things that makes iPad

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
Mini one of the things that makes iPad
so<00:00:28.740> incredible<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.760> there's<00:00:30.420> almost<00:00:30.599> no

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
so incredible is that there's almost no

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.530 
so incredible is that there's almost no
end<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:33.450> when

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
end to what you can do with it so when

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630 
end to what you can do with it so when
we<00:00:33.660> decided<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> make<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> iPad<00:00:34.649> Mini<00:00:34.920> we

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
we decided to make the iPad Mini we

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
we decided to make the iPad Mini we
wanted<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> make<00:00:36.090> sure<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.660> had<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:37.079> the

features<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:37.920> iPad<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.640> magical

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
features that make iPad so magical

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
features that make iPad so magical
we<00:00:40.350> began<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> display<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.460> has<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
we began with the display that has the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.319 
we began with the display that has the
same<00:00:42.000> resolution<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.899> iPad<00:00:43.350> 2<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.149> all

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
same resolution as the iPad 2 so all

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
same resolution as the iPad 2 so all
your<00:00:45.510> apps<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.870> content<00:00:46.020> look<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> work<00:00:47.280> the

your apps and content look and work the
same<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.530> at<00:00:49.530> 7.9<00:00:50.039> inches<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.850> small

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
same way and at 7.9 inches it's small

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.479

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.440 

if<00:01:36.950> all<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.340> we<00:01:37.430> had<00:01:37.549> done<00:01:37.790> was<00:01:38.030> take<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
if all that we had done was take the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.440 
if all that we had done was take the
original<00:01:38.900> iPad<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.530> just<00:01:39.560> reduce<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.450> all

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
original iPad and just reduce it all

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.289 
original iPad and just reduce it all
that<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:41.810> would<00:01:41.990> be<00:01:42.140> aware<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.670> was<00:01:43.670> was

that you would be aware of was was

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.760 
that you would be aware of was was
everything<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:44.780> was<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.200> missing<00:01:45.409> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
everything that was just missing that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.630 
everything that was just missing that
there<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.430> inherent<00:01:46.670> loss<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:48.140> just<00:01:48.740> reducing

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
there is inherent loss in just reducing

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.649 
there is inherent loss in just reducing
a<00:01:49.729> product<00:01:50.090> in<00:01:50.270> size<00:01:50.770> on<00:01:51.770> what<00:01:52.040> we<00:01:52.250> did<00:01:52.610> was<00:01:53.479> we

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
a product in size on what we did was we

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.180 
a product in size on what we did was we
went<00:01:53.690> back<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.140> very<00:01:54.320> beginning<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.039> we

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
went back to the very beginning and we

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.789 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.640> time<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.600> design<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.990> product<00:01:57.409> that

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
took the time to design a product that

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.490 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.070> concentration<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:59.360> not<00:01:59.420> a<00:02:00.020> reduction

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
was a concentration of not a reduction

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.649 
was a concentration of not a reduction
of<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.860> original<00:02:02.170> we<00:02:03.170> felt<00:02:03.470> strongly<00:02:03.890> that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.109 
of the original we felt strongly that
7.9<00:02:05.659> inches<00:02:06.140> was<00:02:06.770> exactly<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.549> right<00:02:07.670> display

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
7.9 inches was exactly the right display

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.530 
7.9 inches was exactly the right display
size<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.649> became<00:02:09.950> clear<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.489> we<00:02:11.330> had<00:02:11.510> to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
size but it became clear that we had to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.289 
size but it became clear that we had to
reduce<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.170> width<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.040> borders<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.000> you

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
reduce the width of the borders so you

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.390 
reduce the width of the borders so you
can<00:02:14.540> still<00:02:14.870> pick<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.590> easily<00:02:16.010> use<00:02:16.190> it

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
can still pick it up and easily use it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.559 
can still pick it up and easily use it
with<00:02:16.519> one<00:02:16.670> hand<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:19.850> have<00:02:20.030> continued<00:02:20.540> to

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
with one hand we have continued to

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.340 
with one hand we have continued to
develop<00:02:21.200> our<00:02:21.530> unibody<00:02:22.250> process<00:02:23.319> there<00:02:24.319> are

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
develop our unibody process there are

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.680 
develop our unibody process there are
essentially<00:02:25.040> two<00:02:25.580> parts<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.330> enclosure
