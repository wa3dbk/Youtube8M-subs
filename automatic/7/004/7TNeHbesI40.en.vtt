so<00:03:17.630> moving<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.050> to<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.200> final<00:03:18.710> image<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.790> can

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
so moving on to the final image you can

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.570 
so moving on to the final image you can
also<00:03:20.360> see<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.140> bottom<00:03:21.350> right<00:03:21.770> I<00:03:22.040> believe

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
also see on the bottom right I believe

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.300 
also see on the bottom right I believe
that<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> different<00:03:23.330> colored<00:03:24.230> at<00:03:24.740> colette

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
that is a different colored at colette

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.280 
that is a different colored at colette
on<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.550> dog<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.240> i'm<00:03:26.390> guessing<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.780> they<00:03:26.990> you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
on the dog so i'm guessing that they you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.350 
on the dog so i'm guessing that they you
can<00:03:27.590> do<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.950> confirming<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.700> few<00:03:29.060> things

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
can do that confirming a few things
