00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.850
 hello today I want to teach you how to do more 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.770
 two types of errors in the tutorial 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:22.580
 earlier we have learned to do these 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.580
 roses and also another guy like this 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.390
 this craft is so attractive that it does not 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.520
 I can stop and thanks to the girls that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.610
 have left in the forum of our web 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.200
 a few links that I wanted to make 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.200
 all at once 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 I tried many and here you can see the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 results of these tests have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.130
 delighted these flowers that have five 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.720
 petals the links you can find in 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.720
 the time below this tutorial 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.900
 but the most impressive most attractive 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.520
 if I see this porous seat of a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.520
 Polish yellow teacher is 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.130
 the skiing that happier 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.049
 because she does it paper that night 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.049
 I tried to do it with this material 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.670
 Tea material is not very popular 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.939
 embedded immediately the idea to do it 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.000
 with napkins the result is 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.130
 surprising although the night paper 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.869
 it has its advantages 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.390
 the roses come out with the napkins I made 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.109
 some experiments changing the thickness of 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.360
 paper leaving by removing the layers with the 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.240
 size of rose 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.470
 and getting a desired appearance 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.149
 then we will put on and with these roses what 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.460
 good in this job 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.880
 that we can create a piece 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.399
 whole from the lists made by 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.399
 we ourselves to the bouquets 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.200
 for example to these is the law n with 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.269
 wrinkled tapia newspaper 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.940
 crush the paper over it I've 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.989
 are covered with a napkin 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:37.459
 wash and then with a thermal gun and 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:41.959
 stuck the roses this is another kind of 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:46.220
 support for a bouquet type vase is 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.590
 made with a spiral braid now 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.400
 You can choose any form for the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.180
 wider vase below or do it 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.330
 straight when we learned Friday the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.590
 braiding technique we can vary in 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.920
 form of 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.920
 these
