00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.759
 I started hip hop dance 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.949
 afterwards I 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.050
 meet people in college who 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.550
 continued from in dynasty that dwelt 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.500
 in front of my house so we mounted a 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.230
 group even let that allowed me 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.949
 to meet what would become the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.769
 macadam group 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.489
 so that was my first my first 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.489
 appearance on stage 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.679
 no 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:59.409
 11 the festival of beaubourg 93,2 the 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:01.489
 show comic opera and 96 march 96 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.059
 but I am the hall of the villette 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.920
 had better project aladin dance 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.920
 general public with the group 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.470
 the problem one of the first at the game where 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.910
 I taught it was good there was said 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.510
 worse but also the basic premise that 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.760
 I use it is to tell me that I 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.320
 person who takes a shot the sites 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.140
 personal foot that he does not intend to be 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.830
 do not see scope that can have things 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.970
 very simple it is important also to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.590
 through the teaching of data 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.840
 to bring this notion of trust 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.670
 she no one our transmission it was 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.790
 not a language and through this language 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.369
 we teach people and even talk and the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.770
 sentence is discussed write yet 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.280
 discuss quarter -hour exchange 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.290
 this information training session 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.750
 teaching of exchanged and 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.670
 transmission is paramount but before 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.230
 everything must not be given simply 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.209
 like the connectors do not remain 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.730
 choreography to give must not 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.680
 to give beyond the steps the spirit of a 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.860
 move his name since the name 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.680
 transmit or less mind and there is 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.180
 my person in front if me when I 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.340
 played for our guard coach his 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.810
 competitors in this game changed it's 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.020
 an inspiration because 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.910
 adjustment 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.920
 this disorder to the chain 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.210
 share the wave of stuff I have 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.210
 trouble filling worse 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.140
 he 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.440
 m 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.610
 and
