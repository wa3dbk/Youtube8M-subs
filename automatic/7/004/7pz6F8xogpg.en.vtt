00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
sparse pure is almost the same as sparse

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.860 
sparse pure is almost the same as sparse
except<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.099> shows<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.700> how<00:04:28.849> many<00:04:29.030> unread<00:04:29.210> here

and that number blog so that makes it a
little<00:04:31.909> bit<00:04:32.090> more<00:04:32.240> useful<00:04:34.599> see<00:04:35.599> they're<00:04:35.810> a

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
little bit more useful see they're a

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.790 
little bit more useful see they're a

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
essentially the same feature set also

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.709 
essentially the same feature set also
brings<00:04:43.789> pictures<00:04:44.150> over<00:04:46.419> alright<00:04:47.419> those<00:04:47.690> are
