00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
about accessorizing it though because I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.450 
about accessorizing it though because I
also<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.320> plus-sized<00:00:49.829> women<00:00:50.010> tend<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
also think that plus-sized women tend to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
also think that plus-sized women tend to
stay<00:00:50.640> away<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:50.960> belting<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.280> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:54.180> stick

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
stay away from belting and if you stick

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.410 
stay away from belting and if you stick
