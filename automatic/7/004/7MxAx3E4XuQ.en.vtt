00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.859
 Hello dear channel subscribers 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.570
 ergon promo for a long time we did not release videos 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.570
 due to the circumstances but not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.940
 let's talk about it in Ukraine today 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.750
 our review is dedicated to signaling 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.880
 adaptation in particular will consider 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:29.970
 smokeball zigzag grenades with peas 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 two types of fire alarm green 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.230
 fire and will run the signal 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.890
 cartridges threaded from the device all 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 demonstrate how it looks and 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.090
 principle of their actions and order 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.399
 exploitation so dear viewers 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.039
 We begin to explain the signal 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.050
 adaptation so let's start the trigger 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.420
 devices and signal threaded 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.129
 Pskov cartridges and device represents 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.840
 from yourself like that with a drummer 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.659
 beats on starter cartridge 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.659
 the principle of action is easy to twist the cartridge 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.610
 platoons so to speak, and the device 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.240
 we drop it clicked and it hits 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.630
 big 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.370
 the truth is quite weighty 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.370
 hold in hand hold tight 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.580
 van see flew 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.470
 we twist 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:43.770
 and repeat the process we twist enter and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 we shoot we shoot without 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.500
 one more different color 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.420
 cool thing and so this is practical 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 grenade with peas plastic case 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.510
 check inside corsair 4 and 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.500
 mountain principle of action simple we pull 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.510
 check quickly thereby ignite the corsair and 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.370
 we have about three four seconds 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.600
 high to throw it 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.760
 explodes scatters gar 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.920
 Well , the affected area let's say 23 meters 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.920
 maximum and so we do 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.490
 here it burns here it exploded roads 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.650
 shattered since she swarm view 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.810
 practical grenades 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.500
 also with peas truth such exist 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.450
 out paint their distinctive features 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.690
 parts they are delays ie you can 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.630
 pull the check and hold and then throw 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.120
 but there have been cases of exploding in your hand therefore 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.870
 I do not recommend the principle of action is the same 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.870
 We pull out the pin and throw so that 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:13.110
 that's actually left after 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:16.940
 bang and so continue fair hair 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.500
 fire there are different colors with us 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.230
 represented green is red 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.350
 yellow well, the principle of operation is simple 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:31.560
 it means we remove the top cover and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.680
 there chika with a string well here, too 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.210
 pull out and lights from flashing lights 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:44.550
 about 15 20 seconds green good 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.130
 suitable for 3 fans will like this 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.310
 that's the way 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.310
 bright green 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.599
 fighters 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.520
 to signal 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.790
 such an order is not actually all 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.850
 veil 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.330
 u does not go out 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.300
 well and rolls let it burn out it was a flyer 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.840
 fire smoke zigzag checker for 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.350
 group military-sports games 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.960
 Well also suitable for creating some 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.290
 atmosphere permissible for photographing often 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.530
 take the principle of a child otherwise hide 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.740
 the upper part here is a little ring which we 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.850
 , too, pulling out smokes, she also gave 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.650
 half a minute is the amount of smoke now 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.700
 actually we will see it 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.090
 often your questions like how much and so 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.090
 go 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.690
 and as you can see, in principle, can smoke 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.229
 sufficiently large human territory 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.229
 will not be seen 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.160
 Here is a chance to zigzag 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.100
 on time and spotted but as dear 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:41.530
 the audience we are not enemies of nature therefore everything 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:43.240
 for a clean you pull out the trash and all 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.750
 will brush your review were 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.039
 signaling devices are presented 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.930
 various 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.690
 so that you understand the principle of their actions and 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.580
 Effect 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.630
