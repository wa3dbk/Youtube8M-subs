using<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.630> just<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.520> paste

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
using that just because it is a paste

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.120 
using that just because it is a paste
and<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.330> can<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:26.720> not<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.960> pure<00:02:27.290> substance<00:02:27.530> so

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
get mostly ivermectin which could either

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.490 
get mostly ivermectin which could either
cause<00:02:40.310> an<00:02:40.460> underdose<00:02:40.880> or<00:02:41.150> an<00:02:41.240> overdose<00:02:41.660> you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
cause an underdose or an overdose you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.380 
cause an underdose or an overdose you

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
never want either for the rabbits

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.550 
never want either for the rabbits
because<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.660> under<00:02:44.930> dose<00:02:45.110> won't<00:02:45.410> be

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
because the under dose won't be

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.160 
because the under dose won't be
effective<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.280> an<00:02:46.370> overdose<00:02:46.850> well<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.990> could

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
effective and an overdose well it could

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.890 
effective and an overdose well it could
kill<00:02:48.350> your<00:02:48.470> rabbit<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.720> don't
