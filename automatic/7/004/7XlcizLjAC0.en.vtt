00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.340

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.340
 ship's 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.910
 to see if there is a man who has gone 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.739
 Well, I'm not going first, so it's not worth it 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.390
 that happens that happens when you try to give 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.489
 more turns of the slope I try to give more 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.199
 turns of the account then one of two or 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.720
 you get dizzy or you explode the car in this 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.800
 case 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.090
 let's first have the first things like that 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.050
 that I'm happy so we're going to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.430
 eat an oil a milestone oil not 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.960
 it exists because there is an olive but 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.490
 good as there is going to be is that if 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.659
 we are first that quiet favor with 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.539
 our center not lemon 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.420
 so we can use this curve 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.039
 here unexpected with any boy 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.600

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.609
 let's hope we choke a lot in 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.189
 this second in this second round 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:43.100
 because as we count, it's going to come 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.590

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.289

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:03.429
 the eyes itself is annoying while the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.619

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.070
 as photos longer but no penalty or be 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.080
 not exploited by sheer pity 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.350
 with the command of the medical team in 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.410
 two said but I swear time but begic 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.090
 he shared and producing guys going 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.500
 like the gentleman every banana is 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.870
 proud of me even if he covers me and with the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.820
 fingers ok let's go left or that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.500
 instance the last round guys them 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.880
 story are doing pretty good 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.330
 the truth although I have enough glue 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.310
 this time 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.140
 there is indeed a gentleman who is finished 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.090
 of happening right now and the others of 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.280
 back glued a lot with that guy 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.960
 because as we dance a little more than 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 the gentleman tells if he throws us over 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.270
 and do not see what we can do wrong eye 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.270

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.630
 your speed your super speed see 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.070
 then if you are bent, that's what 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.570
 what happens when you see nothing that ends 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.220
 being flying to a place in the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.220
 stain where blood does not stain 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:30.860
 let's call me what my fool calls already 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.230

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.870
 guys is little to blame because curves 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.190
 lovely now in missing point 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.120
 of control for the end of the race as well 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.910
 that we have won three minutes of 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.950
 race and four more minutes proved more 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.250
