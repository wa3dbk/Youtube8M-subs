00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.020 

so<00:00:06.710> I<00:00:07.070> bought<00:00:07.430> this<00:00:07.809> Bessie<00:00:08.950> 3/4<00:00:09.950> inch<00:00:10.160> pipe

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
so I bought this Bessie 3/4 inch pipe

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.930 
so I bought this Bessie 3/4 inch pipe
clamp<00:00:11.450> online<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:12.799> I've<00:00:13.070> never<00:00:13.340> owned<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:13.760> pipe

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
clamp online and I've never owned a pipe

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.680 
clamp online and I've never owned a pipe
clamp<00:00:14.209> before<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.049> I'm<00:00:15.770> curious<00:00:16.480> how<00:00:17.480> this

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
clamp before so I'm curious how this

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.870 
clamp before so I'm curious how this
thing<00:00:17.930> goes<00:00:18.140> together<00:00:18.380> should<00:00:18.860> be<00:00:19.010> obviously

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
thing goes together should be obviously

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.990 
thing goes together should be obviously
very<00:00:20.210> easy<00:00:20.810> to<00:00:21.050> put<00:00:21.260> together<00:00:21.380> but<00:00:21.860> you<00:00:22.580> know<00:00:22.759> I

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
very easy to put together but you know I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.520 
very easy to put together but you know I
thought<00:00:23.269> I'd<00:00:23.480> record<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.310> unboxing<00:00:32.530> just

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
thought I'd record the unboxing just

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.500 
thought I'd record the unboxing just
like<00:00:33.680> a<00:00:33.710> kid<00:00:34.070> at<00:00:34.220> Christmas<00:00:40.180> what<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.210> liked

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
like a kid at Christmas what I liked

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.310 
like a kid at Christmas what I liked
about<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:42.050> pipe<00:00:42.350> lamp<00:00:42.740> is<00:00:43.570> these<00:00:44.570> feet<00:00:45.020> I

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
about this pipe lamp is these feet I

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.000 
about this pipe lamp is these feet I
thought<00:00:45.680> I'd<00:00:45.860> be<00:00:46.010> kind<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.400> nice<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:47.150> have<00:00:48.010> some

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
thought I'd be kind of nice to have some

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.150 
thought I'd be kind of nice to have some
with<00:00:49.190> some<00:00:49.420> longer<00:00:50.420> feet<00:00:50.720> that<00:00:51.050> it<00:00:51.320> can<00:00:51.590> stand

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
with some longer feet that it can stand

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.210 
with some longer feet that it can stand
on<00:00:52.370> its<00:00:52.580> own<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:53.030> little<00:00:53.330> bit<00:00:53.480> better<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.220> see

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
on its own a little bit better so see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.180 
on its own a little bit better so see
how<00:00:55.310> that<00:00:55.490> works<00:00:55.670> out<00:00:59.680> let's<00:01:00.680> see<00:01:00.860> if<00:01:00.950> it<00:01:01.040> has

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
how that works out let's see if it has

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:11.920 
how that works out let's see if it has
an<00:01:01.370> idiot's<00:01:01.700> guide<00:01:09.460> there<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.790> no<00:01:11.180> idiots

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
an idiot's guide there is no idiots

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.500 
an idiot's guide there is no idiots
guide<00:01:14.020> all<00:01:15.020> right<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:16.700> obviously<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.270> pipes

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
guide all right so obviously the pipes

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.840 
guide all right so obviously the pipes
going<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.810> go<00:01:17.930> in<00:01:18.110> for<00:01:18.770> threads<00:01:19.160> in<00:01:19.340> here<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:19.760> it

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
going to go in for threads in here so it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.100 
going to go in for threads in here so it
looks<00:01:20.000> like<00:01:20.150> we<00:01:20.270> need<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.480> have<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.660> threaded

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
looks like we need to have a threaded

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.500 
looks like we need to have a threaded
pipe<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:22.760> I'll<00:01:23.330> grab<00:01:23.540> one<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.900> those<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.510> put

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
pipe so I'll grab one of those and put

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:37.359 
pipe so I'll grab one of those and put
it<00:01:26.600> together

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.850 

that<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.549> exciting<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> picked<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that was exciting so I picked up this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.600 
that was exciting so I picked up this
pipe<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.430> local<00:01:42.240> hardware<00:01:42.600> store

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
pipe from local hardware store

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.499 
pipe from local hardware store
three-quarter<00:01:44.610> inch<00:01:46.880> let's<00:01:47.880> thread<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.390> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
three-quarter inch let's thread it on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.279 
three-quarter inch let's thread it on
the<00:01:48.659> end<00:01:52.820> let's<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.330> idiot-proof<00:01:54.720> this

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
the end let's see how idiot-proof this

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:25.350 
the end let's see how idiot-proof this
is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:42.280 

Wow<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:30.190> does<00:02:31.190> not<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.730> any<00:02:32.000> easier<00:02:41.290> there

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
Wow that does not get any easier there

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.880 
Wow that does not get any easier there
you<00:02:42.470> go<00:02:44.560> all<00:02:45.560> right<00:02:47.380> I'm<00:02:48.380> going<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.710> making

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
you go all right I'm going to be making

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.370 
you go all right I'm going to be making
some<00:02:49.280> cutting<00:02:49.610> boards<00:02:50.000> pretty<00:02:50.270> soon<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:51.050> these

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
some cutting boards pretty soon so these

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.740 
some cutting boards pretty soon so these
will<00:02:51.560> come<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.770> handy<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.459> did<00:02:53.030> buy<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.240> second

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
will come in handy I did buy a second

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.510 
will come in handy I did buy a second
pipe<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.320> I'll<00:02:54.470> have<00:02:54.650> two<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.040> these<00:02:55.160> short<00:02:57.520> all

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
pipe so I'll have two of these short all

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.490 
pipe so I'll have two of these short all
right<00:02:59.080> if<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.290> needed<00:03:00.500> help<00:03:00.650> with<00:03:02.500> assembling

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
right if you needed help with assembling

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.820 
right if you needed help with assembling
a<00:03:03.560> pipe<00:03:03.980> clamp<00:03:04.280> from<00:03:04.580> Bessie<00:03:05.080> yet<00:03:06.080> probably

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
a pipe clamp from Bessie yet probably

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.940 
a pipe clamp from Bessie yet probably
done<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.850> be<00:03:09.670> using<00:03:10.670> one<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:15.350> next<00:03:15.560> time<00:03:15.739> have
