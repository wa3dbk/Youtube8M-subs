pictures<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:07.420> know<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.690> we<00:04:07.810> haven't<00:04:07.990> seen

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
pictures you know that we haven't seen

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.220 
pictures you know that we haven't seen
before<00:04:09.270> when<00:04:10.270> it<00:04:10.360> comes<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> spider-man

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
before when it comes to the spider-man

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.990 
before when it comes to the spider-man
sets<00:04:11.590> we<00:04:11.740> might<00:04:11.920> also<00:04:12.100> be<00:04:12.340> getting<00:04:12.580> a<00:04:12.670> rhino

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
and I'm thinking that if we do it might

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.900 
and I'm thinking that if we do it might
be<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.130> big<00:04:16.430> fig<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.720> would<00:04:17.989> be<00:04:18.019> awesome
