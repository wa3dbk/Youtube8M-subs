00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello again I welcome you to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.329
 www braids and dotcom hairstyles today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.119
 let's make the uam to a braid 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:14.300
 different but we're also going to do the 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.600
 hairstyle is called the leaf 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.950
 and we are going to make a division to the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.500
 second that the second one is on top of 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.650
 the ear do not forget them and also 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.410
 let's make a division behind the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.660
 ear in this way 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.970
 we use the penilla so thin is not 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.480
 so 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.290
 like half moon here that we will stay 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 in this way and we take this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 tentatively 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.260
 okay 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.769
 and so let's do the other side 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.769
 as well 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.490
 how do we see this provisional 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.970
 do not forget to moisten the hair if 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.009
 they are left the division like this to the second and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.590
 then we make a half moon here okay 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.899
 moisten the hair and comb it if the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.330
 girl has a fringe cocoon we can only 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.420
 separate we separate them here and we take it 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.580
 also provisional 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.820
 ok this one we take the divisions 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.910
 now let's take a pigtail in this 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.430
 position is already in combined the hair 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.280
 moistened and we're going to catch it here 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 under ok it's not going to be here in the center 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 but here below 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.299
 because we proceed to if we place four 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.580
 Rubber bands and hand over 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.090
 we hold everything from the tail in this way 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.299
 although we will not let it go 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.359
 we put the rubbers we let go 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.880
 we go down and grab in this way ok 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.000
 behind the rubber to go 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.000
 adjusting 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.960
 and it's been like that 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.960
 [Music] 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.950
 ok we take a lock and we divide it into 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.110
 three parts first second and third the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.660
 first it goes below the second and by 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.020
 over the third here we are going to feed 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.050
 the first one here ok 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.530
 let's take a very thin food 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.860
 and we 're going to pass the first one goes by 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.680
 under the second but it does not go over 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.870
 of the third but we feed on this 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.739
 side 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 the third and here we start below 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.099
 of the second one and we feed the one on the side of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.190
 here is always going to be like this they feed 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.519
 the side ones on this side like this and 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.760
 happens below the second we feed 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.450
 the one here 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.220
 if this braid also goes up so that 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.230
 they are going to let go or go to 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.120
 get loose and the foods are 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.160
 thin 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.040
 and so 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.920
 successively we continue with this 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.650
 sequence until finishing the 3rd until the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.920
 tail do not forget that the braid 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.650
 have to go in this direction because if 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.320
 you are caught for this side the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.860
 braid is left twisted then it has 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.950
 to go in one direction ok and we 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.260
 it stays this way and when we finish 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.900
 here we are going to hold it with 2 bands 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.900
 in the queue that we already have 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.180
 it will be like this 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.870
 ok now let's do the guama let's go 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:18.100
 pick up a tuft quoted from up here of 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.389
 the pigtail has already been greased and now 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.410
 we have moistened and combed we take 3 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.520
 little pigs of this male and we started 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.520
 make the braid 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.440
 above the first above the 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.410
 second and below the third 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.780
 we are feeding by taking this part 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.330
 from here back 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.700
 and we feed 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.250
 we practice 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.910
 we are taking the million of the 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.910
 sides 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.540
 or let's tighten both 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.980
 because after 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.120
 we will stay 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:12.050
 very very tight here we are taking the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.050
 strands and all 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.630
 thin 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.200
 until we finish 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.470
 the last of the 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.920
 the last lock 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.870
 ok here we have finished and collect all 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.170
 The tufts in the braid are not 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.810
 I forgot that he goes up and that he 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:38.230
 Feeds with the sides we hold 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.500
 in this way here and then we are going to take 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.170
 with these tweezers 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:50.010
 for pearls let's take the braid 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:53.320
 from here and we are going to hold it here 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.550
 thus 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.550
 we have the clamp 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.999
 on this side 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.310
 and we're going to put the tip of the 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:22.810
 braid to this side here below the 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.810
 braid ok 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.129
 we hold it with a clamp 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.849
 thus 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:37.980
 and here we have the guama this is the 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:44.060
 water braid 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.060

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:02.900
 here we are going to use these pearls yes and 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:06.379
