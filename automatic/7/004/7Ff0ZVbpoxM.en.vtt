 hello to you artem for the last 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.210
 a day in the world of jailbreak many things happened 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.340
 interesting in this video I will try 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.670
 tell you about the most significant events 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.590
 and since you remember already more than a year in 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.529
 China, there are three groups of hackers 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.449
 jailbreak ios 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.949
 This team toy g which released 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.029
 hacking a couple of days ago 25 n p and pangu 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.730
 the evil that you did on my 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.160
 instructions possible thanks to the utility 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.430
 released group toy g 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.350
 however despite this last night 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.989
 group called 25p released 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.000
 her program for jailbreak she 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.120
 also available for windows and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.920
 works in a similar way 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.829
 toy g developers have already blamed 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 hackers from 25 to n that they 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 used their source code is true in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.489
 we are not particularly interested in this issue 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.590
 just mean that at the moment 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.799
 There are 2 programs that allow 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.700
 jailbreak with 83 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.530
 the next good news for everyone 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020
 jailbreak device owners 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.119
 is that the creator is sitting with auric 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.650
 finally updated your store tvikov 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.150
 for full compatibility with 83 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.680
 in order to install the update on 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.630
 your device only needs 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.150
 run sit and wait bye 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.430
 will update the list of available 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.350
 extensions if the update is not 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.689
 started automatically go to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.630
 change tab and press the button 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.159
 update the top left after that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.439
 how the search process will end 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.110
 you will see an available update for 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.970
 tweak sitting installer boldly updating it 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.430
 do respring or reboot 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.090
 devices and enjoy updated sit and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.350
 with support and with 83 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 developers from the 3g team 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.680
 released an updated tweak apple file 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.829
 can do it 2 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.200
 shortened and fc2 it is needed in order 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.509
 to the entire device file system 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.149
 was seen after jailbreak in any file 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.219
 moment to set this peak 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.770
 need to add new repositories 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.420
 sitting wait for the list update 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.050
 extensions from it and install 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.550
 appropriate supplement 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.170
 after pic ping device any 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.350
 the file manager will work fine 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.420
 dfg whips and device besides 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.820
 note that better file 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.930
 managers sitting ai file already supports 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.300
 and from 83 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.830
 unfortunately at the moment not all 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.910
 tweaks compatibility of this version 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.800
 operating system 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.980
 so you have to wait until the authors 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.180
 will complete their additions in order 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.160
 to better navigate 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.150
 quik-compatibility and enthusiasts in the network 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.280
 collected data on all extensions and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.660
 grouped them in a separate file 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.940
 I will place a link to this document under 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.470
 video and you can always go into it and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.280
 see current information about 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.720
 compatibility of one or another tvika 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.560
 pay attention not only to the column 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.200
 compatibility 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.420
 Well, on the notes column sometimes tweak 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.280
 compatible with with 83 but some of it 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 functions or most of the functionality 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.660
 unworkable and literally before 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.660
 the release of this video has appeared 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.730
 one great news updated a bit 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.130
 jailbreak module itself for compatibility with 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.650
 extensions for this are also necessary 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.830
 go in sitting wait until happen 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.269
 update extensions and update tweak 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.070
 after updating this add-on and 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.500
 device reboot part 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.970
 installed extensions will start working 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.850
 except in the system parameters 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.500
 tweaks settings will appear as you see 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.500
 at the moment on my device already 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.650
 earned expansion flew base and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.230
 slip control center moreover tweak 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.150
 changing the screen resolution on with 83 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.459
 works better than previous versions 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.049
 operating system 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.290
 earlier when trying to set the resolution 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.750
 from iphone 6 plus to iphone 5 or 5s 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.810
 we saw artifacts in the corners of the screen 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.370
 now this does not happen offer 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.739
 you in the comments to write what account 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.110
 see you tried on the NPP 83 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.540
 and make sure they work either 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.430
 inoperability is not all 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.079
 forget to share your opinions and 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.299
