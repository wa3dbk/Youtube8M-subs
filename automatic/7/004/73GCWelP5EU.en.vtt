this<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.470> definitely<00:00:07.950> not<00:00:08.370> what<00:00:08.970> any<00:00:09.090> septic

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
this is definitely not what any septic

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.320 
this is definitely not what any septic
system<00:00:09.929> owner<00:00:10.110> wants<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.710> see<00:00:11.120> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
system owner wants to see this is a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.680 
system owner wants to see this is a
failed<00:00:12.750> septic<00:00:13.200> system<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.389> I'm<00:00:15.389> going<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
failed septic system and I'm going to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.130 
failed septic system and I'm going to
show<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:15.990> how<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> solve<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.130> problem

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
show you how I solve this problem

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.630 
show you how I solve this problem
the<00:00:19.140> reason<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.500> failed<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.980> because<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the reason it's failed is because the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.550 
the reason it's failed is because the
perforated<00:00:21.240> pipes<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> Weeping

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
perforated pipes out here in the Weeping

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.859 
perforated pipes out here in the Weeping
bed<00:00:22.769> became<00:00:23.430> plugged<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.480> reason<00:00:24.750> it's

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
bed became plugged and the reason it's

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.769 
bed became plugged and the reason it's
bubbling<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.529> because<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.400> an<00:00:26.519> attempt<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.150> made

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
bubbling is because of an attempt I made

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.160 
bubbling is because of an attempt I made
originally<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.130> add<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> bubbling<00:00:29.849> system<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
originally to add a bubbling system to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.580 
originally to add a bubbling system to
make<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> tank<00:00:31.679> aerobic<00:00:33.350> unfortunately<00:00:34.350> both

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
make the tank aerobic unfortunately both

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.660 
make the tank aerobic unfortunately both
sides<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> tank<00:00:35.880> still<00:00:36.570> remain<00:00:37.340> way<00:00:38.340> above

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
sides of the tank still remain way above

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.470 
sides of the tank still remain way above
their<00:00:38.940> normal<00:00:39.360> level<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:41.239> something<00:00:42.239> needs

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
their normal level and something needs

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.869 
their normal level and something needs
to<00:00:42.570> happen<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> story<00:00:44.100> about<00:00:44.160> what

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to happen so this is a story about what

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
to happen so this is a story about what
I<00:00:44.910> did<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.360> solve<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> problem<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> first

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
I did to solve the problem the first

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
I did to solve the problem the first
step<00:00:46.890> involves<00:00:47.579> having<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.030> tank<00:00:48.270> pumped<00:00:48.870> out

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
step involves having the tank pumped out

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139 
step involves having the tank pumped out
in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> usual<00:00:49.649> sort<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.610> both<00:00:50.879> have

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
in the usual sort of way so both have

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.510 
in the usual sort of way so both have
halves<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> tank<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.070> completely

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
halves of the tank will be completely

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
halves of the tank will be completely
empty<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.210> no<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.050> sewage<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.680> flow<00:00:55.860> out

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
empty and no more sewage will flow out

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670 
empty and no more sewage will flow out
into<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.399> Weeping<00:00:56.699> bed<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> Old

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
into the Weeping bed and this is the Old

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.049 
into the Weeping bed and this is the Old
Faithful<00:00:58.859> truck<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.489> makes<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> happen<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
Faithful truck that makes it happen the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.080 
Faithful truck that makes it happen the
process<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:04.220> involved<00:01:05.220> digging<00:01:05.820> down<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
process I use involved digging down to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.899 
process I use involved digging down to
find<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> ends<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.770> four<00:01:08.070> perforated

nozzle on the end of this hose is is
pretty<00:01:35.880> interesting<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:37.320> both<00:01:38.930> cleans<00:01:39.930> out

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pretty interesting it both cleans out

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.780 
pretty interesting it both cleans out
ahead<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> nozzle<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:43.009> shoots<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.250> Jets

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
ahead of the nozzle and shoots out Jets

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
ahead of the nozzle and shoots out Jets
of<00:01:44.939> water<00:01:45.210> behind<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> propel<00:01:46.409> itself

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
of water behind it to propel itself

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.330 
of water behind it to propel itself
inwards<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.200> push<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
inwards so you don't have to push it it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
inwards so you don't have to push it it
just<00:01:50.640> pulls<00:01:51.000> itself<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
just pulls itself in and here you can

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.450 
just pulls itself in and here you can
you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.829> last<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> cleaning

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you can see the last of the cleaning

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.910 
you can see the last of the cleaning
water<00:01:56.610> coming<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.180> I've<00:01:57.719> run<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.590> through<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
water coming out I've run this through a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.889 
water coming out I've run this through a
couple<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.369> times<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
couple of times so it's actually just

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.570 
couple of times so it's actually just
the<00:02:01.049> final<00:02:01.500> touch<00:02:02.340> right<00:02:02.670> now

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
the final touch right now

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.490 
the final touch right now
here<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.360> single<00:02:06.990> jet<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.470> water

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
here you can see a single jet of water

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.440 
here you can see a single jet of water
blasting<00:02:08.460> out<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> front<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.360> the

called a clog hog I found it online and
boy<00:02:21.060> did<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.300> work<00:02:21.540> well<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.470> whole<00:02:22.680> process

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
boy did it work well this whole process

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.620 
boy did it work well this whole process
would<00:02:23.520> not<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.880> succeeded<00:02:24.270> without<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
would not have succeeded without it the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.050 
would not have succeeded without it the
bottom<00:02:27.959> line<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:29.220> everything's<00:02:29.970> working

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
bottom line is that everything's working

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.190 
bottom line is that everything's working
really<00:02:30.510> well

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
really well

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.260 
really well
as<00:02:31.440> soon<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.950> septic<00:02:32.610> tank<00:02:32.850> filled<00:02:33.090> up

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
as soon as the septic tank filled up

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.160 
as soon as the septic tank filled up
again<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.980> reached<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.970> normal<00:02:36.330> level<00:02:36.660> at<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
again it reached the normal level at the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.680 
again it reached the normal level at the
bottom<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> outlet<00:02:38.100> pipe<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:39.420> been

bottom of the outlet pipe and it's been

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.010 
bottom of the outlet pipe and it's been
performing<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> new<00:02:41.610> system<00:02:42.030> for

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
performing just like a new system for

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.380 
performing just like a new system for
seven<00:02:43.530> months<00:02:43.680> now<00:02:43.980> even<00:02:44.910> though<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.209> more

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
seven months now even though it's more

bubbling here is because I have

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
which from everything I read will help
