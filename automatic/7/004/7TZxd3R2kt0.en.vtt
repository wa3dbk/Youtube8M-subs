00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400 

yeah<00:00:00.299> I<00:00:00.329> thought<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.719> did<00:00:00.750> play<00:00:00.989> pretty<00:00:01.199> good<00:00:01.290> I

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
yeah I thought we did play pretty good I

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.960 
yeah I thought we did play pretty good I
thought<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.740> you<00:00:02.129> know<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.370> first<00:00:02.550> period<00:00:02.790> we

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
thought the you know the first period we

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.340 
thought the you know the first period we
played<00:00:03.149> really<00:00:03.330> good<00:00:03.480> second<00:00:04.080> period<00:00:04.290> we

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
played really good second period we

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.599 
played really good second period we
didn't<00:00:04.529> get<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.650> lot<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.859> shots<00:00:05.100> but<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.430> thought

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
didn't get a lot of shots but I thought

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.770 
didn't get a lot of shots but I thought
we<00:00:05.730> played<00:00:05.879> not<00:00:06.089> bad<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:09.120> third<00:00:09.330> period<00:00:09.599> we

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
we played not bad the third period we

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.540 
we played not bad the third period we
had<00:00:09.900> good<00:00:10.110> chances<00:00:10.139> early<00:00:10.679> when<00:00:11.040> once<00:00:11.370> it

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
had good chances early when once it

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.400 
had good chances early when once it
scored<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> looked<00:00:12.120> like<00:00:12.269> my<00:00:12.840> mind<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.170> try<00:00:13.349> to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
scored it looked like my mind we try to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.959 
scored it looked like my mind we try to
open<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.889> tried<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> get<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.429> back<00:00:14.549> right<00:00:14.820> away

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
open we tried to get it back right away

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.609 
open we tried to get it back right away
we<00:00:15.360> probably<00:00:15.540> got<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> little<00:00:15.929> impatient<00:00:16.289> where

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
we probably got a little impatient where

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.460 
we probably got a little impatient where
we<00:00:16.710> didn't<00:00:16.949> need<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.810> by<00:00:18.810> getting<00:00:19.020> impatient

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
we didn't need to by getting impatient

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.109 
we didn't need to by getting impatient
we<00:00:19.710> gave<00:00:19.890> them<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> few<00:00:20.340> outnumbered<00:00:20.760> rushes

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
we gave them a few outnumbered rushes

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.259 
we gave them a few outnumbered rushes
that<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.539> didn't<00:00:21.779> hurt<00:00:21.930> us<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.439> but

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
that they didn't hurt us on it but

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.400 
that they didn't hurt us on it but
certainly<00:00:24.269> chances<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.840> didn't<00:00:25.050> need<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> give

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
certainly chances we didn't need to give

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620 
certainly chances we didn't need to give
him<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.039> think<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:27.210> opened<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
him so I think we just we opened up a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
him so I think we just we opened up a
little<00:00:27.840> too<00:00:27.930> much<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> start<00:00:28.800> in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
little too much there in the start in

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.520 
little too much there in the start in
the<00:00:29.039> middle<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> third<00:00:29.609> period<00:00:36.290> yeah<00:00:37.290> he

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the middle of the third period yeah he

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.990 
the middle of the third period yeah he
was<00:00:37.620> pretty<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
was pretty good you know I think that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.220 
was pretty good you know I think that
you<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> backline<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> good<00:00:43.050> line

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you know the backline was a good line

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.250 
you know the backline was a good line
like<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.850> we<00:00:44.850> knew<00:00:45.180> there<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> deep<00:00:45.690> team<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
like they we knew there a deep team and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.799 
like they we knew there a deep team and
they<00:00:46.350> had<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> lot<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.629> lot<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> different

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
they had a lot of a lot of different

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.450 
they had a lot of a lot of different
weapons<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.649> showed<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.250> game

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
weapons and they showed it in that game

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.240 
weapons and they showed it in that game
like<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.760> played<00:00:50.969> well<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> group<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.250> he

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
like they played well as a group and he

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:05.830 
like they played well as a group and he
was<00:00:53.399> good

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.300 

well<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.870> little<00:01:07.080> bits<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.380> especially<00:01:07.830> teams

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
well a little bits just especially teams

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.120 
well a little bits just especially teams
I<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.990> other<00:01:10.110> things<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.920> know

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I think the other things are you know

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.520 
I think the other things are you know
the<00:01:11.550> Horvat<00:01:11.880> line<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.300> playing<00:01:12.540> good<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the Horvat line was playing good you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
the Horvat line was playing good you
know<00:01:13.620> they<00:01:13.770> got<00:01:13.920> caught<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.370> last<00:01:14.640> one

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
know they got caught for the last one

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.920 
know they got caught for the last one
but<00:01:14.910> they<00:01:15.720> got<00:01:15.930> our<00:01:16.050> first<00:01:16.230> goal<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.900> I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
but they got our first goal you know I

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
but they got our first goal you know I
think<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.260> think<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.770> our<00:01:19.920> lines<00:01:20.100> are<00:01:20.400> playing

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
think I think all our lines are playing

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.520 
think I think all our lines are playing
pretty<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.050> play<00:01:22.229> our<00:01:22.260> best

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pretty good and I think we play our best

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
pretty good and I think we play our best
when<00:01:22.800> we<00:01:22.920> refresh<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.660> maybe<00:01:24.840> they

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
when we refresh you know maybe they

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.090 
when we refresh you know maybe they
should<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.290> had<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.410> couple<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.890> minutes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
should have had a couple more minutes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
should have had a couple more minutes
probably<00:01:26.430> wouldn't<00:01:27.090> hurt<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.420> there's<00:01:27.600> times

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
probably wouldn't hurt but there's times

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.870 
probably wouldn't hurt but there's times
during<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> year<00:01:28.229> where<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.700> those

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
during the year where they have those

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.460 
during the year where they have those
minutes<00:01:30.300> we<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.870> everything<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.260> great

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
minutes we want and everything was great

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.690 
minutes we want and everything was great
because<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:31.890> weren't<00:01:32.040> getting<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> minutes

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because they weren't getting the minutes

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.740 
because they weren't getting the minutes
and<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:36.090> feel<00:01:36.600> we

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and you know it's going to be we feel we

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
and you know it's going to be we feel we
got<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> play<00:01:37.110> hard<00:01:37.350> every<00:01:37.590> game<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.100> there's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
got to play hard every game and there's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.969 
got to play hard every game and there's
no<00:01:38.729> sense<00:01:38.970> burned<00:01:39.210> about<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.660> game<00:01:39.979> they're

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
no sense burned about one game they're

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.290 
no sense burned about one game they're
going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.160> be<00:01:41.250> fresh<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> next<00:01:42.000> game<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
going to be fresh for the next game and

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:51.330 
going to be fresh for the next game and
maybe<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.720> that'll<00:01:42.990> pay<00:01:43.110> off

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.020 

I<00:01:55.109> thought<00:01:56.109> he<00:01:56.200> played<00:01:56.320> real<00:01:56.590> well<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.909> know<00:01:58.000> I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
I thought he played real well you know I

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.499 
I thought he played real well you know I
mentioned<00:01:58.420> they<00:01:58.479> got<00:01:58.630> our<00:01:58.750> first<00:01:58.929> one<00:01:59.259> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
mentioned they got our first one I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.880 
mentioned they got our first one I
thought<00:02:01.509> he<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.929> thought<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.409> line<00:02:02.619> played

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
thought he I thought that line played

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.440 
thought he I thought that line played
hard<00:02:03.130> throughout<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.549> thought<00:02:03.850> they<00:02:04.000> generated

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
hard throughout I thought they generated

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.770 
hard throughout I thought they generated
for<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:06.189> hopefully<00:02:06.520> for<00:02:06.880> us<00:02:06.969> he<00:02:07.149> even<00:02:07.600> gets

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
for so and hopefully for us he even gets

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.690 
for so and hopefully for us he even gets
better<00:02:08.019> but<00:02:08.229> but<00:02:08.560> he<00:02:08.649> played<00:02:08.890> good<00:02:09.099> he<00:02:09.310> was<00:02:09.489> you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
better but but he played good he was you

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:18.120 
better but but he played good he was you
know<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:09.940> whole<00:02:10.090> line<00:02:10.360> was<00:02:10.539> good<00:02:10.720> last<00:02:10.899> night

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.130 

no<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.060> look<00:02:19.420> at<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.630> guys<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.110> other

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
no you look at the guys on the other

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140 
no you look at the guys on the other
side<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:21.130> know<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.460> flames<00:02:21.670> up<00:02:21.850> some<00:02:22.000> young

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
side you know the flames up some young

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.490 
side you know the flames up some young
guys<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.660> are<00:02:22.750> stepping<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.320> playing

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.750 
guys to that are stepping in and playing
hard<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.400> way<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
hard I just think that's the way of the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.340 
hard I just think that's the way of the
new<00:02:27.940> players<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.390> young<00:02:28.630> players<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.170> they're

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
new players a young players like they're

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.170 
new players a young players like they're
they're<00:02:29.770> confident<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.400> their<00:02:30.520> ability<00:02:30.970> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
they're confident in their ability and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.460 
they're confident in their ability and
they<00:02:31.330> feel<00:02:31.570> they<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.810> come<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.200> play<00:02:32.350> and

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
they feel they can come in and play and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.950 
they feel they can come in and play and
not<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.970> heat<00:02:33.970> up<00:02:34.000> ice<00:02:34.270> time<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:34.720> they<00:02:34.810> can

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
not just heat up ice time but they can

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.390 
not just heat up ice time but they can
make<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> difference<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.310> way

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
make a difference and that's the way

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.610 
make a difference and that's the way
they<00:02:36.550> play<00:02:36.790> but<00:02:37.750> Willie<00:02:37.990> you've<00:02:38.170> got<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.380> new

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
team and they've written their own story

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.090 
team and they've written their own story
this<00:02:40.360> year<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:40.990> been<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.380> while<00:02:41.710> since

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
this year but it's been a while since

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.460 
this year but it's been a while since
that<00:02:42.760> core<00:02:43.120> group<00:02:43.150> has<00:02:43.510> had<00:02:43.660> success<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
that core group has had success in the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.650 
that core group has had success in the
playoff<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.250> how<00:02:45.700> do<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.910> stop<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.420> from

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
playoff so how do you stop that from

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.300 
playoff so how do you stop that from
creeping<00:02:47.140> into<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.530> game<00:02:47.710> how<00:02:47.920> do<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.070> stop

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
creeping into the game how do you stop

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.270 
creeping into the game how do you stop
that<00:02:48.550> from<00:02:48.760> taking<00:02:49.180> over<00:02:49.300> in<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.600> locker<00:02:49.870> room

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
that from taking over in the locker room

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.490 
that from taking over in the locker room
yeah<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.730> think<00:02:52.480> that's<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.750> past<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.380> this

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
yeah I think that's the past and this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.870 
yeah I think that's the past and this
donor<00:02:53.830> year<00:02:54.070> we're<00:02:54.220> worried<00:02:54.460> about<00:02:54.490> is<00:02:54.640> this

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
donor year we're worried about is this

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.350 
donor year we're worried about is this
year<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.960> don't<00:02:56.170> think<00:02:56.380> we're<00:02:57.210> focused<00:02:58.210> on

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
year and I don't think we're focused on

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.870 
year and I don't think we're focused on
that<00:02:58.540> at<00:02:58.720> all<00:02:58.840> i<00:02:58.900> think<00:02:59.050> our<00:02:59.380> focuses<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
that at all i think our focuses is the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.080 
that at all i think our focuses is the
flames<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:03.040> knew<00:03:03.220> it'd<00:03:03.370> be<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.520> tough

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
flames and and we knew it'd be a tough

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.150 
flames and and we knew it'd be a tough
game<00:03:04.300> like<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:04.570> not<00:03:04.870> like<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.680> easiest<00:03:05.950> game

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
game like it's not like the easiest game

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.200 
game like it's not like the easiest game
to<00:03:06.370> steal<00:03:06.580> in<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.760> series<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.210> game<00:03:07.390> one<00:03:09.210> you

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
to steal in the series is game one you

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.360 
to steal in the series is game one you
know<00:03:10.300> all<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.110> games<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:11.500> been<00:03:11.650> closed<00:03:11.950> like

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
know all the games have been closed like

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.770 
know all the games have been closed like
their<00:03:12.550> ball<00:03:12.730> being<00:03:12.910> basically<00:03:13.330> one<00:03:13.570> goal<00:03:13.750> game

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
their ball being basically one goal game

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.590 
their ball being basically one goal game
so<00:03:14.490> why<00:03:15.490> would<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.970> know<00:03:16.150> we<00:03:16.300> wouldn't<00:03:16.510> expect

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
so why would you know we wouldn't expect

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.420 
so why would you know we wouldn't expect
anything<00:03:16.990> different<00:03:17.170> they<00:03:17.860> beat<00:03:18.040> us<00:03:18.130> at<00:03:18.280> home

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
anything different they beat us at home

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.210 
anything different they beat us at home
before<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.350> it's<00:03:20.350> not<00:03:20.500> something<00:03:20.680> we<00:03:20.890> wanted

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
before so it's not something we wanted

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.220 
before so it's not something we wanted
it's<00:03:21.400> not<00:03:21.520> something<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.450> know<00:03:22.570> we<00:03:22.750> we

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
it's not something that you know we we

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.920 
it's not something that you know we we
felt<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:23.710> you<00:03:24.190> know<00:03:24.280> they're<00:03:24.460> good<00:03:24.670> team<00:03:24.930> with

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
felt but you know they're good team with

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.050 
felt but you know they're good team with
so<00:03:26.200> many<00:03:26.380> veteran<00:03:26.890> players<00:03:27.130> why<00:03:27.640> do<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.940> think

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
so many veteran players why do you think

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
so many veteran players why do you think
your<00:03:28.270> team<00:03:28.860> lost<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:30.160> little<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.460> its

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
your team lost a little of its

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.110 
your team lost a little of its
positional<00:03:32.080> composure<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.520> last<00:03:33.730> ten

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
positional composure in the last ten

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000 
positional composure in the last ten
minutes<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.660> mean<00:03:34.810> for<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> group<00:03:35.500> that's<00:03:35.680> kind

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
minutes I mean for a group that's kind

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.190 
minutes I mean for a group that's kind
of<00:03:36.070> been<00:03:36.250> there<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.580> done<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:37.050> should<00:03:38.050> they

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
of been there and done that should they

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.810 
of been there and done that should they
have<00:03:38.230> had<00:03:38.440> more<00:03:38.620> composure<00:03:39.040> that's<00:03:39.670> because

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
have had more composure that's because

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.700 
have had more composure that's because
you<00:03:39.940> really<00:03:40.180> wanted<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.450> win<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:41.320> know<00:03:41.440> when

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
it it's a great sign that when something
