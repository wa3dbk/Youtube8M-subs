00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.389
 1 1 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 I tried to work on white 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.140
 rims on endurance with a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.609
 sequence of moves that will be slow 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.350
 which is good with stamina in fact 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.439
 is that I can mix with a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 doubling cases of coordination the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.720
 coordination will serve those who are 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.759
 checked not only for sports 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 competition fight but also 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.760
 personalized coaching for people 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.440
 who would be for example people 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 of elderly who suffer from 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.579
 neurodegenerative diseases or who 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 may have symptoms of the type 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.710
 memory loss and highlighting we're going 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.480
 develop without working a little bit of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.199
 memory of coordination and that's fine 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.059
 to retain customers because 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.840
 we are coach does not have the particular taste of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.880
 mona lisa 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.530
 I gave sequence to enter and 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.130
 sites often in the durance at each 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.290
 once I'm going to give the name of the shot 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.170
 he will add to them what we will have 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.170
 already seen previously which I put four 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:29.229
 doubled ya the box after we are we are 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.130
 little by little each time we have 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.540
 added a cost that will allow no 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.770
 only to develop endurance but 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.710
 also to develop its ability to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.390
 retain the ability to memorize 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.800
 concatenations we can go that can 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.289
 continue to infinitely a game for 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:53.910
 start here with double tap car 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.910
 behind the left hook could believe 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.920
 so this is the little little thing 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.690
 detail that will also allow my 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.209
 colleagues to be able to correct students 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.840
 on it he chained his bus withdrawal 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.580
 he put the right he has a cool without 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.310
 change its distance we are not good 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.510
 distance it's just not possible that the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.870
 endangers you because you can 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.310
 advance too indecisive exposes world 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.050
 would have been they make me a little 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.360
 not chased forward to lead him to 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.310
 meanings here I am at ten years two months 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.280
 in fact have not hunted I'm saying 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.050
 a lot so that's right here and 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.840
 the water 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.070
 we are at a good distance so if 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.260
 you have a student who makes this mistake 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.580
 there recorrigÃ© to reposition the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.650
 distance so that one is 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.940
 really adjusted by 10 years and the shot 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.950
 endurance 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.930
 we can develop it like that on two 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.860
 ways according to what we want 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.850
 no, and that's for sure I decided to 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.550
 working at an opponent who 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.080
 should be aggressive because his am 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.880
 a boxer who should be aggressive 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:13.770
 because we have bad money when 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:15.990
 she advances on the beginning of the audience 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.720
 ok then he can decide to lengthen 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.460
 the trident endurance 2 I'm going to do that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.790
 you I find the videos that is this 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.790
 who is blocking 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.840
 it can be that to me I'm always a 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.740
 continuity several shots members 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.470
 inferior who consume a lot 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.970
 of energy from left to right 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.890
 the more the sequence of you who has it 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.680
 sent is a long time it is tiring 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.930
 to make a block of several 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.540
 concatenations of what we saw here by 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.920
 example I will ask to do your 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.959
 blue choices that right inside 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.880
 left the pcf we saw it previously 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:00.989
 but then we walk i miss you left 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.160
 right is pretty left hook we are 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.720
 pushes to make a long water that goes 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.260
 allow us to really go to 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.819
 the exhaustion of energies and consulates 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.469
 fault 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.889
 to these practices and that we really 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.420
 peace phase m pma power 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.870
 maximum aerobic tank before having 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.079
 or found on big 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:30.289
 sequences of 1 1mg is sick fighting 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:31.910
 So here I am going to leave it stupid 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.860
 done because I'm going to be combined here 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:05:02.979
 it's a number we've had to 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:05:02.979
 patiently we will make the bread 1 3 2 3 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.180
 these are phases that can 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.590
 be combined which is in good standing 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.190
 endurance and all that we have seen 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.960
 previously 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.370
 I am sequences of speed or 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.470
 sentence launches just 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.270
 combine them several times either 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.550
 average intensity to dry 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.830
 the fundamental stamina is sure to 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.870
 the intensity very very hard for with everything 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.159
 gently towards the pma and then towards the 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.639
 phases actually that are the hardest 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.639
 endurance 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.199
 but
