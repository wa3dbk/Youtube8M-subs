00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
might help dab a little bit of residue

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.070 
might help dab a little bit of residue
from<00:03:07.610> oil<00:03:07.849> in<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.390> slip<00:03:08.599> these<00:03:08.720> on<00:03:08.900> here

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
at this little copper washer it's a

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.449 
at this little copper washer it's a
crush<00:03:40.810> washer<00:03:41.170> there's<00:03:41.770> a<00:03:41.860> little<00:03:42.099> Ridge<00:03:42.250> in

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
crush washer there's a little Ridge in

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.510 
crush washer there's a little Ridge in
there<00:03:42.640> make<00:03:43.000> sure<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.890> ridge<00:03:44.890> itself<00:03:45.250> is

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
there make sure that the ridge itself is

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.550 
there make sure that the ridge itself is
facing<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.239> injector<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.959> female<00:03:47.319> part
