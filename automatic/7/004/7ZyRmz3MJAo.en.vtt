00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.239
 when choosing a liquid crystal 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:11.089
 tv 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:12.789
 first of all it is necessary to decide on 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.329
 screen size 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.470
 if you buy a TV in the kitchen 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.390
 in order to enjoy 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.779
 tv shows during breakfast or 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.109
 cooking should be limited 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.529
 size 15 20 inches diagonally 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.249
 for home theater costs 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.899
 choose a small bigger but again 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:29.720
 still 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.840
 based on the size of the room 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.270
 optimal distance for 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 viewer is 3 4 diagonals 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.030
 further determine the image format 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.000
 there are two of them 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.950
 four extreme and 16 children is the ratio 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.610
 screen sides 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.200
 television broadcasts format 4 to three 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.879
 while to view 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.030
 movies endowed will be perfect 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.010
 widescreen tv 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.940
 sixteen by 9 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 so how do I want to watch both 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.410
 you say 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.690
 don't be afraid of stretching problem 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.570
 image distortion manufacturers 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.020
 solved long ago 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.490
 all TVs are now equipped with auto function 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.710
 formatting 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.670
 but it's best seen how she is 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.460
 It works exactly widescreen 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.340
 TVs 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.920
 in this case, the center of the picture remains 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.540
 unchanged will be confused only 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 small areas on the sides of the screen 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.100
 in the end you can watch 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.150
 TV shows without any visible 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.410
 distortion 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.750
 the next important factor is resolution 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.610
 screen 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.310
 the higher the resolution the more monolithic 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.110
 the picture will turn out 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.850
 however, remember that with 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.890
 watching television 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.540
 programs may occur small 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 Problems 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.560
 This is due to the fact that the resolution 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.640
 most televisions 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.720
 far superior 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.880
 television permission 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.810
 signal 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.470
 and to match the picture 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.540
 screen resolution touched being taken 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.030
 video image processor 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.579
 at the same time may occur 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.579
 small loss distortion artifacts 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.080
 clarity 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.970
 we recommend buying a tv 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.180
 leading manufacturers 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.690
 which is very serious 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.000
 production of such processors and often 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 give their name sylvinite and television 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.160
 the next parameter is the response time 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.259
 matrices 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.209
 measured in insects 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.389
 than this time to start the more even 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.959
 smoothly you get the picture and vice versa 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.120
 for example you are watching a broadcast 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.289
 football or tennis match 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.629
 when flying the ball on the TV screen with 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.129
 response time more than fifty 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.989
 most likely you will be able to watch so 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.949
 called comet tail phenomenon 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.089
 today there are models 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.829
 words with just one click 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:35.909
 millisecond 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.389
 the truth and the price tag of such models can not be called 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.569
 humane 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.379
 in our opinion, would be the best 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.649
 order responses in two three seconds seeing 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.969
 couple of words about brightness and contrast 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.559
 minimum brightness value below which 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.479
 do not miss sipri you will 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.809
 the minister is 450 scandal per square 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:55.759
 meter 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.969
 this is the value at which the scan in 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.449
 brightly lit room will 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.579
 comfortable 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.609
 today all manufacturers already 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.569
 stepped over this bar 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.339
 and choose a TV with a brightness value 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.319
 above four hundred and fifty channel on 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.029
 square meter will be pretty easy 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.809
 now and contrast 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.069
 the manufacturer can specify 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.209
 Contrast both static and 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.539
 dynamic 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.219
 the difference between these two concepts can 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:22.919
 reach dozens of times 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.029
 for example the same tv 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:26.789
 static contrast can 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.659
 be thousands to one and dynamic 20 thousand 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.749
 teams 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.379
 we recommend turning your 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.339
 attention when choosing a TV exactly 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.599
 static readings 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.889
 contrast 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.179
 further we will talk and in the interface 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:41.019
 When buying a TV, you will see 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.019
 that the inputs of the outputs are sufficient 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:43.919
 quantity 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.849
 this will allow you to connect it 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.220
 multiple sources simultaneously 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.050
 turn tv entertaining 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.979
 Centre 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.089
 implications for choosing the right input 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.419
 all you need is a remote 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.479
 remote control 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.569
 perhaps worth mentioning a 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.059
 additional features that 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.759
 manufacturers equip TV 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.369
 this is an internet connection 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.399
 computer connection card reader 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.999
 or fm tuner 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.219
 everything is strictly personal manufacturers 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.059
 offer a huge variety of solutions and 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.929
 which ones need be called 

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:17.849
 must decide in Islam 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.440
 we hope that our gate 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.300
 will help you with the choice
