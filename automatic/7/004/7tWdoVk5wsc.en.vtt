00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.609
 there in Normandy an extended department 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.680
 out of five countries where each one offers a landscape 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.630
 good to him for this new ride 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.340
 follow me for an acrobatic tour 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.430
 and bucolic that promises us beautiful 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.430
 met 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.610
 2 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 oh no we settled on 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.370
 a platform we are sure in the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.710
 adventure park in the rock either on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 the arrageois a floor class and yes we 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.000
 had to take a lot of commitment 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 from the Ministry of Ecology to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.659
 the time being able to give some 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.040
 number of guarantees on the respect of 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.110
 nature of the environment and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.850
 daily how does it go then 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.320
 every year we have a forestry expert 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 who's going to check the status of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.030
 trees give us some advice and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.800
 prerogatives and us every day at 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.220
 everyday we are here to maintain the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.649
 site is managed the trees one is open 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.479
 from easter to all saints and after there 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.310
 a lot of site maintenance work 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.220
 and then it's all the management of the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.229
 communication and staff to make a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.310
 coast of agreement in terms of the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 park public 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.619
 you how old you rather 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.300
 young people rather adults we take the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.130
 children from 5 years and after 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.869
 there is no age limit of agreement and we 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.819
 going to see all types of public the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.039
 young people from families who come from friends 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.259
 school business enormously 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.590
 and aerated centers also agree and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.569
 so with the family the children the carpet 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.890
 the world manic everyone can 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.840
 come on grandparents if they want 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.099
 climb climb if he prefers to stay 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.700
 wisely on the ground to accompany their 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.700
 children they can also 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.350
 you have a particularity I believe 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.010
 at home on the adventure park it's 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.510
 so explain me 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.210
 this year we made the choice 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.740
 to invest in security yet another 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.620
 little more critics and others 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.610
 years so we each system onj 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.470
 with two carabiners that are connected 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.180
 between them and that prevents from landing 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.130
 both at the same time if we have one of 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.420
 tasks and the other will never be able to 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.620
 picks up and only at the end of 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.150
 course we will manage to remove the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.740
 two carabiners we are the only ones 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.390
 low normandie for now to have 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.050
 this system for the little ones we have a 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.510
 other system 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.130
 it's a simple hook and suddenly 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.500
 children do not have to manipulate the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.820
 carabiner so they are tied all 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.430
 throughout the activity we call that 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.660
 lines of life goes on I guess that's it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.940
 reassures parents too 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.020
 it reassures the parents and that does not prevent 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.470
 no kids having fun with us 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.580
 keep on going 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.580
 yes, it's gone 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.450
 / 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.930
 if we are in a green setting 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.180
 with this beautiful sun 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.700
 you are a paradise here not everything to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.330
 do 11th time you're here it's a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.370
 decade 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.730
 knowing that it took us six years 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.900
 restore all the buildings 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.600
 who is around us you are you 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.060
 launched in a great madness to renovate 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.340
 all that we invested ourselves totally in 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.170
 the restoration of these buildings which is 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.670
 fell into ruin when we took them yes 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.519
 it was really a madness actually 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.290
 to buy all and all this together we have 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.360
 eight buildings in total that are 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.220
 eighteenth century in mud and 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.940
 timbered there I believe you have 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.970
 really a specificity is the side 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.920
 very very natural nature of everything 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.519
 that you have undertaken here including the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.230
 renovation 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.790
 we wanted to keep of course 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.890
 the authenticity of the buildings so we have 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.919
 learned to remake mud we kept 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.720
 local materials 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.090
 we redid everything how old 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.900
 you have housing hits in December 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.580
 so we have eight buildings in total 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.970
 including a bread oven 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.300
 our house and then also three 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.030
 gÃ®tes, one of which is accessible to people 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.460
 reduced mobility and four bedrooms 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.740
 one of which also accessible 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.060
 to people in wheelchairs say 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.949
 I would like to take a little tour 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.849
 we go there bye bye with pleasure it's 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.849
 party is gone 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.720
 so our clientele is pretty 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.390
 diversified come because people 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.570
 who come in the adorn 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.700
 come mostly to nature for the 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.060
 preserved landscapes of which many 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.650
 hikers a lot of people from 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.890
