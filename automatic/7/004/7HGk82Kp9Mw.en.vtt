see<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> day<00:00:20.490> here<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.510> Nick<00:00:21.750> tell<00:00:22.260> me

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
see the day here we are Nick tell me

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.050 
see the day here we are Nick tell me
exactly<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.980> works<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.029> is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
exactly how this works so this is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.670 
exactly how this works so this is
actually<00:00:24.420> using<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.779> single<00:00:25.289> camera<00:00:25.439> that's

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
actually using a single camera that's

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.900 
actually using a single camera that's
mounted<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.039> steering<00:00:26.369> wheel<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> it's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
mounted in the steering wheel and it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.160 
mounted in the steering wheel and it's
performing<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> lot<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.420> image<00:00:27.660> processing<00:00:27.689> on

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
performing a lot of image processing on

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.839 
performing a lot of image processing on
the<00:00:28.230> face<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> eye<00:00:28.680> region<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.609> driver

the face in the eye region of the driver

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.400 
the face in the eye region of the driver
and<00:00:30.150> we're<00:00:30.510> looking<00:00:30.599> exactly<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.380> what

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
and we're looking exactly at what

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.450 
and we're looking exactly at what
they're<00:00:31.710> looking<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.340> they're

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
they're looking at and what they're

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.680 
they're looking at and what they're
paying<00:00:32.610> attention<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.329> we're<00:00:33.450> looking<00:00:33.510> at

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
paying attention to so we're looking at

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840 
paying attention to so we're looking at
fatigue<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.230> well<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.559> distraction<00:00:35.130> you're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
fatigue as well as distraction you're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.920 
fatigue as well as distraction you're
actually<00:00:36.000> working<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> number<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
actually working with a number of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.690 
actually working with a number of
automotive<00:00:37.680> leaders<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.219> integrate<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
technology so it's not too far off it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350 
technology so it's not too far off it
sounds<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.129> Jetsons<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.180> actually

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
sounds very Jetsons but it's actually

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630 
sounds very Jetsons but it's actually
robles<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:43.469> well<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.219> gonna<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.520> here
