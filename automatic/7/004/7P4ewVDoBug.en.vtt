00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
simple code it's only quite long because

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.310 
simple code it's only quite long because
oops<00:03:39.380> because<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.890> color<00:03:41.220> venues<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.320> so

a random value I'm sorry
with<00:04:57.720> helpfu<00:04:58.140> turn<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.500> code<00:04:58.740> off<00:04:58.919> first<00:04:59.460> I'm

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
with helpfu turn the code off first I'm

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.060 
with helpfu turn the code off first I'm
Russian<00:05:00.150> as<00:05:00.270> usual<00:05:00.750> turn<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.350> code<00:05:01.590> off<00:05:01.740> first

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
Russian as usual turn the code off first

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.280 
Russian as usual turn the code off first
then<00:05:02.430> change<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.540> random<00:05:03.720> friendly

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
then change it to a random friendly

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.250 
then change it to a random friendly
saying<00:05:04.830> oh<00:05:05.040> he's<00:05:05.820> got<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.090> bit<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.390> sky<00:05:06.660> yes<00:05:07.080> if

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
saying oh he's got a bit of a sky yes if

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.070 
saying oh he's got a bit of a sky yes if
you<00:05:07.350> haven't<00:05:07.590> realized<00:05:08.130> it<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.600> textures

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
you haven't realized it and the textures

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.350 
you haven't realized it and the textures
are<00:05:10.229> all<00:05:10.410> square<00:05:10.919> but<00:05:11.130> through<00:05:11.360> transparency

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
are all square but through transparency

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.610 
are all square but through transparency
we<00:05:12.540> can<00:05:12.690> do<00:05:12.870> round<00:05:13.320> these<00:05:14.870> textures<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.350> yes

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
we can do round these textures but yes

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.920 
we can do round these textures but yes
way

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
way

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.560 
way
so<00:05:18.930> two<00:05:19.350> halves<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:19.800> make<00:05:20.010> up<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.400> BA<00:05:20.580> BOM<00:05:20.820> King

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
so two halves that make up a BA BOM King

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.940 
so two halves that make up a BA BOM King
ba<00:05:21.780> BOM<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.289> there

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
ba BOM and there

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.580 
ba BOM and there
and<00:05:23.370> then<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.670> color<00:05:24.080> values<00:05:25.080> will<00:05:25.260> just<00:05:25.410> go

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
and then the color values will just go

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.100 
and then the color values will just go
too<00:05:25.650> quickly<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:27.090> this<00:05:27.270> is<00:05:27.330> funny<00:05:27.750> she's

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
too quickly and this is funny she's

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.090 
too quickly and this is funny she's

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
Korean citizens the kind of value

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.080 
Korean citizens the kind of value
the<00:05:35.220> first<00:05:35.490> color<00:05:35.820> value<00:05:36.330> spells<00:05:36.690> at<00:05:36.930> dated<00:05:37.470> 23

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
the first color value spells at dated 23

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.670 
the first color value spells at dated 23

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
coincidences but for that was here we go

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.470 
coincidences but for that was here we go
and<00:05:48.590> know<00:05:49.590> this<00:05:49.800> night<00:05:50.040> its<00:05:50.700> beasts<00:05:51.060> you<00:05:51.360> know

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
and know this night its beasts you know

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.070 
and know this night its beasts you know
yep<00:05:51.750> there<00:05:51.960> we<00:05:52.080> are

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
yep there we are

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.220 
yep there we are
gotcha

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
gotcha

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.040 
gotcha
and<00:05:55.320> so<00:05:56.250> it's<00:05:56.640> rate<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:57.930> I<00:05:58.200> did<00:05:58.530> 8<00:05:58.740> 0<00:05:59.370> 0<00:05:59.520> 0<00:06:00.120> 0<00:06:00.210> 0

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
and so it's rate so I did 8 0 0 0 0 0

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.770 
and so it's rate so I did 8 0 0 0 0 0
remember<00:06:01.530> it's<00:06:01.680> RGB<00:06:02.580> red<00:06:02.850> green<00:06:02.910> blue<00:06:03.480> just

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
remember it's RGB red green blue just

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.500 
remember it's RGB red green blue just
get<00:06:03.990> out<00:06:04.050> pain<00:06:04.440> or<00:06:04.710> soften<00:06:05.160> Kingdom<00:06:05.670> you<00:06:06.300> can

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
get out pain or soften Kingdom you can

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.270 
get out pain or soften Kingdom you can
play<00:06:06.870> around<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.380> the<00:06:07.500> values<00:06:07.890> we<00:06:08.040> have<00:06:08.160> to

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
play around to the values we have to

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.880 
play around to the values we have to
repeat<00:06:08.730> them<00:06:08.910> four<00:06:09.300> times<00:06:09.330> basically<00:06:10.230> for

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
repeat them four times basically for

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.760 
repeat them four times basically for
each<00:06:11.010> shoot<00:06:11.930> so<00:06:12.930> for<00:06:13.230> example<00:06:15.260> if<00:06:16.260> I<00:06:16.530> want<00:06:16.680> to

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
each shoot so for example if I want to

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.940 
each shoot so for example if I want to
do<00:06:17.040> green<00:06:17.700> I've<00:06:17.970> used<00:06:18.300> 8<00:06:18.480> 0<00:06:18.930> into<00:06:19.200> the<00:06:19.320> f0<00:06:19.890> so

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
do green I've used 8 0 into the f0 so

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.060 
do green I've used 8 0 into the f0 so
it's<00:06:20.130> sort<00:06:20.370> of<00:06:20.400> half<00:06:20.700> not<00:06:21.450> for<00:06:22.050> intensity<00:06:22.680> not

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
it's sort of half not for intensity not

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.210 
it's sort of half not for intensity not
too<00:06:23.280> bright

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
too bright

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.190 
too bright
there<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.370> go<00:06:26.550> that's<00:06:26.820> one<00:06:27.360> half<00:06:27.750> then<00:06:28.050> the

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
there you go that's one half then the

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.470 
there you go that's one half then the
other<00:06:28.650> half<00:06:28.950> because<00:06:29.610> you<00:06:29.790> might<00:06:30.120> like<00:06:30.300> them

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
other half because you might like them

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.880 
other half because you might like them
up<00:06:30.660> or<00:06:30.900> fetch<00:06:31.230> you<00:06:31.350> can't<00:06:31.500> do<00:06:31.560> that<00:06:31.710> if<00:06:31.800> you

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
up or fetch you can't do that if you

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.260 
up or fetch you can't do that if you
want<00:06:32.100> but<00:06:32.160> I<00:06:32.280> don't<00:06:32.430> think<00:06:32.640> it<00:06:32.730> works<00:06:32.910> on<00:06:33.090> them

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
want but I don't think it works on them

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.140 
want but I don't think it works on them
later<00:06:33.540> only<00:06:34.380> on<00:06:34.620> a<00:06:34.650> real<00:06:34.890> 164<00:06:35.670> but<00:06:35.820> somebody

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
later only on a real 164 but somebody

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.860 
later only on a real 164 but somebody
can<00:06:36.500> correct<00:06:37.500> me<00:06:37.920> that's<00:06:38.610> not<00:06:39.060> so<00:06:39.390> but<00:06:39.600> you<00:06:39.690> get

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
can correct me that's not so but you get

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.420 
can correct me that's not so but you get
some<00:06:40.020> cool<00:06:40.350> effects<00:06:42.440> by<00:06:43.440> combining<00:06:43.980> all<00:06:44.250> these
