 interesting that will help 16 to play 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.689
 same because it is very difficult the new 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 command had so much knowledge in the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 competitive I always said confuse 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.510
 the new classes things that are 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.940
 considered wrong among other things 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.940
 So I decided to make this request to you. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.969
 let me in the head and show my 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.059
 guys I have the three modes of 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.090
 competitive show that is your show destroys the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 niger brites likes to be called de 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.270
 Hero I use my bet is mine. 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.920
 of the game is to always avoid 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.800
 same attack but they do not limit the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.420
 frei local I front end grip 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.580
 what to prepare the marathon agility he 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.010
 was quite deadly in focus 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 the pecs essential to compete with the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.930
 Sns mortal that the designers focus on is that it is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.939
 the focus of the block to the two who watch it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 in training as a tomato I was there 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.890
 I like to avoid myself because it 's the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.810
 fire increases is after in marathon design 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 What project do you need to run? 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.000
 quite agility that is kind light 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.670
 white the option that there is a lot of speed 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.920
 this is my favorite to take the already the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:44.549
 You win my class to prove it on time. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.909
 for me it leaves to hear that I was one 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.380
 class to earn what 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.999
 I'm going to change her here that I prefer 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.310
 Now I do not know what God opened the place for 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:56.329
 increases the damage from afar I like one 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.359
 that they can fly in some 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.749
 situations at the time when for example the dog 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:05.179
 that I use to pull in the photograph 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:08.720
 so here is a sniper that twice 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.429
 to paraná 9 has every time and check in 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.410
 class is a different difficult situation 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.360
 you need to adapt your team 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.760
 this time and others at the time that the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.280
 term between them, here is a class 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.829
 of the profile with the rise and there at the time 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.200
 very good too but here is a class 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.269
 with two lenses that is the defense that 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.480
 usually used to check the pump is 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:34.810
 from here only a hundredth stan and then to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.910
 serie d people I'll show you 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.239
 domination i am object player 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.030
 so I just need to kill and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.260
 make space because I'm not tactical 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.260
 then brought him to help the team or the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.549
 tuxedo and drag you see you do not expect 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.970
 which are basically the same ownership is 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.850
 pattern 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.160
 the competitive has a standard type is 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.160
 you use what's outside your 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.580
 chances of winning there it decreases 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.760
 truth is then so my favorite 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.350
 she coordinates this process is equal to 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.770
 which is prepared agility marathon is 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.840
 stable and lasting drinking cocal issue 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.300
 I think the best about the game that 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.870
 has a good grid very good in tension 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.770
 bonbon the wounded singer 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.840
 here is the same thing just someone took 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.120
 with fire or extended puts a truce 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.709
 even for the end the team here is a dream 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.030
 some street situations 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.720
 Dominion I use for me is better than 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.970
 Cheers 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.370
 José does not have as much precision as a 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.390
 third when you're closing 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:54.930
 paulo and joão uzzum few situations is me 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:56.330
 I think I only use the zone in the case with 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.220
 two instances 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.920
 I'm here with two tanks of a network 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.050
 in certain situations that I am 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.850
 control of evil I just need to follow the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.380
 my flags 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.200
 from here I give a little bit different 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.519
 because I come the gringos playing 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.489
 reward almost because I found it very 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.160
 interesting is a prestige the action that 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.830
 it is because it carries me faster 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.580
 use is quite in the sex ong is very good 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:33.780
 It is this one in two deaths 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:38.130
 for me it 's like catching the flag of zeal 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.030
 in front is very good in two 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.380
 instances 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.770
 in certain situations very 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.190
 important here is the same thing only for 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:55.400
 premiere a vision 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:58.440
 now look at the team of cambridge if you look at 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.160
 1 and almost no lethal professional and 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.080
 tactic 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.000
 You need to get better but not better. 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.170
 because in ritz you have to finish the 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.570
 contract you need to control the 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.940
 the map and most of the time the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.460
 so what I 'd rather do put 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.760
 class where I kill him the most and do my 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.490
 paper only understands that with voice and each 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.400
 in the team has its role for example the 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.890
 day or the player the goal of our 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.680
 time he wears a tuxedo that 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.550
 class authorized by aesthetic accident is 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.800
 finishing the map I need I need 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.160
 make a quick bite then a type 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.430
 all their classes they must have 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.540
 determined hours understood why you 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.010
 can not simply pick up a 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.060
 same thing you need to play the 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.290
 head game 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.450
 understands and class an essential thing 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.770
 several people asked me then I found 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.520
 interesting to do this here people are 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.860
 that 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.930
 the classes to and another thing that a 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.150
 people asked me to show my 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.200
 anti-cut as is my nature 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.090
 this things 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:10.380
 I have a relationship of victory in victory 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:14.220
 and also defeats 0.8 because the game 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.200
 alone business goes for then admitted 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.430
 happened yesterday when he died where 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.980
 then yes a stampede is my 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.540
 playing time the 15 days easy because 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.950
 site with prestige in the race 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.210
 I really like playing bad is a 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.210
 something I miss 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.169
 People, I'm going to stay here. 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.419
 Thank you to whoever is signing up. 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.340

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.950
 I'm enjoying farhan do this 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.950
