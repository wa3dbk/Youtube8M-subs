00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.149
 Beyond the mornings that perfume the flowers and the last torments of a spring that 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.800
 is dying I know you I feel 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.730
 I'm not scared anymore 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.140
 Beyond moments when time has stopped 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.920
 when the colorless life is no longer pink or gray 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.180
 I know you I feel my heart is gray 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.860
 My angel I dreamed of you 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.050
 and strange you were near me 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:18.040
 Beyond lies and uncertain words beyond my dreams and my sorrowful dreams 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.689
 I know you I feel you and everything goes out 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:33.520
 Beyond the mysteries swept away by the wind when my soul is sincere and my breath 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.560
 in suspense I feel you and I know 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.270
 that you hear me 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.700
 My angel I dreamed of you 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.170
 and strange you were near me 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:02:07.009
 Beyond my tears beyond my laughter of your memory which always makes me suffer 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.730
 I know you I feel you in a sigh 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:26.920
 beyond the fog of useless thoughts beyond the insomnia of my fragile nights 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.269
 I know you I feel so well be it 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:44.299
 My angel I dreamed of you 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:54.400
 and strange you were near me
