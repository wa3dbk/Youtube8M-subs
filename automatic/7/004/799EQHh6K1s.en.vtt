00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.540
 Welcome to one more episode, the technician. 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.840
 ferreira and today I'm finally going to prove 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.520
 bar in bar in shock the former tab is beer 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 here from the bay though with a beer 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.220
 season is then a limited edition and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.530
 launched a couple of months ago 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.870
 and finally bolton to her I already fulfilled 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.060
 she was wrapping time to take 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.830
 because it is too big and I do not 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.570
 I wanted to take everything on my own so today. 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.720
 I finally got to take it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.090
 I'll only be able to take the rest of it. 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.120
 beer here is the name is Baden-baden 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.720
 chocolate drink a beer that face 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.730
 Do you already think of awady chocolate more? 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:03.210
 not if it was a beer is from another 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.700
 country has your Brazil maybe to her 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 I would go in with a chocolate cocoa straight 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.380
 in the recipe but this one as for being 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.509
 brazil that has a law that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.399
 prohibits you from brewing beer 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.390
 any ingredient that comes from source 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.820
 animal 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.249
 so honey is milk's kind things 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.200
 however if you can do it at home no 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.450
 can market but if you want 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 Try it if you can try it is beer that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.649
 miley shore is from jordan fields who 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 never been in the factory must know the 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.340
 factory is very cool you can taste 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.289
 beers there is the here see the chocolate 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.869
 But she will not roll like 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.319
 I explained to her her recipe is 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.319
 next they put cocoa in the boil 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.689
 and place vanilla in the 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.549
 maturity and as soon as we feel the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.939
 smell and a little bit of chocolate taste 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.369
 and so see the chocolate we go 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:06.000
 finally try and today I go 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:12.240
 eating chocolate is also nothing 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.800
 It's very special because beauty did little 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.020
 noise we already see that is not so much 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:30.440
 gas is not so much the carbon dioxide in 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:32.340
 beer and take your site to the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.820
 beautiful wonderful 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.570
 see how it is in beer light again 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.730
 the scoreboard 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.790
 we can not see the other 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.950
 side but a training but with a good 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.690
 I'm here we can already see that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.540
 even those dark beers in which the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.670
 People do not take it, we do not end it. 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.690
 drinking very cold water more or less 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.130
 in six to eight degrees or more was 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.350
 so you can see that it also goes 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.250
 keep will not get to be more than 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.080
 that's right 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.540
 because of the foam a brownish 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.940
 smell is very much chocolate even is 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.280
 I think it's a chocolate problem that the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.630
 instrument that actually smells is a 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.810
 chocolate 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:21.799
 in fact feel very yummy 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.160
 chocolate milk is like chocolate 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:29.480
 true, yes, very good, very good 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.480
 Try French 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.220
 our hot you end up picking up the 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.769
 sentence a chocolate beer, right? 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.519
 So you think, this is our turn. 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.610
 and pure sweet but so she has you feel 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.739
 quite like bitter mourning things 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.900
 of this kind that you end up always picking up 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.760
 the candy but it tastes like chocolate 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.299
 so it seems that the mouth is 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.269
 Spread chocolate as if you had 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:07.970
 eat a bonbon with liquor and you finish 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.040
 only by ingesting color first and 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.859
 chocolate is in the rest of the mouth not 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.780
 It seems we will try to go 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.780
 direct harmonize first test in 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.680
 chocolate version a small bar 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.060
 everything will be fine 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.370
 other recipes involving chocolate 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.800
 The fear is I'm not much of a chocolate fan. 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.800
 they are well 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:56.870
 the load of rubbish but very good indeed 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:59.660
 people is beer that has so 6 6 6% by 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.850
 one hundred percent of it comes from it 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.200
 in the 600 ml bottles 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.200
 so my grade 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.330
 note 5 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.980
 The embargo on the plate of fear is me. 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.920
 I was hoping that I would play but it 's 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.350
 hot as hell percent very chief 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.480
 in the air of chocolate is not active in 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.410
 button already everything but it is not because of it 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.840
 that she will reach active is good is good 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.470
 so I was surprised I thought he announced 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.970
 that would be bad but it 's my chocolate 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.520
 so I recommend that you 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.420
 chocolate and all other languages 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.000
 are very good to go to the factory and 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.680
 This is until the next episode. 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.630
 do not drink drive a dream of driving not 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.630
 see such health
