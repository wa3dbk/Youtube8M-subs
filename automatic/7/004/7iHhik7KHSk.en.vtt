00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.630 
baseline so I'm going to cover both
let's<00:00:16.660> say<00:00:16.810> you<00:00:16.869> mean<00:00:17.109> it<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.350> net<00:00:17.560> so<00:00:18.520> the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
let's say you mean it the net so the

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.429 
let's say you mean it the net so the
first<00:00:18.880> step<00:00:19.119> is<00:00:19.300> realized<00:00:19.990> that<00:00:20.199> when<00:00:20.320> you're

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
first step is realized that when you're

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.599 
first step is realized that when you're
at<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:20.619> net<00:00:20.769> you're<00:00:20.919> going<00:00:21.070> to<00:00:21.130> use<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.369> same

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
at the net you're going to use the same

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.890 
at the net you're going to use the same
grip<00:00:21.939> for<00:00:22.210> every<00:00:22.449> volley

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
grip for every volley

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.630 
grip for every volley
that's<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.349> choppa<00:00:23.589> grip<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.339> that's<00:00:24.519> going

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
that's the choppa grip so that's going

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.009 
that's the choppa grip so that's going
to<00:00:24.730> be<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.849> forehand<00:00:25.269> volley<00:00:25.359> of<00:00:25.570> backhand
