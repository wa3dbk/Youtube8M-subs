theories and today's theory is gonna be

theories and today's theory is gonna be
mapped<00:00:12.070> based<00:00:12.310> off<00:00:12.460> value<00:00:12.820> it's<00:00:12.970> now<00:00:13.360> these

mapped based off value it's now these

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.700 
mapped based off value it's now these
maps<00:00:13.720> really<00:00:13.960> aren't<00:00:14.110> based<00:00:14.350> off<00:00:14.500> of<00:00:14.530> any

evidence or anything like that they're

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.189 
evidence or anything like that they're
mainly<00:00:16.240> just<00:00:16.330> maps<00:00:16.570> that<00:00:16.720> I<00:00:16.840> would<00:00:16.990> personally

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
mainly just maps that I would personally

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.570 
mainly just maps that I would personally
like<00:00:17.439> to<00:00:17.500> see<00:00:17.710> so<00:00:17.859> let's<00:00:17.890> go<00:00:18.130> to<00:00:18.189> get<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.430> shit

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
like to see so let's go to get the shit

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.069 
like to see so let's go to get the shit
started<00:00:18.939> now<00:00:19.449> personally<00:00:19.689> don't<00:00:20.019> think

Church will for make a map about
Auschwitz<00:00:21.550> Mealing<00:00:21.880> because<00:00:22.060> people<00:00:22.329> can<00:00:22.419> get

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
Auschwitz Mealing because people can get

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.300 
Auschwitz Mealing because people can get
really<00:00:22.539> butt<00:00:22.990> hurt<00:00:23.199> but<00:00:23.619> if<00:00:23.710> they<00:00:23.829> do<00:00:23.890> we<00:00:24.189> could

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
really butt hurt but if they do we could

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.800 
really butt hurt but if they do we could
probably<00:00:24.550> be<00:00:24.730> one<00:00:24.909> of<00:00:24.999> the<00:00:25.060> scariest<00:00:25.359> maps

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
probably be one of the scariest maps

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.810 
probably be one of the scariest maps
we've<00:00:25.960> ever<00:00:26.079> had<00:00:26.259> probably<00:00:26.619> rival<00:00:27.009> drug<00:00:27.249> and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
we've ever had probably rival drug and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.950 
we've ever had probably rival drug and
it<00:00:27.909> could<00:00:27.999> also<00:00:28.119> probably<00:00:28.300> be<00:00:28.509> a<00:00:28.539> really<00:00:28.839> good

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
it could also probably be a really good

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.689 
it could also probably be a really good
map<00:00:29.199> now<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.679> way<00:00:29.829> that<00:00:29.949> I<00:00:30.039> see<00:00:30.220> it<00:00:30.279> we<00:00:30.369> have<00:00:30.550> to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
map now the way that I see it we have to

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.130 
map now the way that I see it we have to
rabbit<00:00:30.999> Auschwitz<00:00:31.359> by<00:00:31.480> train<00:00:31.779> there's<00:00:32.020> really

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
rabbit Auschwitz by train there's really

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.750 
rabbit Auschwitz by train there's really
no<00:00:32.380> other<00:00:32.560> way<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.800> arrive<00:00:33.130> at<00:00:33.310> Auschwitz

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
no other way to arrive at Auschwitz

no other way to arrive at Auschwitz
other<00:00:33.910> than<00:00:34.060> train<00:00:34.329> because<00:00:34.750> that's<00:00:34.989> how<00:00:35.079> the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
other than train because that's how the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.510 
other than train because that's how the
Nazis<00:00:35.500> would<00:00:35.590> bring<00:00:35.770> in<00:00:35.890> all<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.130> Jews<00:00:36.310> and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.690 
design because I've never actually been
to<00:02:26.319> Auschwitz<00:02:26.799> all<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.010> really<00:02:27.250> know<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.489> like

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
to Auschwitz all I really know is like

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.250 
to Auschwitz all I really know is like
they<00:02:27.790> have<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.909> big<00:02:28.090> open<00:02:28.359> courtyard<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.930> then

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
they have a big open courtyard and then

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.990 
they have a big open courtyard and then
like<00:02:29.379> tons<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.739> barracks<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:30.340> Treyarch<00:02:30.849> could

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
like tons of barracks so Treyarch could

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.309 
like tons of barracks so Treyarch could
sort<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.269> play<00:02:31.450> around<00:02:31.480> with<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.870> map<00:02:32.049> design

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
sort of play around with a map design

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.629 
sort of play around with a map design
but<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.739> storyline<00:02:33.069> I've<00:02:33.310> thought<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.549> lot

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
but the storyline I've thought a lot

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.129 
but the storyline I've thought a lot
about<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.269> storyline<00:02:34.599> would<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:34.840> really

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
about and the storyline would be really

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.509 
about and the storyline would be really
awesome<00:02:35.260> they<00:02:35.560> sorted<00:02:35.950> something<00:02:36.129> like<00:02:36.250> this

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
awesome they sorted something like this

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.099 
awesome they sorted something like this
so<00:02:36.939> josef<00:02:37.569> mengele

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
so josef mengele

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.300 
so josef mengele
I<00:02:38.200> think<00:02:38.469> the<00:02:38.530> Thai<00:02:38.650> pronounce<00:02:38.920> his<00:02:39.040> last<00:02:39.069> name

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
I think the Thai pronounce his last name

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.069 
I think the Thai pronounce his last name
it<00:02:39.790> was<00:02:39.819> basically<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.269> doctor<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.719> ran<00:02:40.900> how

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
it was basically the doctor that ran how

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.300 
it was basically the doctor that ran how
she<00:02:41.139> would<00:02:41.409> so<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.680> lot<00:02:41.859> of<00:02:41.889> people<00:02:42.189> actually

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
she would so a lot of people actually

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.860 
she would so a lot of people actually
were<00:02:42.639> scared<00:02:42.879> of<00:02:42.939> him<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.269> I've<00:02:43.510> heard<00:02:43.659> a<00:02:43.689> lot

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
were scared of him and I've heard a lot

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.059 
were scared of him and I've heard a lot
of<00:02:44.019> people<00:02:44.290> say<00:02:44.439> that<00:02:44.590> he<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:44.769> actually<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
of people say that he was actually a

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.440 
of people say that he was actually a
really<00:02:45.310> good-looking<00:02:45.489> guy<00:02:45.730> these<00:02:46.299> are

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
really good-looking guy these are

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.550 
really good-looking guy these are
actually<00:02:46.689> from<00:02:46.750> Jewish<00:02:47.109> people<00:02:47.379> that<00:02:47.469> were

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
actually from Jewish people that were

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.960 
actually from Jewish people that were
actually<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:48.010> Auschwitz<00:02:48.459> I'm<00:02:48.579> just<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:48.819> whoa

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
actually in Auschwitz I'm just like whoa

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.059 
actually in Auschwitz I'm just like whoa
what<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.209> fuck<00:02:49.269> but<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.230> feel<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.709> he<00:02:50.919> has<00:02:51.040> to

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
what the fuck but I feel like he has to

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.409 
what the fuck but I feel like he has to
be<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> very<00:02:51.549> big<00:02:51.760> part<00:02:51.939> in<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.209> mainly

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
be a very big part in this mainly

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.210 
be a very big part in this mainly
because<00:02:52.540> he<00:02:52.989> was<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.230> doctor<00:02:53.379> there<00:02:53.680> he<00:02:54.069> did

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
because he was the doctor there he did

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.099 
because he was the doctor there he did
all<00:02:54.400> sorts<00:02:54.609> of<00:02:54.790> weird<00:02:54.970> tests<00:02:55.269> on<00:02:55.480> twins<00:02:55.870> and

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
all sorts of weird tests on twins and

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.289 
all sorts of weird tests on twins and
with<00:02:56.230> DNA<00:02:56.650> he<00:02:57.069> would<00:02:57.220> slice<00:02:57.400> people<00:02:57.790> open<00:02:58.120> so

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
with DNA he would slice people open so

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.030 
with DNA he would slice people open so
people<00:02:58.450> together<00:02:58.659> he<00:02:59.290> was<00:02:59.409> very<00:02:59.709> interested

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
people together he was very interested

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.190 
people together he was very interested
in<00:03:00.310> DNA<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.359> feel<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.540> what<00:03:01.719> Traer<00:03:01.959> should

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
in DNA so I feel like what Traer should

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.780 
in DNA so I feel like what Traer should
do<00:03:02.349> is<00:03:02.530> maybe<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.189> him<00:03:03.519> have<00:03:03.639> some

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
do is maybe have him have some

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.459 
do is maybe have him have some
connections<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.299> group<00:03:04.510> 935<00:03:04.719> or<00:03:05.379> the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
connections to group 935 or the

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.440 
connections to group 935 or the
Illuminati<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:06.669> maybe<00:03:06.879> he<00:03:07.030> actually<00:03:07.150> has<00:03:07.419> a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
Illuminati so maybe he actually has a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.209 
Illuminati so maybe he actually has a
connection<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.870> group<00:03:08.230> 935<00:03:08.439> maybe<00:03:09.069> he

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:09.219 
connection to group 935 maybe he

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.009 
connection to group 935 maybe he
actually<00:03:09.489> knew<00:03:09.609> Maxis<00:03:09.969> and<00:03:10.060> Richtofen<00:03:10.359> or

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
actually knew Maxis and Richtofen or

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.750 
actually knew Maxis and Richtofen or
maybe<00:03:11.169> he<00:03:11.349> was<00:03:11.439> actually<00:03:11.590> sent<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.189> by<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
maybe he was actually sent in by the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.399 
maybe he was actually sent in by the
Illuminati<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.510> actually<00:03:13.719> knows<00:03:13.840> Richthofen

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
Illuminati and actually knows Richthofen

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.780 
Illuminati and actually knows Richthofen
directly<00:03:14.739> since<00:03:14.919> Richthofen<00:03:15.400> was<00:03:15.489> also<00:03:15.730> in

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
directly since Richthofen was also in

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.280 
directly since Richthofen was also in
the<00:03:15.879> Illuminati<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.750> maybe<00:03:16.900> he's<00:03:17.049> actually

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
the Illuminati so maybe he's actually

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.780 
the Illuminati so maybe he's actually
sent<00:03:17.500> into<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.799> by<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.099> Illuminati<00:03:18.579> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
sent into the by the Illuminati to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.129 
sent into the by the Illuminati to
actually<00:03:19.000> do<00:03:19.150> all<00:03:19.269> these<00:03:19.389> tests<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:19.989> stuff

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
actually do all these tests and stuff

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.240 
actually do all these tests and stuff
like<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.439> because<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.650> Illuminati<00:03:21.099> knew

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
like that because the Illuminati knew

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.979 
like that because the Illuminati knew
what<00:03:21.370> was<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.639> on<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.030> then<00:03:22.629> maybe<00:03:22.780> at

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
what was going on and then maybe at

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.330 
what was going on and then maybe at
Auschwitz<00:03:23.440> he<00:03:23.500> was<00:03:23.590> also<00:03:23.739> doing<00:03:24.010> tests<00:03:24.280> with

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
Auschwitz he was also doing tests with

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.789 
Auschwitz he was also doing tests with
one<00:03:24.609> one<00:03:24.760> five<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.269> twins<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:25.780> DNA<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:26.620> maybe

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
one one five on twins and DNA so maybe

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.229 
one one five on twins and DNA so maybe
while<00:03:27.040> he<00:03:27.250> was<00:03:27.370> at<00:03:27.459> Auschwitz<00:03:27.819> he<00:03:27.970> actually

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
while he was at Auschwitz he actually

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.339 
while he was at Auschwitz he actually
learned<00:03:28.449> something<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:28.959> maybe<00:03:29.109> he<00:03:29.260> actually

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
learned something so maybe he actually

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.990 
learned something so maybe he actually
discovered<00:03:30.310> something<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.609> could<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:30.879> of

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
discovered something that could be of

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.520 
discovered something that could be of
use<00:03:31.209> or<00:03:31.389> maybe<00:03:31.510> actually<00:03:31.900> invented<00:03:32.290> something

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
use or maybe actually invented something

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.830 
use or maybe actually invented something
at<00:03:32.739> Auschwitz<00:03:33.189> so<00:03:33.639> I<00:03:33.669> feel<00:03:33.879> like<00:03:33.909> Sam<00:03:34.599> in<00:03:34.750> the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
at Auschwitz so I feel like Sam in the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.719 
at Auschwitz so I feel like Sam in the
original<00:03:35.199> gang<00:03:35.379> which<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.709> takeo<00:03:36.129> Nikolai<00:03:36.579> and

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
original gang which is takeo Nikolai and

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.460 
original gang which is takeo Nikolai and
Dempsey<00:03:36.970> they<00:03:37.599> arrived<00:03:37.930> at<00:03:38.109> Auschwitz

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
Dempsey they arrived at Auschwitz

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.979 
Dempsey they arrived at Auschwitz
looking<00:03:38.949> for<00:03:39.129> whatever<00:03:39.280> Josef<00:03:39.849> Mengele<00:03:40.329> hope

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
looking for whatever Josef Mengele hope

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.300 
looking for whatever Josef Mengele hope
it's<00:03:41.139> how<00:03:41.199> you<00:03:41.260> pronounce<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.680> whatever<00:03:42.099> he

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
it's how you pronounce it whatever he

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.949 
it's how you pronounce it whatever he
was<00:03:42.430> basically<00:03:42.729> designing<00:03:43.209> or<00:03:43.479> working<00:03:43.840> with

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
was basically designing or working with

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.240 
was basically designing or working with
that's<00:03:44.319> what<00:03:44.530> they<00:03:44.650> want<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.889> get<00:03:45.010> they<00:03:45.129> want

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
that's what they want to get they want

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.559 
that's what they want to get they want
to<00:03:45.310> get<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.519> research<00:03:45.849> or<00:03:46.120> whatever<00:03:46.389> he

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
to get that research or whatever he

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.479 
to get that research or whatever he
invented<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.290> maybe<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.919> reason<00:03:48.069> they<00:03:48.280> want

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
invented and maybe the reason they want

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.920 
invented and maybe the reason they want
this<00:03:48.669> is<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.389> could<00:03:49.449> help<00:03:49.599> take<00:03:49.900> down

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
this is because it could help take down

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.050 
this is because it could help take down
Richthofen<00:03:50.709> or<00:03:50.799> Maxis<00:03:51.220> or<00:03:51.519> whoever<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:51.909> really

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
Richthofen or Maxis or whoever is really

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.909 
Richthofen or Maxis or whoever is really
in<00:03:52.150> charge<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.689> events<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:53.079> this<00:03:53.229> map<00:03:53.470> would

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
in charge the events of this map would

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.710 
in charge the events of this map would
take<00:03:54.159> place<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.669> events<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.060> black<00:03:55.269> ops<00:03:55.509> 2

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
take place of the events of black ops 2

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.879 
take place of the events of black ops 2
so<00:03:56.079> while<00:03:56.169> the<00:03:56.259> other<00:03:56.379> gang<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.590> going<00:03:56.769> through

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
so while the other gang is going through

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.649 
so while the other gang is going through
dire<00:03:57.040> eisenberg<00:03:57.639> maybe<00:03:58.329> we're<00:03:58.509> going

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
dire eisenberg maybe we're going

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.149 
dire eisenberg maybe we're going
throughout<00:03:58.900> Schwing<00:03:59.470> some<00:03:59.650> other<00:03:59.769> map<00:03:59.979> so

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
throughout Schwing some other map so

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.319 
throughout Schwing some other map so
this<00:04:00.280> just<00:04:00.459> sort<00:04:00.519> of<00:04:00.639> explains<00:04:01.030> what's

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
this just sort of explains what's

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.509 
this just sort of explains what's
happening<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.169> original<00:04:02.620> game<00:04:02.769> while<00:04:03.340> the

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
happening to the original game while the

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.979 
happening to the original game while the
events<00:04:03.759> of<00:04:03.849> black<00:04:04.000> ops<00:04:04.209> 2<00:04:04.359> are<00:04:04.479> happening<00:04:04.840> and

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
events of black ops 2 are happening and

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.960 
events of black ops 2 are happening and
the<00:04:05.079> reason<00:04:05.379> Richtofen<00:04:05.949> and<00:04:06.040> Maxis<00:04:06.129> can't

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
the reason Richtofen and Maxis can't

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.249 
the reason Richtofen and Maxis can't
exactly<00:04:07.180> tell<00:04:07.540> where<00:04:07.720> they<00:04:07.900> are<00:04:08.019> is<00:04:08.139> because

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:08.259 
exactly tell where they are is because

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:09.929 
exactly tell where they are is because
they<00:04:08.470> didn't<00:04:08.620> have<00:04:08.709> full<00:04:08.949> power<00:04:09.159> so<00:04:09.849> it's

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
they didn't have full power so it's

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.129 
they didn't have full power so it's
basically<00:04:10.150> what<00:04:10.239> you're<00:04:10.419> doing<00:04:10.689> in<00:04:10.780> black<00:04:10.959> ops

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
basically what you're doing in black ops

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.689 
basically what you're doing in black ops
2<00:04:11.229> with<00:04:11.439> transit<00:04:11.829> die<00:04:11.979> rise<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.459> buried

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
2 with transit die rise and buried

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.129 
2 with transit die rise and buried
you're<00:04:13.090> basically<00:04:13.359> just<00:04:13.419> trying<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.780> increase

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
you're basically just trying to increase

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.110 
you're basically just trying to increase
power<00:04:14.409> with<00:04:14.709> Maxis<00:04:15.129> and<00:04:15.250> Richtofen

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
power with Maxis and Richtofen

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.490 
power with Maxis and Richtofen
so<00:04:16.359> they<00:04:16.479> can't<00:04:16.690> really<00:04:16.930> see<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.229> entire

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
so they can't really see the entire

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.629 
so they can't really see the entire
earth<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.949> they're<00:04:18.099> spots<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.430> they<00:04:18.519> can

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
earth and they're spots that they can

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.249 
earth and they're spots that they can
actually<00:04:18.759> see<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.479> use<00:04:19.599> their<00:04:19.720> power<00:04:19.930> on<00:04:20.079> are

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
actually see and use their power on are

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.029 
actually see and use their power on are
very<00:04:20.409> limited

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
very limited

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.589 
very limited
maybe<00:04:21.370> ouch<00:04:21.579> which<00:04:21.849> just<00:04:22.030> isn't<00:04:22.180> one<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.449> them

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
maybe ouch which just isn't one of them

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.670 
maybe ouch which just isn't one of them
so<00:04:22.750> that's<00:04:22.810> why<00:04:22.990> they<00:04:23.110> can't<00:04:23.320> tell<00:04:23.530> we're

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
so that's why they can't tell we're

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.440 
so that's why they can't tell we're
saying<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.070> rest<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.340> gang<00:04:24.520> are<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:25.210> Sam

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
saying the rest of the gang are so Sam

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.390 
saying the rest of the gang are so Sam
the<00:04:25.599> gang<00:04:25.750> go<00:04:26.139> here<00:04:26.409> find<00:04:27.010> something<00:04:27.279> that

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
the gang go here find something that

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.600 
the gang go here find something that
they<00:04:27.490> need<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:27.940> then<00:04:28.180> we<00:04:28.270> go<00:04:28.389> on

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
they need and then we go on

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.920 
they need and then we go on
the<00:04:28.669> next<00:04:28.909> map<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.330> then<00:04:29.419> will<00:04:29.539> eventually

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
the next map and then will eventually

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.020 
the next map and then will eventually
take<00:04:30.139> down<00:04:30.319> Richthofen<00:04:30.889> or<00:04:30.979> Maxis<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.490> then

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
take down Richthofen or Maxis and then

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.820 
take down Richthofen or Maxis and then
maybe<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.569> conclusion<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.139> zombies<00:04:33.530> or<00:04:33.680> maybe

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
maybe the conclusion of zombies or maybe

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.379 
maybe the conclusion of zombies or maybe
we<00:04:33.889> keep<00:04:34.069> going<00:04:34.219> who<00:04:34.759> really<00:04:35.000> knows<00:04:35.180> but

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
we keep going who really knows but

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.059 
we keep going who really knows but
