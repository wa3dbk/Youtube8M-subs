00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
not because some political ethical big

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.140 
not because some political ethical big

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
issue happens that we need to simply

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.060

of the existence

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.290 
of the existence
why<00:03:47.930> was<00:03:48.260> f1<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.190> keen<00:03:49.490> to<00:03:49.700> put<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:49.970> on<00:03:50.090> again

why was f1 so keen to put it on again
this<00:03:50.420> year<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.870> think<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.320> was<00:03:51.350> born<00:03:51.710> not<00:03:52.220> of

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
this year I think it was born not of

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.880 
this year I think it was born not of
money<00:03:52.820> or<00:03:53.240> greed<00:03:53.690> or<00:03:53.720> any<00:03:54.260> of<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.500> things<00:03:54.650> that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
money or greed or any of the things that

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.830 
money or greed or any of the things that
people<00:03:55.190> might<00:03:55.610> want<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.940> characterize<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.720> was

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
people might want to characterize it was

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.170 
people might want to characterize it was
born<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.880> enthusiasm<00:03:58.880> for<00:03:59.030> motor

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
born of a and enthusiasm for motor

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.980 
born of a and enthusiasm for motor
racing<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.660> passion<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.080> hold<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.620> Grand<00:04:00.860> Prix

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
racing a passion to hold a Grand Prix

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.930 
racing a passion to hold a Grand Prix
I<00:04:03.020> think<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:04.190> clouded<00:04:04.820> the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
I think that that clouded the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.450 
I think that that clouded the
decision-making<00:04:05.450> process<00:04:06.040> but<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.160> didn't

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
decision-making process but that didn't

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.650 
decision-making process but that didn't
address<00:04:07.640> whether<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.060> was<00:04:08.150> right<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.510> go<00:04:08.630> there

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
address whether it was right to go there

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.380 
address whether it was right to go there
on<00:04:08.960> principle<00:04:09.520> well<00:04:10.520> again<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.030> don't<00:04:11.090> think

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
on principle well again I don't think

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.940 
on principle well again I don't think
we're<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.780> sport<00:04:12.140> at<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.470> end<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.710> the<00:04:12.770> day

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
we're a sport at the end of the day

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.160 
we're a sport at the end of the day
we're<00:04:13.190> not<00:04:13.310> -<00:04:13.550> no<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:14.030> start<00:04:14.480> taking<00:04:15.050> a

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
we're not - no you start taking a
