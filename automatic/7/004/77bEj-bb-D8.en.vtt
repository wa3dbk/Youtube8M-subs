00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.730 

what<00:00:27.760> makes<00:00:27.970> this<00:00:28.150> lexus<00:00:28.690> GS<00:00:28.720> unique<00:00:29.470> is<00:00:29.710> that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
what makes this lexus GS unique is that

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.710 
what makes this lexus GS unique is that
it<00:00:30.100> has<00:00:30.250> an<00:00:30.430> electric<00:00:30.760> motor<00:00:30.790> perhaps<00:00:31.570> more

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
it has an electric motor perhaps more

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.330 
it has an electric motor perhaps more
importantly<00:00:32.200> it<00:00:32.260> also<00:00:32.650> has<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.160> most

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
importantly it also has the most

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.840 
importantly it also has the most
horsepower<00:00:33.610> just<00:00:34.390> over<00:00:34.750> 380<00:00:35.710> which<00:00:36.250> means<00:00:36.520> in

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
horsepower just over 380 which means in

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.180 
horsepower just over 380 which means in
theory<00:00:37.120> it<00:00:37.390> should<00:00:37.420> be<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.870> fastest<00:00:38.320> lexus<00:00:38.770> GS

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
theory it should be the fastest lexus GS

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.729 
theory it should be the fastest lexus GS
combined<00:00:39.700> but<00:00:40.150> it<00:00:40.239> still<00:00:40.450> uses<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.750> 3.5<00:00:41.440> liter

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
combined but it still uses a 3.5 liter

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.040 
combined but it still uses a 3.5 liter
v6<00:00:41.830> we<00:00:42.460> did<00:00:42.640> add<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.030> atkinson<00:00:43.540> cycle<00:00:43.570> through

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
v6 we did add the atkinson cycle through

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.990 
v6 we did add the atkinson cycle through
this<00:00:44.170> still<00:00:44.500> with<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.860> overall<00:00:45.460> combined

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
this still with the overall combined

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.780 
this still with the overall combined
burst<00:00:46.270> tire<00:00:46.420> 388<00:00:47.290> let's<00:00:47.860> elect<00:00:48.070> another<00:00:48.610> one

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
burst tire 388 let's elect another one

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.650 
burst tire 388 let's elect another one
has<00:00:49.350> 306<00:00:50.350> right<00:00:50.790> 306<00:00:51.790> so<00:00:51.970> this<00:00:52.120> puts<00:00:52.360> out<00:00:52.540> the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
has 306 right 306 so this puts out the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.700 
has 306 right 306 so this puts out the
performance<00:00:53.080> of<00:00:53.199> a<00:00:53.290> 4.5<00:00:54.040> liter<00:00:54.309> v8

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.630 

there's<00:01:01.050> more<00:01:01.320> room<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> trunk<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
there's more room in the trunk and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.609 
there's more room in the trunk and
that's<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.540> stack<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.229> batteries

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that's because they stack the batteries

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.490 
that's because they stack the batteries
up<00:01:04.920> instead<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> outward<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.320> bit

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
up instead of outward so a little bit

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.680 
up instead of outward so a little bit
more<00:01:07.560> tushy<00:01:07.950> space<00:01:08.190> for<00:01:08.400> me<00:01:08.520> they're<00:01:09.390> still

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
more tushy space for me they're still

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.620 
more tushy space for me they're still
using<00:01:10.530> Nicola<00:01:11.280> hydride<00:01:11.700> batteries<00:01:12.150> back<00:01:12.360> here

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
using Nicola hydride batteries back here

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.990 
using Nicola hydride batteries back here
and<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.890> well<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:14.880> want

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and that's because well they don't want

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
and that's because well they don't want
to<00:01:15.060> mess<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.360> good<00:01:15.509> thing<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:16.290> year<00:01:16.350> we

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to mess with a good thing this year we

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
to mess with a good thing this year we
actually<00:01:16.770> took<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.310> stack<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> batteries<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
actually took and stack the batteries on

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
actually took and stack the batteries on
top<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> each<00:01:18.600> other<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> section<00:01:20.280> on

will it be a price premium for the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.080 
will it be a price premium for the
hybrid<00:02:16.130> there<00:02:17.130> always<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> little<00:02:17.849> bit<00:02:17.940> for

money<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.520> get<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.910> hybrid<00:02:45.270> drive<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:45.930> this

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
money to get the hybrid drive with this

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.390 
money to get the hybrid drive with this
car<00:02:46.290> you're<00:02:46.470> getting<00:02:46.800> better<00:02:47.010> fuel<00:02:47.190> economy

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
car you're getting better fuel economy

car you're getting better fuel economy
and<00:02:48.000> you're<00:02:48.330> getting<00:02:48.420> more<00:02:48.630> power<00:02:48.930> that's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
and you're getting more power that's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.590 
and you're getting more power that's
true<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.610> other<00:02:50.730> cars<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.210> this<00:02:51.330> class

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
true but the other cars in this class

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
and the fact that the engineers I have a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.840 
and the fact that the engineers I have a
video<00:03:19.290> showing<00:03:19.650> them<00:03:19.800> all<00:03:20.070> going<00:03:20.400> out<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.760> it

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
video showing them all going out to it

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.970 
video showing them all going out to it
like<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> bamboo<00:03:21.360> forest<00:03:21.840> picking<00:03:22.710> out<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
like a bamboo forest picking out the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.250 
like a bamboo forest picking out the
bamboo<00:03:23.370> each<00:03:23.730> bamboo<00:03:24.420> tree<00:03:24.630> they<00:03:24.780> want<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.080> use

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
bamboo each bamboo tree they want to use

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.350 
bamboo each bamboo tree they want to use
so<00:03:25.860> take<00:03:26.070> it<00:03:26.220> back<00:03:26.250> they<00:03:26.550> split<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.060> up<00:03:27.150> into

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
so take it back they split it up into

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.940 
so take it back they split it up into
different<00:03:27.540> sections<00:03:27.930> they<00:03:28.290> glue<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:28.770> top

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
different sections they glue it on top

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.980 
different sections they glue it on top
of<00:03:29.160> each<00:03:29.280> other<00:03:29.520> then<00:03:30.090> they<00:03:30.240> form<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.780> around

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
of each other then they form it around

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.470 
of each other then they form it around
for<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.500> wheel<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.070> they<00:03:32.490> have<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> machine<00:03:33.330> it

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
for the wheel and they have a machine it

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.240 
for the wheel and they have a machine it
goes<00:03:33.600> around<00:03:33.780> custom<00:03:34.230> ASIC<00:03:34.530> sheet<00:03:34.770> they

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
goes around custom ASIC sheet they

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.490 
goes around custom ASIC sheet they
literally<00:03:35.580> hand<00:03:35.970> finish<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.600> by<00:03:36.720> hand<00:03:36.959> sanding

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
literally hand finish it by hand sanding

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.470 
literally hand finish it by hand sanding
