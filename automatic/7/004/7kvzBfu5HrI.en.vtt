cap now be careful cuz once you loosen
the<00:00:48.000> cap<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.450> waters<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.170> gonna<00:00:49.880> come<00:00:50.880> out

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the cap but waters just gonna come out

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
the cap but waters just gonna come out
of<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.330> it's<00:00:51.480> under<00:00:51.690> pressure<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.950> even

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
of here like it's under pressure so even

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
of here like it's under pressure so even
tip<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.580> bucket<00:00:53.700> up<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> we

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
tip the bucket up a little bit so we

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.600 
tip the bucket up a little bit so we
have<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.440> drain<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> coolant<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:05.309> well

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
have to drain the coolant because well

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.830 
have to drain the coolant because well
first<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.360> allowed<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
first of all it's not allowed on the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.930 
first of all it's not allowed on the
track<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.190> do<00:01:08.430> spill<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
track and if you do spill it on the

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.080 
track and if you do spill it on the
track<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.509> becomes<00:01:09.780> very<00:01:10.170> slippery<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.090> we'll

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
track it becomes very slippery so we'll

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
track it becomes very slippery so we'll
drain<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> fill<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.840> water<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.320> don't

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
drain it fill it with water and don't

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.859 
drain it fill it with water and don't
forget<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> put<00:01:15.030> coolant<00:01:15.330> back<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
forget to put coolant back in it in the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
forget to put coolant back in it in the

now<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.570> gonna<00:01:57.659> use<00:01:57.840> small<00:01:58.260> drill<00:01:58.560> bits

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
now you're gonna use small drill bits

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.890 
now you're gonna use small drill bits
you've<00:01:59.460> got<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.580> lot<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> bolts<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.450> drill<00:02:00.689> and

you've got a lot of bolts to drill and

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.580 
you've got a lot of bolts to drill and
you're<00:02:01.680> probably<00:02:01.979> gonna<00:02:02.220> break<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:03.470> dozen<00:02:04.470> or

you're probably gonna break a dozen or
more<00:02:04.729> drill<00:02:05.729> bits<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:07.080> come<00:02:07.260> drill

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
more drill bits if you don't come drill

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.190 
more drill bits if you don't come drill
them<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.740> me<00:02:07.830> anyway<00:02:08.459> um<00:02:08.720> there's<00:02:09.720> different

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
them for me anyway um there's different

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.199 
them for me anyway um there's different
ways<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:10.320> can<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.769> with<00:02:11.430> smaller<00:02:11.760> bolts

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
ways you can do it with smaller bolts

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.520 
ways you can do it with smaller bolts
you<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.480> go<00:02:12.570> straight<00:02:12.810> through<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.380> see

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.020 
go into the dish it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.330> drill<00:02:21.630> these<00:02:22.130> nuts<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.640> go<00:02:23.790> from

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
easier to drill these nuts you go from

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.850 
easier to drill these nuts you go from
flat<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.330> flat<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.870> don't<00:02:25.230> if<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.350> guys<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.709> see

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
flat to flat I don't if you guys can see

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.900 
flat to flat I don't if you guys can see
through<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.500> there's<00:02:28.549> numerous<00:02:29.549> ways

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
through that and there's numerous ways

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.460 
through that and there's numerous ways
of<00:02:30.150> doing<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:30.690> do<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.260> bike

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
of doing it you can do it on the bike

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.860 
of doing it you can do it on the bike
you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.549> drill<00:02:32.790> press<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.390> can

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you can do it in a drill press you can

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.140 
you can do it in a drill press you can
clamp<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.500> vise<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.130> free<00:02:35.700> hand<00:02:35.940> drill

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
clamp it in a vise and free hand drill

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.780 
clamp it in a vise and free hand drill
it<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:37.040> clamp<00:02:38.040> them<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.370> pair<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.640> vise

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it and clamp them in a pair of vise

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.330 
it and clamp them in a pair of vise
grips<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.450> drill<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.349> prefer<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
grips and drill it I prefer to do it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.930 
grips and drill it I prefer to do it
freehand

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
freehand

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.790 
freehand
but<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.110> gonna<00:02:43.200> take<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
but it's it's gonna take you all to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.180 
but it's it's gonna take you all to
figure<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
figure it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.120 
figure it
what<00:02:44.310> works<00:02:44.490> best<00:02:44.760> for<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:47.070> I'll

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
what works best for you so I'll

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.770 
what works best for you so I'll
demonstrate<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.760> drilling<00:02:48.300> with<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> pair<00:02:48.690> of

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
demonstrate on drilling with a pair of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.220 
demonstrate on drilling with a pair of
vise<00:02:48.900> grips

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
vise grips

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.160 
vise grips
clamp<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.320> bolt<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.190> vise<00:02:53.340> grips<00:02:54.050> pick<00:02:55.050> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
clamp the bolt in the vise grips pick it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.900 
clamp the bolt in the vise grips pick it
at<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.410> shoulder<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.340> don't<00:02:56.520> crush<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
at the shoulder so you don't crush the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.640 
at the shoulder so you don't crush the
threads<00:02:57.210> if<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.840> damage<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> threads<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
threads if you damage the threads of the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.160 
threads if you damage the threads of the
bolt<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:59.520> bolt<00:02:59.670> will<00:02:59.880> be<00:02:59.940> useless<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.300> you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.270 

always<00:03:04.170> wear<00:03:04.320> your<00:03:04.410> safety<00:03:04.560> glasses<00:03:04.860> when

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
always wear your safety glasses when

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:20.560 
always wear your safety glasses when
drilling<00:03:06.110> pick<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> flat<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.750> start<00:03:09.750> drilling

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.830 

so<00:03:21.570> there's<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:21.990> drilled<00:03:23.030> now<00:03:24.030> got<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.690> take

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
so there's one drilled now got to take

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.660 
so there's one drilled now got to take
your<00:03:25.020> time<00:03:25.230> go<00:03:26.040> slow<00:03:26.840> light<00:03:27.840> pressure<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
your time go slow light pressure and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.400 
your time go slow light pressure and
faster<00:03:29.670> drill<00:03:29.880> speed<00:03:30.240> is<00:03:30.450> not<00:03:30.780> necessarily

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
faster drill speed is not necessarily

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:47.660 
faster drill speed is not necessarily
the<00:03:31.560> best<00:03:31.710> way

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.730 

you
