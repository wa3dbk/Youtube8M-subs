looks<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:51.570> impressive<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.199> cool<00:00:52.710> duty<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
looks really impressive and cool duty is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.350

known<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.579> its<00:00:53.789> action<00:00:54.329> packed

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
known for its action packed

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.990 
known for its action packed
single-player<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> crazy<00:00:56.340> cutscenes

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
single-player and it's a crazy cutscenes

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
single-player and it's a crazy cutscenes
so<00:00:57.270> we're<00:00:58.079> definitely<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> miss

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so we're definitely not going to miss

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.670

that<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.820> modern<00:01:00.030> warfare<00:01:00.210> 3<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.469> looks

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that in modern warfare 3 it looks

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250 
that in modern warfare 3 it looks
beautiful<00:01:02.359> and<00:01:03.359> taking<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> look<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
beautiful and taking a look at the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
beautiful and taking a look at the
gameplay<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> recoil<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.729> such<00:01:05.939> should

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
gameplay here the recoil and such should

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.149 
gameplay here the recoil and such should
be<00:01:06.119> slightly<00:01:06.390> different<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
be slightly different to that of

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
be slightly different to that of
multiplayer<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.400> Sophie<00:01:09.090> bit<00:01:09.210> worried<00:01:09.600> it's

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
multiplayer and Sophie bit worried it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.920 
multiplayer and Sophie bit worried it's
not<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> correlate<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.490> cross<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
not going to correlate or cross it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.390 
not going to correlate or cross it
directly<00:01:13.439> because<00:01:13.740> single-player

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
directly because single-player

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800 
directly because single-player
multiplayer<00:01:14.549> always<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.570> slightly

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
multiplayer always have slightly

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
multiplayer always have slightly
different<00:01:15.930> slight<00:01:16.680> differences<00:01:17.130> between<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
different slight differences between the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
different slight differences between the
guns<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.330> jumping<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.740> single<00:01:20.220> player<00:01:20.369> now

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
guns so jumping from a single player now

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.450 
to multiplayer but separate for
multiplayer<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.770> rank<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.189> within

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
multiplayer so you can rank up within

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
multiplayer so you can rank up within
spec<00:01:50.820> ops<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.689> won't<00:01:51.899> directly<00:01:52.049> linked

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
spec ops but it won't directly linked

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.740 
spec ops but it won't directly linked
into<00:01:52.799> multiplayer<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> get<00:01:54.149> guns<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
into multiplayer so you can get guns and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.170 
into multiplayer so you can get guns and
stuff<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.710> play<00:01:55.920> more<00:01:56.159> spec<00:01:56.399> ops<00:01:56.610> so

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
stuff as you play more spec ops so

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
stuff as you play more spec ops so
that's<00:01:57.329> really<00:01:57.570> awesome<00:01:57.810> they've<00:01:58.140> added<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that's really awesome they've added that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
that's really awesome they've added that
in<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.950> well<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.549> there's<00:02:00.270> new<00:02:00.509> gameplay<00:02:00.930> here

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
in as well and there's new gameplay here

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.060 
in as well and there's new gameplay here
from<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.710> level<00:02:02.040> called<00:02:02.189> bootleg<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.479> is

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
from a level called bootleg this is

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.469 
from a level called bootleg this is
actually<00:02:05.070> completely<00:02:05.460> separate<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.270> think

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
actually completely separate I think

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.930 
actually completely separate I think
it's<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.899> cut<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.409> second<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:07.950> it's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it's about to cut in a second here it's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.590 
it's about to cut in a second here it's
in<00:02:09.740> china<00:02:10.740> i<00:02:10.890> believe<00:02:11.250> i<00:02:11.490> mean<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:12.000> dog<00:02:12.360> here

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
in china i believe i mean this dog here

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.990 
in china i believe i mean this dog here
it's<00:02:12.900> completely<00:02:13.440> separate<00:02:13.890> from<00:02:14.000> single

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
it's completely separate from single

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.670 
it's completely separate from single
player<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.510> bonus<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.230> basically<00:02:16.560> a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
player it's a bonus and basically a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680 
player it's a bonus and basically a
bonus<00:02:17.040> mission<00:02:17.400> which<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> find<00:02:18.120> in

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
bonus mission which you can find in

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
multiplayer and spec ops only so that's

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
multiplayer and spec ops only so that's
really<00:02:21.060> cool<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.480> think<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.810> looks

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
really cool and I think it looks

all four maps in one big go at the end

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.520

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.390 
personally think it's going to be loads
of<00:03:51.420> stuff<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.870> cordially<00:03:52.590> linking<00:03:53.250> into
