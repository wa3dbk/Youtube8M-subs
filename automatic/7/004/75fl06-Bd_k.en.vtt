00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
know I was in the motor work I was

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.780 
know I was in the motor work I was
always<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> motor<00:03:16.590> work<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.580> had<00:03:17.670> never

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
always in the motor work but had never

tried<00:03:18.120> any<00:03:18.330> bodywork<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.380> rather

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.130 
tried any bodywork and so I was rather
nervous<00:03:19.760> about<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.330> we<00:03:21.510> decided<00:03:21.900> that

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
nervous about that so we decided that

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.710 
nervous about that so we decided that
we'd<00:03:22.290> send<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> cab<00:03:22.920> off<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> local<00:03:24.570> body

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.130 
we'd send the cab off to a local body
shop<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:26.660> he<00:03:27.660> sent<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> cab<00:03:28.230> off<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.930> went

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
shop so he sent the cab off and it went

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.900 
shop so he sent the cab off and it went
up<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> first<00:03:31.650> choice<00:03:31.920> collision<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.549> Sydney
