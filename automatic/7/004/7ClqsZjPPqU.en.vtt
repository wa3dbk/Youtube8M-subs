00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.080

 as sent normal systems from 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.680
 dell on the site green neatly 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.209

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.770
 memory what storage 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.850
 you name it and of course if you still 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.930
 You can always have specific wishes 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.890
 call and then can 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.409
 now go one step further and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.170
 configuration now a system with a 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.640
 haswell processor and some video card in it 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.900
 tinkering each other can do a lot 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.079
 normal computer stores also for you 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.239
 to do 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.609
 what makes this product so special 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.379
 is actually just yes somewhat in the 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.060
 cupboard which is in it and then also the 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.349
 finishing the overall picture 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.030
 so let's just go there 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.319
 see what you have that computer 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.760
 sitting in this is really special well 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.650
 I need a bit of a difference 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.659
 is with what you feel with a system 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.489
 Buying a regular computer store is like that 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.139
 this of course just really transported 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.549
 should be able to be this should really be forgotten 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.079
 must be this must be to all 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.970
 inspections etcetera etcetera 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.620
 season also feels that he is from 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.239
 inside is not finished black 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.560
 big boy that is silver finished 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.810
 that is partly due to shielding 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.280
 to be done that way 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.950
 but if you also really go inside 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.689
 then you also see that he really 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.760
 is completely different than what you are 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.889
 are used to a normal computer 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.480
 yes that is not a hard disk here 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.650
 sit at the back is sitting with 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.299
 actually that the motherboard a bit 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.459
 is placed diagonally 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.769
 yes and yes it is indeed what that 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.220
 type of triangle yes actually one 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.479
 hexagon and the joke is that this is him 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.129
 actim standard way you down 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.540
 can put him as for whatever reasons on jim 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.870
 move forward or backward 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.760
 put 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.199
 is that no problem no the is so 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.299
 even praise me on the website 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.370
 from van dell all angles can be five 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.560
 times the weight of these cabinets 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.540
 in my mind that in this suitcase next to in 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.159
 road that would already say 26 pounds of well 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.319
 I find it hard to feel after one 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.180
 bring a party but yes if you have to 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.209
 you are also less bothered by us 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.889
 comes with 2 men yes and sometimes with 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.780
 test and here on the first floor is then 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.040
 it was quite a joke for him to go to 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.680
 to top it he is also the one 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.340
 beautiful water pools that is on the processor 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.739
 placed 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.079
 yes and inside it looks pretty nice 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.949
 from here is a 500 watt power supply 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.439
 delta 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:13.239
 modular here is also a small detail 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.180
 the cabinet lighting that sits through this 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.859
 connector against a print on the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.449
 casting pete messing with the with 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.489
 post cables yes it looks very 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.050
 neat yes and cabinet lighting 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.550
 then innovate by going ahead he stands 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.810
 now on blue 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.550
 you can set everything on you 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.289
 want to find your own very beautiful is possible too 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.970
 yes I had blinked etcetera 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.330
 etcetera via the control panel of 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.860
 a 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
 my work can really do that all the way up 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.460
 we can also put your own hand 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.930
 specific configurations with games and such 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.719
 when I think about it I have a lot to do 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.280
 everything for that matter yes ask that 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:44.439
 will immediately occur to many people if 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.050
 You can use the ready qualification system 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.120
 You must purchase it with this configuration 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.620
 do until the end of time or falls 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.849
 who some to upgrade weirder 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.259
 he is quite the top three to upgrade 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.770
 look basically it is that i do 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.389
 space 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.400
 together are largely specific to 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.900
 an insert developed things like it 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.620
 motherboard it is and music and msi 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.969
 motherboard 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.860
 but a lot in west that also it 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.000
 Eemian deflate again but also 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.379
 so remzi number 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.909
 and as it makes recognizable yes 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:08.229
 it is the historical variant of this 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.909
 motherboard in a separate box my 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.500
 jerk off and if you feel also in bios 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.610
 there is also something about it 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.080
 is right there is also a possibility 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.909
 piece of software with which you 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.289
 that can be funny the 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.800
 overclocking settings is below it 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.780
 Cup 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.460
 mailbox coffee quraysh and i don't know 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.710
 where that where that translated error today 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.419
 is but yes you can be the one and 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.650
 Another do look down all the boxes with 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.639
 just in the pub the food is normal 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.069
 modular so you can basically be there 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.840
 put another food into it with impunity 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.610
 there are only four 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.229
 memory bank but I think for the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.590
 most people 16 gigabytes or already 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.770
 Enough 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.599
 yes yes then the question finally remains and 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.610
 that is apples with pears that I realize 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.740
 Something like that, now a good choice 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.270
 or you can simply go to the 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.740
 alternate or final or any other 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.900
 Kumite store then and there in games 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.889
 system will set the bar assemblies 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.180
 because for hard to be able to 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.589
 once cheaper than one in it 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.940
 no doubt come but I have you 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.529
 gets very nice here of course 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.669
 system a very special system 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.949
 back and of course it does 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.539
 they were more like them and like you said I 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.190
 ok you can you can i games system 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.680
 put together in a very cheap cast 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.180
 van but I much 59 euros or something but you 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.529
 can also be a little more expensive costco view 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.750
 and this is of course a total picture 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.120
 with all sorts and your there support 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.529
 service is there and if so yes if you 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.839
 there is to appreciate that 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.069
 of course very interesting to the 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.089
 cat who goes through i want for dime 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.770
 sit on the first rank then you can 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.270
 that of course also always like you
