00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.840
 and greet my little cemac shrimps 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.420
 maboul and today I present to you 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.950
 a little trick or features that 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.840
 is more or less hidden his lack gives 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.430
 Besides, I will explain in 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.740
 detail how is it going then me 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.290
 under snow leopard and under the jaws 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.270
 I used to configure what 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.989
 applications open in which office 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.700
 from my mac 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.940
 does that mean what you see here that 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.410
 I have office number one office 2 3 and 4 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.719
 I used to come for example 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.370
 configured for that when I run 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.980
 safari it will launch automatically 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.030
 in the number one office when I'm going 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.530
 launch google chrome 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.690
 it will automatically launch into the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.310
 office number 2 and when finally I 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.440
 launches firefox it will open in the 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.970
 office number 3 so I had this 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.100
 used to configure what 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.320
 applications launch on which desktop 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.000
 under mao du laguiole I lost this 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.670
 habit because I did not find this 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.880
 feature I originally thought that 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.310
 apple had removed material but 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.840
 then I discovered that this 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.380
 functionality was more or less 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.299
 hidden 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.490
 that's why I'm doing this video 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.600
 to show you this little trick 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:24.610
 so before this feature was 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.440
 present here in mission space 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.270
 control so before that was called space 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.020
 I take something like that so in 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.900
 mission control 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.729
 here we had the opportunity to 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.979
 configure which application saleh 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.479
 was going to open on which office 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.460
 now as you can see 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.070
 this feature is no longer 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.710
 available in mission control but on 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.170
 the icon itself so let's say I 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 want safari to launch on the desk 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.110
 number one 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.780
 I will come and place myself on the desk 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.180
 number one and I just click the button 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.250
 right on the safari icon i'm going in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.070
 option is here you can see 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.970
 assign to all offices this office 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.740
 where none none is by default so it 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.349
 will open randomly 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.280
 we are going to come and choose this office for 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.709
 office number one 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.959
 so if for example I come on the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.890
 office number 3 let's say if I come 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.950
 launch safari 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.860
 logically it will automatically 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.940
 switch to office number 1 up I 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.730
 click safari 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.170
 and you can see we are there 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.840
 his bets on the desk 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.760
 1 i configured so google 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.620
 chrome and firefox if i'm going to launch 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.390
 google chrome bones 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.459
 he goes automatically to the desk 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.430
 number 2 and finally if I just launched 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.470
 firefox hop it goes automatically on the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.000
 office number 3 obviously you 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.709
 can do this with all the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.239
 applications that you have on your mac 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.220
 not only with browsers 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.750
 so I can very well come configured 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.540
 for example twitter facetime 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.920
 imessage etc that was all that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.310
 I had to introduce you to this 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.140
 video 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.030
 do not forget to leave 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.040
 comments to tell me what you 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.080
 have thought of this trick of loving the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.620
 video and follow us on facebook and 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.040
