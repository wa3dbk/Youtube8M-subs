at<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.950> point<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.309> build<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.640> need<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
at this point in the build we need to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.370 
at this point in the build we need to
decide<00:00:12.210> whether<00:00:12.480> we're<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.870> build<00:00:13.050> a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.350 
decide whether we're going to build a
hinge<00:00:13.620> point<00:00:14.010> or<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> solid<00:00:14.790> point<00:00:14.969> turnout

the way from the top of the Frog right

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.400 
the way from the top of the Frog right
down<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> end<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> switch<00:00:39.870> points<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
down to the end of the switch points and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
down to the end of the switch points and
they're<00:00:40.950> soldered<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.490> to<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.790> throw<00:00:42.120> bar<00:00:42.300> tie

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
they're soldered on to a throw bar tie

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.410 
they're soldered on to a throw bar tie
and<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> turnout<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.280> operated<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and when the turnout is operated the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.500 
and when the turnout is operated the
rail<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.650> flexes<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.130> that<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.790> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
rail just just flexes like that it's it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.410 
rail just just flexes like that it's it
hinges<00:00:48.900> on<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.350> tie<00:00:49.800> here<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.400> hinge<00:00:51.090> point

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hinges on this tie here a hinge point

hinges on this tie here a hinge point
turnout<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.200> in<00:00:52.380> which<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.890> switch

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
turnout is one in which the switch

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
turnout is one in which the switch
points<00:00:53.970> are<00:00:54.090> actually<00:00:54.210> separated<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
points are actually separated from the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
points are actually separated from the
closure<00:00:55.770> rail<00:00:56.130> so<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.790> one<00:00:56.970> piece<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
closure rail so this is one piece of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
closure rail so this is one piece of
rail<00:00:57.540> here<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.290> a<00:00:58.590> separate<00:00:59.160> piece<00:00:59.370> here

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
rail here and then a separate piece here

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.840 
rail here and then a separate piece here
and<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.290> points<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.710> actually<00:01:01.860> hinged

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and the the points are actually hinged

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
and the the points are actually hinged
like<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> hinges<00:01:04.589> fashioned<00:01:05.159> from

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
like that and the hinges fashioned from

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.630 
like that and the hinges fashioned from
using<00:01:06.240> rail<00:01:06.540> joiners<00:01:06.990> allows<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.649> to<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.430> move

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
using rail joiners allows it to to move

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.510 
using rail joiners allows it to to move
back<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:08.880> forth<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> advantage<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> hinge

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
back and forth the advantage of a hinge

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
back and forth the advantage of a hinge
point<00:01:11.850> turnout<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.870> move<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.320> little

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
point turnout is that they move a little

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920 
point turnout is that they move a little
freer<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.700> doesn't<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> whole<00:01:15.299> lot<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
freer it doesn't take a whole lot of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.100 
freer it doesn't take a whole lot of
effort<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.979> move<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:17.370> back<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> forth<00:01:18.120> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
effort to move these back and forth the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.200 
effort to move these back and forth the
downside<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> takes<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.120> more

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
downside is it takes a little bit more

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
downside is it takes a little bit more
effort<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> make<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> turn<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.159> way

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
effort to make a turn out this way

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
effort to make a turn out this way
because<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> cut<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.810> rails<00:01:25.020> off

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
because you have to cut the rails off

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620 
because you have to cut the rails off
and<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> hinge<00:01:26.490> from<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.299> couple<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and make the hinge from a couple of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.469 
and make the hinge from a couple of
railed<00:01:27.780> trainers<00:01:28.430> when<00:01:29.430> doing<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.909> solid<00:01:30.119> point

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
railed trainers when doing a solid point

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.330 
railed trainers when doing a solid point
turn<00:01:30.690> out<00:01:30.869> they're<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.440> lot<00:01:31.650> easier<00:01:32.040> because

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
turn out they're a lot easier because

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.280 
turn out they're a lot easier because
it's<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.700> simply<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.750> piece<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.140> rail

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it's just simply one piece of rail

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.770 
it's just simply one piece of rail
soldered<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.010> throw<00:01:35.280> bar<00:01:35.490> tie<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.940> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
soldered on the throw bar tie and I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
soldered on the throw bar tie and I
would<00:01:36.960> guess<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.680> vast<00:01:38.040> majority<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
would guess that the vast majority of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.250 
would guess that the vast majority of
modelers<00:01:39.240> building<00:01:39.689> turnouts<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> our

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
modelers building turnouts and our

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.070 
modelers building turnouts and our
fixtures<00:01:40.650> opt<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.280> solid<00:01:42.119> point<00:01:42.390> turnouts

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
fixtures opt for solid point turnouts

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.570 
fixtures opt for solid point turnouts
because<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> lot<00:01:43.920> easier<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.310> do

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
because there are a lot easier to do

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.670 
because there are a lot easier to do
they're<00:01:44.880> faster<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> they're<00:01:46.080> they're<00:01:46.439> more

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
they're faster and they're they're more

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.370 
they're faster and they're they're more
trouble-free<00:01:47.130> because<00:01:47.430> there's<00:01:47.580> no<00:01:48.140> joint<00:01:49.140> in

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
trouble-free because there's no joint in

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.260 
trouble-free because there's no joint in
this<00:01:49.710> rail<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.580> it's<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.759> single<00:01:50.939> piece

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this rail at all so it's a single piece

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.050 
this rail at all so it's a single piece
and<00:01:52.170> there's<00:01:52.799> enough<00:01:53.189> distance<00:01:53.820> between

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and there's enough distance between

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.359 
and there's enough distance between
where<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.630> hinges<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.070> end<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.310> the

where it hinges and the end of the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.490 
where it hinges and the end of the
points<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.330> allow<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> flex<00:01:58.200> quite

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
points to allow this to flex quite

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
points to allow this to flex quite
easily<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.009> takes<00:01:59.250> almost<00:01:59.430> no<00:01:59.700> effort<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.330> all

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
easily it takes almost no effort at all

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.010 
easily it takes almost no effort at all
to<00:02:00.750> move<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> back<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.590> forth

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
hinged point over a solid point would be

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.280 
hinged point over a solid point would be
