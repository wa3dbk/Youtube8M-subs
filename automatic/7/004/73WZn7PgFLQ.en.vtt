a brief overview about my experience

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.730 
a brief overview about my experience
with<00:00:16.170> fountain<00:00:16.619> c14<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:19.050> started<00:00:19.590> playing

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
with fountain c14 and I started playing

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.980 
with fountain c14 and I started playing
final<00:00:20.070> fantasy<00:00:20.100> 14<00:00:20.580> during<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> closed<00:00:21.750> beta

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
final fantasy 14 during the closed beta

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.920 
final fantasy 14 during the closed beta
and<00:00:22.640> I<00:00:23.640> thought<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.060> clothes<00:00:24.300> bit<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and I thought the clothes bit of the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.410 
and I thought the clothes bit of the
game<00:00:26.660> rocky<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.289> start<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.269> was

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
game rocky at that start so and I was

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.589 
game rocky at that start so and I was
hoping<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:31.019> would<00:00:31.050> fix<00:00:31.439> things

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
hoping that they would fix things

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.389 
hoping that they would fix things
by<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:32.780> time<00:00:33.050> they<00:00:33.199> released<00:00:33.590> felt<00:00:34.129> as

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
by the time they released felt as

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.670 
by the time they released felt as
important<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:37.160> I<00:00:37.280> was<00:00:37.399> just<00:00:37.579> rude

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
important but and I was just rude

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
important but and I was just rude
the<00:00:39.770> game<00:00:40.270> while

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the game while

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.810 
the game while
the<00:00:42.810> gameplay<00:00:43.380> I<00:00:43.829> thought<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.220> story<00:00:44.579> had<00:00:44.790> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the gameplay I thought the story had a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.500 
the gameplay I thought the story had a
lot<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> potential

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
lot of potential

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.810 
lot of potential
but<00:00:47.079> everything<00:00:47.469> else<00:00:47.800> was<00:00:47.949> just<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:51.190> guess

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
but everything else was just so I guess

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.500 
but everything else was just so I guess
I<00:00:52.199> am<00:00:53.199> a<00:00:53.230> little<00:00:53.320> bit<00:00:53.710> better<00:00:53.949> about<00:00:54.280> how<00:00:54.730> long

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
I am a little bit better about how long

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.049 
I am a little bit better about how long
has<00:00:55.719> he<00:00:55.750> turned<00:00:55.989> I<00:00:56.199> was<00:00:56.320> beginning<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.579> they

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
has he turned I was beginning but they

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.620 
has he turned I was beginning but they
have<00:00:58.300> teams<00:00:58.870> looking

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
have teams looking

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.110 
have teams looking
last<00:01:00.230> year

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.660 

give<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:05.260> technology

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
give more technology

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.910 
give more technology
and<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.299> want<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.540> also<00:01:07.689> show<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.049> changes<00:01:08.619> they

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
made

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.160 
made
that<00:01:10.979> might<00:01:11.399> have<00:01:11.729> happened<00:01:12.149> in

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
that might have happened in

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.550 
that might have happened in
hopefully<00:01:14.770> they've<00:01:15.009> done<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.250> lot<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.520> changes

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
hopefully they've done a lot of changes

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
hopefully they've done a lot of changes
so<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.590> would<00:01:18.159> like<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.369> stop

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:04:20.890 

welcome

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:05:11.270 

you

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.189 

so<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.520> was<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.879> opening<00:05:13.000> movie<00:05:13.689> a<00:05:13.720> final

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
so that was the opening movie a final

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.330 
so that was the opening movie a final
fantasy<00:05:14.620> 14<00:05:15.599> it<00:05:16.650> looks<00:05:17.650> like<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:17.949> has<00:05:18.069> a<00:05:18.099> lot<00:05:18.310> of

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
fantasy 14 it looks like it has a lot of

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.610 
fantasy 14 it looks like it has a lot of
potential<00:05:18.759> but<00:05:18.969> the<00:05:19.270> game<00:05:19.479> ended<00:05:19.810> up<00:05:19.990> flopping

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
potential but the game ended up flopping

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.619 
potential but the game ended up flopping
I<00:05:20.919> think<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.460> was<00:05:21.490> rated<00:05:22.060> one<00:05:22.090> of<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.360> worst

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
I think it was rated one of the worst

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:28.920 
I think it was rated one of the worst
video<00:05:22.900> games<00:05:23.229> of<00:05:24.000> 2010<00:05:26.159> so<00:05:27.419> that's<00:05:28.419> it<00:05:28.599> for<00:05:28.810> my
