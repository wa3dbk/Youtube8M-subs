00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.609
 pickaxe is the last of the series there 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.809

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.320
 did not give you the figurine of 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.640
 ectoplasm at because last time 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.330
 not terrible at all so I did not 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.560

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.070

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.300

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.050
 to rot the booster exagrid but good 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.130

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.750
 is supposed to give us a good pick 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.120
 I cross my fingers to make it the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 case now I leave the chance to 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.560
 hazard 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.900

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.090
 impossible but you never know 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.090

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.230
