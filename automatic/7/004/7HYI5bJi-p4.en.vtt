00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 in this opportunity we are going to see 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.359
 tech genius let's see what 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.160
 which is the types of muscle tissue the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.080
 muscle axis types let's go 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.150
 showing smooth muscle presence 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 Smooth musculature is for action 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.529
 completely involuntary that is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.109
 Presents in hollow visors and cups 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.300
 blood this case is the stomach 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.800
 present three muscle layers 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 which present their different version 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 direction what generates the possibility 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.269
 that you can contract and modify your 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.579
 way in its contract function and that at 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.230
 observe the presence of tissue 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.760
 cardiac striate 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.250
 let's listen to action marquez 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 Involuntary is present in the heart 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.489
 and main vessels in the case of passage 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.079
 orta and pulmonary veins the fiber 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.989
 muscular is presented in the layer 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.750
 intermediate that is formed by a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.059
 myocardial muscle fibers that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 contracts before birth the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.649
 individual in the case of muscle 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.260
 striated skeletal is for action 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.049
 volunteer completely voluntary and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.680
 conscious this ocular tissue presents 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.080
 fibers arranged 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.700
 along the axis of the structure in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.400
 which is social this case the axis 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.160
 present in the upper member his 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.950
 fever are disposed from a point of 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.600
 belly origin to a point of 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.070
 insertion that is present by a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.070
 insertion tendon 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.470
 within the types of muscles that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.480
 let's find the body according to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.550
 the morphology that they can present 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.420
 we are in the presence of a muscle 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.140
 flat is the pectoralis major muscle 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.910
 nucleus that originates from that from 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.480
 bones like the clavicle and the sternum 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:50.550
 arranging fibers towards the area of ​​the 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.560
 humerus as indicated in this image on 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.930
 muscular belly of these muscles 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.630
 flat is not something very thick what 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.170
 allows to detach in the extension of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.840
 chest 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 as well as external oblique muscle that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.610
 reaches subsequently inserted meza 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 aponeurosis of white connective tissue 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.910
 which allows a better suspend and sacyr 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.250
 within the characteristics of the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.370
 muscles in respect to their morphology 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.069
 let's find vice-preferential muscles 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.069
 this muscle that is practiced is very 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.629
 similar to a use and takes the nomenclature 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.189
 of the fusiform type muscle inside 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.739
 also of the classifications that 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.019
 we find in the morphology we are going to 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.349
 find also the type muscles 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.349
 uniform muscles of uniform type 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.720
 They are shaped like a pen and have their 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.109
 fibers very similar to them what is 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.319
 presents is the rectus femoris muscle the 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.959
 which is a connective tissue 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.540
 who can formulate pores is up to 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.030
 insertion tendon from it towards the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 lateral fibers come off in 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.819
 directions other than fibers that 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.769
 let's find in the middle area 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.159
 within the morphology of the muscles 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.799
 we have to find the muscles of type 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.599
 sphincter or in circular form these 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.319
 muscles of the scissor points 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.569
 insertion in the location what it issues 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.650
 that muscle contraction can close 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.980
 the inner area we have two examples 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.480
 link muscles hide from coral that the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.480
 that closes the upper lips and 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.219
 inferior and we also have the presence 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.219
 of orbicular muscle of the eyes 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.660
 let's explain then and achieve 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.210
 understand how is the operation 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.400
 muscle to allow movement 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.560
 as an example let's analyze what is 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.370
 the biceps brachii the muscle seen 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.710
 back and has as its name indicates 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.300
 biceps has two heads a head 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.300
 short that in which striking 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.790
 and a long head that is what 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.580
 presented 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.000
 at this time 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.269
 the short house will come particularly to 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.510
 insert here 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.600
 in the process by scapula chords 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.990
 and the long head will continue 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.569
 through the groove of interacting charge up 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:34.370
 insert in a see as a speed 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.150
 his big scream and 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.150
 Y 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:43.080
 has two heads 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.630
 and this is the continuation would have / 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.330
 biceps muscle but it's going to end 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.370
 in a single insertion that is in the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.370
 thin tuberosity 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.280
 that if we articulate it 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.230
 lohan then finish the biceps 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.140
 inserting itself in this which is the 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.200
 tuberosity in radius therefore the 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:10.410
 shortening we go to the muscle the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.410
 shortening of these muscle fibers 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.740
 remember that these are fibers 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.600
 muscles has the possibility of 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.970
 shortened that has been described to be 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.940
 can be shortened by up to 50 percent 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.460
 of the length of their fibers they will generate in 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.949
 definitive 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.949
 the mobility of this one 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.900
 logically it is accompanied by urine 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.900
 allowing then this muscle 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.550
 allowing then the type bending
