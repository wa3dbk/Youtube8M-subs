00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
well this bar is a little bit bigger

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.770 
well this bar is a little bit bigger
than<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.520> savage<00:02:25.790> octane<00:02:26.330> yeah<00:02:31.630> that's<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
than the savage octane yeah that's the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.830 
than the savage octane yeah that's the
1/8<00:02:33.080> scale<00:02:33.230> savage<00:02:33.950> octane<00:02:34.340> truck<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.630> Yeti

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
1/8 scale savage octane truck the Yeti

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.740 
1/8 scale savage octane truck the Yeti
has<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.170> longer<00:02:36.500> wheelbase<00:02:36.860> on<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.510> which<00:02:38.510> way

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
has a longer wheelbase on it which way

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.930 
has a longer wheelbase on it which way
is<00:02:38.810> there<00:02:39.020> about<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.260> same<00:02:39.640> here<00:02:40.640> -<00:02:40.790> you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
is there about the same here - you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.430 
is there about the same here - you
always<00:02:41.150> say<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.510> bit<00:02:41.630> more<00:02:41.660> stable<00:02:42.050> and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
always say it's a bit more stable and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.530 
always say it's a bit more stable and
it'll<00:02:42.620> also<00:02:42.709> be<00:02:42.950> faster<00:02:43.459> than<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.819> savage

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
it'll also be faster than the savage

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.750 
it'll also be faster than the savage
octane<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.680> lot<00:02:45.830> less<00:02:46.040> maintenance<00:02:46.250> good

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
octane and a lot less maintenance good

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.449 
octane and a lot less maintenance good
it's<00:02:46.850> electric<00:02:47.239> party<00:02:47.630> what<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.920> Yeti

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
it's electric party what is this Yeti

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.420 
it's electric party what is this Yeti
like<00:02:50.120> compared<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.110> old<00:02:51.260> URI<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.220> new

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
like compared to the old URI the new

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.550 
like compared to the old URI the new
Yeti<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.540> its<00:02:53.690> size<00:02:53.900> will<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.410> lot

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
Yeti because of its size will be a lot

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.590 
Yeti because of its size will be a lot
more<00:02:54.739> stable<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.340> drive<00:02:55.550> than<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.150> old<00:02:56.390> one

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
more stable to drive than the old one

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.870 
more stable to drive than the old one
especially<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:57.590> rough<00:02:57.950> terrain<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.640> doing

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
especially on rough terrain and doing

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.750 
especially on rough terrain and doing
jumps<00:02:59.440> so<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.500> know<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:00.950> new<00:03:01.220> Yeti<00:03:01.580> will

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
jumps so you know the the new Yeti will

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.630 
jumps so you know the the new Yeti will
be<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.940> lot<00:03:02.420> more<00:03:02.450> stable<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.110> way<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
be a lot more stable in that way and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.949 
be a lot more stable in that way and
also<00:03:04.819> I<00:03:05.060> think<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:05.330> just<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.780> its

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
also I think it's just because of its

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.259 
also I think it's just because of its
size<00:03:06.080> it's<00:03:06.350> more<00:03:06.560> impressive<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:07.190> look<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.489> but

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
size it's more impressive to look at but

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.160 
size it's more impressive to look at but
more<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.540> an<00:03:08.630> eye-catcher<00:03:09.760> speed<00:03:10.760> wise<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
more of an eye-catcher speed wise the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.870 
more of an eye-catcher speed wise the
new<00:03:12.350> one<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.860> supposed<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.280> be<00:03:13.340> faster<00:03:13.760> than

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
new one is supposed to be faster than

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.220 
new one is supposed to be faster than
the<00:03:14.000> old<00:03:14.150> one<00:03:14.360> we'll<00:03:14.570> have<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.870> put<00:03:15.079> them

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
the old one we'll have to put them

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.880 
the old one we'll have to put them
together<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.709> see<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.910> prove<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.269> yeah<00:03:18.110> Jordan
