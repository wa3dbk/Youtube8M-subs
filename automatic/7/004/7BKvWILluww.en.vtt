00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
peyto trial which permitted us to make

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.800 
peyto trial which permitted us to make

memo dynamically stable but had

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.919 
memo dynamically stable but had

right ventricular overload on imaging

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.989 
right ventricular overload on imaging
those<00:01:40.539> patients<00:01:41.079> should<00:01:41.649> be<00:01:41.829> monitored<00:01:42.429> but

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
those patients should be monitored but

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.450 
those patients should be monitored but
not<00:01:43.329> necessarily<00:01:43.960> treated<00:01:44.530> with<00:01:44.859> primary

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
not necessarily treated with primary

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.450 
not necessarily treated with primary
reperfusion<00:01:46.060> therapy<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:47.409> can<00:01:47.710> be<00:01:47.920> done<00:01:48.189> as

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
reperfusion therapy this can be done as

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.730 
reperfusion therapy this can be done as
a<00:01:48.490> rescue<00:01:49.119> treatment<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:50.109> this<00:01:50.289> was<00:01:50.469> a<00:01:50.499> very

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
a rescue treatment so this was a very

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.279 
a rescue treatment so this was a very
important<00:01:51.490> issue<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:52.060> think<00:01:52.329> this<00:01:52.749> will<00:01:52.929> be

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
important issue and I think this will be

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.260 
important issue and I think this will be
one<00:01:53.319> of<00:01:53.499> the<00:01:53.740> highlights<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.999> these

one of the highlights of this of these

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.200 
one of the highlights of this of these
guidelines<00:01:55.859> what<00:01:56.859> are<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.429> other<00:01:57.670> key

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
guidelines what are the other key

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.379 
guidelines what are the other key

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.219 
prognosis and also for the treatment I
would<00:02:04.179> say<00:02:04.569> that<00:02:04.889> the<00:02:05.889> possibility<00:02:06.850> to

would say that the possibility to

would say that the possibility to
classify<00:02:08.229> patients<00:02:08.500> at<00:02:09.369> low<00:02:10.030> risk<00:02:10.300> with

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.920 
have pulmonary embolism well I know that
the<00:02:43.780> most<00:02:44.080> important<00:02:44.800> message<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.760> then<00:02:46.300> about

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
the most important message is then about

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.530 
the most important message is then about
the<00:02:47.200> new<00:02:47.590> oral<00:02:48.220> anticoagulation<00:02:49.030> drugs

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
the new oral anticoagulation drugs

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.949 
the new oral anticoagulation drugs
because<00:02:50.050> it's<00:02:50.400> recently<00:02:51.400> large<00:02:52.000> they<00:02:52.390> are<00:02:52.660> all

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
because it's recently large they are all

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.150 
because it's recently large they are all
recently<00:02:53.830> launched<00:02:54.510> they<00:02:55.510> are<00:02:55.660> being<00:02:55.959> used

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
recently launched they are being used

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.280 
recently launched they are being used
for<00:02:57.160> pulmonary<00:02:57.489> embolism<00:02:58.300> as<00:02:58.450> well<00:02:58.660> yes<00:02:59.019> and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
for pulmonary embolism as well yes and

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.809 
for pulmonary embolism as well yes and
in<00:02:59.410> fact<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.800> is<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.040> second<00:03:00.489> thing<00:03:00.670> that

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
in fact this is the second thing that

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.900 
in fact this is the second thing that
arrived<00:03:01.150> very<00:03:01.420> late<00:03:01.750> because<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:03.310> approvals

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
arrived very late because the approvals

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.090 
arrived very late because the approvals
for<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.390> picks<00:03:04.780> are<00:03:04.959> banned<00:03:05.140> for<00:03:05.319> example<00:03:05.830> and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
for a picks are banned for example and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.460 
for a picks are banned for example and
the<00:03:06.310> bigot<00:03:06.610> Ron<00:03:06.819> were<00:03:07.299> just<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.840> couple<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.290> days

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
the bigot Ron were just a couple of days

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.650 
the bigot Ron were just a couple of days
before<00:03:08.680> we<00:03:08.890> closed<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.519> whole<00:03:09.730> document<00:03:10.150> so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
before we closed the whole document so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.030 
before we closed the whole document so
we<00:03:10.690> had<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.110> modify<00:03:11.290> some<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:11.830> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
we had to modify some of the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.580 
we had to modify some of the
recommendations<00:03:12.760> just<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.299> show<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:14.290> now<00:03:14.530> we

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
recommendations just to show that now we

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.699 
recommendations just to show that now we
have<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.220> much<00:03:15.819> simpler<00:03:16.299> way<00:03:16.480> much<00:03:17.140> simpler

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
have a much simpler way much simpler

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.539 
have a much simpler way much simpler
alternative<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.420> previous

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
alternative to the previous

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.600 
alternative to the previous
anticoagulation<00:03:21.989> management<00:03:23.130> with<00:03:24.130> oral

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
anticoagulation management with oral

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.520 
anticoagulation management with oral
drugs<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.269> can<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.720> started<00:03:26.019> from<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.500> very

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
drugs that can be started from the very

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.590 
drugs that can be started from the very
beginning<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.430> after<00:03:27.670> diagnosis<00:03:28.420> this

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
beginning just after diagnosis this

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.160 
beginning just after diagnosis this
refers<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.230> course<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.650> apixaban<00:03:30.190> rivaroxaban

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
refers of course to apixaban rivaroxaban

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.020 
refers of course to apixaban rivaroxaban
so<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.410> will<00:03:32.650> make<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.340> lights<00:03:33.670> of

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
so this will make the lights of

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.140 
so this will make the lights of
physicians<00:03:34.900> easier<00:03:35.530> but<00:03:35.799> also<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.940> will

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
physicians easier but also it will

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.030 
physicians easier but also it will
improve<00:03:37.510> safety<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.230> patients<00:03:38.650> because

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
improve safety of the patients because

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.099 
improve safety of the patients because
the<00:03:39.910> risk<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.269> bleeding<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.900> these

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
the risk of bleeding with these

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.380 
the risk of bleeding with these
compounds<00:03:41.500> seems<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.459> be<00:03:42.609> lower<00:03:42.760> than<00:03:43.060> with

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
compounds seems to be lower than with

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.370 
compounds seems to be lower than with
traditional<00:03:43.989> ones

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
traditional ones

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.160 
traditional ones

be very helpful for our physicians and
they<00:03:50.470> should<00:03:50.799> read<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.310> completely<00:03:51.910> thank<00:03:52.600> you

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
they should read it completely thank you

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.920 
they should read it completely thank you
very<00:03:52.930> much<00:03:53.170> thank<00:03:53.799> you
