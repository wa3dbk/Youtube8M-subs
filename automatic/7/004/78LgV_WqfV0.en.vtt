00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
who knows it's another half but I think

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.840

Notre Dame is really playing great
defense<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.510> think<00:02:23.720> offensively<00:02:24.260> it's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
defense and I think offensively it's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.440 
defense and I think offensively it's
affecting<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.490> way<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.790> corner<00:02:26.210> plates

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
affecting the way the corner plates

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.430 
affecting the way the corner plates
