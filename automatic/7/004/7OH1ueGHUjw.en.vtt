and shutdown between the Mac Mini my old
Mac<00:00:12.090> Mini<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> new<00:00:13.080> quad-core<00:00:13.769> iMac<00:00:14.269> so

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
Mac Mini and the new quad-core iMac so

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.910 
Mac Mini and the new quad-core iMac so
the<00:00:15.389> specs<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.870> these<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.320> machines<00:00:16.470> are

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
the specs on these two machines are

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.849 
the specs on these two machines are
fairly<00:00:17.340> similar<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.119> did<00:00:18.960> upgrade<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.500> RAM<00:00:19.619> on

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
fairly similar I did upgrade the RAM on

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.429 
fairly similar I did upgrade the RAM on
the<00:00:19.890> Mac<00:00:20.130> Mini<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:20.970> four<00:00:21.240> gigs<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:22.230> is

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the Mac Mini so it's at four gigs it is

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.179 
the Mac Mini so it's at four gigs it is
running<00:00:22.710> an<00:00:22.980> Intel<00:00:23.460> Core<00:00:23.880> 2<00:00:23.910> Duo<00:00:25.039> processor<00:00:26.039> at

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
running an Intel Core 2 Duo processor at

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.060 
running an Intel Core 2 Duo processor at
-<00:00:26.599> 2.0<00:00:27.800> gigahertz<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:30.140> then<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.289> 120

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
- 2.0 gigahertz and then it has 120

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.290 
- 2.0 gigahertz and then it has 120
gigabyte<00:00:32.550> hard<00:00:32.730> drive<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.059> iMac<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
gigabyte hard drive and then the iMac is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.680 
gigabyte hard drive and then the iMac is
again<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> quad<00:00:36.930> core<00:00:37.170> i5<00:00:37.940> I'm<00:00:38.940> also<00:00:39.210> four<00:00:39.480> gigs

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
again a quad core i5 I'm also four gigs

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.619 
again a quad core i5 I'm also four gigs
of<00:00:39.809> RAM<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> 500<00:00:41.399> gigabyte<00:00:41.760> hard<00:00:41.790> drive<00:00:42.090> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
of RAM with a 500 gigabyte hard drive so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.110 
of RAM with a 500 gigabyte hard drive so
let's<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.070> start<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
let's see if we can start these up and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.900 
let's see if we can start these up and
I'm<00:00:45.450> gonna<00:00:45.600> press<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> power<00:00:46.379> buttons<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I'm gonna press the power buttons at the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.010 
I'm gonna press the power buttons at the
same<00:00:48.090> time<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.170> ready<00:00:50.600> let<00:00:51.600> me<00:00:51.629> find

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
same time here we go ready let me find

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.670 
same time here we go ready let me find
it<00:00:52.170> there<00:00:52.410> ready<00:00:52.949> set<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> go

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.830 

all<00:01:00.680> right<00:01:01.130> so<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.760> deeper<00:01:02.180> sound<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:02.690> can

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
all right so the deeper sound you can

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.830 
all right so the deeper sound you can
see<00:01:03.020> is<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.470> iMac<00:01:03.980> because<00:01:04.520> it<00:01:04.670> has<00:01:04.850> better

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
see is the iMac because it has better

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.770 
see is the iMac because it has better
speakers<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.880> Apple<00:01:08.690> chime<00:01:10.780> sounded

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
speakers so it the Apple chime sounded

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.050 
speakers so it the Apple chime sounded
earlier<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.250> could<00:01:13.370> see<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> IMAX

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
earlier and you could see the IMAX

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.920 
earlier and you could see the IMAX
already<00:01:15.670> showing<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.850> Apple<00:01:17.150> logo<00:01:17.300> there's<00:01:17.840> a

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
already showing the Apple logo there's a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.670 
already showing the Apple logo there's a
blue<00:01:18.200> screen<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.120> we're<00:01:20.120> started<00:01:20.660> up<00:01:20.780> that's

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
blue screen and we're started up that's

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.110 
blue screen and we're started up that's
very<00:01:22.160> impressive

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
very impressive

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.170 
very impressive
again<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.229> reformatted<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.250> hard<00:01:25.640> drive<00:01:25.910> on

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
again I reformatted the hard drive on

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.600 
again I reformatted the hard drive on
the<00:01:26.390> Mac<00:01:26.540> Mini<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.680> iMac<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.130> brand<00:01:28.460> new

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
the Mac Mini and the iMac is brand new

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.570 
the Mac Mini and the iMac is brand new
so<00:01:29.120> these<00:01:29.330> are<00:01:29.570> as<00:01:29.840> if<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.320> had<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:31.009> these<00:01:31.340> two

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
so these are as if you had on these two

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
so these are as if you had on these two
machines<00:01:32.770> stock<00:01:33.970> brand<00:01:34.970> new<00:01:35.180> from<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
machines stock brand new from the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.240 
machines stock brand new from the
factory<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.390> quite<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:39.110> difference

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
factory and that is quite a difference

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.830 
factory and that is quite a difference
and<00:01:41.440> finally<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.710> Mac<00:01:42.979> Mini<00:01:43.009> starts<00:01:43.670> up<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.720> as

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
and finally the Mac Mini starts up so as

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.620 
and finally the Mac Mini starts up so as
you<00:01:44.930> can<00:01:45.050> see<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.820> quad-core<00:01:46.820> iMac<00:01:47.180> quite<00:01:47.600> a

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
you can see the quad-core iMac quite a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.210 
you can see the quad-core iMac quite a
bit<00:01:47.900> quicker<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.360> next<00:01:50.540> test<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:51.229> we're

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
bit quicker so the next test is we're

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.100 
bit quicker so the next test is we're
just<00:01:52.250> gonna<00:01:52.430> do<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.729> restart<00:01:53.330> on<00:01:53.660> both<00:01:53.899> machines

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
just gonna do a restart on both machines

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.840 
just gonna do a restart on both machines
oh<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:56.390> just<00:01:58.060> click<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.240> again<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:01.280> two<00:02:01.580> one

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
oh I just click this again you two one

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.680 
oh I just click this again you two one
and<00:02:02.210> go

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.480 

wow<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:07.220> look<00:02:07.520> like<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.940> time<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.509> Mac<00:02:08.690> Mini

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
wow so look like that time the Mac Mini

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.760 
wow so look like that time the Mac Mini
shut<00:02:10.490> down<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> little<00:02:11.180> quicker<00:02:11.390> but<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:15.290> iMac

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
shut down a little quicker but the iMac

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.010 
shut down a little quicker but the iMac
is<00:02:16.010> still<00:02:16.400> starting<00:02:17.000> up<00:02:17.150> quite<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.600> bit<00:02:17.780> quicker

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
is still starting up quite a bit quicker

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.100 
is still starting up quite a bit quicker
I<00:02:18.319> mean<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> slight<00:02:19.360> every<00:02:20.360> second<00:02:20.810> -

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
I mean it was a slight every second -

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.750 
I mean it was a slight every second -
quicker<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.740> shutdown<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.280> think<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
quicker on the shutdown I think but the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.990 
quicker on the shutdown I think but the
startup<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.480> where<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.959> Mac<00:02:27.140> Mini<00:02:27.670> loses<00:02:28.670> so

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
startup is where the Mac Mini loses so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.890 
startup is where the Mac Mini loses so
were<00:02:29.500> restarted<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.640> iMac<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.450> then<00:02:32.750> that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
were restarted on the iMac and then that

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.570 
were restarted on the iMac and then that
committee<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:34.040> still<00:02:34.459> at<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.910> Apple<00:02:35.810> logo

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
committee is still at the Apple logo

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.540 
committee is still at the Apple logo
