00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
to be persuaded to quite a bit well I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.490 
to be persuaded to quite a bit well I
think<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.389> can<00:02:48.569> get<00:02:48.720> too<00:02:48.900> clever<00:02:49.139> at<00:02:49.349> this

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
think you can get too clever at this

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.080 
think you can get too clever at this
game<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:49.980> think<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.370> maybe<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.879> think

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
game and I think that maybe you think

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.490 
game and I think that maybe you think
that<00:02:51.299> you're<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.780> championship<00:02:52.319> manager

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
that you're just a championship manager

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.440 
that you're just a championship manager
or<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> football<00:02:53.340> league<00:02:53.489> manager<00:02:53.909> or<00:02:53.940> whatever

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
or a football league manager or whatever

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.890 
or a football league manager or whatever
for<00:02:55.379> me<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.889> just<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.239> important<00:02:57.720> that

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
for me I just really it's important that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.869 
for me I just really it's important that
where<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.139> go<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.739> think<00:02:58.829> that's<00:02:59.159> important<00:02:59.670> that

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
where I go I think that's important that

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.759 
where I go I think that's important that
I'm<00:03:00.359> gonna<00:03:00.599> run<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> team<00:03:01.139> exactly<00:03:01.620> our<00:03:01.739> I

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
I'm gonna run the team exactly our I

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.559 
I'm gonna run the team exactly our I
want<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.129> run<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.519> doesn't<00:03:03.090> matter<00:03:03.329> what

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
want to run it and doesn't matter what

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.970 
want to run it and doesn't matter what
level<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.930> think<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.349> if<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.739> club's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
level I think that if the club's

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.610 
level I think that if the club's
ambitious<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:06.359> I've<00:03:06.540> met<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.019> Chairman<00:03:07.379> once

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
ambitious and I've met the Chairman once

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.520 
ambitious and I've met the Chairman once

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
here and he's very ambitious and I've

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920 
here and he's very ambitious and I've
promised<00:03:11.459> him<00:03:11.639> that<00:03:11.670> I'm<00:03:11.939> skill<00:03:12.269> as<00:03:12.540> hungry<00:03:12.900> as

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930
