00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.410
 hi youtube, how were you? 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.930
 be very good 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:15.049
 because I have the analysis of the late Joseph 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:18.080
 breaks mw2 0711 and let's start by seeing your 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:22.540
 physical details and we see their finished 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.540
 aluminum and his voice and the back 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.470
 your volume buttons will 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.860
 notifications and power button and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.860
 blocking 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.440
 and on this side we have 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:44.420
 your port for microsd cards 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:49.600
 micro usb port microphone and input 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.600
 for 3.5 mm hearing aids 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.060
 we turn on the tablet 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.890
 good 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.250
 this tablet is borrowed because of that it has not 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.170
 remembered very well the pattern of 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.230
 unlocking but there it is 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.700
 now we see its internal details 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.890
 this tablet has a cpu 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.330
 a good hertz giga 1.08 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.230
 and has a gpu 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.290
 800 gs 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.510
 and ram memory of a giga 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.510
 as well as internal memory of 8gb 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.440
 now let's see its resolution 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.950
 there it is has a screen of 7 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.610
 inches with resolution of 800 x 400 and 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.210
 a pixel density of 120 by 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.210
 inch 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.260
 very well 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.299
 now let's see how it behaves 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.299
 browsing 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.940
 it's true 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.610
 when not surfing 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.210
 it's not one of those strengths since 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.120
 the wifi does not have a very good reach that 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:28.490
 let's say what makes navigation 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:33.490
 be a bit slow and sometimes even a 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.490
 both clumsy or annoying 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.360
 perhaps one of its negative points is 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.230
 Wifi 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.230
 but good 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.030
 there we see a little slow 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.290
 they are also somewhat slow 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.459
 as I told you not about your strong point 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.890
 and his battery is also one of his 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.050
 negative points that lasts if you use it if 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.870
 you use the tablet 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.560
 more or less intensely it lasts as 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.560
 about four hours 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.740
 there we see the score that he gave me 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.740
 benchmark 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.990
 It would make as the uncap the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.760
 first day 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.569
 but let's see 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.500
 how it behaves with other applications 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.500
 like twitter 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.760
 here is the guide a little 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.360
 it was a little bit but there it is 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.360
 It works well 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.220
 now 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.720
 see how they move the 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.820
 Applications 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.900
 sometimes it read a bit but 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.900
 it works fast 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.880
 and what many were waiting for 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.300
 the games see how the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.300
 games 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.410
 we put yesterday's 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.689
 I think if it's pronounced 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.499
 but 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.499
 good 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:40.840
 in games basically I've only 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:45.090
 tested this 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:49.050
 and then behaves decently 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.249
 right now you do not do the thing 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.239
 more fluid than I have seen but 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:59.790
 behaves decently can play 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:02.960
 but not as fluidly as 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.960
 as a wait 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.750
 there is 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.880
 we see how in the beginning a 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.880
 bit 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.539
 but you can play well 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.480
 if they are not very demanding they will not give 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.320
 very important 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.170
 I also say this payment if you demand a 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.170
 little if I go out demanding 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.729
 the truth that I expected 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.729
 something else 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.930
 we leave 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.930
 because my mom is not so easy 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.459
 and good with 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.759
 now we check how he behaves in 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.759
 Youtube 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.350
 this equipment comes with android 4.0 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:24.709
 I think it's obvious but I'm telling you 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.709
 so as not to leave them with doubts 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.940
 and while we check the video 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:37.490
 we also see its volume 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.490
 now how does it sound 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.590
 there is 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.430
 has a regular volume without suffering 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.440
 defined but 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.870
 It is not very high 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.720
 and lives look good they look good 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.020
 colors have good definition good 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.020
 detail 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.110
 but the wifi if it leaves much to be desired 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.770
 as well as its performance 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.220
 browsing 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.590
 the truth is that it behaves 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:29.220
 and it is already 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:31.920
 So here is my analysis in the little hand 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.030
 up subscribe and leave your 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.190
 comments 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.320
 Say if you liked this tablet xxi is the 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:41.770
 they will buy or not 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.960
 and bye bye at the moment is all 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.639
 that I'm very good thanks for watching the 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.639
 video bye bye
