simple one this side and one incision on

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.639 
simple one this side and one incision on
the<00:02:06.170> edge<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.490> we<00:02:07.609> have<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:07.819> big<00:02:08.179> there<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.869> now

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
the edge so we have a big there and now

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.839 
the edge so we have a big there and now
for<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.069> feet

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
for the feet

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.990 
for the feet
remember<00:02:11.750> penguins<00:02:12.290> have<00:02:12.470> webbed<00:02:12.890> feet<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.819> we

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
remember penguins have webbed feet so we

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.440 
remember penguins have webbed feet so we
work<00:02:14.209> like<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.860> we<00:02:15.980> start<00:02:16.370> by<00:02:16.700> making<00:02:16.940> a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
work like this so we start by making a

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.370 
work like this so we start by making a
small<00:02:18.110> triangle<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.220> we<00:02:19.790> pull<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.150> one<00:02:20.390> next

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
small triangle and we pull this one next

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.610 
small triangle and we pull this one next
smaller<00:02:22.190> incisions<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.810> give<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.079> that<00:02:24.110> wedge

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
smaller incisions to give it that wedge

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.360 
smaller incisions to give it that wedge
look<00:02:24.980> discard<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.599> second<00:02:27.079> one<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.980> now<00:02:28.160> that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
look discard the second one and now that

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
look discard the second one and now that
we<00:02:28.459> have<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.700> couple<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.180> web<00:02:29.420> tools

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
we have a couple of web tools

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.550 
we have a couple of web tools
