00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.880
 some circumstance this tweet we 're going 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 to be done with the following application 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.099
 it's called alkaline line or alkaline such and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 how do you see it there 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 Look it within what is and and and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.099
 install once you have it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.380
 installed you will come to what they are 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.920
 the settings of your phone or series or 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.600
 settings as you want to call 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 once entering this section in the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 part of below we will find what 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 are the configurations of this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.430
 application that we just installed it 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.260
 we will give a click on this side 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 regularly by default when you the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 Installations is enabled 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 any change that you make here 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.760
 left side on top 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
 you always have to give him gray spring 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.200
 so that in that way obviously the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.300
 change take defect 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.670
 well once I restart my phone 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 you realize that the battery in the part 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 top right has changed let's 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120
 return to what are the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.770
 configurations where we were 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.020
 I want to show you what some are 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.479
 other issues regarding this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.210
 application if I enter the section of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.910
 appearance where he says themes on this side 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.340
 we could change what is the 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.960
 same I return to the previous screen 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.660
 by clicking on the top 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.490
 left and then in that same 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.220
 top left I'm going to give 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.170
 gray spring so the phone 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.020
 restart and in this way the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.790
 issue of what the battery is now a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.580
 time the phone turned on as you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.410
 you will realize the subject has changed and in 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.259
 this moment we are presented with the 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.420
 we just selected now 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.270
 if I return to the application to the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.440
 section where we had to 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.210
 select a topic regarding the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.670
 battery you can tell that nothing 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.649
 more there are two this is because you must 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.180
 install the ones you want to 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.220

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.680

 choose the one you like the most 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.420
 good the way to install the themes is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.340
 in what would be looking for 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.920

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.530

 a list of names of which are my 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.310
 favorites so that obviously you 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.890
 look for threads install by yourself 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.840
 when we have Syria open if 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.810

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 from above you know what you can do 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.720
 searches in this case I will search by
