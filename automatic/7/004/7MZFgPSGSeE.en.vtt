00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
skip a whole step you could just get to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.279 
skip a whole step you could just get to
do<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> easy<00:00:23.430> part<00:00:23.880> because<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.810> first<00:00:25.080> part

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289

do the easy part because the first part
is<00:00:25.350> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.590> hard<00:00:25.769> ish<00:00:26.660> want<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> get<00:00:27.869> past

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
is kind of hard ish want to get past

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.480 
is kind of hard ish want to get past
it's<00:00:28.230> good<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.590> there<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> possible<00:00:29.340> way<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it's good so there is a possible way to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.940 
it's good so there is a possible way to
get<00:00:29.699> our<00:00:29.820> hostiles<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.949> map<00:00:33.649> not<00:00:34.649> just

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
get our hostiles on this map not just

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
get our hostiles on this map not just
some<00:00:35.100> multiplayer<00:00:35.480> time<00:00:36.480> trials<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.110> there

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
some multiplayer time trials I is there

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.680 
some multiplayer time trials I is there
a<00:00:37.320> time<00:00:37.380> trails<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.219> don't<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:39.570> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a time trails on this I don't I think so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.690 
a time trails on this I don't I think so
but<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> actual<00:00:40.800> st.<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.579> as

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but it's not like the actual st. so as

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.180 
but it's not like the actual st. so as
you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.050> blocked<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.040> your

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you can see this is blocked to get your

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.260 
you can see this is blocked to get your
way<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.489> match<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> the

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
on multiplayer you don't even have to do

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.840 
on multiplayer you don't even have to do
that<00:05:42.419> hard<00:05:42.990> part<00:05:43.229> over<00:05:43.410> here<00:05:43.740> you<00:05:44.520> could<00:05:44.700> just

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
that hard part over here you could just

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.990 
that hard part over here you could just
like<00:05:45.060> walk<00:05:45.300> through<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.810> do<00:05:45.960> it<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:46.789> so<00:05:47.789> yeah

like walk through and do it and so yeah

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.580 
like walk through and do it and so yeah
that's<00:05:48.210> that's<00:05:48.570> prove<00:05:48.900> they<00:05:49.050> can<00:05:49.110> do<00:05:49.410> it<00:05:49.500> on

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
that's that's prove they can do it on

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.330 
that's that's prove they can do it on
both<00:05:49.830> on<00:05:50.960> hostiles<00:05:51.960> in<00:05:52.140> time<00:05:52.320> trials<00:05:52.530> and<00:05:53.159> just

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
both on hostiles in time trials and just

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.620 
both on hostiles in time trials and just
for<00:05:53.520> fun<00:05:53.550> i'm<00:05:53.729> going<00:05:54.030> to<00:05:54.090> see<00:05:54.210> if<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.360> could<00:05:54.419> do

that<00:06:26.710> building<00:06:27.130> that's<00:06:27.340> by<00:06:27.820> there<00:06:28.030> but<00:06:28.210> you

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
that building that's by there but you

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.520 
that building that's by there but you
could<00:06:28.420> crawl<00:06:28.660> around<00:06:28.780> here<00:06:29.290> and<00:06:29.520> then<00:06:31.530> i'm

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
could crawl around here and then i'm

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.730 
could crawl around here and then i'm
going<00:06:32.650> to<00:06:32.710> try<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:32.920> do<00:06:33.130> it<00:06:33.280> and<00:06:33.690> i<00:06:34.690> failed<00:06:34.990> and<00:06:35.380> i

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
going to try to do it and i failed and i

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.920 
going to try to do it and i failed and i
fell<00:06:35.950> the<00:06:36.040> map<00:06:36.210> so<00:06:37.210> that's<00:06:37.330> what<00:06:37.510> the<00:06:37.600> outside

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
fell the map so that's what the outside

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.800 
fell the map so that's what the outside
the<00:06:38.050> map<00:06:38.200> looks<00:06:38.470> like<00:06:39.120> but<00:06:40.120> if<00:06:40.210> i<00:06:40.330> made<00:06:40.540> i<00:06:40.570> would

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
the map looks like but if i made i would

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.790 
the map looks like but if i made i would
have<00:06:40.900> jumped<00:06:41.050> on<00:06:41.200> that<00:06:41.230> little<00:06:41.470> platform

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
have jumped on that little platform

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.750 
have jumped on that little platform
above<00:06:43.890> so<00:06:44.890> that's<00:06:45.040> how<00:06:45.160> I<00:06:45.190> get<00:06:45.370> on<00:06:45.400> the<00:06:45.610> map

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
above so that's how I get on the map

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.430 
above so that's how I get on the map
other<00:06:46.000> hostiles<00:06:46.510> multiply<00:06:47.110> you<00:06:47.200> don't<00:06:47.350> have

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
other hostiles multiply you don't have

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.730 
other hostiles multiply you don't have
to<00:06:47.530> do<00:06:47.680> that<00:06:47.710> part<00:06:48.490> that's<00:06:48.640> barricaded<00:06:49.300> um<00:06:49.740> so

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
to do that part that's barricaded um so

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.270 
to do that part that's barricaded um so
that's<00:06:50.920> it<00:06:51.130> guys<00:06:51.540> I'm<00:06:52.540> not<00:06:52.720> level<00:06:53.080> one<00:06:53.350> played
