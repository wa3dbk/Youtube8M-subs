00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.940
 what do you think 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.170
 the evening 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.650
 what do you think 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 I speak 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 hahahaha 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.110
 how nice it is to chew on 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.340
 but when the taste is finished it is often spit out on the street which is annoying 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.009
 chewing gum on the street Amsterdam is full of it, you think chewing gum 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.199
 I thought 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.199
 anp 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.940
 the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 what do you think about women being taught 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.960
 yes certainly when you walk through 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.580
 and 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.289
 Jan further I do not know 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.680
 intention 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.740
 the fishermen were without research by putting the butter on your head when you caught the 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.630
 in short do your shoes 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.920
 no statement about all the names, but the shortage itself is all possible 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.460
 street 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.450
 no I know you are trying too high to know 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.060
 after she with her bike but I have so many problems in the Netherlands but I had 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.420
 never dare to draft you find on the street annoying 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.340
 Do you ever want to refuse chewing gum on the street for a constant reason? 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.020
 find something yourself 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.039
 this festive year 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.200
 anyway waste 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.630
 and sometimes sat 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.230
 it originated 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.230
 throw your self can be good 9 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.500
 you find the idea talent 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 no but hearing 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 what is the solution for the championship 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.010
 or people are very annoyed by chewing gum on the street well I heard that 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.120
 is now the solution you can tell us about it 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.100
 of course we have a solution 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.140
 You can do this by accident rather than throwing it onto the street in the crem 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.760
 an appointment 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.150
 it has shown us what that looks like 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.050
 of course it's very simple 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.000
 furthermore, the burning butts and colonization are caught laterally 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.799
 one closes his turn 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.909
 and by air density 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.239
 a cradle after a few seconds to conjure up the cigarette 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.359
 there is traffic on the doctors' newspaper 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.819
 with papers 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.139
 I know you can also buy 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.109
 in what part 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.349
 and then store in traffic 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.079
 count you play at home 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.840
 and how much I really no longer throw on the street and how much does it cost 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:38.709
 well the consumer pays the two in 2 hours for this only a few kissed 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.879
 intended for companies who want to send their ugly environmental message 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.449
 I think you really think that this is the solution for good standing 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:53.409
 well what else can you do than save anp dhe and worse 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.409
 you can put it away instead of throwing it on the street 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.479
 and that's why i think this is the real solution 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.569
 you know what you sow will use 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.789
 yes i think they finished as going out to sea 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:17.079
 showed up for you there 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.829
 if you had used it yourself 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.989
 why not because it's not practices it's a nice idea but it will 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:29.499
 three minutes after measurements, every day his or her became known for being the delfth 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.819
 always with another stop it is not what it is 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.509
 no i don't think it works 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:38.239
 I personally think you are sorry I don't know 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.329
 please have fun 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.979
 yes thank you go succeed 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:48.070
 by being smarter to track people injured and educate themselves 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.509
 profit in the designated as 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.729
 bins or bins 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.639
 instead of walking a little life 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.109
 walk around 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.520
 nobody anyway though i am not always his 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.589
 What Do You Think 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:05.789
 You can use it yourself on someone else's you maybe a little month 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.839
 I like the company I do just have to be against this anyway 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.349
 on the spot it turned out to be really fun to have fun with it 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.919
 at least I know it was later with the evening time 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.209
 in this small bags and key and as flat 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.150
 that is not for you either 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.670
 I think you do taste he said I was on the street well in time
