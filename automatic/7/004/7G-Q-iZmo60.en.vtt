build some confidence early that we

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.869 
build some confidence early that we
don't<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.469> try<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.399> dig<00:00:47.700> deep

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
don't have to try and you know dig deep

at<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.059> end<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.570> figure<00:00:49.170> things<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.590> our

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
at the end to figure things out our

at the end to figure things out our
first<00:00:50.550> look<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.420> Steve<00:00:51.780> Wilson<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.770> from

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
first look at Steve Wilson right from

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.279 
first look at Steve Wilson right from
behind<00:00:53.129> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> an<00:00:54.030> unusual<00:00:54.180> style<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
behind kind of an unusual style but the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.200 
behind kind of an unusual style but the
same<00:00:58.559> result<00:00:59.010> 9<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.550> goes<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.910> late

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
same result 9 thing goes a little late

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.959 
same result 9 thing goes a little late
there<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.410> good<00:01:02.010> opening<00:01:02.340> shot<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.760> Steve

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
there for a good opening shot for Steve

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.700 
there for a good opening shot for Steve
Wilson<00:01:03.180> maybe<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.290> slow<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Wilson maybe just a little slow on the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.080 
Wilson maybe just a little slow on the
speed<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.250> why<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> ball<00:01:05.729> hooked<00:01:05.970> in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
speed and that's why the ball hooked in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
speed and that's why the ball hooked in
as<00:01:06.240> high<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.659> did<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> 9th<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
as high as it did but the 9th in as you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.330 
as high as it did but the 9th in as you
said<00:01:08.790> Mike<00:01:08.970> Durbin<00:01:09.360> did<00:01:09.540> fall<00:01:09.780> over<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.830> our

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
said Mike Durbin did fall over and our

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.050 
said Mike Durbin did fall over and our
matches<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.119> even<00:01:12.570> after<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.049> frame<00:01:14.060> season

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

he's<00:01:15.180> 28<00:01:15.479> years<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.900> age<00:01:16.549> 510<00:01:17.549> only<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> hundred

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
he's 28 years of age 510 only a hundred

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.399 
he's 28 years of age 510 only a hundred
and<00:01:18.600> fifty<00:01:18.990> five<00:01:19.170> pounds<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> big<00:01:21.000> guy

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
and fifty five pounds so not a big guy

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.780 
and fifty five pounds so not a big guy
and<00:01:22.409> he<00:01:22.530> tends<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.130> his<00:01:23.250> swing<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.670> little

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and he tends to get his swing a little

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.429 
and he tends to get his swing a little
bit<00:01:23.909> away<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.240> his<00:01:24.509> body<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.960> he<00:01:25.110> does<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
bit away from his body but he does it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.429 
bit away from his body but he does it
the<00:01:25.530> same<00:01:25.560> every<00:01:25.979> time<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> don't<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.380> he

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the same every time so I don't think he

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.670 
the same every time so I don't think he
should<00:01:28.470> change

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
should change

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.640 
should change
I<00:01:30.710> like<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.730> two<00:01:32.120> eight<00:01:32.750> ten<00:01:33.140> was<00:01:33.350> up<00:01:33.470> there

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
I like the two eight ten was up there

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.960 
I like the two eight ten was up there
for<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.860> split<00:01:34.100> second<00:01:34.520> we'll<00:01:34.640> end<00:01:34.760> up<00:01:34.820> with

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
for a split second we'll end up with

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.860 
for a split second we'll end up with
only<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.360> apron

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
only the apron

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.840 
only the apron
it<00:01:35.990> really<00:01:36.350> was<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.620> very<00:01:36.740> good<00:01:37.160> break<00:01:37.400> Mike<00:01:37.640> he

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
it really was a very good break Mike he

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.180 
it really was a very good break Mike he
had<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.750> ten<00:01:39.110> standing<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.710> two<00:01:39.950> and

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
had the to a ten standing the two and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.250 
had the to a ten standing the two and
the<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.670> ten<00:01:41.030> fell<00:01:41.360> at<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.540> last<00:01:41.810> moment

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
the and the ten fell at the last moment

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.500 
the and the ten fell at the last moment
as<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.410> said<00:01:42.650> leaves<00:01:43.640> him<00:01:43.820> with<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.970> relatively

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
as you said leaves him with a relatively

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.120 
as you said leaves him with a relatively
easy<00:01:44.720> spare<00:01:45.140> shouldn't<00:01:45.500> have<00:01:45.590> any<00:01:45.740> problem

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
easy spare shouldn't have any problem

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.710 
easy spare shouldn't have any problem
shooting<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.490> eight<00:01:46.610> pin<00:01:50.680> at<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:52.040> pin<00:01:52.720> will

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
shooting the eight pin at the a pin will

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.080 
shooting the eight pin at the a pin will
off-balance<00:01:54.350> checking<00:01:55.160> an<00:01:55.310> approach<00:01:55.640> where

off-balance checking an approach where

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.060 
off-balance checking an approach where
he<00:01:56.240> converts<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.780> with<00:01:56.930> no<00:01:57.050> trouble<00:01:57.470> making

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070

that delivery and I believe what it was

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.540 
that delivery and I believe what it was
is<00:05:32.870> that<00:05:32.900> Danny<00:05:33.230> Wiseman<00:05:33.680> just<00:05:33.950> got<00:05:34.130> short

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
is that Danny Wiseman just got short

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.430 
is that Danny Wiseman just got short
with<00:05:34.670> his<00:05:34.760> delivery<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.450> will<00:05:35.900> see<00:05:36.140> the<00:05:36.290> ball

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
with his delivery and will see the ball

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.320
