00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.060
 Hey YouTube users it's Charlie, comic con this week and I'm going to do a bunch of 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.420
 Videos related to marvel and giveaway so I wanted to do a great preview of all Avengers 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.679
 The movies are inspired by things that are about to happen. There are a few Marvel movies are not 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.679
 Will be strengthened like parents but the important thing is that there will be no avengers 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.710
 Omar Ultron Trailer I will be uploading the clipboard footage. 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.400
 Make sure you sign up for all of these things. It will be a crazy week, but here 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.390
 What happens. 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.319
 First, the most important. In the panel of the Marvel Universe will be Saturday 26 July 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.109
 At 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time. To be carried out for another two and a half hours. Most paintings are just 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.769
 One hour long. In a longer marvel as they dedicate a handful of time to each of them 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.999
 Upcoming movies. Like last year they did about 45 minutes for the winter soldier, then another 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.229
 45 for the parents, then the rest of the time for the Avengers 2. 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.079
 This year is a bit different in that they are new movies they will be like showing off 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.839
 Ants man and full on Avengers 2 supply with whole cast. Which still leaves a lot 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.530
 Of time, what is a big surprise this year? 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.579
 Marvel just announced the release dates of five new mystery films. Those are theatrical films, 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.530
 So we are talking spin-offs, Avengers consequences and new personalities. Those five are on top 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.579
 Of films that are already scheduled in phase 3 including Ant Man 17 July 2015. 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.450
 Captain America 3 May 6, 2016, then 7 more Untitled movies. These are the dates for each 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.729
 who are they. 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.729
 July 8, 2016, May 5, 2017, July 28, 2017, November 3, 2017, July 6, 2018, November 2, 2018 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.780
 And 3 May 2019. 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.149
 What is dealing with so many untitled movies. It is likely to announce at least a marvel of 3 or 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.249
 4 of them. No one expects them to announce all 7. But it is possible. 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:43.719
 The films most likely she will announce to a strange doctor, and her director but is released 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:50.719
 History. He hesitated to have it July 8, 2016, making it the first stage 3 film after the captain 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.700
 America 3. They have the actor, they found a strange doctor, but he did not sign the contract 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.749
 Until now. 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.130
 Kevin FEIGE, president of the studio said that if he signs by Saturday, he will announce 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.609
 Who is in the Marvel board. That would be the biggest surprise. 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.819
 The greatest theories now include Benedict Cumberbach, Jared Leto and Edgar Ramirez. 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.720
 After that, they will probably announce Thor 3, 3 Avengers and Guardians sequel. I 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.069
 Also expected to announce to them what the first film of stage 4 is, the first film after 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.920
 Avengers 3. 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.349
 There is a small small chance that the Black Panther movie may be announced as Inhumans Cinema. 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.069
 This is a large collection of information to dump on Hall H, but that is why the Marvel board is 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.120
 Always the best. 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.540
 As I said, I will be loaded that night. So it should be posted by midnight on a Saturday evening 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.930
 Depending on the speed of the Internet. 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.930
 Avengers 2 Trailer is a separate thing. Marvel usually does not allow people to 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.739
 Add footage from the online panel, and I still do a breakdown of it no matter what, but if 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.099
 They do not allow it to be posted online, and I add it to my video. 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.099
 Announced a marvel that what they're going to do, or try to do is release at least 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.870
 One film per year, the sequel to one new character film per year. So here is a snapshot of that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.500
 Release the schedule again, and the scrolls. 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.129
 Spring is always where they put their biggest movies, and consequences. That means summer dates 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.079
 When we'll probably see new characters. Once we get in 2017 there are 3 movies, 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.849
 So I'll probably experiment and see if it hurts the box office to release so many 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.590
 Big movies in the same year. 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.819
 If things go well, they will completely. They will probably start releasing 5 movies every two years 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.849
 Netflix also publishes Netflix offers. 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.010
 So anyone wondering about Black Panthers, Captain Miracle and other level Avengers are great 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.209
 The characters will definitely see them in the end. 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.400
 I still expect the first female-driven one to be a black widow, but I think the captain 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.239
 Marvel will be one second. 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.239
 Earlier said that FEIGE Phase 3, objectively will be about magic. Something 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.549
 You have not done any of the movies yet. If you remember the end of winter soldier, 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.870
 Baron von Strucker said we are entering the age of miracles. 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.730
 He was talking about the mutants, but miracles are also another word of magic. It was not 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.269
 It is a coincidence that HYDRA was tracking Steven Strange. I think it's interesting to sitwell 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.160
 He did not see a strange "doctor". But this does not mean that in the current continuity, Stephen Strange 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.510
 Not the supreme magician. 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.350
 But when you're thinking of Stage 3, think of him as a magician and magician magician. Stage 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.300
 3 paves the way for the multidimensional marvel of the universe, but the giant star. 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.080
 This does not mean they're going to jump into the multi-universe or visit any demon planes, 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.440
 It just means that they are building the foundation for doing so. 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.440
 FEIGE did this other interview where it made it look like a marvel I would introduce a doctor 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.400
 Strangely in the context of Avengers. Just because in his view, this is the character road 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.310
 It has been developed in the past. In comedy it's always a big part of the Illuminati stories 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.110
 A great Avengers team complained. 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.310
 That's why I think it's quite possible that the last scene credits Avengers 2 could have 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.810
 A strange moment a doctor. They already hired Scott Derrickson to guide a strange doctor 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.060
 Movie, so we know he gets a standalone.But if the president of the studio thinks 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.470
 The character that will be created through the Avengers and Avengers 2 still shoots, 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.960
 Would not it make sense to include him in some small way? 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.290
 She supports the theory that just that she will announce some big things strange doctor this 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.760
 weekend. 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.980
 The other big news that we may not be talking about is the fate of those who will direct the Avengers 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.380
 3. There is a lot of talk about that Joss Hidon will write and only produce this. Reason 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.380
 People report that because the demands meet the marvel of film making 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.100
 Is getting tricky. The films were literally marveling at what was thought of the last 3 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.130
 Years, no matter how long time to make Avengers 3. This is cumbersome. 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.480
 So usually in situations like this, you just step down from day to day directing duties 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.860
 And only work on the script and produce. They still have a great view on which gets cast, Ma 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.990
 The story and how it all looks. He'd just get more of his free time to be 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.600
 Normal human being is going back. He has a family. 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.000
 If Guus Hidon does not guide Avengers 3, who will choose the next? 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.480
 That's easy, James Gan. Whenever you see Galaxy guards in a few weeks, 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.670
 You'll see exactly why James Gan would be perfect for a great team like Avengers movie up. 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.720
 Plus, it's not as expensive as the Hidon Gauss at this point. 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.350
 He said that sings depending on how well parents do at the box office this is true, he said 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.870
 Parents will be guided 2. I have not confirmed the marvel of this film yet, but I expect them 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.330
 Declares it in a panel. Right now, it's pre-publication ticket sales are being appreciated 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.210
 Will make between 68 and $ 70 million opening weekend, if he goes crazy this number 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.310
 Can reach 80 million. 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.330
 Compare it to the winter soldier opened in about $ 95 million and the dark world bull 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.470
 Which opened at $ 85 million. Those were all of the consequences. Captain America First 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.580
 The film got only 65 million open it weekend. 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.910
 So if the guardians actually hits what they are predicting, James will definitely do it 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.350
 sequel. Can make it difficult for him to do a third Avengers movie, but only 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.610
 Depends on scheduling. It would be a bit easier to guess what a marvel 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.280
 I will do as soon as I announce the date for the 3 Avengers, which I think will happen this weekend. 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.610
 I think it will be July 2018 that registration. That would give them two more movies 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.010
 Must be done after Captain America 3. 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.890
 For those asking about Tom Hiddleston, he will not return until Thor 3, I too 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:19.820
 I think they will advertise in the panel. I do not think he's going to make it like everyone else 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.740
 He did with a huge reveal last year. He was there mostly because they were promoting 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.660
 Thor dark world. 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.030
 A small part of me believes that James Digger is going to do the [Ultron] sound for the intro and 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.890
 painting. And they will do the thing to kee, but it will be James the excavator doing a creepy [ultron] sound. 

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.930
 This is the coolest thing I think they can do, but let me know if you have another theory. 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.520
 Here are the details about my miraculous donations. 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.400
 I give up the character of Marvel Funko Pop. All you have to do to share is to be 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.240
 And leave a comment on this video. I choose the winner next week. You can choose 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.040
 Pretty much any character that is available like Iron Man or Loki. 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.360
 So a big reminder, the Marvel panel on Saturday night will load that as soon as possible. if I were
