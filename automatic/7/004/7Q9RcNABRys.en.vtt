00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
first off if runescape did go in the

guys<00:01:23.320> really<00:01:23.860> see<00:01:24.340> Microsoft<00:01:25.180> controlling

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
guys really see Microsoft controlling

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.020 
guys really see Microsoft controlling
runescape<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.500> think<00:01:26.860> more<00:01:27.100> or<00:01:27.220> less<00:01:27.370> Microsoft

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
runescape I think more or less Microsoft

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.180 
runescape I think more or less Microsoft
would<00:01:28.360> take<00:01:28.870> over<00:01:29.080> runescape<00:01:29.740> for<00:01:29.890> probably

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
would take over runescape for probably

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.100 
would take over runescape for probably
about<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.460> year<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:31.270> then<00:01:31.540> they<00:01:31.720> would<00:01:31.900> realize

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
about a year and then they would realize

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.380 
about a year and then they would realize
wow<00:01:32.800> this<00:01:33.190> is<00:01:33.340> actually<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.820> too<00:01:34.060> much<00:01:34.360> work

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
wow this is actually just too much work

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.960 
wow this is actually just too much work
for<00:01:34.780> us<00:01:35.140> let's<00:01:35.590> just<00:01:35.830> move<00:01:36.400> on<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:36.850> do

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
for us let's just move on and do

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.640 
for us let's just move on and do
something<00:01:37.360> else<00:01:37.510> more<00:01:38.020> or<00:01:38.140> less<00:01:38.170> that's<00:01:38.470> what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
something else more or less that's what

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.290 
something else more or less that's what
Microsoft<00:01:39.130> does<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:39.700> that's<00:01:39.820> why<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.030> kind<00:01:40.180> of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
Microsoft does and that's why I kind of

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.240 
Microsoft does and that's why I kind of
like<00:01:40.480> about<00:01:40.690> jagex<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:41.680> like<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.860> lot<00:01:42.130> of

to<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.220> think<00:03:38.340> it's<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.670> level<00:03:38.819> 80<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:39.480> I've

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
to I think it's a level 80 now I've

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.009 
to I think it's a level 80 now I've
known<00:03:40.799> people<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.519> get<00:03:42.239> their<00:03:42.450> characters

three weeks on runescape it gets you not

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.839 
three weeks on runescape it gets you not
so<00:03:51.690> far<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.829> first<00:03:53.099> thing<00:03:53.220> Blizzard

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
so far so the first thing Blizzard

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.250 
so far so the first thing Blizzard
wouldn't<00:03:54.120> probably<00:03:54.329> most<00:03:54.690> likely<00:03:54.750> due<00:03:55.230> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
wouldn't probably most likely due to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.440 
wouldn't probably most likely due to
runescape<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:56.130> more<00:03:56.549> or<00:03:56.639> less<00:03:56.700> dice<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.269> can

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
runescape is more or less dice I can

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.080 
runescape is more or less dice I can
basically<00:03:57.780> make<00:03:58.169> it<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.829> lot<00:03:59.010> easier<00:03:59.190> for<00:03:59.700> us<00:04:00.060> to

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
basically make it a lot easier for us to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.759 
basically make it a lot easier for us to
actually<00:04:00.329> get<00:04:00.660> ninety<00:04:00.930> nines<00:04:01.169> they<00:04:01.620> would

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
actually get ninety nines they would

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.559 
actually get ninety nines they would
probably<00:04:02.010> most<00:04:02.310> likely<00:04:02.430> say<00:04:02.970> oh<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.209> guys

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
probably most likely say oh you guys

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.629 
probably most likely say oh you guys

conclusion Blizzard will most likely

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.210 
conclusion Blizzard will most likely
make<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.720> game<00:04:57.900> easier<00:04:58.170> and<00:04:58.620> they<00:04:58.860> would<00:04:59.010> most

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
make the game easier and they would most

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.360 
make the game easier and they would most
likely<00:04:59.430> make<00:05:00.120> our<00:05:00.390> characters<00:05:00.900> into<00:05:01.770> penis

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
likely make our characters into penis

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.570 
likely make our characters into penis
lighting<00:05:02.790> people<00:05:03.450> or<00:05:03.720> more<00:05:04.500> or<00:05:04.560> less<00:05:04.710> logs<00:05:05.100> or

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.620 
have just been joking around or
something<00:05:17.160> but<00:05:17.430> like<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.670> said<00:05:17.940> if<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.360> was

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
something but like I said if it was

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.600 
something but like I said if it was
actually<00:05:19.260> talked<00:05:19.560> about<00:05:19.830> selling<00:05:20.340> runescape

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
actually talked about selling runescape

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.460 
actually talked about selling runescape
I<00:05:21.030> think<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.510> would<00:05:21.600> be<00:05:21.630> more<00:05:21.780> or<00:05:22.080> less<00:05:22.200> talked

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
I think it would be more or less talked

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.230 
I think it would be more or less talked
about<00:05:22.680> in<00:05:22.800> offices<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:23.670> I'm<00:05:23.820> not<00:05:23.970> really<00:05:24.030> sure

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240
