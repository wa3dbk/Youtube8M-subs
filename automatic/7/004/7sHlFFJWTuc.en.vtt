table<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.789> example<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.480> set<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> first

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
table for example we can set the first

we've<00:01:07.799> stored<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.729> inside<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> session<00:01:10.070> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
we've stored one inside a session that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
we've stored one inside a session that
would<00:01:11.220> mean<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.490> Alex<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.970> logged<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.330> then

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
would mean that Alex is logged in then

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.020 
would mean that Alex is logged in then
we<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.900> any<00:01:13.049> data<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.500> need<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.760> these<00:01:14.880> are

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
we can get any data we need so these are

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.810 
we can get any data we need so these are
the<00:01:15.090> fundamentals<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> user<00:01:16.200> login<00:01:16.470> system

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
the fundamentals of a user login system

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.740 
the fundamentals of a user login system
storing<00:01:17.820> something<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.299> allows<00:01:18.509> us<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
storing something that allows us to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.590 
storing something that allows us to
access<00:01:19.020> data<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:20.220> our<00:01:20.400> user<00:01:20.729> which<00:01:21.390> can

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
access data about our user which can

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
access data about our user which can
change<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.590> day<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> could<00:01:23.100> log<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.520> Alex

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
change so one day I could log in as Alex

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
change so one day I could log in as Alex
on<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.119> day<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> could<00:01:24.540> log<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:24.930> Billy<00:01:25.140> or

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
on one day I could log in as Billy or

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.859 
on one day I could log in as Billy or
another<00:01:25.650> user<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.100> log<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.490> billing

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
another user could log in as billing

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.550 
another user could log in as billing
okay<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:27.950> let's<00:01:29.720> let's<00:01:30.720> put<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.259> into<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
okay so let's let's put this into a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
okay so let's let's put this into a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
we will be doing at the very top then

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
we will be doing at the very top then
we're<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.540> able<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.960> log<00:01:58.140> users<00:01:58.530> in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
we're going to be able to log users in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.179 
we're going to be able to log users in
we<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.880> OB<00:02:00.509> start<00:02:01.079> before<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
we also want OB start before that

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
we also want OB start before that
because<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.210> we're<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.570> doing<00:02:03.719> is

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
because what we're going to be doing is

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.959 
because what we're going to be doing is
using<00:02:04.200> header<00:02:04.619> headers<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.490> header<00:02:05.729> function

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
using header headers the header function

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.690 
using header headers the header function
to<00:02:06.810> re<00:02:07.049> redirect<00:02:07.770> our<00:02:07.920> user<00:02:08.220> back<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
to re redirect our user back to the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.010 
to re redirect our user back to the
index<00:02:08.789> page<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.509> they've<00:02:09.660> logged<00:02:09.840> in

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
index page when they've logged in

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.010 
index page when they've logged in
correctly<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.879> need<00:02:12.060> OB<00:02:12.390> start<00:02:12.690> session

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
correctly so we need OB start session

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.910 
correctly so we need OB start session
start

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
start

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
start
and<00:02:14.010> now<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.370> here<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:14.850> we<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.630> can

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and now in here what we can do is we can

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.449 
and now in here what we can do is we can
say<00:02:15.960> dollar<00:02:16.290> underscore<00:02:16.770> session<00:02:19.459> user

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
say dollar underscore session user

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.850 
say dollar underscore session user
underscore<00:02:21.450> ID<00:02:21.890> equals<00:02:22.890> user<00:02:23.370> underscore<00:02:24.000> ID

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
underscore ID equals user underscore ID

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.530 
underscore ID equals user underscore ID
so<00:02:25.860> we've<00:02:25.980> grabbed<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> user<00:02:26.580> ID<00:02:26.850> from<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
so we've grabbed the user ID from the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.870 
so we've grabbed the user ID from the
user<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.170> has<00:02:28.319> correctly<00:02:29.280> entered<00:02:29.730> their

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
user that has correctly entered their

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.240 
user that has correctly entered their
username<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.510> password<00:02:30.959> now<00:02:31.770> we're<00:02:31.980> storing

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
username and password now we're storing

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.100 
username and password now we're storing
it<00:02:32.430> inside<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.760> session<00:02:33.270> called<00:02:33.510> session<00:02:33.810> ID

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
it inside a session called session ID

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.520 
it inside a session called session ID
called<00:02:34.740> user<00:02:34.980> ID<00:02:35.220> okay<00:02:36.209> now<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.290> want<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
called user ID okay now what we want to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.050 
called user ID okay now what we want to
do<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.740> say<00:02:37.890> header<00:02:40.040> location<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.280> we<00:02:41.790> want<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
do is say header location and we want to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.570 
do is say header location and we want to
go<00:02:42.180> back<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> index.php<00:02:43.230> page<00:02:43.860> we're

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
go back to the index.php page we're

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.559 
go back to the index.php page we're
already<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.300> will<00:02:45.450> just

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
already on that but this will just

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.750 
already on that but this will just
refresh<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.650> will<00:02:46.770> perform<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.280> checks<00:02:47.580> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
refresh it it will perform the checks to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.820 
refresh it it will perform the checks to
say<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.390> user<00:02:48.630> logged<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.739> will

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
say is this user logged in and it will

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.729 
say is this user logged in and it will
give<00:02:49.950> us<00:02:50.070> some<00:02:50.250> data<00:02:50.430> round<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:54.410> okay<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.440> we're

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
give us some data round so okay so we're

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.310 
give us some data round so okay so we're
pretty<00:02:55.830> much<00:02:56.010> done<00:02:56.220> there<00:02:56.489> let's<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.390> go

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
pretty much done there let's just go

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.479 
pretty much done there let's just go
back<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> our<00:02:58.709> index<00:02:59.190> dot<00:02:59.430> PHP<00:02:59.459> page<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:01.489> we

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
back to our index dot PHP page and we

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.280 
back to our index dot PHP page and we
will<00:03:03.380> create<00:03:04.380> an<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.620> statement<00:03:04.880> now<00:03:06.290> let's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
will create an if statement now let's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.810 
will create an if statement now let's
assume<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:10.530> something<00:03:10.830> else<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.550> then

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
assume and if something else and then

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.960 
assume and if something else and then
down<00:03:12.060> here<00:03:12.560> let's<00:03:13.560> assume<00:03:13.950> we'll<00:03:14.610> ignore<00:03:14.850> this

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
down here let's assume we'll ignore this

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.770 
down here let's assume we'll ignore this
for<00:03:15.120> now<00:03:15.620> let's<00:03:16.620> assume<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.780> session

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
for now let's assume that a session

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.920 
for now let's assume that a session
called<00:03:19.110> user<00:03:19.470> ID<00:03:19.799> has<00:03:20.760> been<00:03:21.000> set<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.570> isn't

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
called user ID has been set and isn't

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.550 
called user ID has been set and isn't
empty<00:03:22.610> now<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:24.090> means<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.750> user<00:03:25.079> has

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
empty now this means that the user has

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.160 
empty now this means that the user has
logged<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.280> because<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.690> means<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.959> we've

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
logged in because it means that we've

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.729 
logged in because it means that we've
gone<00:03:28.350> through<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:29.430> process<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.290> setting<00:03:31.290> this

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
gone through the process of setting this

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.699 
gone through the process of setting this
to<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> user<00:03:33.000> ID<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.810> correct<00:03:34.320> user

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
to the user ID of the correct user

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.009 
to the user ID of the correct user
that's<00:03:34.950> logged<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.400> or<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> users<00:03:36.390> correctly

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
that's logged in or the users correctly

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.229 
that's logged in or the users correctly
enter<00:03:37.230> their<00:03:37.380> details<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.519> all<00:03:38.670> we<00:03:38.790> need<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.060> do

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
enter their details so all we need to do

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.120 
enter their details so all we need to do
is<00:03:39.480> say<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.610> set<00:03:42.620> dollar<00:03:43.620> underscore

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
is say if is set dollar underscore

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:54.550 
is say if is set dollar underscore
session<00:03:46.340> user<00:03:47.340> underscore<00:03:48.239> ID<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:52.160> not<00:03:53.160> empty

session user underscore ID and not empty

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.650 
session user underscore ID and not empty
dollar<00:03:55.560> underscore<00:03:56.070> session<00:03:58.130> use<00:03:59.130> our<00:03:59.370> ID<00:03:59.660> so

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
dollar underscore session use our ID so

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.210 
dollar underscore session use our ID so
for<00:04:00.810> any<00:04:00.959> reason<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.560> session<00:04:01.860> called

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
for any reason that a session called

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.390 
for any reason that a session called
user<00:04:02.430> ID<00:04:02.670> has<00:04:02.880> been<00:04:03.030> set<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:03.690> not<00:04:04.019> empty

user ID has been set and it's not empty

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.500 
user ID has been set and it's not empty
then<00:04:05.400> we<00:04:07.940> still<00:04:08.940> run<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:09.209> code<00:04:10.790> well<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:12.000> say

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
then we still run this code well we say

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.569 
then we still run this code well we say
is<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.900> not<00:04:13.079> empty<00:04:13.410> because<00:04:13.680> we<00:04:13.920> need<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.430> be

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
is it not empty because we need it to be

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.810 
is it not empty because we need it to be
we<00:04:15.090> need<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.239> contain<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.019> value<00:04:16.370> in<00:04:17.370> that<00:04:17.519> case

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
we need to contain a value in that case

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.890 
we need to contain a value in that case
we<00:04:18.269> can<00:04:18.479> say<00:04:18.919> echo

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
we can say echo

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.290 
we can say echo
you<00:04:21.970> you're<00:04:23.020> logged<00:04:24.020> in<00:04:24.580> let's<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:26.060> escape

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
you you're logged in let's just escape

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.230 
you you're logged in let's just escape
that<00:04:26.720> single<00:04:27.380> quotation<00:04:27.740> mark<00:04:27.970> otherwise<00:04:28.970> we

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
that single quotation mark otherwise we

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.030 
that single quotation mark otherwise we
want<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.540> present<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.050> user<00:04:30.229> with<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.860> login

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
want to present the user with the login

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.610 
want to present the user with the login
form<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.479> let's<00:04:32.660> just<00:04:32.840> go<00:04:32.960> through<00:04:32.990> before<00:04:33.410> I

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
form so let's just go through before I

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.040 
form so let's just go through before I
test<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.190> whole<00:04:34.400> login<00:04:34.790> process<00:04:35.060> because

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
test this whole login process because

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.629 
test this whole login process because
we've<00:04:36.169> pretty<00:04:36.410> much<00:04:36.500> logged<00:04:36.889> a<00:04:37.010> user<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.430> now

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
we've pretty much logged a user in now

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.379 
we've pretty much logged a user in now
so<00:04:38.360> let's<00:04:38.780> let<00:04:39.350> me<00:04:39.380> just<00:04:39.620> test<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:40.270> we'll<00:04:41.270> go

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
so let's let me just test this we'll go

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.030 
so let's let me just test this we'll go
through<00:04:41.600> this<00:04:41.690> in<00:04:41.750> my<00:04:41.930> head<00:04:42.080> or<00:04:42.500> not<00:04:42.860> in<00:04:42.949> my

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
through this in my head or not in my

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.350 
through this in my head or not in my
head<00:04:43.220> but<00:04:43.460> with<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.940> guys<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:46.150> we'll<00:04:47.150> start

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
head but with you guys so we'll start

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.240 
head but with you guys so we'll start
from<00:04:47.449> this<00:04:47.630> bit<00:04:47.840> here<00:04:48.050> we<00:04:48.320> grab<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.770> user<00:04:49.010> ID

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
from this bit here we grab the user ID

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.280 
from this bit here we grab the user ID
from<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:49.970> result<00:04:50.479> of<00:04:50.690> where<00:04:50.900> we've<00:04:51.169> already

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
from the result of where we've already

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.659 
from the result of where we've already
echoed<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:51.740> out<00:04:51.919> so<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.130> know<00:04:52.310> what<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.550> does

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
echoed this out so you know what it does

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.250 
echoed this out so you know what it does
we<00:04:52.910> we've<00:04:53.210> got<00:04:53.240> one<00:04:53.570> for<00:04:53.780> Alex<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.139> to

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
we we've got one for Alex and to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.790 
we we've got one for Alex and to
verbally<00:04:54.650> we<00:04:55.520> set<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:55.850> session<00:04:56.180> here<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:57.650> this

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
verbally we set the session here so this

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.950 
verbally we set the session here so this
session<00:04:58.039> will<00:04:58.370> now<00:04:58.520> equal<00:04:58.940> one<00:04:59.210> if<00:04:59.479> I<00:04:59.630> log<00:04:59.810> in

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
session will now equal one if I log in

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.650 
session will now equal one if I log in
as<00:05:00.050> Alex<00:05:00.440> then<00:05:01.160> we<00:05:01.340> relocate<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.180> index<00:05:02.479> dot

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
as Alex then we relocate to index dot

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.750 
as Alex then we relocate to index dot
PHP<00:05:02.690> so<00:05:03.650> we're<00:05:03.800> already<00:05:03.949> on<00:05:04.220> index<00:05:04.520> dot<00:05:04.729> PHP

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
PHP so we're already on index dot PHP

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.980 
PHP so we're already on index dot PHP
because<00:05:05.330> we've<00:05:05.479> included<00:05:05.840> this<00:05:07.660> we<00:05:08.660> can<00:05:08.780> even

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
because we've included this we can even

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.990 
because we've included this we can even
refresh<00:05:09.260> now<00:05:09.620> just<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.100> just<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.669> show<00:05:10.760> you

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
refresh now just to just to show you

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.300 
refresh now just to just to show you
that<00:05:11.300> we're<00:05:11.660> still<00:05:11.900> logged<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.289> so<00:05:13.190> we're

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
that we're still logged in so we're

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.340 
that we're still logged in so we're
still<00:05:13.490> not<00:05:13.520> logged<00:05:13.850> in<00:05:14.060> now<00:05:14.210> as<00:05:14.870> soon<00:05:15.050> as<00:05:15.229> I

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
still not logged in now as soon as I

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.700 
still not logged in now as soon as I
type<00:05:15.590> in<00:05:15.800> Alex<00:05:16.190> here<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.669> I<00:05:17.570> type<00:05:17.810> in<00:05:17.990> pass<00:05:18.289> one

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
type in Alex here and I type in pass one

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.100 
type in Alex here and I type in pass one
two<00:05:18.919> three<00:05:19.250> here<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.639> click<00:05:19.699> login<00:05:20.120> we're

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
two three here and I click login we're

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.360 
two three here and I click login we're
going<00:05:21.229> to<00:05:21.289> process<00:05:21.530> everything<00:05:22.010> that<00:05:22.250> we've

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
going to process everything that we've

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.159 
going to process everything that we've
already<00:05:22.550> talked<00:05:22.910> about<00:05:23.090> then<00:05:23.870> we're<00:05:24.020> going<00:05:24.139> to

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
already talked about then we're going to

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.110 
already talked about then we're going to
locate<00:05:24.380> back<00:05:24.889> to<00:05:25.039> index<00:05:25.340> dot<00:05:25.520> PHP<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:26.060> I'm

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
locate back to index dot PHP so I'm

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.730 
locate back to index dot PHP so I'm
going<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.300> refresh<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.870> page<00:05:26.900> essentially

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
going to refresh the page essentially

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.070 
going to refresh the page essentially
then<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:28.610> chip<00:05:28.910> then<00:05:29.180> this<00:05:29.360> check<00:05:29.660> is<00:05:29.870> going

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
then this chip then this check is going

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.560 
then this chip then this check is going
to<00:05:30.169> happen<00:05:30.440> again<00:05:30.740> but<00:05:31.550> this<00:05:31.700> time<00:05:31.760> we<00:05:32.330> have

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
to happen again but this time we have

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.350 
to happen again but this time we have
set<00:05:32.840> session<00:05:33.260> with<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.620> user<00:05:33.830> ID<00:05:34.120> key<00:05:35.120> and

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
set session with the user ID key and

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.719 
set session with the user ID key and
it's<00:05:36.110> not<00:05:36.380> empty<00:05:36.620> so<00:05:37.280> we're<00:05:37.400> going<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.550> say

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
it's not empty so we're going to say

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.070 
it's not empty so we're going to say
you're<00:05:37.940> logged<00:05:38.120> in<00:05:39.160> so<00:05:40.160> let's<00:05:40.370> test<00:05:40.580> that

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
you're logged in so let's test that

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.320 
you're logged in so let's test that
clicking<00:05:42.080> login<00:05:42.789> and<00:05:43.789> now<00:05:43.910> it<00:05:44.000> says<00:05:44.180> you're

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
clicking login and now it says you're

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.240 
clicking login and now it says you're
logged<00:05:44.479> in<00:05:44.690> no<00:05:45.169> matter<00:05:45.380> how<00:05:45.560> many<00:05:45.770> times<00:05:46.039> we

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
logged in no matter how many times we

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.969 
logged in no matter how many times we
refresh<00:05:46.789> this<00:05:47.000> page<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:48.020> session<00:05:48.500> is<00:05:48.620> still

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
refresh this page the session is still

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.430 
refresh this page the session is still
set<00:05:49.370> therefore<00:05:50.000> we're<00:05:50.150> still<00:05:50.389> logged<00:05:50.570> in<00:05:50.810> so

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
set therefore we're still logged in so

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.110 
set therefore we're still logged in so
now<00:05:51.620> you've<00:05:51.919> essentially<00:05:52.370> learned<00:05:52.699> how<00:05:53.090> to

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
now you've essentially learned how to

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.290 
now you've essentially learned how to
log<00:05:53.539> a<00:05:53.570> user<00:05:53.870> in<00:05:54.139> and<00:05:54.639> that's<00:05:55.639> basically<00:05:56.030> it

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
log a user in and that's basically it

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.930 
log a user in and that's basically it
for<00:05:56.330> logging<00:05:56.660> you<00:05:56.870> use<00:05:57.050> it<00:05:57.199> in<00:05:57.639> what<00:05:58.639> you<00:05:58.760> can

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
for logging you use it in what you can

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.670 
for logging you use it in what you can
now<00:05:59.090> do<00:05:59.150> is<00:05:59.449> on<00:05:59.570> any<00:05:59.840> other<00:06:00.050> page<00:06:00.349> that<00:06:00.380> you

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
now do is on any other page that you

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.839 
now do is on any other page that you
work<00:06:00.889> with<00:06:01.160> say<00:06:01.460> you<00:06:02.060> had<00:06:02.270> a<00:06:02.300> page<00:06:02.539> called<00:06:02.990> I

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
work with say you had a page called I

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.240 
work with say you had a page called I
don't<00:06:04.849> know<00:06:05.289> tutorials<00:06:06.289> dot<00:06:06.500> PHP<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:07.039> you

rid of this inside here and create a

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.250 
rid of this inside here and create a

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
function that allows you to quickly

function that allows you to quickly
check<00:06:18.650> if<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.949> users<00:06:19.250> logged<00:06:19.430> in<00:06:19.639> so<00:06:20.300> let's<00:06:20.479> go

back to cording dot PHP and we're going

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.450 
back to cording dot PHP and we're going
to<00:06:23.449> create<00:06:23.630> a<00:06:23.720> function<00:06:23.960> called<00:06:24.260> logged<00:06:24.949> in

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
function is we're going to say if we're

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.860 
function is we're going to say if we're
going<00:06:30.670> to<00:06:30.730> do<00:06:30.820> exactly<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.420> same<00:06:31.600> as<00:06:31.720> what

we've done what we've just removed from
index<00:06:35.740> dot<00:06:35.950> PHP<00:06:35.980> here<00:06:36.790> but<00:06:37.420> we're<00:06:37.510> going<00:06:37.600> to

index dot PHP here but we're going to

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.030 
index dot PHP here but we're going to

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
put it in a function so all we need to

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.440 
put it in a function so all we need to
do<00:06:39.220> is<00:06:39.310> call<00:06:39.610> this<00:06:39.820> so<00:06:40.690> if<00:06:41.730> if<00:06:42.730> it's<00:06:43.690> set

we're going to tell false so if you know

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.830 
we're going to tell false so if you know
about<00:07:06.430> functions<00:07:07.000> and<00:07:07.150> if<00:07:07.210> you've<00:07:07.360> correctly

about functions and if you've correctly

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.150 
about functions and if you've correctly
learned<00:07:08.050> about<00:07:08.200> functions<00:07:08.680> you'll<00:07:08.830> know<00:07:08.950> I

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
learned about functions you'll know I

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.030 
learned about functions you'll know I
can<00:07:09.610> just<00:07:09.640> put<00:07:09.910> if<00:07:10.060> logged<00:07:10.720> in<00:07:10.930> then<00:07:11.830> it<00:07:11.950> will

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
can just put if logged in then it will

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.980 
can just put if logged in then it will
say<00:07:12.160> we're<00:07:12.310> logged<00:07:12.460> in<00:07:12.670> because<00:07:13.270> this<00:07:13.750> will

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
say we're logged in because this will

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.600 
say we're logged in because this will
return<00:07:14.350> true<00:07:15.360> so<00:07:16.360> this<00:07:16.510> block<00:07:16.720> will<00:07:16.960> run<00:07:17.170> if<00:07:17.610> we

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
return true so this block will run if we

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.460 
return true so this block will run if we
return<00:07:18.910> false<00:07:19.270> we're<00:07:19.750> going<00:07:19.960> to<00:07:20.020> include<00:07:20.260> the

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470 
return false we're going to include the

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.670 
return false we're going to include the
login<00:07:20.770> form<00:07:21.450> so<00:07:22.450> let's<00:07:23.110> go<00:07:23.200> back<00:07:23.230> to<00:07:23.440> the<00:07:23.500> page

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 
login form so let's go back to the page

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.600 
login form so let's go back to the page
and<00:07:23.710> see<00:07:23.980> if<00:07:24.070> that<00:07:24.190> works

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
and see if that works

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.670 
and see if that works
yep<00:07:25.060> it<00:07:25.270> still<00:07:25.480> tells<00:07:25.690> us<00:07:25.930> that<00:07:26.230> we<00:07:26.380> are<00:07:26.410> logged

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
yep it still tells us that we are logged

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.890 
yep it still tells us that we are logged
in
