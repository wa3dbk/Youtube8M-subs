well<00:00:09.219> this<00:00:10.219> is<00:00:10.459> my<00:00:11.500> most<00:00:12.500> recent<00:00:12.740> freebie<00:00:13.400> that

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
well this is my most recent freebie that

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.420 
well this is my most recent freebie that
got<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.059> one

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
got this one

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:27.700 
got this one
yesterday<00:00:19.440> it's<00:00:20.440> a<00:00:20.530> craftsman<00:00:21.160> generator

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.910 

I<00:00:28.630> mean<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:29.840> didn't<00:00:30.140> paid<00:00:30.410> too<00:00:30.710> much<00:00:30.740> attention

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
I mean I didn't paid too much attention

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.780 
I mean I didn't paid too much attention
to<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:32.680> other<00:00:33.680> than<00:00:33.829> it<00:00:34.040> does<00:00:34.250> say<00:00:34.520> it<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.760> a

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
to it other than it does say it is a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:45.670 
to it other than it does say it is a
force<00:00:42.460> there's<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.550> serial<00:00:44.030> number<00:00:44.320> on<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
force there's a serial number on the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.790 
force there's a serial number on the
engine

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.139 

so

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.920 

and<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.170> 143<00:00:58.949> number<00:00:59.629> which<00:01:00.629> means

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and it is the 143 number which means

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.979 
and it is the 143 number which means
Sears<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.160> all<00:01:02.280> original<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.989> this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
Sears this is all original but this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.870 
Sears this is all original but this
generator<00:01:04.530> came<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:05.010> someone<00:01:05.460> who

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
generator came from someone who

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.840 
generator came from someone who
obviously<00:01:07.009> tried<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> running<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.759> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
obviously tried to get it running and it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.510 
obviously tried to get it running and it
would<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.150> start<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.070> they

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
would not start and then it's not they

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
would not start and then it's not they
can<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.420> realized<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.290> even<00:01:13.470> large

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
can be realized that it's not even large

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.910 
can be realized that it's not even large
enough<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.979> run<00:01:14.250> their<00:01:15.060> house<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.890> they've<00:01:16.890> got

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
enough to run their house on they've got

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.190 
enough to run their house on they've got
a<00:01:17.130> large<00:01:17.399> house<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.880> 1800<00:01:18.570> watts<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.960> not

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a large house and 1800 watts is not

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.359 
a large house and 1800 watts is not
enough<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.509> I<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.470> they've<00:01:26.009> given

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
enough and I do know them they've given

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.270 
enough and I do know them they've given
me<00:01:26.399> a<00:01:26.549> push<00:01:26.790> mower<00:01:27.060> before<00:01:27.860> but<00:01:30.950> well<00:01:31.950> there

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
me a push mower before but well there

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.590 
me a push mower before but well there
you<00:01:32.399> go<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:33.270> three-prong<00:01:33.990> outlets<00:01:35.060> air<00:01:36.060> filter

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you go to three-prong outlets air filter

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.469 
you go to three-prong outlets air filter
probably<00:01:37.050> needs<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.440> changed<00:01:38.810> spark<00:01:39.810> plug

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
probably needs to be changed spark plug

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.440 
probably needs to be changed spark plug
appears<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.750> original<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.800> sad<00:01:44.009> part

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
appears to be original that's a sad part

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.669 
appears to be original that's a sad part
oil<00:01:47.119> is<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.659> actually<00:01:48.990> full<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.440> oil

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
oil is that it's actually full on oil

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.230 
oil is that it's actually full on oil
but<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:52.429> I'll<00:01:53.429> be<00:01:53.610> changing<00:01:53.850> that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
but you know I'll be changing that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.960 
but you know I'll be changing that
obviously<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.950> then<00:01:56.039> I'll<00:01:56.130> clean<00:01:56.399> out<00:01:56.429> the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
obviously and then I'll clean out the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.040 
obviously and then I'll clean out the
generator<00:01:57.479> head<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.399> that'll<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.789> it

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
generator head and that'll be it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.630 
generator head and that'll be it
hopefully<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.130> running<00:02:05.340> oh

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
hopefully I can get this one running oh

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.559 
hopefully I can get this one running oh
yeah

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
yeah

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.089 
yeah
and<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.860> other<00:02:07.979> issue<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.550> got<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:10.679> crack

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
and the other issue it's got that crack

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.449 
and the other issue it's got that crack
there<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.940> good<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:13.560> crack<00:02:13.830> let's<00:02:14.160> lots

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
there that's good that crack let's lots

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.589 
there that's good that crack let's lots
of<00:02:14.610> fuel<00:02:14.819> through<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:17.300> can<00:02:18.300> try<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
of fuel through I can try and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.650 
of fuel through I can try and
demonstrate

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.759 

see

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.819 

it<00:02:31.189> doesn't<00:02:31.489> have<00:02:31.579> much<00:02:31.640> feel<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.209> there<00:02:32.829> feel

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
it doesn't have much feel in there feel

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.490 
it doesn't have much feel in there feel
is<00:02:34.069> probably<00:02:34.879> right<00:02:35.659> up<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.989> about<00:02:36.200> there

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
is probably right up to about there

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.640 
is probably right up to about there
something<00:02:36.920> like<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:39.189> as<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:41.480> as<00:02:42.319> I've

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
something like that but as I as I've

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.770 
something like that but as I as I've
done<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.250> coating<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.939> engine<00:02:44.299> has<00:02:44.569> this

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
done the coating on the engine has this

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.059 
done the coating on the engine has this
as<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.140> becomes<00:02:45.469> the<00:02:46.000> engine<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.680> know<00:02:48.799> the

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
as it becomes the engine you know the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.729 
as it becomes the engine you know the
serial<00:02:49.519> number<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.269> believe<00:02:50.780> was<00:02:51.019> eight<00:02:51.439> oh

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
serial number I believe was eight oh

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.550 
serial number I believe was eight oh
nine<00:02:51.769> six<00:02:52.519> or<00:02:52.670> something<00:02:52.939> like<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.379> so<00:02:54.379> this

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
nine six or something like that so this

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:12.490 
nine six or something like that so this
is<00:02:54.620> probably<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.569> 1978<00:02:56.569> model

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.699 

so<00:03:13.500> huge<00:03:13.890> muffler<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> little<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:15.470> guess<00:03:16.470> that's

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
so huge muffler a little I guess that's

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:25.640 
so huge muffler a little I guess that's
a<00:03:16.860> that's<00:03:17.340> that's<00:03:17.819> good<00:03:22.010> 3600<00:03:23.010> RPM<00:03:23.430> motor<00:03:24.650> 1800

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
a that's that's good 3600 RPM motor 1800

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.250 
a that's that's good 3600 RPM motor 1800
watts<00:03:26.090> single-phase<00:03:27.860> nothing<00:03:28.860> too<00:03:29.040> special

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
watts single-phase nothing too special

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.199 
watts single-phase nothing too special
16<00:03:31.260> amps<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.650> guess<00:03:31.799> that's<00:03:32.010> pretty<00:03:32.220> good

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.970 

keep<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.360> mind<00:03:36.569> it's<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.810> small<00:03:37.079> generator<00:03:37.500> but

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
keep in mind it's a small generator but

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.550 
keep in mind it's a small generator but
oh<00:03:38.239> just<00:03:39.239> making<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.569> quick<00:03:39.690> video<00:03:39.900> here<00:03:40.110> we'll

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
oh just making a quick video here we'll

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.910 
oh just making a quick video here we'll
have<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.739> video<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.940> from<00:03:42.319> so<00:03:43.319> see<00:03:43.829> you

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
have a video that one is from so see you

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.260 
have a video that one is from so see you
guys<00:03:44.069> then

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.330 

you
