a little less smooth than others and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.000 
a little less smooth than others and
they<00:00:42.449> can<00:00:42.600> adjust<00:00:42.720> it<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.769> they<00:00:43.830> have<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
they can adjust it and then they have a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.009 
they can adjust it and then they have a

because they can have a look at that and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.610 
because they can have a look at that and
they<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.540> how<00:00:48.570> their<00:00:48.870> driving<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:49.379> been

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
they can see how their driving has been

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.439 
they can see how their driving has been
on<00:00:49.890> any<00:00:50.370> particular<00:00:50.489> route<00:00:51.089> or<00:00:51.299> any

over time technology works by measuring

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.359 
over time technology works by measuring
what<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> driver<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.500> doing<00:00:58.650> in<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:58.890> real-time

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
what the driver is doing in a real-time

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.180 
what the driver is doing in a real-time
basis<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.479> have<00:01:00.659> onboard<00:01:01.190> diagnostics

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
basis so we have onboard diagnostics

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.270 
basis so we have onboard diagnostics
like<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.339> GPS<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> GPRS<00:01:03.659> an<00:01:04.440> accelerometer<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
like a GPS a GPRS an accelerometer and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.219 
like a GPS a GPRS an accelerometer and
effectively<00:01:05.760> allows<00:01:06.150> us<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.600> measure<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.020> real

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
effectively allows us to measure in real

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
effectively allows us to measure in real
time<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> driver<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.670> doing<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
time what the driver is doing is a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.080 
time what the driver is doing is a
driver<00:01:09.720> accelerating<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.680> he<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.460> she<00:01:11.640> braking

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
driver accelerating is he or she braking

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
driver accelerating is he or she braking
are<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.360> turning<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.200> how<00:01:13.680> aggressively<00:01:14.250> or

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
are they turning and how aggressively or

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.820 
are they turning and how aggressively or
how<00:01:14.880> smoothly<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.720> doing<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.710> we

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
how smoothly are they doing that so we

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
how smoothly are they doing that so we
feed<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.250> back<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> driver<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
feed that back to the driver so the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510 
feed that back to the driver so the
driver<00:01:18.630> constantly<00:01:19.409> knows<00:01:19.649> how<00:01:20.280> they're

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
driver constantly knows how they're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
driver constantly knows how they're
driving<00:01:20.969> and<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.179> can<00:01:21.359> improve<00:01:21.719> because

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
driving and they can improve because

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.840 
driving and they can improve because
they're<00:01:22.500> being<00:01:22.679> told<00:01:22.890> okay<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> might<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
they're being told okay that might be a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.029 
they're being told okay that might be a
slightly<00:01:24.179> too<00:01:24.780> aggressive<00:01:25.259> maneuver<00:01:25.679> might

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
slightly too aggressive maneuver might

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.649 
slightly too aggressive maneuver might
be<00:01:26.159> slightly<00:01:26.429> too<00:01:26.640> aggressive<00:01:27.030> acceleration

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
be slightly too aggressive acceleration

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.389 
be slightly too aggressive acceleration
so<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.380> tone<00:01:28.619> down<00:01:28.649> their<00:01:29.039> driving<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
so they will tone down their driving and

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.249 
so they will tone down their driving and
over<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> period<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.060> time<00:01:30.299> you'll<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> much

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
over a period of time you'll have a much

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.480 
over a period of time you'll have a much
more<00:01:31.499> smoother<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> safer<00:01:32.789> experience<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
more smoother and safer experience the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.340 
more smoother and safer experience the
benefits<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.149> driver<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.929> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> be

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
benefits for the driver are going to be

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.429 
benefits for the driver are going to be
that<00:01:37.590> he<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.280> how<00:01:38.609> he<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:39.299> she<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.630> driving

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that he can see how he or she is driving

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.340 
that he can see how he or she is driving
and<00:01:40.670> improve<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.719> they're<00:01:42.960> doing<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and improve on what they're doing on a

things basically at the top of the tree
ie<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.490> all<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.820> sin<00:02:02.000> bit<00:02:02.210> drive<00:02:02.570> green<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:04.520> a

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
ie is all the sin bit drive green it's a

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.039 
ie is all the sin bit drive green it's a
good<00:02:04.700> incentive<00:02:04.969> I<00:02:05.299> mean<00:02:05.450> if<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.719> drivers

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
good incentive I mean if the drivers

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.229 
good incentive I mean if the drivers
know<00:02:06.200> they're<00:02:06.409> going<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.590> be<00:02:06.759> given<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.939> cash

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
know they're going to be given a cash

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.880 
know they're going to be given a cash
incentive<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.869> drive<00:02:09.080> within<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.470> green<00:02:09.679> then

incentive to drive within the green then

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.369 
incentive to drive within the green then
I<00:02:10.069> can<00:02:10.429> only<00:02:10.550> benefit<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> driver<00:02:11.379> benefit

I can only benefit the driver benefit

I can only benefit the driver benefit
first<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.980> benefit<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.459> public
