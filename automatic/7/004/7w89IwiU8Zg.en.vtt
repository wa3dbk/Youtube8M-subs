00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.890
 yes hello my dear 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.930
 Welcome to a new video of mine 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.590
 I am happy that he will pass me again 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.489
 Look today there is easter jam and 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.370
 For this we need 150 grams of carrots 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.500
 peeled and cut into pieces and 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:48.070
 150 grams of apples also peeled and in 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.070
 I cut off pieces 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.579
 downsize and first time and that ten 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.079
 second step 8 we have here 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.480
 little bit of lids 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.480
 that has just now in the mixer 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.040
 and exactly what it depends on the rand has 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.040
 just made up a little bit down 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.160
 and now the rest of the ingredients come 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:28.940
 and we need 150 now 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:40.100
 orange juice then we need one 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:52.250
 knife tip orange peel aroma then 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:02:03.050
 a teaspoon vanilla sugar two 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:19.250
 teaspoon of lemon juice 1 42 namely 250 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:20.230
 Gramm 240 but that should still be 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.080
 fold 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.480
 So that will mix first and times 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.450
 although five seconds on level four 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:38.690
 and now we leave the whole 14 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:40.519
 minutes 100 degrees level 2 1 should follow the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.709
 we have been cooking for eight minutes 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:50.570
 our Easter jam again eight 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:52.840
 seconds at stage eight puree times 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.840
 purely 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.840
 that smells delicious I can 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.260
 probably not show otherwise 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.260
 runs out of me but you can guess 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.360
 I'm looking forward to it so me 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.330
 Now my jam in nice 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.660
 Auslese fill and let her something 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.590
 Cool off and then when I sample the cost 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:31.349
 then you are there again 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:34.440
 is the same so my dear is coming now 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.890
 the tasting jam is here 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.480
 not cold but it was me 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.769
 no matter where I try now 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.690
 namely not having breakfast at all 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.540
 It sounds good that I am myself 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.790
 now the delicious easter jam 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.790

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.380
 hmm 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.240
 a very fine aroma 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.430
 Not 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:21.770
 difficult to describe so diverse 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.469
 the orange juice comes through a bit 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.719
 but through the carrots and the apples 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:31.009
 is it really something special? 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.009
 everything must try in any case 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.490
 More I can not say because 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:47.360

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.360

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.750

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.750
 just to easter as a small gift 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.350

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.350
