solar assistant kit which is quite a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.310 
solar assistant kit which is quite a
cool<00:00:05.370> little<00:00:05.609> piece<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.180> educational<00:00:09.260> is<00:00:10.260> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
cool little piece of educational is a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.400 
cool little piece of educational is a
toy<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.920> suppose<00:00:11.480> first<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.599> all<00:00:12.660> comes<00:00:13.019> role<00:00:13.230> as

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
toy I suppose first of all comes role as

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.620 
toy I suppose first of all comes role as
wood<00:00:13.650> which<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.219> put<00:00:14.460> together<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:15.150> make<00:00:15.299> box

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
wood which you put together to make box

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.689 
wood which you put together to make box
store<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.880> some<00:00:17.880> sandpaper<00:00:18.390> some<00:00:18.840> glue

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
store it in some sandpaper some glue

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.590 
store it in some sandpaper some glue
this<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.820> where<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.029> gets<00:00:21.119> more<00:00:21.330> interesting

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
this is where it gets more interesting

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.880 
this is where it gets more interesting
to<00:00:22.020> multimeter<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:25.820> open<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:27.890> should

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
to multimeter in here open up should

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.849 
to multimeter in here open up should
already<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.279> batteries<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.740> all

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
already have batteries in it so it's all

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.240 
already have batteries in it so it's all
good<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:33.860> hook<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.100> up<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:37.469> your<00:00:38.899> two<00:00:39.899> bits

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
good to go hook this up to your two bits

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.639 
good to go hook this up to your two bits
now<00:00:41.250> what's<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.480> interesting<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
now what's really interesting about this

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.350 
now what's really interesting about this
is<00:00:43.879> this<00:00:44.879> bag<00:00:46.280> which<00:00:47.280> contains<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.730> connect

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
is this bag which contains and connect

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.380 
is this bag which contains and connect
this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.810 

it<00:00:55.390> contains<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.990> solar<00:00:56.320> panels<00:00:56.740> here

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
it contains the solar panels here

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.470 
it contains the solar panels here
so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.510 
so
first<00:01:01.140> thing<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:02.040> of<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.220> solar

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
first thing I can do one of these solar

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.080 
first thing I can do one of these solar
panels<00:01:02.610> here<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.360> try<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.570> measure<00:01:05.030> how<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
panels here is to try and measure how to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.560 
panels here is to try and measure how to
voltage<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:07.350> devices<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.950> given

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
voltage these little devices are given

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
voltage these little devices are given
right<00:01:09.570> I'm<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> hook<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.530> positive

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
right I'm not going to hook the positive

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.180 
right I'm not going to hook the positive
to<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.080> back<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> cell<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
to the back of the cell here and the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.330 
to the back of the cell here and the
negative<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.160> some

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
negative and you can see you're in some

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.050 
negative and you can see you're in some
sunshine<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.119> you've<00:01:21.330> got<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:22.020> point

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
sunshine here you've got a good point

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.499 
sunshine here you've got a good point
five<00:01:24.060> seven<00:01:24.869> volts<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.970> other<00:01:27.090> thing<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> can

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
five seven volts the other thing you can

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.030 
five seven volts the other thing you can
measure<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.320> thing<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> the

what<00:02:49.409> we're<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.709> try<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.159> is<00:02:50.430> we're

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
what we're going to try and do is we're

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.069 
what we're going to try and do is we're
going<00:02:50.939> to<00:02:51.000> hook<00:02:51.120> them<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.359> in<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.659> parallel

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
going to hook them up in a parallel

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.440 
going to hook them up in a parallel
configuration<00:02:55.609> by<00:02:56.609> doing<00:02:56.909> that<00:02:57.030> we're<00:02:57.299> going

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
configuration by doing that we're going

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.390 
configuration by doing that we're going
to<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.720> half<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.379> volts<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:58.980> twice<00:02:59.189> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
to have half the volts and twice the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.210 
to have half the volts and twice the
ends<00:02:59.700> so

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.970 

like<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.240> positive<00:03:09.530> hook<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.740> up<00:03:10.800> to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
like this to positive hook this up to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
like this to positive hook this up to
the<00:03:11.310> other<00:03:12.200> little<00:03:13.200> power<00:03:13.530> panel<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
the other little power panel to the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.530 
the other little power panel to the
positive<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:19.140> then<00:03:20.210> we're<00:03:21.210> going<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.450> take

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
positive and then we're going to take

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.770 
positive and then we're going to take
the<00:03:21.840> negative<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:23.250> negative<00:03:24.710> over<00:03:25.710> here<00:03:26.780> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the negative to negative over here and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.300 
the negative to negative over here and
then<00:03:28.470> we're<00:03:28.950> going<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> take<00:03:29.430> negative<00:03:31.310> into

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
then we're going to take negative into

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.280 
then we're going to take negative into
the<00:03:32.340> multimeter

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.869 

and<00:03:37.409> now<00:03:41.569> only<00:03:42.569> touch<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.019> Sun<00:03:43.609> we<00:03:44.609> suddenly

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
and now only touch the Sun we suddenly

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:52.830 
and now only touch the Sun we suddenly
have<00:03:47.540> 45

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.140 

so<00:03:53.470> that's<00:03:54.250> one<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.580> things<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.910> can<00:03:55.120> be

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
so that's one of the things that can be

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.380 
so that's one of the things that can be
done<00:03:55.239> with<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:56.349> kit<00:03:57.000> now<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.060> second<00:03:58.360> thing

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
done with this kit now the second thing

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.490 
done with this kit now the second thing
this<00:03:59.019> kit<00:03:59.260> comes<00:03:59.290> with<00:03:59.650> is<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.069> little<00:04:00.519> motor

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
this kit comes with is a little motor

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.190 
this kit comes with is a little motor
which<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.739> be<00:04:02.860> hooked<00:04:03.010> up<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.280> something<00:04:04.200> like

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
which can be hooked up to something like

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.410 
which can be hooked up to something like
it's<00:04:05.410> still<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.620> spiral<00:04:06.069> disc<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.000> can<00:04:10.239> have

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
it's still a spiral disc so you can have

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.449 
it's still a spiral disc so you can have
a<00:04:10.450> look<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.930> see<00:04:12.629> what's<00:04:13.629> positive<00:04:14.340> stick<00:04:15.340> it

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
a look and see what's positive stick it

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.650 
a look and see what's positive stick it
in<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.640> Sun<00:04:15.849> and<00:04:16.479> there<00:04:16.989> we<00:04:17.079> go<00:04:18.419> get<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.449> nice

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
in the Sun and there we go get a nice

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.950 
in the Sun and there we go get a nice
little<00:04:20.040> spinny<00:04:21.040> motor<00:04:21.340> here

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.350 

in<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.680> parallel<00:04:26.860> configuration<00:04:28.350> well
