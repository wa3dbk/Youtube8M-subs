 hello to everyone today in this 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:09.130
 video I propose an exercise for 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.260
 give you the fingers of your left hand 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:16.680
 and this excerpt from my gym guitar book 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.960
 available on my website 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.550
 I chose the number 13 pink pages 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.550
 I start with you play 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.670
 then at the level of the left hand 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.450
 we will use the four fingers of 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:49.330
 the number one index of the major of de 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:53.559
 the ring finger 3 and the little finger 4 on 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:58.020
 will start with the set box played with 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.020
 finger three on the rope 5 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:11.710
 then we will play box 5 with the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:15.680
 finger one on the rope 4 so 7 5 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.010
 then we will play box 6 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.280
 ground rope 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.180
 korn iii with finger two and finally we 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:34.480
 will play fast with the finger 4 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:36.100
 on the rope so it gives 7 5 6 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.980
 House 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.130
 this zac 6 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.560
 myth 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.680
 at the level of the right hand we go 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.680
 use the round trip so ba ba 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.470
 or not 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 or 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.600
 for the positioning of the left hand 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:12.980
 try to be as far right as possible 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:22.220
 of the box but against the bar 7 5 6 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.220
 8 7 7 6 8 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.150
 baobab 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.030
 the second measure is the return 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.910
 so we will play this time box 7 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.910
 on rope 2 with your finger 3 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:50.270
 then box 5 on rope 3 with the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:57.370
 finger one then box 6 on the rope 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:03:01.640
 4 with the fingers 2 and finally the box 8 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.700
 with the finger 4 on the rope 5 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.880
 so that gives 7 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:12.680
 5 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:17.730
 6 8 7 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.760
 5-5 6 and 8 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:30.359
 always go back so low up 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:34.250
 low up high low down or low so now 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.250
 I link everything from the beginning it gives 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:58.969
 not words not at the bar where ben 7.5 6 800 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:58.969
