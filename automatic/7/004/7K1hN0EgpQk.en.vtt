00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
I just chopped far it off set it down

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.119 
I just chopped far it off set it down
somewhere<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.659> just<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.319> top<00:02:43.560> part<00:02:43.590> along

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
somewhere and just the top part along

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.949 
somewhere and just the top part along
probably<00:02:44.700> weighs<00:02:44.849> like<00:02:45.150> two<00:02:45.450> or<00:02:45.569> three<00:02:45.750> pounds

probably weighs like two or three pounds
then<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:47.220> bottom<00:02:47.640> part<00:02:47.670> probably<00:02:48.269> weighs

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
then the bottom part probably weighs

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.849 
then the bottom part probably weighs
like<00:02:48.629> five<00:02:48.900> six<00:02:49.370> thirty<00:02:50.370> seven<00:02:50.970> pounds<00:02:51.569> so

in<00:03:01.319> case<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> were<00:03:01.709> wondering<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.549> you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
in case you were wondering and you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.930 
in case you were wondering and you
didn't<00:03:02.940> submit<00:03:03.090> 50<00:03:03.599> subs<00:03:03.810> not<00:03:04.049> funny<00:03:05.040> wait<00:03:05.220> we

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
didn't submit 50 subs not funny wait we

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.140 
didn't submit 50 subs not funny wait we
have<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.299> gate<00:03:06.690> all<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:08.069> way<00:03:08.280> along<00:03:08.639> except

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
have this gate all the way along except

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.759 
have this gate all the way along except
for<00:03:09.299> right<00:03:09.389> here<00:03:09.599> which<00:03:09.900> there's<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.560> ladder

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
for right here which there's a ladder

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.379 
for right here which there's a ladder
there<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.159> that<00:03:11.280> works<00:03:11.459> out<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.879> now<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.329> I

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
there so that works out and now so I

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.210 
there so that works out and now so I
didn't<00:03:12.599> have<00:03:12.690> any<00:03:12.750> leftover<00:03:13.319> gate<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.099> then

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
didn't have any leftover gate and then

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.699 
didn't have any leftover gate and then
all<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.579> way<00:03:14.669> along<00:03:14.879> here<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:16.109> all<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.590> way

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
all the way along here and all the way

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.460 
all the way along here and all the way
along<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.430> sniping<00:03:17.849> in<00:03:18.030> line<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.480> actually

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
along the sniping in line and actually

over the place
we<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.840> clone<00:04:10.080> here<00:04:10.350> who's<00:04:10.590> making<00:04:10.980> sure

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
we have a clone here who's making sure

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.670 
we have a clone here who's making sure
that<00:04:11.280> only<00:04:11.580> clones<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:12.360> come<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.720> there's<00:04:13.500> no

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
that only clones can come in there's no

I'll<00:05:27.660> go<00:05:27.810> tutorial<00:05:28.290> on<00:05:28.350> that<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.560> little<00:05:28.979> bit

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
I'll go tutorial on that a little bit

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.990 
I'll go tutorial on that a little bit
after<00:05:30.300> this<00:05:30.390> video<00:05:30.570> mean<00:05:31.040> probe<00:05:32.040> here<00:05:32.280> really

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
then right here you have this ordinary

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.500 
then right here you have this ordinary
piece<00:05:51.870> of<00:05:52.020> wall<00:05:52.200> but<00:05:52.950> then<00:05:53.160> if<00:05:53.400> you<00:05:53.910> lift<00:05:54.300> up

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
piece of wall but then if you lift up

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.690 
piece of wall but then if you lift up
this<00:05:54.720> ladder

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
this ladder

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.780
