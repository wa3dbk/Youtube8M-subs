it

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.130 
it
the<00:02:30.150> handle<00:02:30.660> itself<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.260> 420<00:02:31.769> j2<00:02:32.010> stainless

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
the handle itself is 420 j2 stainless

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.559 
the handle itself is 420 j2 stainless
and<00:02:34.140> has<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.819> carbon-fiber<00:02:35.819> styled<00:02:38.330> design<00:02:39.330> on

and has a carbon-fiber styled design on
the<00:02:39.690> outside<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.099> can<00:02:41.250> see<00:02:41.430> they're

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the outside as you can see they're

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.590 
the outside as you can see they're
really<00:02:42.090> really<00:02:42.540> cool<00:02:42.780> design<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:45.150> course<00:02:45.420> I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
really really cool design of course I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.520 
really really cool design of course I
talked<00:02:45.840> about<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.350> outburst<00:02:47.310> technology

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
talked about the outburst technology

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.990 
talked about the outburst technology
basically<00:02:49.530> once<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.130> blade<00:02:50.340> gets<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.760> 30

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
basically once the blade gets to 30

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.229 
basically once the blade gets to 30
degrees<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.590> spring<00:02:52.950> kicks<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.940> flips

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
degrees the spring kicks in and it flips

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.320 
degrees the spring kicks in and it flips
the<00:02:54.420> blade<00:02:54.660> out<00:02:55.489> using<00:02:56.489> these<00:02:56.610> thumb<00:02:56.970> studs

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the blade out using these thumb studs

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.420 
the blade out using these thumb studs
it's<00:02:57.569> got<00:02:57.780> dual<00:02:58.019> ramped<00:02:58.380> thumb<00:02:58.739> studs<00:02:59.069> on<00:02:59.280> both

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
it's got dual ramped thumb studs on both

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.640 
it's got dual ramped thumb studs on both
sides<00:02:59.700> so<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.120> an<00:03:00.360> ambidextrous<00:03:01.290> hope<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
sides so it is an ambidextrous hope and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.020 
sides so it is an ambidextrous hope and
you<00:03:01.709> can't<00:03:01.950> open<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:03.239> your<00:03:03.360> left<00:03:03.630> hand<00:03:05.030> as

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
you can't open with your left hand as

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.589 
you can't open with your left hand as
well<00:03:06.299> as<00:03:06.510> right<00:03:07.580> now<00:03:08.580> one<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.030> cool<00:03:09.330> thing

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
well as right now one of the cool thing

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.559 
well as right now one of the cool thing
is<00:03:09.630> actually<00:03:10.140> built<00:03:10.380> into<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:11.569> handle

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
is actually built into that handle

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.890 
is actually built into that handle
itself<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.099> liner<00:03:14.340> lock<00:03:14.810> instead<00:03:15.810> of

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
itself is the liner lock instead of

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.780 
itself is the liner lock instead of
being<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.200> third<00:03:16.470> piece<00:03:17.299> on<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.959> handle<00:03:19.790> it's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
being a third piece on the handle it's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.310 
being a third piece on the handle it's
actually<00:03:21.269> cut<00:03:22.230> from<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:23.390> right<00:03:24.390> side<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:25.019> guess

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
actually cut from the right side I guess

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.020 
actually cut from the right side I guess
you<00:03:25.470> say<00:03:25.620> rats<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:25.980> don't<00:03:26.160> know<00:03:26.310> if<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.579> left

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you say rats I don't know if it left

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.080 
you say rats I don't know if it left
side<00:03:27.180> right<00:03:27.209> side<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:29.280> cut<00:03:29.519> into<00:03:29.730> one<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
side right side it's cut into one of the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.530 
side right side it's cut into one of the
sides<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:32.790> don't<00:03:33.060> know<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.329> can<00:03:33.480> even

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
sides so I don't know if you can even

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.590 
sides so I don't know if you can even
see<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:34.109> carved<00:03:34.609> down<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.180> handle

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
see that it's carved down to that handle

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.539 
see that it's carved down to that handle
itself<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.230> there's<00:03:37.410> only<00:03:37.560> two<00:03:37.859> pieces<00:03:38.130> the

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
itself so there's only two pieces the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.550 
itself so there's only two pieces the
left<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.910> right<00:03:39.060> side<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:40.200> actually

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
left and right side and it's actually

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.789 
left and right side and it's actually
placed<00:03:40.890> into<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:42.049> believe<00:03:43.049> they<00:03:43.290> cut

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
placed into that I believe they cut

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.800 
placed into that I believe they cut
these<00:03:43.980> grooves<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.549> here<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:44.970> way<00:03:45.299> it'll

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
these grooves in here so that way it'll

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.710 
these grooves in here so that way it'll
pull<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.799> liner<00:03:47.549> lock<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.269> place<00:03:48.480> and

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
pull this liner lock in a place and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.710 
pull this liner lock in a place and
gives<00:03:48.870> attention<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.530> let<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.459> pop<00:03:50.639> up

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
gives attention to let it pop up

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.420 
gives attention to let it pop up
underneath<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.900> blade<00:03:52.160> holds<00:03:53.160> really<00:03:53.310> well

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
underneath the blade holds really well

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.840 
underneath the blade holds really well
there's<00:03:53.819> nice<00:03:54.030> Jinping's<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.750> back<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.230> it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
there's nice Jinping's on the back of it

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
there's nice Jinping's on the back of it
that<00:03:56.850> way<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.359> get<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.569> good<00:03:57.630> grip<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.560> it's

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
that way you get a good grip on it it's

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.500 
that way you get a good grip on it it's
got<00:03:58.859> really<00:03:59.160> good<00:03:59.370> weight<00:03:59.639> I<00:04:00.030> think<00:04:00.389> they're

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
got really good weight I think they're

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.629 
got really good weight I think they're
weighs<00:04:01.109> around<00:04:01.410> 3<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.069> 4<00:04:02.100> ounces<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:04.489> it's<00:04:05.489> not

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
weighs around 3 to 4 ounces so it's not

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.430 
weighs around 3 to 4 ounces so it's not
really<00:04:06.060> heavy<00:04:06.299> but<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.720> not<00:04:06.870> really<00:04:07.230> wide

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
really heavy but it's not really wide

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.360 
really heavy but it's not really wide
it's<00:04:07.709> kind<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.100> nice<00:04:08.510> nice<00:04:09.510> balanced<00:04:10.370> knife

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
it's kind of a nice nice balanced knife

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.800 
it's kind of a nice nice balanced knife
there<00:04:11.670> is<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.970> mini<00:04:12.180> version<00:04:13.100> waist<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:15.000> couple

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
there is the mini version waist a couple

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.349 
there is the mini version waist a couple
of<00:04:16.109> tenths<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:17.010> an<00:04:17.130> ounce<00:04:17.250> list<00:04:17.760> or<00:04:18.060> something

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
of tenths of an ounce list or something

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.240 
of tenths of an ounce list or something
like<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.539> it's<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.260> not<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.889> huge<00:04:20.280> difference

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
like that it's a not a huge difference

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.830 
like that it's a not a huge difference
as<00:04:23.250> far<00:04:23.340> as

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
as far as
