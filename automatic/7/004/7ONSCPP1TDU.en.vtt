and<00:02:46.829> then<00:02:49.829> just<00:02:50.829> put<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.430> right<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.790> that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
and then just put it right here so that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.319 
and then just put it right here so that
the<00:02:55.060> back<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.510> facing<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:57.250> stuff<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.299> can

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
the back is facing this stuff so I can

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.819 
the back is facing this stuff so I can
go<00:02:58.739> like<00:02:59.739> this<00:03:00.040> way<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.650> then

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
go like this way like that so then

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.619

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
motion examiner it then takes so long to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.789 
motion examiner it then takes so long to
do<00:04:16.790> it<00:04:16.820> but<00:04:17.480> it<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.170> takes<00:04:18.530> some<00:04:18.829> thought<00:04:19.160> oh

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
do it but it it it takes some thought oh

glass beads you can probably see with

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000 
glass beads you can probably see with
compared<00:04:32.000> with<00:04:32.150> this<00:04:32.360> that's<00:04:33.050> what<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.830> need
