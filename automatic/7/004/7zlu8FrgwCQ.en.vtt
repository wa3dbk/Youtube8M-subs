been waiting to see a video of some of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
been waiting to see a video of some of
the<00:00:41.820> emergency<00:00:42.120> lighting<00:00:42.450> during<00:00:43.050> an<00:00:43.140> actual

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the emergency lighting during an actual

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.330 
the emergency lighting during an actual
power<00:00:43.649> outage<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.360> here<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
power outage so here you go this one is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.000 
power outage so here you go this one is
on<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> 6<00:00:50.850> volt<00:00:50.940> battery<00:00:51.420> backup<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:54.449> light

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
on a 6 volt battery backup this light

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.220 
on a 6 volt battery backup this light
does<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.820> any<00:00:57.030> batteries<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
does not have any batteries in it that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.979 
does not have any batteries in it that
light<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.770> powered<00:00:59.309> by<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:03.239> power<00:01:03.539> supply

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
light is powered by this power supply

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.260 
light is powered by this power supply
right<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.240> turn<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> off<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:07.500> turns<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:08.270> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
right here turn it off it turns up that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
right here turn it off it turns up that
light<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.659> stay<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.140> long<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
light will stay on as long as the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.620 
light will stay on as long as the
generator<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.939> long<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> powers

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
generator is on or as long as the powers

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.030 
generator is on or as long as the powers
off<00:01:12.810> pretty<00:01:13.080> much<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.439> how<00:01:13.500> long<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.860> light

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
off pretty much it's how long that light

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.580 
off pretty much it's how long that light
stays<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> 6<00:01:16.500> volt

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
stays on this one here is on a 6 volt

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.330 
stays on this one here is on a 6 volt
battery<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> shortest<00:01:19.130> running<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
battery this is the shortest running of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.319 
battery this is the shortest running of
any<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> emergency<00:01:21.390> lights<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.840> room

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.910

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
guys find out about the stuff the same

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:27.770 
guys find out about the stuff the same
time<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.739> do

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.240 

now<00:02:28.780> one<00:02:28.960> of<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.140> thick<00:02:29.350> orcs<00:02:29.710> is<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.100> our

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
now one of the thick orcs is with our

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.770 
now one of the thick orcs is with our
generator<00:02:31.200> sometimes<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.410> voltage<00:02:32.830> output

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
generator sometimes the voltage output

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.610 
generator sometimes the voltage output
isn't<00:02:34.780> quite<00:02:35.320> high<00:02:35.590> enough<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.300> around

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
isn't quite high enough it's like around

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
isn't quite high enough it's like around
104<00:02:38.620> volts<00:02:39.010> or<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.900> which<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:40.930> low<00:02:41.920> enough<00:02:42.280> that

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
104 volts or so which is low enough that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.500 
104 volts or so which is low enough that
the<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:44.800> sometimes<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.400> fire<00:02:45.610> alarm<00:02:45.910> or<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the that sometimes the fire alarm or the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.590 
the that sometimes the fire alarm or the
UPS<00:02:46.660> units<00:02:47.550> think<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.670> powers<00:02:49.030> off<00:02:49.210> even

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
UPS units think the powers off even

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.030

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380

back<00:03:02.920> up<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.430> bit<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.850> it'll<00:03:04.450> switch

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
back up a little bit and it'll switch

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.070 
back up a little bit and it'll switch
off<00:03:05.800> its<00:03:06.130> batteries<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.850> then<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.810> alarm

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
off its batteries and then the alarm

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.960 
off its batteries and then the alarm
goes<00:03:08.290> off<00:03:08.470> because<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:09.190> trouble<00:03:09.520> silenced

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
goes off because the trouble silenced

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.810 
goes off because the trouble silenced
button<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.360> pushed<00:03:10.570> down<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.220> fix<00:03:12.610> that

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
button is pushed down and you fix that

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.430 
button is pushed down and you fix that
and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.060> drift<00:03:13.420> dips<00:03:13.720> back<00:03:13.930> down<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.320> goes

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
and then drift dips back down and goes

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.420 
and then drift dips back down and goes
to<00:03:14.590> battery<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.010> then<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.160> gives<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.400> a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
to battery and then it gives you a

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.800 
to battery and then it gives you a
trouble<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.060> silence<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.660> just

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
trouble then you silence it and just

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.720 
trouble then you silence it and just
it's<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.380> repeating<00:03:17.800> cycle<00:03:17.980> which<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.400> lots<00:03:18.550> and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
it's a repeating cycle which is lots and

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.570 
it's a repeating cycle which is lots and
lots<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.970> fun<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.620> there<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.370> guys<00:03:21.520> go

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
and that has a fresh battery in it so I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.520 
and that has a fresh battery in it so I
don't<00:03:47.590> know<00:03:47.680> if<00:03:47.800> they<00:03:47.950> got<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.630> surge<00:03:49.630> hit<00:03:50.380> it

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530
