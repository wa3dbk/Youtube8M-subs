00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:17.611
 Is body removal and identification planned in the near future? How will identification take place? 

00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:19.161
 Identification? 

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:23.584
 An authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense will come here from the Ukrainian side. 

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:29.383
 We pass on the body and the body identification will be carried out in the Dnepropetrovsk morgue. 

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:35.455
 DNA tests will be carried out there and the identity determined. 

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:38.435
 So such procedures do not take place in DNR? 

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:41.422
 No, we just pass the bodies. 

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:42.010
 I get it. 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.155
 Could you introduce yourself? 

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:48.532
 I am Deputy Chairwoman of the Commission for the Exchange of Prisoners of the Ministry of Defense, DNR 

00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:50.186
 Ridionova Lilija. 

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:56.718
 And do you get any questions about missing? 

00:00:56.718 --> 00:00:59.005
 Not from the official structures. 

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.615
 No one has ever turned to us, not once. 

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:05.571
 Only relatives call us. 

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.488
 So they are not officially interested in those who have disappeared in this area? 

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:10.804
 At least nobody turned to us. 

00:01:13.643 --> 00:01:15.349
 Does a lot of relatives call you? 

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:17.803
 Much. Very much. 

00:01:17.803 --> 00:01:20.367
 Day and night. 

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:24.926
 A lot of missing people have been reported there since the Ilovaya Cauldron, the Staroevich Cauldron. 

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:29.314
 Debalcev's boiler now, there is also a lot missing. 

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:34.879
 Did you read any notes, they were also from relatives? 

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:40.705
 Yes, I'm taking notes. I have a large database of missing persons. 

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:48.070
 I'm making notes because they call me when I'm on the road and always try to make a quick note of it and then look for it. 

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:55.381
 Raven, Lawyer, Rachman 

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.775
 and the 93rd Brigade of Jakut and Bradka. 

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:02.858
 The prisoners have told us that these people are in the air at the airport. 

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.527
 So, the prisoners themselves ... 

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:12.783
 Yes, they unfortunately do not know the surname, but remember the nicknames. 

00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:14.748
 They were witnesses. 

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:21.231
 When we pulled out the bodies last week 

00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:26.325
 so during the hauling one man immediately recognized two soldiers. 

00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:27.382
 So the prisoners themselves are helping you? 

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:29.998
 Yes, they help us.
