00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
but where their hand kind of has a lot

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.380 
but where their hand kind of has a lot
more<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
more to do with it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539 
more to do with it
like<00:01:15.840> their<00:01:16.020> hand<00:01:16.350> mojo<00:01:16.799> versus<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.340> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
like their hand mojo versus it just

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
like their hand mojo versus it just
twirling<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.479> fingers<00:01:19.080> like

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.190 
twirling and that and my fingers like
that<00:01:19.640> which<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> think<00:01:21.180> bond<00:01:21.570> did<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that which is what I think bond did so

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.999 
that which is what I think bond did so
you<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:28.970> up<00:01:29.970> high<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.799> then

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you see like up high and then and then

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.319 
you see like up high and then and then
twirl<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:32.759> finish<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.150> off<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> way

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
twirl then finish it off this is the way

00:01:39.329 --> 00:05:11.980 
twirl then finish it off this is the way
I<00:01:39.360> play<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.040> so

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.270 

it<00:05:12.990> looks<00:05:13.259> cool<00:05:13.530> because<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:13.860> looks<00:05:14.009> like<00:05:14.129> it's

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
it looks cool because it looks like it's

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.950 
it looks cool because it looks like it's
a<00:05:14.340> hell<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.669> lot<00:05:14.789> of<00:05:14.909> effort<00:05:15.300> kind<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.840> like

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
a hell of a lot of effort kind of like

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.600 
a hell of a lot of effort kind of like
he<00:05:16.050> seems<00:05:16.289> like<00:05:16.409> he<00:05:16.500> goes<00:05:16.650> like<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:17.069> and<00:05:17.490> then

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
he seems like he goes like that and then

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.189 
he seems like he goes like that and then
coming<00:05:17.969> in<00:05:18.090> something<00:05:18.599> that<00:05:18.690> looks<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:18.990> it's

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
coming in something that looks like it's

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.320 
coming in something that looks like it's
in<00:05:19.319> a<00:05:19.349> lot<00:05:19.740> of<00:05:19.770> effort<00:05:20.219> son's<00:05:20.580> real<00:05:20.879> heavy<00:05:21.150> at

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
in a lot of effort son's real heavy at

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.830 
in a lot of effort son's real heavy at
the<00:05:21.449> same<00:05:21.659> time<00:05:21.930> like
