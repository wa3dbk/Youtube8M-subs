00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
the Exmoor our sensor yeah gives you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.609 
the Exmoor our sensor yeah gives you
great<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.210> low<00:01:29.360> light<00:01:29.630> just<00:01:30.259> because<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
great in low light just because the

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.749 
great in low light just because the
sun's<00:01:30.860> going<00:01:31.100> down<00:01:31.130> doesn't<00:01:31.580> mean<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:31.729> have

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
sun's going down doesn't mean you have

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.270 
sun's going down doesn't mean you have
to<00:01:31.880> stop<00:01:31.939> shooting<00:01:32.570> yeah<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:33.259> got<00:01:33.500> 120

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
to stop shooting yeah it's got 120

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.069 
to stop shooting yeah it's got 120
frames<00:01:34.490> per<00:01:34.640> second<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:35.299> now<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.509> can<00:01:35.750> do<00:01:35.900> slow

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
frames per second so now you can do slow

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.560 
frames per second so now you can do slow
motion<00:01:36.829> which<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.970> know<00:01:38.030> great<00:01:38.299> feature

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
motion which is you know great feature

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.700 
motion which is you know great feature
that<00:01:38.750> no<00:01:38.840> one<00:01:38.960> else<00:01:39.079> has<00:01:39.140> Heather<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.590> can

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
that no one else has Heather you can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.590 
that no one else has Heather you can
slow<00:01:39.860> down<00:01:40.040> by<00:01:40.250> four<00:01:40.549> times<00:01:40.820> four<00:01:41.210> times<00:01:41.240> was

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
slow down by four times four times was

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.149 
slow down by four times four times was
it<00:01:41.630> down<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.930> 30<00:01:42.110> frames<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.439> second<00:01:42.680> exactly

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
it down to 30 frames a second exactly

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.429 
it down to 30 frames a second exactly
and<00:01:43.340> then<00:01:44.030> built<00:01:44.509> in<00:01:44.630> stabilization<00:01:45.049> which

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
and then built in stabilization which

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.499 
and then built in stabilization which
again<00:01:45.860> Sony's<00:01:46.280> got<00:01:46.430> a<00:01:46.460> great<00:01:46.640> reputation<00:01:46.970> for

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
lens exmor r sensor stabilization and

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.649 
lens exmor r sensor stabilization and
slow<00:01:57.950> motion<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.490> great<00:01:58.939> little<00:01:59.090> camera<00:01:59.479> for
