send them out I got through not even 10

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500

of<00:00:25.289> them<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.340> how<00:00:26.550> long<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.150> process

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
like I was really surprised by that and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
like I was really surprised by that and
I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.179> part<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> had<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
I think part of it had to do with the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.930 
I think part of it had to do with the
fact<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.890> didn't<00:00:32.160> want<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.550> send<00:00:32.790> out

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
fact that I didn't want to just send out

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
fact that I didn't want to just send out
like<00:00:33.149> flirts<00:00:33.570> or<00:00:33.870> winks<00:00:34.230> whatever<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> you

to find out from you like you know how

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.729 
to find out from you like you know how
how<00:03:23.970> long<00:03:24.299> how<00:03:24.660> back<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.140> forth<00:03:25.350> do<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.590> go

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
how long how back and forth do you go

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.880 
how long how back and forth do you go
with<00:03:25.890> your<00:03:26.040> emails<00:03:26.430> before<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:28.170> ask<00:03:28.620> someone

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
with your emails before you ask someone

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.250 
with your emails before you ask someone
out<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.280> generally<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> think<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.019> guys

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
out and generally I think that the guys

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.100 
out and generally I think that the guys
take<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.890> lead<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.510> terms<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.630> going<00:03:33.810> back<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
take the lead in terms of going back and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.960 
take the lead in terms of going back and
forth<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> guys<00:03:34.890> will<00:03:35.579> ask<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
forth and the guys will ask for the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.289 
forth and the guys will ask for the
phone<00:03:36.180> number<00:03:36.480> next<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.920> know

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
phone number next and then you know

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.699 
phone number next and then you know
hopefully<00:03:39.299> after<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.049> phone<00:03:40.230> number<00:03:40.500> then

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
hopefully after the phone number then

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.410 
hopefully after the phone number then
they'll<00:03:40.950> ask<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.280> out<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.640> date<00:03:41.670> usually

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
they'll ask you out on a date usually

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.729 
they'll ask you out on a date usually
that's<00:03:42.600> how<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.870> goes<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.290> sometimes<00:03:43.620> a

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
that's how it goes and sometimes a

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:44.840 
that's how it goes and sometimes a
little<00:03:43.950> bit<00:03:44.130> different<00:03:44.459> but<00:03:44.549> I'm<00:03:44.640> especially
