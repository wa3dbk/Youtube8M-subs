 If you go to a site that handles a lot of old software 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.830
 There is about 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.600
 Using this software 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.600

 You can restore it by selecting here 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.450
 Well it is it looks like 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.450
 Well this time pc game and pc 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.110
 Unusual and Okabe are also using it for the main 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.460
 It is a youth-tier back met Well 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.460
 That one 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.850
 Using the character voice of this character Ellis 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.260
 I want to change the sound 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.269
 There are a lot of such feelings, and this time Iris 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.690
 8 start it's Ellis start in general 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.040
 I tried using this 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.220
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.100
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:50.620
 It is here we set as hey when Dawn 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.150
 By the way, file police is file format and this 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.680
 wav you 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.680
 Only wav is supported 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.159
 I changed it 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.270
 Let's start a little old actually 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.290
 What it feels like 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.290
 Let's take a look 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:24.100
 This time it's a character voice, so it's a bit longer and the line is longer 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.100
 I think the line is broken halfway 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.750
 It seems to be recent with trust 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:40.000
 Because the sound of the end date is also written 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.000
 I think it's probably changed , but what about it? 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.220
 I said that it was a balance of my feet 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.820
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.820
 After all, if the government is long, it will be cut off on the way 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.500
 Come on 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.830
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.299
 Would you like to 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.940
 It does not do 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:20.000
 Maa like this 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.000
 It is a start sound- 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:28.220
 Eh this time 8 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.220
 I tried using character voice 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:37.660
 Well because the serif is cut off in the middle 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.480
 Well short government 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.560
 If you use 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.560
 I think it is good 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:54.689
 Yes Well the outrage of it is the windows 7 this time 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.840

00:07:54.689 --> 00:08:01.030
 It is like this 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.030
