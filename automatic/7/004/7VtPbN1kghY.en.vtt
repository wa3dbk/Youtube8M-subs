00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 execute all friends welcome to a 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.000
 new video thanks to you guys what 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
 they asked for today I bring you the 5 trucks 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.929
 less used of said play in this picture 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.130
 say let's start with the top number 5 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.780
 throughout this season was one of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.300
 the best selections for the line of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 mid this champion is surgut he had his 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.859
 glory time when it was fixed by 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.390
 quini and destroyed the set of villiers in 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.010
 unfortunately that time ended burgos 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.630
 throughout history has had its 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
 good times like the carry and mid 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 leiner but currently it is one of the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.000
 least likely chosen by the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.120
 difficulty of your mechanics or because 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.449
 it's just ugly 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.949
 number 4 in position number 4 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.809
 we find concilian he is done 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.250
 to make a support or mitloehner but 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.050
 the different goals throughout the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.879
 time have not favored him since it is a 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.739
 champion who can resist a lot puts you 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.329
 a long time came his rebound they tried 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.920
 to give some control to cilia crowd 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.899
 but in my opinion they came back very 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.579
 difficult to use surely the reason why 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.440
 which they do not use is the difficulty 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.239
 to use it correctly and at the same time 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.710
 be a champion that is very resistant already 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.570
 that for support there are many better 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.430
 options that silvia until you do not 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.340
 I have an improvement he will stay in this 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.409
 position number 3 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.179
 they know her as the ugliest champion of 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.649
 all the play son is the one waiting for his 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.689
 red work two seasons ago 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.399
 she is pop and I think the problem 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.049
 with pop and it's not your skills kit anymore 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.460
 because it's broken if it's not your 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.319
 appearance which causes the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.360
 players do not see the ribbon and what 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.950
 say about kobe palette she overcomes the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.530
 promoter standards just 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.060
 looking at her is a total beauty if you do not 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
 you like this pop video and it will go 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.590
 maybe visit your kit skills and your 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.450
 mechanical influences a bit but what 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.490
 more highlights why they do not choose it is 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 its appearance and what I think that up 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.679
 do not do her review she 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.289
 will remain one of the most unpopular 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.209
 number 2 is worth occupies this position and 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.709
 possibly its popularity is due to 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.390
 skills kit that has already its 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.979
 appearance your skills have been 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.049
 left behind do not adapt to the new 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.149
 ways to play and the goal of champions 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.739
 It also greatly influences a gargoyle 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.049
 since being it does not give a good 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.670
 appearance something that is with him is his 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.009
 last one that allows you to start any 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.170
 tim fain but the line that you always go 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.000
 there will be better options that gale maybe 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.860
 in the future , improve your skills or 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.090
 its appearance but for now it will stay in 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.810
 position number 2 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.640
 number 1 many thought that pop would be 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.349
 in this position but when I thought that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.780
 there was someone more unpopular than little 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.730
 well I surpass him he suffers the same 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.290
 problem that the previous champions and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.300
 is that it does not fit the goal because of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.220
 your skills kit there will always be someone 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.650
 that it will be better to choose it instead of 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.510
 yorick and this again is due to what 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.040
 bad that you see even if you do not believe it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.019
 The champion's appearance implies a lot 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.970
 in the game but because there would be 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.709
 skins or why would you buy them if you 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.959
 It would give the same thing as the champion 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.910
 crying skills can be very 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.650
 good but as has happened in all 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.510
 this top the appearance of the champion is what 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.890
 that is imposed first of all because the image 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 of a grave digger is not very 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.730
 attractive to players maybe because 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.049
 that does not choose this factor is what 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.239
 position there is now in the number position 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.069
 one I hope that at some time they 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.329
 come your visual rigor and skills 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.519
 to all the champions that have been 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.030
 mentioned in this top if not in some 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.860
 all of them will disappear 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.660
 and good friends before saying goodbye and 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.730
 send greetings many asked me 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.590
 by the string and fan page form existed 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.660
 some program to avoid the at the time 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.890
 of player pair because if there is in my 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.600
 case has served me to play in the 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.770
 enea and lan servers with a 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.120
 better latency 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.100
 the program is called guatafán and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.420
 surely some will already know the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.370
 link I leave it in the description no 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.530
 it will be necessary to register only 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.390
 is to download and play on the page you 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.560
 it will come out free download you click there and 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.390
 then the whatsapp will start at 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.040
 download they install it as any 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.200
 program and then a window will come out 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880
 if they leave everything as it is and give it the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.560
 login will begin to connect with the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.060
 servers of the program and clarified that 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.459
 this program is useful to play others 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.140
 games apart from live of legends now 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.300
 where it says game we wrote in said of 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.590
 legends and select it where it says 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.569
 network if they are going to play on the servers 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 from norteamérica online le den custom ice 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.769
 network and choose florida 6 and now I 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.360
 They will say why choose this server 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.010
 This is the one that gives you the best latency for 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.930
 play in North America and in the pnc 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.880
 finally they give him in play and will open them 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.650
 automatically and you will see how the ping has 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.269
 lowered drastically remember that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.069
 whenever they are going to play it they must open 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.780
 first the wat to fast and good friends that 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.700
 it has been all remember to leave them a like 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.420
 if you liked the video if I do not think violate 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.370
 unless 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.260
 for you who is the most champion 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.820
 unpopular or the ugliest champion that 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.200
 you know now I will send the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.269
