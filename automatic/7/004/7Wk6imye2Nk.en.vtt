put it one over so remember that okay
we're<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.470> over<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:05.189> behind<00:01:05.369> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
we're going to go over here behind it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.719 
we're going to go over here behind it
place<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.080> right<00:01:07.320> there

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
place one right there one right there

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.780 
place one right there one right there
let's<00:01:08.729> don't<00:01:08.970> torch<00:01:09.210> read<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.320> dust<00:01:10.790> dig

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
let's don't torch read some dust dig

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.910 
let's don't torch read some dust dig
down<00:01:12.229> dig<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.340> dig<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.330> over

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
down dig down and then dig down and over

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
down dig down and then dig down and over
so<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.400> shop<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.670> roles<00:01:18.090> total<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.470> one

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
so you shop for roles total and this one

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
so you shop for roles total and this one
you're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> put<00:01:20.130> redstone<00:01:20.340> dust<00:01:20.729> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you're going to put redstone dust this

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
you're going to put redstone dust this
one<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> redstone<00:01:22.140> repeater<00:01:22.560> facing<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.549> way

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
one a redstone repeater facing that way

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.980 
one a redstone repeater facing that way
on<00:01:24.090> foldaway<00:01:26.240> redstone<00:01:27.240> dust<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> one

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
on foldaway redstone dust in this one

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.859 
on foldaway redstone dust in this one
and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.829> redstone<00:01:29.280> torch<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.570> wall

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and then a redstone torch on this wall

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.080 
and then a redstone torch on this wall
not<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> floor<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> wall<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:32.880> you're

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
not on the floor on the wall then you're

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.810 
not on the floor on the wall then you're
going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> place<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.869> block<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> redstone

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
going to place a block on the redstone

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.410 
going to place a block on the redstone
torch<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.579> redstone<00:01:38.579> dust<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.000> top<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
torch with a redstone dust on top of it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
torch with a redstone dust on top of it
and<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> block<00:01:41.009> over<00:01:41.040> the

rest of these like that so then you can

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
rest of these like that so then you can
fill<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.229> area<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:49.820> little

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
fill in this area then do that a little

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.260 
fill in this area then do that a little
bit

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.600 

okay<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.570> then<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.710> then<00:01:58.130> you're<00:01:58.220> gonna<00:01:58.310> place

okay and then so then you're gonna place

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.120 
okay and then so then you're gonna place
a<00:01:58.910> redstone<00:01:59.090> repeaters<00:01:59.930> like<00:02:00.410> there's<00:02:00.620> no<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
a redstone repeaters like there's no the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.700 
a redstone repeaters like there's no the
way<00:02:01.510> you<00:02:02.510> will<00:02:02.690> this<00:02:02.930> will<00:02:03.170> be<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:03.470> your

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
way you will this will be like your

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.620 
way you will this will be like your
source<00:02:04.190> on<00:02:04.460> how<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.640> turn<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.970> off<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.120> on<00:02:05.360> so

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
source on how to turn it off and on so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.720 
source on how to turn it off and on so
you<00:02:05.720> can<00:02:05.780> run<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.350> around<00:02:06.710> anywhere<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:07.400> you

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
you can run this around anywhere if you

you can run it to a wall say and then
play<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> lever<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:17.630> opens

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
play a lever on that and then it opens

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.110 
play a lever on that and then it opens
and<00:02:20.710> closes<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.900> yeah<00:02:24.170> that's<00:02:24.380> how<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.590> do<00:02:24.860> a
