00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
predict the weather the second is to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.649 
predict the weather the second is to
study<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> effects<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> climate<00:01:14.130> change

how clouds influence the amount of light
that<00:03:49.870> gets<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.620> ground<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.189> also<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
that gets to the ground and also the

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.199 
that gets to the ground and also the
amount<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.209> heat<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:53.049> gets<00:03:53.349> we<00:03:54.280> sent<00:03:54.760> back<00:03:54.970> up

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
amount of heat that gets we sent back up

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.990 
amount of heat that gets we sent back up
into<00:03:55.420> space<00:03:55.659> so<00:03:56.260> we're<00:03:56.920> mostly<00:03:57.250> looking<00:03:57.670> at<00:03:57.849> it

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
into space so we're mostly looking at it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.690 
into space so we're mostly looking at it
from<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.239> sort<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.810> broad<00:03:59.260> issue<00:03:59.700> rather

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
from that sort of broad issue rather

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.970 
from that sort of broad issue rather
than<00:04:00.849> from<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.450> local<00:04:01.840> weather<00:04:02.110> perspective

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
than from the local weather perspective

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.770 
than from the local weather perspective
or<00:04:03.159> anything<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.670> some<00:04:04.329> of<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.540> things

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
or anything like that some of the things

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.100 
or anything like that some of the things
that<00:04:04.959> we're<00:04:05.079> looking<00:04:05.230> for<00:04:05.470> our<00:04:06.159> contrails

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
that we're looking for our contrails

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.930 
that we're looking for our contrails
which<00:04:08.110> are<00:04:08.290> hard<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.709> see<00:04:08.920> from<00:04:09.099> space<00:04:09.280> because

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
which are hard to see from space because

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.410 
which are hard to see from space because
they're<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:10.690> small<00:04:11.459> small<00:04:12.459> cirrus<00:04:13.150> clouds

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
they're so small small cirrus clouds

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.780 
they're so small small cirrus clouds
small<00:04:13.870> cumulus<00:04:14.379> clouds<00:04:14.650> are<00:04:15.069> hard<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.579> see

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
small cumulus clouds are hard to see

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.330 
small cumulus clouds are hard to see
thin<00:04:16.209> clouds<00:04:16.510> are<00:04:16.870> hard<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.199> see<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:18.010> then<00:04:18.190> as

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
thin clouds are hard to see and then as

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.509 
thin clouds are hard to see and then as
I<00:04:18.489> mentioned<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.060> multi-layer<00:04:19.630> issue<00:04:20.250> we<00:04:21.250> get

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
I mentioned the multi-layer issue we get

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.790 
I mentioned the multi-layer issue we get
complimentary<00:04:22.330> information<00:04:23.050> from<00:04:23.620> the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
complimentary information from the

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.409 
complimentary information from the
ground<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.460> from<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.789> satellite<00:04:25.240> that's

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
ground and from the satellite that's

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.110 
ground and from the satellite that's
very<00:04:25.750> helpful<00:04:25.990> so<00:04:26.889> we<00:04:27.220> just<00:04:27.430> have<00:04:27.550> to<00:04:27.699> see<00:04:27.880> what

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
very helpful so we just have to see what

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.210 
very helpful so we just have to see what
data<00:04:28.360> we<00:04:28.479> get<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.050> see<00:04:29.289> what<00:04:29.620> we<00:04:29.979> can<00:04:30.190> learn

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
data we get and see what we can learn

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.210 
data we get and see what we can learn
from<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.760> Wow<00:04:31.389> globey<00:04:31.930> who<00:04:32.380> knew<00:04:32.650> there<00:04:32.830> was<00:04:32.919> so

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
from it Wow globey who knew there was so

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.560 
from it Wow globey who knew there was so
much<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.550> be<00:04:33.639> learned<00:04:33.669> from<00:04:34.060> studying<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
much to be learned from studying the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.840 
much to be learned from studying the
clouds<00:04:34.840> above<00:04:35.110> our<00:04:35.289> heads<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:36.400> can<00:04:36.550> learn<00:04:36.669> to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
clouds above our heads you can learn to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.520 
clouds above our heads you can learn to
better<00:04:37.000> predict<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.510> weather<00:04:37.660> or<00:04:37.960> measure

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
better predict the weather or measure

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.920 
better predict the weather or measure
the<00:04:38.710> impact<00:04:39.010> we're<00:04:39.280> having<00:04:39.520> on<00:04:39.639> our<00:04:39.729> planet<00:04:40.030> so

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
the impact we're having on our planet so

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.900 
the impact we're having on our planet so
the<00:04:41.050> next<00:04:41.199> time<00:04:41.410> you're<00:04:41.650> outside<00:04:42.070> take<00:04:42.729> a<00:04:42.760> look

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
the next time you're outside take a look

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.580 
the next time you're outside take a look
at<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.150> clouds<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.750> see<00:04:44.199> if<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.440> can

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
at the clouds and see if you can

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.529 
at the clouds and see if you can
determine<00:04:44.889> whether<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:45.400> gonna<00:04:45.490> rain<00:04:45.820> or

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
determine whether it's gonna rain or

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:57.470 
determine whether it's gonna rain or
shine

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.510 

Oh
