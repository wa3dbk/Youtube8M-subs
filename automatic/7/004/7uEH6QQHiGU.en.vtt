traditional<00:02:23.720> pedal<00:02:24.410> board<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.950> sense<00:02:25.280> in

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
traditional pedal board in a sense in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.490 
traditional pedal board in a sense in
that<00:02:25.640> you've<00:02:25.910> got<00:02:26.150> access<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.840> every<00:02:27.290> single

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
that you've got access to every single

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.250 
that you've got access to every single
thing<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:28.460> you<00:02:28.520> have<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> ability<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.540> preset

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
thing now you have the ability to preset

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.050 
thing now you have the ability to preset
combinations<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.130> these<00:02:31.250> things<00:02:31.550> on<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.910> off

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
combinations of these things on and off

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.630 
combinations of these things on and off
like<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.570> one<00:02:32.780> button<00:02:33.200> can<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:33.980> multiple

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
like and in one button can have multiple

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.940 
like and in one button can have multiple
things<00:02:35.000> come<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.750> off<00:02:35.870> now<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.770> have

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
things come on and off now that you have

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.070 
things come on and off now that you have
presets<00:02:37.700> well<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.270> sounds<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.750> make<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.050> a

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
presets well it sounds you make on a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.170 
presets well it sounds you make on a
record<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.590> can<00:02:39.740> recreate<00:02:40.100> lot<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:41.000> but

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
record you can recreate lot just but

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.820 
record you can recreate lot just but
this<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.720> know<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> drop<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.350> switch<00:02:42.590> right

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
this you know the drop of a switch right

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.470 
this you know the drop of a switch right
here<00:02:43.010> now<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.640> mean<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.000> can<00:02:44.150> go<00:02:44.300> from

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
here now I mean you can go from

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.250 
here now I mean you can go from
absolutely<00:02:45.050> dry<00:02:45.320> nothing<00:02:46.390> that's<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:48.200> is

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
absolutely dry nothing that's it this is

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.590 
absolutely dry nothing that's it this is
like<00:02:48.500> plugging<00:02:48.770> in<00:02:48.920> omar's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
like plugging in omar's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.090 
like plugging in omar's
and<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.690> bypasses<00:02:51.140> all<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.560> all<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> other

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and it bypasses all this all the other

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.190 
and it bypasses all this all the other
stuff<00:02:52.400> now<00:02:53.239> if<00:02:53.360> you're<00:02:53.480> gonna<00:02:53.570> step<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:54.050> this<00:02:54.140> a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
stuff now if you're gonna step on this a

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.040 
stuff now if you're gonna step on this a
little<00:02:54.380> bit<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.709> know<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:56.630> they<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.810> just

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
little bit you know just they have just

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.990 
little bit you know just they have just
a<00:02:57.140> little<00:02:57.290> delay<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.370> easy<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:01.580> dude<00:03:01.820> that

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
a little delay so easy so dude that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.190 
a little delay so easy so dude that
carries<00:03:02.330> off<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.600> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.350 

another<00:03:11.200> great<00:03:11.620> benefit<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.549> this<00:03:12.879> approach

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
another great benefit to this approach

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.979 
another great benefit to this approach
over<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.980> fact<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:15.849> here<00:03:16.450> you're

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
over this is the fact that here you're

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.070 
over this is the fact that here you're
running<00:03:17.409> through<00:03:17.650> every<00:03:18.190> single<00:03:18.610> cable<00:03:19.540> every

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
running through every single cable every

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.190 
running through every single cable every
single<00:03:20.680> effect<00:03:21.159> everything<00:03:22.000> all<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.930> time

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
single effect everything all the time

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.860 
single effect everything all the time
that's<00:03:23.860> why<00:03:24.159> people<00:03:24.819> will<00:03:25.299> go<00:03:25.480> man<00:03:25.720> I'm

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
that's why people will go man I'm

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.569 
that's why people will go man I'm
running<00:03:26.200> through<00:03:26.409> all<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.560> these<00:03:26.829> pedals<00:03:27.400> and

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
running through all of these pedals and

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.580 
running through all of these pedals and
everything<00:03:28.030> my<00:03:28.599> order<00:03:29.019> what's<00:03:29.260> happened<00:03:29.530> to

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
everything my order what's happened to

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.319 
everything my order what's happened to
my<00:03:29.680> guitar<00:03:30.040> tone<00:03:30.280> when<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:30.549> plugged<00:03:30.849> my<00:03:30.940> guitar

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
my guitar tone when I plugged my guitar

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.300 
my guitar tone when I plugged my guitar
straight<00:03:31.690> into<00:03:31.870> my<00:03:32.019> app<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.440> sounds<00:03:32.769> great

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
straight into my app it sounds great

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.490 
straight into my app it sounds great
when<00:03:33.610> I<00:03:33.670> plug<00:03:33.909> through<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.299> pedal<00:03:34.720> board<00:03:34.959> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
when I plug through this pedal board so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.949 
when I plug through this pedal board so
I<00:03:35.530> don't<00:03:35.680> look<00:03:35.799> this<00:03:36.510> having<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.599> looping

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
I don't look this having a looping

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.270 
I don't look this having a looping

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
in a system and here's why what happens

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.099 
in a system and here's why what happens
is<00:03:49.239> we<00:03:50.049> go<00:03:50.769> through<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.099> series<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.640> loops<00:03:52.120> but

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
is we go through a series of loops but

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.580 
is we go through a series of loops but
we<00:03:53.409> truly<00:03:53.769> bypass<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.870> effect<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.530> the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
we truly bypass the effect and the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.220 
we truly bypass the effect and the
cables<00:03:57.549> connecting<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.150> effect<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:59.079> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
cables connecting the effect so the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.899 
cables connecting the effect so the
single<00:03:59.500> path<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.859> much<00:04:00.040> purer<00:04:00.400> in<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.670> case

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
it work right I realize that I had some

it work right I realize that I had some
building<00:05:14.850> blocks<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.330> were<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.630> same<00:05:15.900> and

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
building blocks that were the same and

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.580 
building blocks that were the same and
so<00:05:17.010> we<00:05:18.000> came<00:05:18.210> up<00:05:18.270> with<00:05:18.570> switchers<00:05:19.020> like<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.380> 4

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
so we came up with switchers like the 4

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.560
