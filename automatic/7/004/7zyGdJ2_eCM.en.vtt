00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
crevasse it's a bad day to be scarify

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.440 
crevasse it's a bad day to be scarify
and<00:02:11.560> just<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.640> thought<00:02:12.850> I'd<00:02:13.120> done<00:02:13.300> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
vertigo thing there was an added bonus

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.650 
vertigo thing there was an added bonus
at<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.760> top<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.860> glass<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:18.660> you

to do shoot the line and fall down the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.440 
to do shoot the line and fall down the
crevasse<00:02:51.160> you're<00:02:51.490> making<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.910> way<00:02:52.060> harder

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
crevasse you're making that way harder

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.120 
crevasse you're making that way harder
than<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.600> needs<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.020> be<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.350> don't<00:02:53.830> go<00:02:53.950> out

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.040 
than it needs to be just don't go out
the<00:02:54.310> guides<00:02:54.520> tracks<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.150> never<00:02:55.330> overtake<00:02:55.750> him

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.710 

perfectly<00:02:59.050> undemonstrated<00:02:59.950> by<00:03:00.760> Graham

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.720 

so<00:03:04.720> onto<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.260> glass<00:03:05.470> here<00:03:05.710> we<00:03:05.890> ventured<00:03:06.340> but

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
so onto the glass here we ventured but

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.920 
so onto the glass here we ventured but
our<00:03:06.820> journey<00:03:07.120> was<00:03:07.360> not<00:03:07.720> without<00:03:08.230> drama<00:03:08.530> oh

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.880 

look<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.140> producers<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:17.140> just<00:03:17.440> pulled<00:03:17.740> up

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
look and producers we just pulled up

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.020 
look and producers we just pulled up
here<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.700> edge<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.390> roll<00:03:19.990> and<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.790> my

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
here on the edge of a roll and in my

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.090 
here on the edge of a roll and in my
limited<00:03:22.600> knowledge<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:23.110> glaciers<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.650> think

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
limited knowledge of glaciers I think

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.520 
limited knowledge of glaciers I think
that<00:03:24.370> as<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.880> glacier<00:03:25.330> rolls<00:03:25.630> over<00:03:25.900> something

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
that as the glacier rolls over something

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.610 
that as the glacier rolls over something
so<00:03:26.740> it<00:03:26.890> starts<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.370> split<00:03:27.610> open<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.930> crevasses

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
so it starts to split open and crevasses

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.580 
so it starts to split open and crevasses
are<00:03:29.740> forming<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:30.400> see<00:03:30.610> this<00:03:30.760> hole<00:03:31.420> here<00:03:31.810> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
are forming you see this hole here and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.440 
are forming you see this hole here and
there's<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> big<00:03:33.100> hole<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:33.580> down<00:03:33.820> there<00:03:34.060> what

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
there's a big hole just down there what

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.090 
there's a big hole just down there what
we're<00:03:34.600> going<00:03:34.780> across<00:03:34.990> now<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> bridge<00:03:35.800> over

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
we're going across now is a bridge over
