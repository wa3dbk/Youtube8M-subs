00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.090 
side so once you get this tightened up
make<00:02:07.509> sure<00:02:07.539> that<00:02:07.810> it's<00:02:07.960> not<00:02:08.080> too<00:02:08.289> tight<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
make sure that it's not too tight and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
make sure that it's not too tight and
almost<00:02:15.100> all<00:02:15.250> these<00:02:15.459> feet<00:02:15.670> brakes<00:02:15.880> are<00:02:16.000> going

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
almost all these feet brakes are going

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.280 
almost all these feet brakes are going
to<00:02:16.180> have<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> little<00:02:16.660> screw<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:16.959> each<00:02:17.230> side<00:02:19.290> but

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
to have a little screw on each side but

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.410 
to have a little screw on each side but
those<00:02:20.470> are<00:02:20.620> going<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.100> say<00:02:21.790> if<00:02:21.970> say<00:02:22.300> if

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
those are going to do is say if say if

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.020 
those are going to do is say if say if
your<00:02:22.570> brake<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.050> uh<00:02:23.430> sticking<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.790> side

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
your brake is uh sticking on this side

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.530 
your brake is uh sticking on this side
and<00:02:25.209> just<00:02:25.420> one<00:02:25.600> sides<00:02:25.870> working<00:02:26.170> if<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:28.330> this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and just one sides working if if this

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.340 
and just one sides working if if this
side<00:02:28.720> screwed<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.320> all<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.709> way<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:31.810> you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
side screwed in all the way then you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.660 
side screwed in all the way then you
would<00:02:32.470> want<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.709> just<00:02:32.769> loosen<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.459> up<00:02:33.580> a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
would want to just loosen this one up a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.180 
would want to just loosen this one up a
little<00:02:33.819> bit<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:35.080> if<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.380> not<00:02:35.500> then<00:02:35.830> tighten

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
little bit and if it's not then tighten

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.460 
little bit and if it's not then tighten
this<00:02:36.310> one<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.050> tighten<00:02:38.440> that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
this one and with as you tighten that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.850 
this one and with as you tighten that
one<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:39.519> going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> bring<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.810> spring<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
one it's going to bring that spring to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.350 
one it's going to bring that spring to
tighten<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:42.190> Springs<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:42.850> bring<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.150> arm

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
tighten that Springs and bring that arm

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.920 
tighten that Springs and bring that arm
over<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.760> or<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.030> loosen<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.420> one<00:02:46.690> you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
over so or you can loosen this one you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.640 
over so or you can loosen this one you
can<00:02:47.049> watch<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.489> do<00:02:48.549> this<00:02:48.850> at<00:02:49.000> all<00:02:49.650> see

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
can watch because I do this at all see

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.160 
can watch because I do this at all see
that<00:02:50.829> loosen<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.370> up<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.660> puts<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.049> that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
that loosen that up and it puts all that

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.010 
that loosen that up and it puts all that
spring<00:02:53.530> tension<00:02:53.950> text<00:02:54.640> off<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.000> side

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
spring tension text off of this side

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.790 
spring tension text off of this side
this<00:02:56.410> would<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:57.220> little<00:02:57.790> more<00:02:58.030> spring<00:02:58.800> same

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
this would be a little more spring same

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.590 
this would be a little more spring same
thing<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.250> side

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.080 

so<00:03:04.600> really<00:03:05.280> tightening<00:03:06.280> either<00:03:06.730> one

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
so really tightening either one

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.670 
so really tightening either one
tightening<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:07.960> one's<00:03:08.170> going<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.380> bring<00:03:08.560> it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
tightening this one's going to bring it

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.270 
tightening this one's going to bring it
that<00:03:08.860> way

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
that way

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.530 
that way
tightening<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:09.940> one's<00:03:10.150> going<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.360> bring

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
tightening this one's going to bring

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.940 
tightening this one's going to bring
break<00:03:10.840> down<00:03:11.020> if<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.350> want<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> balance<00:03:11.740> that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
break down if you want to balance that

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.170 
break down if you want to balance that
out<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.340> where<00:03:12.460> they're<00:03:12.640> doing<00:03:12.790> at<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.000> same

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
out to where they're doing at the same

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.360 
out to where they're doing at the same
time<00:03:13.420> that's<00:03:14.080> pretty<00:03:14.380> much<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:15.160> then<00:03:15.280> you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
time that's pretty much it and then you

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.400 
time that's pretty much it and then you
can<00:03:15.490> adjust<00:03:15.610> this<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.270> know<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.750> really

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
can adjust this you know this is really

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.800 
can adjust this you know this is really
loose<00:03:17.620> even<00:03:18.550> loosen<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.480> pull<00:03:19.660> your

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
loose even loosen this and pull your

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.420 
loose even loosen this and pull your
cable<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.380> little<00:03:20.590> bit<00:03:20.680> tighter<00:03:20.890> or<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.310> can

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
cable a little bit tighter or you can

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.010 
cable a little bit tighter or you can
roll<00:03:21.580> this<00:03:21.670> barrel<00:03:22.000> just<00:03:22.300> drop<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.750> just<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
roll this barrel just drop it's just a

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.870 
roll this barrel just drop it's just a
little<00:03:23.230> bit<00:03:23.380> tighten<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.100> up<00:03:24.160> lock<00:03:24.490> that<00:03:24.670> back

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
little bit tighten it up lock that back

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.090 
little bit tighten it up lock that back
down<00:03:25.290> make<00:03:26.290> sure<00:03:26.320> those<00:03:26.590> are<00:03:26.620> getting<00:03:26.800> at<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
down make sure those are getting at the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.310 
down make sure those are getting at the
same<00:03:27.130> time<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.880> that's<00:03:28.450> pretty<00:03:28.690> much<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.080> on

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
same time and that's pretty much it on

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.580 
same time and that's pretty much it on
the<00:03:29.410> V<00:03:29.560> break<00:03:29.800> easy<00:03:30.190> stuff
