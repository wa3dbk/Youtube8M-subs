their number four is that just above jug
again<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.260> easiest<00:01:00.650> way<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.830> get<00:01:01.130> this<00:01:01.340> is

again the easiest way to get this is

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.120 
again the easiest way to get this is
just<00:01:02.120> have<00:01:02.270> somebody<00:01:02.530> activate<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.650> gondola

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
just have somebody activate the gondola

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
this I was trying to verify on Twitter

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.580 
this I was trying to verify on Twitter
what<00:01:53.090> would<00:01:53.240> happen<00:01:53.630> if<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:54.410> have<00:01:54.560> a

what would happen if you just have a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.290 
what would happen if you just have a
regular<00:01:54.800> blender<00:01:55.220> get<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:55.759> pick<00:01:56.000> up<00:01:56.149> the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
regular blender get and you pick up the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.510 
regular blender get and you pick up the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.270

there are four variations of the

blender gat you've got the acid get

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.650 
blender gat you've got the acid get
you've<00:02:13.400> got<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> sweeper<00:02:14.150> which<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.510> a

regular upgraded blundergat and you have

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.060 
regular upgraded blundergat and you have
the<00:02:16.730> vitriolic<00:02:17.090> withering<00:02:17.720> which<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.470> the

the vitriolic withering which is the
upgraded<00:02:19.220> blundergat<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.750> acid<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.830> I'm

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
upgraded blundergat with acid so I'm

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.270 
upgraded blundergat with acid so I'm
going<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.459> not<00:02:23.360> only<00:02:23.510> upgrade<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.799> regular

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
going to not only upgrade the regular

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.830 
going to not only upgrade the regular
blender<00:02:25.489> get<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.970> acid<00:02:26.360> get<00:02:26.510> I'm<00:02:26.690> also

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
blender get to the acid get I'm also

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.580 
blender get to the acid get I'm also
going<00:02:27.049> to<00:02:27.110> Pat<00:02:27.350> pack<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> punch<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.570> the

going to Pat pack a punch it to the
vitriolic<00:02:30.590> withering<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.760> all<00:02:32.030> we're<00:02:32.209> doing

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
vitriolic withering so all we're doing

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.870 
vitriolic withering so all we're doing
here<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:32.900> ensuring<00:02:33.799> that<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.850> a

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
here is ensuring that we have a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.539 
here is ensuring that we have a
different<00:02:35.540> type<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.810> blundergat<00:02:36.380> before<00:02:37.340> we

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
different type of blundergat before we

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.400 
different type of blundergat before we
collect<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> regular<00:02:38.510> blender<00:02:38.720> get<00:02:39.019> off<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
collect the regular blender get off the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.440 
collect the regular blender get off the
wardens<00:02:39.769> desk<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.370> that's<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.299> ensure

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
wardens desk and that's going to ensure

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.430 
wardens desk and that's going to ensure
that<00:02:41.900> we<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:43.070> fact<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:44.000> blunder<00:02:44.870> GATS<00:02:45.170> or

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
that we have in fact to blunder GATS or

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.770 
that we have in fact to blunder GATS or
variations<00:02:46.430> thereof<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.299> here<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:47.540> go<00:02:47.570> we're

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
variations thereof so here we go we're

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.720 
variations thereof so here we go we're
going<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.989> pick<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.230> up<00:02:48.350> off<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:49.250> wardens<00:02:49.549> desk

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
going to pick it up off the wardens desk

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.330 
going to pick it up off the wardens desk
right<00:02:50.030> now<00:02:50.230> yeah<00:02:51.230> there's<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> regular

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
right now yeah there's the regular

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.180 
right now yeah there's the regular
blender<00:02:52.549> gat<00:02:53.140> sweet<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.470> then<00:02:55.010> we're<00:02:55.100> going

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
blender gat sweet and then we're going

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.920 
blender gat sweet and then we're going
to<00:02:55.310> switch<00:02:55.519> over<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.510> vitriolic

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
to switch over to the vitriolic

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.690 
to switch over to the vitriolic
withering<00:02:57.560> here<00:02:57.769> in<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.890> second<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.519> show

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
withering here in a second just the show

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.690 
withering here in a second just the show
that<00:02:58.940> we<00:02:59.060> have<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.630> in<00:03:00.140> fact<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:01.190> blender<00:03:01.519> gets

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
that we have to in fact to blender gets

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.599 
that we have to in fact to blender gets
there<00:03:01.850> we<00:03:01.910> go<00:03:02.000> see<00:03:02.329> nice<00:03:03.130> that's<00:03:04.130> pretty<00:03:04.250> cool

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
there we go see nice that's pretty cool

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.570 
there we go see nice that's pretty cool
so<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:04.880> think<00:03:05.030> again<00:03:05.900> if<00:03:06.109> you<00:03:06.440> pick<00:03:06.680> up<00:03:06.859> the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
so I think again if you pick up the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.160 
so I think again if you pick up the
blundergat<00:03:08.030> off<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.420> wardens<00:03:08.720> desk<00:03:08.870> without

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
blundergat off the wardens desk without

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.400 
blundergat off the wardens desk without
any<00:03:09.650> other<00:03:10.100> players<00:03:10.430> having<00:03:11.230> pulled<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
any other players having pulled the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.810 
any other players having pulled the
blender<00:03:12.680> got<00:03:12.800> out<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.100> box<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.400> may<00:03:13.670> not

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
blender got out of the box you may not

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820 
blender got out of the box you may not
be<00:03:14.030> able<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.360> pull<00:03:14.600> one<00:03:15.020> out<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.410> box<00:03:15.590> after

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
be able to pull one out of the box after

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.580 
be able to pull one out of the box after
that<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.490> either<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.900> know<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.080> have<00:03:18.380> two

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that so either you know you have two

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.230 
that so either you know you have two
players<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.220> ideally<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.820> want<00:03:19.970> two

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
players and ideally you want two

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.970 
players and ideally you want two
different<00:03:20.690> players<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.410> have<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> blundergat

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
different players to have the blundergat

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.920 
different players to have the blundergat
so<00:03:22.280> they<00:03:22.400> can<00:03:22.580> both<00:03:22.910> upgrade<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.570> vitriol

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
so they can both upgrade to the vitriol

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.660 
so they can both upgrade to the vitriol
withering<00:03:24.380> because<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> pretty<00:03:25.460> damn

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
withering because it's a pretty damn

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.170 
withering because it's a pretty damn
good<00:03:25.970> gun<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.800> just<00:03:28.400> one<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.670> show<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.060> you

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
good gun but just one to show that you

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.970 
good gun but just one to show that you
can<00:03:29.420> in<00:03:29.570> fact<00:03:29.600> have<00:03:29.990> one<00:03:30.260> player<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.680> this<00:03:30.770> can

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
can in fact have one player and this can

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.260 
can in fact have one player and this can
be<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.280> know<00:03:31.310> again<00:03:31.610> if<00:03:31.760> you're<00:03:31.970> playing<00:03:32.180> on

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
be you know again if you're playing on
