00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 [Music] 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.410
 let's talk today about a field a field 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.670
 important that is also very 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.670
 sued in the consultations 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.700
 dermatological doctor doctor what cream 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.160
 use and cream I have to use let's see 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.640
 here has always been always a lot 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.470
 much confusion and more now that there 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.649
 big price differences I've 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.230
 had patients who have said that they 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.050
 it's great to have creams that they acquire 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 even in supermarkets and they are very 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.670
 happy as place even the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.800
 Traditional remedies relax a 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.530
 lizard us to advertise for 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.989
 baby care and then I also have 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.149
 another type of more elitist patients than 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.359
 use high- stain creams that 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.609
 they cost maybe a five hundred bottle 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:59.210
 or thousand euros and they tell you and they are 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.829
 delighted or not happy I think 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.519
 that you have to focus things 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.840
 I put a very graphic example if one 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.250
 drive and have a car 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 Well, the best gasoline in the market is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.250
 lead free zinc lead and you can take it 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.319
 that gasoline but if your car is diesel 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.109
 You are unhappy because this happens a little bit 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.850
 it is obviously no cream 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.890
 alone for any type of individual 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.990
 There may be several types of creams but 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 that will depend a lot if they are adequate 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.549
 or not according to the characteristics of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.140
 the skin of every individual including the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.140
 same individual according to the time of year 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 you can go right some creams yes and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.270
 others not in the price range of 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.009
 market obviously a person 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.720
 that in principle does not have problems of 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.590
 skin can even be worth a cream 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.910
 buy wholesale on the surface and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.100
 there is no problem but to which 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.690
 show that the cream does not meet 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.090
 the requirements either because the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.950
 tolerates well the reaction does of course 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.230
 what should be advising for a 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.110
 specialist a specialist doctor 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.360
 dermatology there are creams in the market 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.690
 even with functions 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.600
 very effective anti-aging and without 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.030
 have to make those large outlays 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.580
 and neither will they obviously cost 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.890
 four or five euros the jar but they are 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.120
 much cheaper than people 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.610
 think but those creams do not owe them 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.530
 advise a close friend or the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.090
 Perfumery shop assistant 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.090
 should your dermatologist do
