00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
year I found that this harmonic balancer

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.960 
year I found that this harmonic balancer
is<00:00:23.060> bad

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
is bad

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.720

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
one alright well I found this harmonic

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.950 
one alright well I found this harmonic
bouncer<00:01:11.150> is<00:01:11.630> bad<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:16.330> in<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.690> removal

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
bouncer is bad and in the removal

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.210 
bouncer is bad and in the removal
process<00:01:20.560> of<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.800> bolt<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.400> holds<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:22.850> in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
process of the bolt that holds it in

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:34.090 
process of the bolt that holds it in
broke<00:01:25.220> in<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:26.180> crank<00:01:30.550> so<00:01:31.550> I<00:01:32.830> don't<00:01:33.830> know<00:01:33.979> what

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
broke in the crank so I don't know what

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.160 
broke in the crank so I don't know what
kind<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.430> lock<00:01:35.030> I'm<00:01:35.180> gonna<00:01:35.360> have<00:01:35.660> getting<00:01:35.900> it

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
kind of lock I'm gonna have getting it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:53.350 
kind of lock I'm gonna have getting it
out<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:40.009> I've<00:01:40.160> got<00:01:40.490> one<00:01:40.729> in<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.970> jump<00:01:52.360> cleaned

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
out and I've got one in the jump cleaned

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.440 
out and I've got one in the jump cleaned
it<00:01:53.600> up<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.020> I'm<00:01:54.500> gonna<00:01:54.649> try<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.119> see<00:01:56.119> how<00:01:56.300> it

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
works after I get there remnants of a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:13.050 
works after I get there remnants of a
broken<00:02:03.170> bolt<00:02:03.380> out<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.710> crank<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:12.230> yeah<00:02:12.470> I

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
broken bolt out of a crank so yeah I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.309 
broken bolt out of a crank so yeah I
have<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> problem<00:02:16.600> well<00:02:17.600> I've<00:02:17.780> been<00:02:17.959> down<00:02:18.140> this

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
have a problem well I've been down this

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.040 
have a problem well I've been down this
road<00:02:18.470> before<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:20.120> should<00:02:20.300> be<00:02:20.450> loose<00:02:20.690> enough<00:02:20.930> to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
road before it should be loose enough to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:30.070 
road before it should be loose enough to
come<00:02:21.230> right<00:02:21.410> out<00:02:21.440> there<00:02:22.100> we<00:02:22.340> go

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.390 

and<00:02:31.190> while<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.430> here

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
and while I'm here

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.680 
and while I'm here
actually<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.460> think<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.910> tip<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.450> broke

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
actually I think just a tip of it broke

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.600 
actually I think just a tip of it broke
off<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:40.290> that's<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.950> case<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.550> may<00:02:43.160> be<00:02:44.160> able<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
off if that's the case I may be able to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
off if that's the case I may be able to
just<00:02:44.820> cruise<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.470> was<00:02:47.360> I've<00:02:48.360> done

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
just cruise on like it was I've done

00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:00.200 
just cruise on like it was I've done
that<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.820> don't<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:52.160> but<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> there

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
that I don't like but I have so there

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.970 
that I don't like but I have so there
you<00:03:00.630> see<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> tip<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.490> its<00:03:02.640> broke<00:03:02.940> anyway

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
you see just the tip of its broke anyway

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.600 
you see just the tip of its broke anyway
so<00:03:04.980> we're<00:03:05.730> kind<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.000> kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.510> go<00:03:06.660> from<00:03:06.780> there

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
so we're kind of kind of go from there

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.960 
so we're kind of kind of go from there
see<00:03:08.610> what<00:03:08.820> happens<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:12.030> inspecting<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> crank

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
see what happens so inspecting the crank

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.760 
see what happens so inspecting the crank
you<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.300> split<00:03:15.660> right<00:03:16.260> there<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
you see it split right there in the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.620 
you see it split right there in the
middle<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:18.330> keyway<00:03:18.660> shear<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.140> out<00:03:20.630> well

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
middle and the keyway shear it out well

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.860 
middle and the keyway shear it out well
I'm<00:03:21.990> pretty<00:03:22.170> sure<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.190> key<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:24.180> not<00:03:24.570> good

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
I'm pretty sure that the key is not good

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.650 
I'm pretty sure that the key is not good
now<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.800> fest<00:03:26.730> case<00:03:27.000> some<00:03:27.210> projects<00:03:27.510> going<00:03:27.600> to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
now in fest case some projects going to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.420 
now in fest case some projects going to
be<00:03:27.750> done<00:03:27.960> for<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.230> night<00:03:30.740> but<00:03:31.740> I'm<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.340> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
be done for the night but I'm going to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.350 
be done for the night but I'm going to
say<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:32.790> probably<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.390> whole<00:03:34.140> problem

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.350 

altogether<00:03:40.490> I'm<00:03:41.490> going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> say<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.240> can

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
altogether I'm going to say that I can

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.000 
altogether I'm going to say that I can
probably<00:03:42.540> put<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> balance<00:03:43.230> here<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.740> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
probably put a balance here on it and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.940 
probably put a balance here on it and
it'll<00:03:44.370> probably<00:03:45.260> run<00:03:46.260> fine<00:03:46.560> again<00:03:46.890> but<00:03:48.950> I've

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
it'll probably run fine again but I've

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.290 
it'll probably run fine again but I've
never<00:03:50.100> seen<00:03:50.460> one<00:03:50.520> split<00:03:51.300> like<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:53.030> okay<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.090> I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
never seen one split like it okay so I

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.510 
never seen one split like it okay so I
may<00:03:54.570> or<00:03:54.720> may<00:03:54.900> not<00:03:54.930> may<00:03:55.560> or<00:03:55.590> may<00:03:55.890> not<00:03:55.920> have<00:03:56.340> it

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
may or may not may or may not have it

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.350 
may or may not may or may not have it
back<00:03:56.940> together<00:03:57.180> tonight<00:03:58.820> very<00:03:59.820> seriously

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360
