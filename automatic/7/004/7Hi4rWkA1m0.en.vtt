00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
for battlefield 3 but for the ps3 so I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970 
for battlefield 3 but for the ps3 so I

think this is cool news for anyone who

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
think this is cool news for anyone who
is<00:00:47.129> playing<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> ps3<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:49.350> don't

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
is playing on the ps3 I really don't

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.410 
is playing on the ps3 I really don't
have<00:00:49.739> any<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.820> thoughts<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.390> feelings

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
have any you know thoughts or feelings

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
have any you know thoughts or feelings
about<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.350> essentially<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.399> know

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
about it it's essentially just you know

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.310 
about it it's essentially just you know
marketing<00:00:53.910> they<00:00:54.210> want<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.539> players<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.110> play

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
marketing they want more players to play

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.889 
marketing they want more players to play
on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> ps3<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.190> buy<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.610> ps3<00:00:57.090> games<00:00:57.329> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
on the ps3 and buy more ps3 games so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.569 
on the ps3 and buy more ps3 games so
that<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.500> why<00:00:58.680> they're<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.160> doing<00:00:59.370> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that is why they're actually doing this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.099 
that is why they're actually doing this
and<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.270> guess<00:01:00.449> they're<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.079> know

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and I guess they're kind of you know

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.830 
and I guess they're kind of you know
making<00:01:01.789> their<00:01:02.789> hope<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.120> battlefield<00:01:03.539> 3<00:01:03.570> is

don't<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.590> we're<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.100> able<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
don't think we're going to be able to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.620 
don't think we're going to be able to
blow<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.549> buildings<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.090> large<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
blow up buildings that large in the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
blow up buildings that large in the
multiplayer<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.560> yeah<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.939> bigger

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
multiplayer but I yeah you know bigger

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.880 
multiplayer but I yeah you know bigger
the<00:01:39.329> better<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.750> opinion<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.710> we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the better in my opinion if we can if we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
the better in my opinion if we can if we
can<00:01:41.189> destroy<00:01:41.549> some<00:01:41.759> large<00:01:41.939> buildings<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.420> think

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
can destroy some large buildings I think

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
can destroy some large buildings I think
that's<00:01:42.750> going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:42.990> pretty<00:01:43.290> epic<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.189> will

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that's going to be pretty epic so I will

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.950 
that's going to be pretty epic so I will
just<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> wait<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
just have to wait and see what that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800 
just have to wait and see what that
actually<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:48.299> full<00:01:48.540> trailer

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
actually is when the the full trailer

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.389 
actually is when the the full trailer
comes<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.380> i<00:01:49.439> believe<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> comes<00:01:50.189> out

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
comes out and i believe that comes out

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.660 
comes out and i believe that comes out
on<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.689> 26th<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> yeah<00:01:52.829> only<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> couple<00:01:53.430> more

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
on the 26th so yeah only a couple more

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
on the 26th so yeah only a couple more
days<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.350> hasn't

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
days for that so there really hasn't

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.200 
days for that so there really hasn't
been<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> whole<00:01:55.979> lot<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.280> new<00:01:56.430> information<00:01:57.090> on

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
that they don't have a lot of server

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.929 
that they don't have a lot of server
stability<00:02:24.500> issues<00:02:25.159> because<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.579> know<00:02:25.640> there's

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
stability issues because I know there's

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.780 
stability issues because I know there's
going<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.329> be<00:02:26.359> a<00:02:26.450> huge<00:02:26.989> flood<00:02:27.409> of<00:02:27.560> players<00:02:27.799> who

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
going to be a huge flood of players who

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.429 
going to be a huge flood of players who
are<00:02:28.909> going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.269> try<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.540> game<00:02:29.689> out<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.200> know<00:02:30.290> a

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
are going to try this game out I know a

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.170 
are going to try this game out I know a
lot<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.709> my<00:02:30.920> friends<00:02:31.189> who<00:02:31.549> aren't<00:02:31.879> really

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
lot of my friends who aren't really

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.670 
lot of my friends who aren't really
considered<00:02:32.599> even<00:02:32.900> buying<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.349> game<00:02:33.470> they're

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
considered even buying the game they're

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.479 
considered even buying the game they're
going<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:33.890> try<00:02:34.099> out<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.310> beta<00:02:34.519> so<00:02:35.209> hopefully

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
going to try out the beta so hopefully

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.099 
going to try out the beta so hopefully
hopefully<00:02:37.489> dice<00:02:38.060> will<00:02:38.299> be<00:02:38.390> prepared<00:02:38.780> for<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
hopefully dice will be prepared for the

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.530 
hopefully dice will be prepared for the
mass<00:02:39.260> flood<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.829> players<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.700> we<00:02:41.209> won't<00:02:41.299> have

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
mass flood of players and we won't have

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.300 
mass flood of players and we won't have
a<00:02:41.569> lot<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.780> servers<00:02:42.109> stability<00:02:42.709> issues<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:43.280> we

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
a lot of servers stability issues so we

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.339 
a lot of servers stability issues so we
can<00:02:43.519> actually<00:02:43.579> play<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.090> game<00:02:44.239> or<00:02:44.420> really

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
can actually play the game or really

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.930 
can actually play the game or really
just<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.680> any<00:02:45.889> issues<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.310> general<00:02:46.459> and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
just have any issues in general and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.309 
just have any issues in general and
hopefully<00:02:47.389> when<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> game<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.170> actually

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
hopefully when the game is actually

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.110 
hopefully when the game is actually
released<00:02:48.889> if<00:02:49.099> there<00:02:49.310> are<00:02:49.489> those<00:02:49.639> issues<00:02:50.000> in

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
released if there are those issues in

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.369 
released if there are those issues in
the<00:02:50.209> beta<00:02:50.420> they're<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.170> be<00:02:51.260> actually

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
they're going to be able to fix it be

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.250 
they're going to be able to fix it be
when<00:02:53.359> you<00:02:53.569> know<00:02:53.659> when<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.870> game<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.170> actually

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
when you know when the game is actually

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.990 
when you know when the game is actually
out<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.829> know<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.010> lot<00:02:55.159> of<00:02:55.189> people<00:02:55.280> were<00:02:55.670> kind<00:02:55.909> of

out I know a lot of people were kind of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.509 
out I know a lot of people were kind of
concerned<00:02:56.359> that<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.290> beta<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.859> too<00:02:58.220> close<00:02:58.489> to

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
concerned that the beta is too close to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
essentially what my thought process is

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.210 
essentially what my thought process is
is<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.870> get<00:04:29.140> your<00:04:29.260> work<00:04:29.410> done<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.740> when<00:04:30.130> the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
is that get your work done so when the

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.070 
is that get your work done so when the
beta<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.520> actually<00:04:30.940> released<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.420> can<00:04:31.570> even

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
beta is actually released you can even

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.720 
beta is actually released you can even
play<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:32.470> for<00:04:32.620> as<00:04:32.710> long<00:04:32.890> as<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.130> want<00:04:33.460> so

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
play it for as long as you want so

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.860 
play it for as long as you want so
that's<00:04:33.880> kind<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.120> what<00:04:34.270> I'm<00:04:34.390> doing<00:04:34.600> right<00:04:34.720> now

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
that's kind of what I'm doing right now

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.990 
that's kind of what I'm doing right now
