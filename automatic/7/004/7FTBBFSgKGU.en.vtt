here my trusty crowdfunded hobby knife
but<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.969> actually<00:00:48.120> don't<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:49.170> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
but I actually don't think we will be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.069 
but I actually don't think we will be
using<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.180> knife<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> beginning<00:00:51.899> for

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
using this knife in the beginning for

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.850 
using this knife in the beginning for
this<00:00:52.309> particular<00:00:53.309> video<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:54.860> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
this particular video because this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.529 
this particular video because this
headphone<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.730> comes<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.180> its<00:00:57.329> own

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
headphone actually comes in its own

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.619 
headphone actually comes in its own
carrying<00:00:58.170> case<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.420> that<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
carrying case and that is the that is

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.990 
carrying case and that is the that is
the<00:01:01.620> actual<00:01:01.920> case<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.399> being<00:01:02.609> used<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the actual case that's being used to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
the actual case that's being used to
transport<00:01:03.300> anything<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.379> i<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.559> is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
transport anything which i think is

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.350 
transport anything which i think is
really<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.100> nice<00:01:05.430> touch<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.240> could

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
really a nice touch because you could

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.899 
really a nice touch because you could
probably<00:01:06.510> pay<00:01:07.020> twenty<00:01:07.799> dollars<00:01:07.830> alone<00:01:08.430> just

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
probably pay twenty dollars alone just

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.410 
probably pay twenty dollars alone just
for<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> box<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.549> certainly<00:01:11.549> there's<00:01:12.000> value

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
for the box so certainly there's value

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.230 
for the box so certainly there's value
for<00:01:12.570> money<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> very<00:01:13.200> beginning<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> then

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
for money at the very beginning so then

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
for money at the very beginning so then
we<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> actual<00:01:16.110> box<00:01:16.560> itself<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.340> just

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
we have the actual box itself it's just

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.899 
we have the actual box itself it's just
like<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> little<00:01:18.000> band<00:01:18.570> case<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:20.610> funny<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
like a little band case it's funny that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.170 
like a little band case it's funny that
the<00:01:21.420> actual<00:01:22.200> logo<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.430> actually<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.090> know

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the actual logo so actually you know

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
the actual logo so actually you know
these<00:01:24.330> stickers<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.869> put<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.770> next<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.130> logos

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
these stickers I put right next to logos

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.590 
these stickers I put right next to logos
and<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.270> could<00:01:27.450> probably

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and you know I think they could probably

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
and you know I think they could probably
be<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> bit<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> place<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:29.369> those<00:01:29.520> barcodes

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
be in a bit of place put those barcodes

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.230 
be in a bit of place put those barcodes
so<00:01:30.869> yeah<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.189> actually<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.060> cool

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so yeah it's really actually really cool

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.420 
so yeah it's really actually really cool
that<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.780> carrying<00:01:34.140> case<00:01:34.430> again

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that you get this carrying case again

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.969 
that you get this carrying case again

to<00:02:08.340> 1<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:09.420> 10<00:02:09.599> kilohertz<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:10.979> an

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
to 1 to 10 kilohertz that is an

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.090 
to 1 to 10 kilohertz that is an
interesting<00:02:11.700> frequency<00:02:12.480> response

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
interesting frequency response

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.280 
interesting frequency response
I<00:02:13.220> don't<00:02:13.610> know<00:02:13.730> how<00:02:13.910> accurate<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.810> diagram

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
I don't know how accurate that diagram

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.610 
I don't know how accurate that diagram
is<00:02:15.710> but<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> basic<00:02:17.450> peak<00:02:17.720> from<00:02:18.350> 5

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
is but to have a basic peak from 5

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.170 
is but to have a basic peak from 5
kilohertz<00:02:18.950> onwards<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.700> 20<00:02:19.940> kilohertz

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
kilohertz onwards to 20 kilohertz

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
kilohertz onwards to 20 kilohertz
hopefully<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.900> won't<00:02:21.080> be<00:02:21.260> particularly<00:02:22.160> to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
hopefully this won't be particularly to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.720 
hopefully this won't be particularly to

interesting<00:02:38.510> looking<00:02:38.660> manual<00:02:39.290> have<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.010> look

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
interesting looking manual have a look

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.440 
interesting looking manual have a look
for<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.580> later<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:43.060> yeah<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.270> seemed

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
for it later on but yeah that seemed

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.930 
for it later on but yeah that seemed
like<00:02:44.600> some<00:02:44.840> thought<00:02:45.170> has<00:02:45.410> gone<00:02:45.440> behind<00:02:45.980> making

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940

this 3d diagram of the company it makes

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.110 
this 3d diagram of the company it makes
it<00:02:54.950> looks<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.160> bit<00:02:55.190> like<00:02:55.340> an<00:02:55.550> amusement<00:02:56.060> park

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
it looks a bit like an amusement park

I've<00:02:56.630> been<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.200> our<00:02:57.320> factories<00:02:57.770> like<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.100> in

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
I've been to our factories like this in

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.480 
I've been to our factories like this in
China<00:02:58.280> they<00:02:58.700> do<00:02:59.210> not<00:02:59.600> look<00:02:59.870> like<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.320> in<00:03:01.250> real

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
China they do not look like this in real

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.720 
China they do not look like this in real
life<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:02.060> anyway<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.320> from<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:04.040> textile

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
life but anyway it is from a textile

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
electronic coat in Guangdong or that is

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.040 
electronic coat in Guangdong or that is
basically<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.940> electronics<00:03:11.050> manufacturing

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
on bass in China we also get a carrying

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.570 
on bass in China we also get a carrying
bag<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.690> not<00:03:18.170> only<00:03:18.320> do<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.560> get<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.740> big<00:03:19.010> case<00:03:19.400> we

bag so not only do we get a big case we

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.490 
bag so not only do we get a big case we
also<00:03:19.700> get<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.910> bag<00:03:20.240> which<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.630> really<00:03:20.960> nice<00:03:21.200> and

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
also get a bag which is really nice and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.860 
also get a bag which is really nice and
this<00:03:21.980> bag<00:03:22.190> has<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.460> you<00:03:23.120> can't<00:03:23.300> see<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:23.720> on<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
this bag has a you can't see this on the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.270 
this bag has a you can't see this on the
camera<00:03:23.960> but<00:03:24.380> this<00:03:24.500> bag<00:03:24.680> has<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> really<00:03:25.100> weird

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
camera but this bag has a really weird

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.610 
camera but this bag has a really weird
texture<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:25.940> because<00:03:26.240> it's<00:03:26.360> furry<00:03:27.050> but<00:03:27.530> it

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
texture to it because it's furry but it

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.030 
texture to it because it's furry but it
feels<00:03:27.830> like<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:29.200> it's<00:03:30.200> just<00:03:30.290> strange<00:03:30.920> to

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
feels like it's it's just strange to

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.610 
feels like it's it's just strange to
touch<00:03:31.310> actually<00:03:31.640> I'm<00:03:31.700> gonna<00:03:31.790> stop<00:03:32.000> doing<00:03:32.120> that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
touch actually I'm gonna stop doing that

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.430 
touch actually I'm gonna stop doing that
ok<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:33.680> take<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.670> fun<00:03:34.940> away<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.540> here<00:03:35.960> we<00:03:36.140> have

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
ok so take the fun away and here we have

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.180 
ok so take the fun away and here we have
the<00:03:36.650> headphones<00:03:37.070> these<00:03:37.430> are<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.620> takstar<00:03:39.680> pro

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
the headphones these are the takstar pro

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.420 
the headphones these are the takstar pro
80s<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.810> can<00:03:41.990> see<00:03:42.200> how<00:03:42.440> people<00:03:43.250> have

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
80s and you can see how people have

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.330 
80s and you can see how people have
described<00:03:43.970> them<00:03:44.150> as<00:03:44.410> Bayer<00:03:45.410> dynamic<00:03:45.980> clones

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
described them as Bayer dynamic clones

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.460 
described them as Bayer dynamic clones
because<00:03:46.700> they<00:03:47.030> have<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.420> same<00:03:47.690> basic<00:03:48.200> kind<00:03:48.410> of

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
because they have the same basic kind of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.770 
because they have the same basic kind of
headband<00:03:48.950> yoke<00:03:49.640> shape<00:03:49.940> though<00:03:50.240> they<00:03:50.390> do<00:03:50.450> have

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
headband yoke shape though they do have

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.740 
headband yoke shape though they do have
elongated<00:03:51.230> cups<00:03:51.920> which<00:03:52.490> are<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.970> fair<00:03:53.600> bit

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
elongated cups which are a fair bit

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.900 
elongated cups which are a fair bit
smaller<00:03:54.230> actually<00:03:54.590> than<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.010> on<00:03:55.370> Bayer

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
smaller actually than the on Bayer

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.760 
smaller actually than the on Bayer
dynamic<00:03:56.390> cuts<00:03:56.600> I'll<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:57.260> take<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:57.530> box

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
dynamic cuts I'll just take this box

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.500 
dynamic cuts I'll just take this box
away<00:03:57.920> view<00:03:58.220> there's<00:03:58.400> nothing<00:03:58.790> more<00:03:59.030> left

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
away view there's nothing more left

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.080 
away view there's nothing more left
inside<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.990> box<00:04:00.200> is<00:04:00.350> part<00:04:00.560> like<00:04:00.710> a<00:04:00.740> table<00:04:04.090> so

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
inside the box is part like a table so

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.020 
inside the box is part like a table so
yeah<00:04:05.360> we<00:04:05.570> have<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.140> headphone<00:04:06.740> which<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.340> made

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.730 
far as I can tell
I<00:04:13.420> think<00:04:14.420> these<00:04:14.540> parts<00:04:14.960> either<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.290> metal<00:04:15.590> or

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
I think these parts either a metal or

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.890 
I think these parts either a metal or
plastic<00:04:15.830> but<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.549> suspect<00:04:17.239> they're<00:04:17.600> actually

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
plastic but I suspect they're actually

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.380 
plastic but I suspect they're actually
metal<00:04:18.260> they<00:04:18.560> actually<00:04:18.920> feel<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.549> surprisingly

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
metal they actually feel a surprisingly

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.680 
metal they actually feel a surprisingly
high<00:04:20.540> quality

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
high quality

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.950 
high quality
kind<00:04:23.379> of<00:04:23.789> metal<00:04:24.789> metallic<00:04:25.120> head<00:04:25.419> banners<00:04:25.810> on

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
kind of metal metallic head banners on

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.779 
kind of metal metallic head banners on
the<00:04:26.050> bay<00:04:26.169> dynamics<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.250> we<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.669> an

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
the bay dynamics and we have an

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.730 
the bay dynamics and we have an
adjustment<00:04:28.150> mechanism<00:04:28.690> it's<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.990> little<00:04:29.440> a

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
adjustment mechanism it's a little a

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.309 
adjustment mechanism it's a little a
little<00:04:30.580> more<00:04:30.759> wobbly<00:04:31.150> than<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:31.509> would<00:04:31.750> like<00:04:31.780> I

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
little more wobbly than I would like I

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.320 
little more wobbly than I would like I
think<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:33.009> could<00:04:33.190> could<00:04:33.699> feel<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> little

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
think it could could feel a little

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.619 
think it could could feel a little
better<00:04:34.710> but<00:04:35.710> overall<00:04:36.060> 469<00:04:37.060> bucks<00:04:37.419> my

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
better but overall 469 bucks my

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.300 
better but overall 469 bucks my
immediate<00:04:38.050> impression<00:04:38.379> is<00:04:38.830> actually<00:04:39.190> these

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
immediate impression is actually these

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.659 
immediate impression is actually these
are<00:04:39.550> built<00:04:39.970> quite<00:04:40.449> remarkably<00:04:41.199> nicely<00:04:41.830> which

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
are built quite remarkably nicely which

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.570 
are built quite remarkably nicely which
is<00:04:42.849> also<00:04:43.080> what<00:04:44.080> I've<00:04:44.259> read<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.009> heard<00:04:45.039> about

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
is also what I've read and heard about

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.149 
is also what I've read and heard about
these<00:04:45.759> headphones<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.539> why<00:04:46.750> they<00:04:47.349> seem<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.949> be

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
these headphones and why they seem to be

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.670 
these headphones and why they seem to be
quite<00:04:48.729> popular<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.599> had<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.900> number<00:04:50.169> of<00:04:50.500> people

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
quite popular I had a number of people

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.860 
quite popular I had a number of people
actually<00:04:51.009> or<00:04:51.639> could<00:04:51.909> be<00:04:52.060> one<00:04:52.360> person

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
actually or could be one person

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.570 
actually or could be one person
requesting<00:04:53.289> it<00:04:53.379> numerous<00:04:53.740> times<00:04:54.099> I<00:04:54.370> can't

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
requesting it numerous times I can't

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.790 
requesting it numerous times I can't
really<00:04:55.300> tell<00:04:55.659> at<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:55.930> point<00:04:55.990> but<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:56.470> had

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
really tell at this point but I had

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.100 
really tell at this point but I had
multiple<00:04:57.789> mentions<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.360> this<00:04:58.509> headphone<00:04:58.690> on

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
multiple mentions of this headphone on

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.399 
multiple mentions of this headphone on
my<00:04:59.259> channel<00:04:59.680> and<00:05:00.190> when<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.520> asked<00:05:00.940> my<00:05:01.419> patreon

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
my channel and when I asked my patreon

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.960 
my channel and when I asked my patreon
back<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.770> what<00:05:03.220> headphone<00:05:03.610> they<00:05:03.699> would<00:05:03.819> like

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
back is what headphone they would like

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.059 
back is what headphone they would like
to<00:05:04.000> see<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.569> I<00:05:04.630> gave<00:05:05.259> the<00:05:05.380> choice<00:05:05.590> between<00:05:05.800> the

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
to see and I gave the choice between the

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.920 
to see and I gave the choice between the
V<00:05:06.250> sonic<00:05:06.960> vs<00:05:07.960> ds1<00:05:08.949> and<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.639> textile<00:05:10.569> fro<00:05:10.750> Eddie

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
V sonic vs ds1 and the textile fro Eddie

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.749 
V sonic vs ds1 and the textile fro Eddie
and<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.169> bunch<00:05:11.349> of<00:05:11.440> other<00:05:12.039> options

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
and a bunch of other options

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.360 
and a bunch of other options
I<00:05:12.880> think<00:05:13.419> text<00:05:13.780> already<00:05:14.020> came<00:05:14.440> out<00:05:14.590> on<00:05:14.770> top<00:05:15.039> in

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
I think text already came out on top in

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.800 
I think text already came out on top in
terms<00:05:15.759> of<00:05:15.909> popularity<00:05:16.259> anyway<00:05:17.259> I<00:05:17.289> have<00:05:17.469> to

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
terms of popularity anyway I have to

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.499 
terms of popularity anyway I have to
undo<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.990> tape<00:05:20.229> around<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:21.400> cable<00:05:24.509> I'll

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
undo the tape around this cable I'll

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.480 
undo the tape around this cable I'll
worry<00:05:25.840> about<00:05:25.930> this<00:05:26.169> cable<00:05:26.500> later<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.800> can<00:05:26.919> you

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
worry about this cable later you can you

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.459 
worry about this cable later you can you
can<00:05:27.639> just<00:05:27.819> assume<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.659> that<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:29.199> tape

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
can just assume that that that tape

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.950 
can just assume that that that tape
eventually<00:05:29.979> comes<00:05:30.190> off<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.789> I'll<00:05:31.030> just<00:05:31.180> cut

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
eventually comes off and I'll just cut

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.939 
eventually comes off and I'll just cut
this<00:05:31.990> off<00:05:32.500> here

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
this off here

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.559 
this off here
I<00:05:33.130> should<00:05:33.370> really<00:05:33.729> use<00:05:33.849> scissors<00:05:34.090> for<00:05:34.330> this<00:05:34.419> at

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
I should really use scissors for this at

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.999 
I should really use scissors for this at
this<00:05:34.690> point<00:05:34.930> because<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.199> is<00:05:35.319> dangerous<00:05:35.440> but

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
this point because it is dangerous but

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.939 
this point because it is dangerous but
and<00:05:36.550> just<00:05:36.969> do<00:05:37.060> not<00:05:37.240> follow<00:05:37.360> my<00:05:37.719> lead<00:05:37.949> ladies

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
and just do not follow my lead ladies

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.450 
and just do not follow my lead ladies
and<00:05:39.099> gentlemen<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:41.500> yeah<00:05:41.680> on<00:05:42.069> the<00:05:42.190> actual

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
and gentlemen so yeah on the actual

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.830 
and gentlemen so yeah on the actual
cable<00:05:42.639> itself<00:05:43.090> again<00:05:43.330> it's<00:05:43.449> actually<00:05:43.719> it

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
cable itself again it's actually it

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.779 
cable itself again it's actually it
seems<00:05:44.680> like<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:44.860> decent<00:05:45.099> quality<00:05:45.580> enough<00:05:46.000> cable

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
seems like a decent quality enough cable

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.249 
seems like a decent quality enough cable
has<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:48.819> little<00:05:49.090> memory<00:05:49.270> from<00:05:49.509> the<00:05:49.569> box<00:05:49.840> as<00:05:50.139> we

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
has a little memory from the box as we

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.550 
has a little memory from the box as we
can<00:05:50.349> see<00:05:50.560> I'm<00:05:51.190> a<00:05:51.250> bit<00:05:51.639> of<00:05:51.729> kink<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:52.380> we'll<00:05:53.380> see

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
can see I'm a bit of kink so we'll see

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.990 
can see I'm a bit of kink so we'll see
whether<00:05:53.770> that<00:05:53.979> kind<00:05:54.190> of<00:05:54.219> straightens<00:05:54.550> out<00:05:54.759> we

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
whether that kind of straightens out we

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.909 
whether that kind of straightens out we
have<00:05:55.240> a<00:05:55.509> six<00:05:55.990> point<00:05:56.169> five<00:05:56.319> millimeter<00:05:56.770> adapter

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
have a six point five millimeter adapter

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.129 
have a six point five millimeter adapter
and<00:05:57.580> then<00:05:57.940> a<00:05:58.440> 3.5<00:05:59.440> millimeter<00:06:00.569> screw<00:06:01.569> terminal

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
and then a 3.5 millimeter screw terminal

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.219 
and then a 3.5 millimeter screw terminal
so<00:06:02.560> again<00:06:03.520> it's<00:06:03.699> all<00:06:03.789> gold-plated<00:06:04.509> by<00:06:04.810> the

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
so again it's all gold-plated by the

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:06.360 
so again it's all gold-plated by the
looks<00:06:05.409> of<00:06:05.529> it<00:06:05.650> everything<00:06:05.919> looks<00:06:06.279> pretty

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
looks of it everything looks pretty

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.129 
looks of it everything looks pretty
high-quality<00:06:08.430> so<00:06:09.430> ya<00:06:09.639> know<00:06:09.880> I<00:06:10.029> will<00:06:10.449> be<00:06:10.779> very
