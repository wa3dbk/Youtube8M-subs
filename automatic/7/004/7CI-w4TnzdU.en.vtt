00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.519
 some have long known me sorry 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.220
 Southern France operates every year 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.949
 but me in the months or in 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.609
 this month where the cranes are pulling 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.359
 pulling is not always after 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.710
 North france 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.410
 it's my passion there then this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.109
 big reservoirs there right now 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.590
 drained who to fish this year 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.590
 The angels are extremely violent here 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.040
 the water level is very low down though 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 what is beneficial for us for us to 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.440
 worth the less water in here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 the better that you have here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.469
 less herb relationship you need 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.199
 do not go that far until then 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.140
 So crowd knew came where the weed 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.149
 stop there are just stop you one 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.890
 the hotspots where you fish here 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.590
 but the other is the weather this year 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.450
 extremely bad for ours so we have 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.150
 here with with with duck pond weather 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 that's what I call it 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.590
 the lake is calm it is sunshine 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.799
 You see, it is also when you are too close to me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.140
 that comes across as a mirror and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.200
 this is absolutely for this see here 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.860
 Counterproductive is best if you 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.110
 really strong wind is on it and am 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.250
 even more rain and temperatures after 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 downstairs and yes everything is beautiful here in t 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.130
 shirt 21 october yes not at all 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.759
 Twenty-fourth october and finest 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.530
 t shirt weather there you can recognize 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.680
 that just does not fit that is here 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.030
 just now shit with the weather so 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.920
 nevertheless I could have got in 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.040
 the few the stormy nights 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.060
 So I've been here for 22 days now 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.550
 i know i could get some very sick 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.709
 Of course, good fish only catch in 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.140
 the nights where we really had a storm 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.090
 or lee days and we storm during the day 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.790
 Did you put that down at night? 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.230
 It did not matter that the fish was commissioned 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.060
 The water is pure oxygen 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.770
 come into the water there is rain 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.340
 came in having the fish optics 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.379
 given the measured at night 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.530
 I really like doing that here 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.760
 with two ground works and with a few 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.700
 other the world wake up, we again 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.319
 imagine and if one or the other 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.340
 then thinks you have to drive here 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.720
 then maybe I have one or two 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.840
 another tip on the way 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.840
 until then consider more expensive
