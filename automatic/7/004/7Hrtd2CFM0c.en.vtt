00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
their ability to fit into our program

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.490 
their ability to fit into our program
and<00:00:39.090> handle<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> stresses<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> being<00:00:40.440> a

and handle the stresses of being a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.220 
and handle the stresses of being a
mascot<00:00:41.210> they're<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> wild<00:00:42.660> animal<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.110> they've

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
mascot they're a wild animal and they've

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.880 
mascot they're a wild animal and they've
learned<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> survive<00:00:45.079> quite<00:00:46.079> well<00:00:46.289> frankly

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
learned to survive quite well frankly

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.069 
learned to survive quite well frankly
and<00:00:47.100> most<00:00:47.579> everything<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.510> new<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> them

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and most everything that's new to them

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
and most everything that's new to them
they<00:00:49.289> take<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> threat<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> mascot

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
they take as a threat I think the mascot

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
they take as a threat I think the mascot
really<00:00:51.989> represents<00:00:52.440> Cal<00:00:52.620> Poly<00:00:52.829> because<00:00:53.190> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
really represents Cal Poly because of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
really represents Cal Poly because of
the<00:00:53.940> spirit<00:00:54.300> we've<00:00:54.840> got<00:00:55.020> them<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.350> tame

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the spirit we've got them pretty tame

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
the spirit we've got them pretty tame
but<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.579> still<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> spirit<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
but they still have a lot of spirit in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
but they still have a lot of spirit in
their<00:00:57.899> eyes<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.039> makes<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
their eyes and I think that makes them a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.240 
their eyes and I think that makes them a
good<00:00:59.910> mascot<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.510> Cal<00:01:00.660> Poly<00:01:01.129> everything<00:01:02.129> we

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
good mascot for Cal Poly everything we

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
good mascot for Cal Poly everything we
do<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.640> Cal<00:01:02.789> Poly<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.480> involved

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
do here at Cal Poly is really involved

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
do here at Cal Poly is really involved
with<00:01:03.870> our<00:01:04.110> hands-on<00:01:04.710> learned<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:05.339> Dooley<00:01:05.670> mano

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
with our hands-on learned by Dooley mano

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.850 
with our hands-on learned by Dooley mano
and<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.840> having<00:01:07.049> students<00:01:07.409> involved<00:01:07.770> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and I think having students involved in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
and I think having students involved in
all<00:01:08.070> aspects<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.210> Mustang<00:01:09.720> mascot

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
all aspects of the Mustang mascot

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
all aspects of the Mustang mascot
program<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.619> essential<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.610> success<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
program is essential for the success of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
program is essential for the success of
the<00:01:12.180> program<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.409> first<00:01:13.710> went<00:01:13.920> into<00:01:14.130> this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the program when we first went into this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
the program when we first went into this
thing<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.729> felt<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.229> going

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
thing I felt that I was probably going

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
thing I felt that I was probably going
to<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.100> quite<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.400> bit<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.270> was

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to have to do quite a bit that I was

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.780

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
gonna have to take a big lead role here

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
gonna have to take a big lead role here
and<00:01:21.000> probably<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> things<00:01:22.979> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and probably do some of the things that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.789 
and probably do some of the things that
the<00:01:23.400> tasks<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.030> required<00:01:24.619> they've<00:01:25.619> done

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.560 
we can get involved but just being able
to<00:01:44.890> be<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.130> part<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:46.030> me<00:01:46.060> is<00:01:46.180> really

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
to be a part of it to me is really

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.719 
to be a part of it to me is really
exciting<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:48.220> we<00:01:48.280> are<00:01:48.520> really

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
exciting when we are really

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.219 
exciting when we are really
experimenting<00:01:49.299> with<00:01:49.450> bringing<00:01:49.689> on<00:01:49.869> new

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
experimenting with bringing on new

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.530 
experimenting with bringing on new
horses<00:01:51.040> into<00:01:51.189> this<00:01:51.399> herd<00:01:51.700> we<00:01:51.909> have<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.240> idea

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
horses into this herd we have the idea

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.240 
horses into this herd we have the idea
that<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.110> program<00:01:53.560> I'm<00:01:53.770> not<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.920> single

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that this is a program I'm not a single

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.100 
that this is a program I'm not a single
horse<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.729> very<00:01:54.939> important<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.630> it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
horse is very important and it

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.929 
horse is very important and it
represents<00:01:56.649> in<00:01:56.770> my<00:01:56.890> mind<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.670> fact<00:01:57.880> that

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
represents in my mind the fact that

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.639 
represents in my mind the fact that
we're<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.149> family<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.840> we're<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.110> group

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
we're a family and that we're a group

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.560 
we're a family and that we're a group
and<00:01:59.920> we<00:02:00.250> want<00:02:00.399> our<00:02:00.490> program<00:02:01.060> our<00:02:01.270> Mustang

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
and we want our program our Mustang

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.250 
and we want our program our Mustang
program<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.500> represent<00:02:02.679> that
