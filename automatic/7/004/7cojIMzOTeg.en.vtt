00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
new quest awaits but there we go

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.469 
new quest awaits but there we go
we<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.659> players<00:01:24.659> book<00:01:25.939> she's<00:01:26.939> um<00:01:27.240> she's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
we have the players book she's um she's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.179 
we have the players book she's um she's
quite<00:01:28.140> thick<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.770> too<00:01:29.009> thick<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.270> yeah

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.830 

and<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.400> says<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> read<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.509> I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and so it says to read this first so I'm

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
and so it says to read this first so I'm
not<00:01:39.990> gonna<00:01:40.140> go<00:01:40.290> through<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.700> but

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
not gonna go through much of it but

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.940 
not gonna go through much of it but
listen<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.720> think<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> how<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.320> make<00:01:46.799> your

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
listen I think this is how you make your

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
listen I think this is how you make your
character<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.939> attacked<00:01:48.329> by<00:01:48.509> goblins

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
character so you get attacked by goblins

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.870 
character so you get attacked by goblins
but<00:01:49.290> me<00:01:49.439> once<00:01:50.220> again<00:01:50.430> there's<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.729> really

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
but me once again there's some really

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.080 
but me once again there's some really
cool<00:01:51.210> artwork<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.670> all<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> dice

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
cool artwork in there all that the dice

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.789 
cool artwork in there all that the dice
numbered<00:01:57.090> things<00:01:57.710> defense<00:01:58.710> we've<00:01:59.040> got<00:01:59.310> wisdom

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
player sheets I guess okay so have a

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.620 
player sheets I guess okay so have a
token<00:03:59.150> got<00:04:00.150> bosses<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:02.060> trolls<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.450> think

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
token got bosses and trolls I think

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.170

you're<00:04:03.720> some<00:04:03.840> heroes<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.519> like<00:04:05.670> pop<00:04:05.910> out

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:55.370 

it's<00:04:36.880> kind<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.120> raised<00:04:50.790> boxing<00:04:53.910> okay<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:54.970> it's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
it's kind of raised boxing okay so it's

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.320 
it's kind of raised boxing okay so it's
double-sided<00:04:57.870> wilderness<00:04:58.870> iary

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
double-sided wilderness iary

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.840 
double-sided wilderness iary
and<00:05:01.330> oh<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:02.350> think<00:05:02.620> these<00:05:02.710> are<00:05:02.800> lots<00:05:03.340> of<00:05:03.460> fold
