00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
as that goes however it's because of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.740

undone and on the adhesive and it does
stick<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:40.100> main<00:01:41.100> complaint<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.759> with

stick up the main complaint I have with

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.639 
stick up the main complaint I have with
that<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> hit

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that really is that it's going to hit

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.200 
that really is that it's going to hit
dirt<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.070> dust<00:01:44.369> under<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.970> eventually

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
dirt and dust under it and eventually

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.380 
dirt and dust under it and eventually
maybe<00:01:45.750> unstick<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.829> skin<00:01:47.159> however<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.000> guess<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
maybe unstick the skin however I guess I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.330 
maybe unstick the skin however I guess I
if<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> did<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.590> over<00:01:49.770> time<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
if you if you did this over time and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
if you if you did this over time and
kept<00:01:50.520> playing<00:01:50.820> around<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> might

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
kept playing around with it you might

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.969 
kept playing around with it you might
get<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> stick<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
get it the stick but you do get this

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
get it the stick but you do get this
wavy<00:01:53.280> look<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.600> leave<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> alone

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
wavy look I think if you leave it alone

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.920 
wavy look I think if you leave it alone
it<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.649> better<00:01:55.860> right<00:01:56.159> around<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
it will look better right around the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.700 
it will look better right around the
speaker<00:01:57.930> though<00:01:58.079> where<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> starts<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
speaker though where it starts to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
speaker though where it starts to
flatten<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.820> actually<00:02:00.030> looks<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.540> lot

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
flatten out it actually looks a lot

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.240 
flatten out it actually looks a lot
better<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:01.649> sure<00:02:01.770> what<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
better so I'm not really sure what to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.340 
better so I'm not really sure what to
think<00:02:02.280> about<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.939> way<00:02:03.000> however<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.079> does

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
think about it that way however it does

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.920 
think about it that way however it does
do<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> nice<00:02:04.890> job<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.460> fits<00:02:05.939> well<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
do a nice job and fits well and is and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.210 
do a nice job and fits well and is and
is<00:02:07.439> cut<00:02:07.740> perfectly<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.629> anyone<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
is cut perfectly and I think anyone that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.199 
is cut perfectly and I think anyone that
appreciates<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.430> type<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> skin<00:02:12.090> would

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
appreciates this type of skin would

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.970 
appreciates this type of skin would
really<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.290> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
really really like it you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.520 
really really like it you
not<00:02:14.099> going<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.340> scratch<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.090> thick<00:02:15.530> if

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
not going to scratch it it's thick if

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.740 
not going to scratch it it's thick if
you<00:02:16.920> set<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.400> down<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.819> not<00:02:18.000> going<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.420> slip

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
you set it down it's not going to slip

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.270 
you set it down it's not going to slip
if<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.019> bump<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.470> or<00:02:19.680> anything<00:02:19.950> it's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
if you bump it or anything it's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.300 
if you bump it or anything it's
definitely<00:02:20.940> more<00:02:21.120> sticky<00:02:21.540> than<00:02:21.750> any<00:02:22.709> skin

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
definitely more sticky than any skin

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.869 
definitely more sticky than any skin
I've<00:02:23.489> ever<00:02:23.670> used<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.360> an<00:02:24.780> iPad<00:02:25.319> or<00:02:25.620> an<00:02:25.769> iPhone

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
I've ever used on an iPad or an iPhone

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.610 
I've ever used on an iPad or an iPhone
so<00:02:26.879> definitely<00:02:27.510> check<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.900> out<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:28.409> let's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
so definitely check that out now let's

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.949 
so definitely check that out now let's
do<00:02:28.830> one<00:02:29.099> more<00:02:29.129> thing<00:02:29.340> before<00:02:29.849> we<00:02:30.150> finish<00:02:30.780> up

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
do one more thing before we finish up

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.780 
do one more thing before we finish up
this<00:02:31.110> review<00:02:31.560> let's<00:02:32.160> go<00:02:32.310> ahead<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.549> remove

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
this review let's go ahead and remove

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.550 
this review let's go ahead and remove
the<00:02:33.239> skin<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.599> see<00:02:33.720> how<00:02:33.870> difficult<00:02:34.379> that<00:02:34.500> is

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the skin and see how difficult that is

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.039 
the skin and see how difficult that is
because<00:02:35.099> that's<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.670> concern<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.090> many<00:02:36.510> this

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
because that's a concern for many this

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.319 
because that's a concern for many this
is<00:02:37.110> 3m<00:02:37.709> tape<00:02:40.220> let's<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.610> we'll<00:02:41.790> start<00:02:42.090> peeling

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
is 3m tape let's see we'll start peeling

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.940 
is 3m tape let's see we'll start peeling
here<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.360> does<00:02:45.540> take<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> good<00:02:46.590> amount<00:02:46.650> of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
here and it does take a good amount of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.610 
here and it does take a good amount of
force<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.910> nice<00:02:48.120> thing<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.450> unlike<00:02:49.079> some

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
force but the nice thing is unlike some

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.500 
force but the nice thing is unlike some
of<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.769> other<00:02:49.829> products<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:51.000> looks<00:02:51.299> like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
of the other products it looks like

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.630 
of the other products it looks like
we're<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.290> actually<00:02:52.680> stretch<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
we're not going to actually stretch the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.839 
we're not going to actually stretch the
product<00:02:54.060> as<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.359> take<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.599> off<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:56.400> does<00:02:56.609> have

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
product as we take it off it does have

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.069 
product as we take it off it does have
like<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> little<00:02:57.239> wrinkled<00:02:57.720> look<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.079> it<00:03:00.079> but

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
like a little wrinkled look to it but

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.319 
like a little wrinkled look to it but
one<00:03:01.680> thing<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.609> don't<00:03:02.730> want<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.060> ruin

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
one thing is is you don't want to ruin

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.930 
one thing is is you don't want to ruin
the<00:03:03.720> skin<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.440> paid<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.700> what<00:03:05.849> you

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the skin that you paid for so what you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.990 
the skin that you paid for so what you
can<00:03:06.120> do<00:03:06.329> is<00:03:06.599> probably<00:03:07.410> assuming<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.489> adhesive

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
can do is probably assuming the adhesive

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.229 
can do is probably assuming the adhesive
is<00:03:09.090> still<00:03:09.420> decent<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.829> could<00:03:11.010> probably<00:03:11.340> put<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
is still decent we could probably put it

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.039 
is still decent we could probably put it
back<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.940> tape<00:03:15.180> yeah<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.660> adhesive

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
back on the tape yeah the adhesive

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.780 
back on the tape yeah the adhesive
actually<00:03:16.349> looks<00:03:16.530> decent<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.069> sticks<00:03:17.430> really

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
actually looks decent it sticks really

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.030 
actually looks decent it sticks really
quite<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> lot<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.139> guess<00:03:19.349> with<00:03:19.560> more<00:03:19.769> play

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
quite a lot and I guess with more play

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.349 
quite a lot and I guess with more play
you<00:03:20.099> could<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.669> to<00:03:20.760> stick<00:03:20.970> around<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
you could get it to stick around the

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.240 
you could get it to stick around the
edges<00:03:21.510> I'm<00:03:21.780> not<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.109> sure<00:03:22.230> but<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.889> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
edges I'm not really sure but it is the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.620 
edges I'm not really sure but it is the
adhesive<00:03:23.700> goes<00:03:23.849> all<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.090> way<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.480> edges

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
adhesive goes all the way to the edges

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.750 
adhesive goes all the way to the edges
so<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:24.989> guess<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.349> could<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:25.950> if<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.579> took

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
so I guess you could do that if you took

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.089 
so I guess you could do that if you took
your<00:03:26.940> time<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.599> stuck<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.079> down<00:03:28.200> there<00:03:28.470> around

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
your time and stuck it down there around

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.190 
your time and stuck it down there around
this<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.880> whole<00:03:30.090> there<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.450> looks<00:03:30.660> like<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
this the whole there it looks like a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.349 
this the whole there it looks like a
looks<00:03:31.680> okay<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.190> thought<00:03:32.430> maybe<00:03:32.639> it's

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
looks okay I thought maybe it's

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.940 
looks okay I thought maybe it's
stretched<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.109> something<00:03:34.470> along<00:03:34.560> those<00:03:34.799> lines
