00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello and welcome to the docks 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.450
 protein 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.969
 in this video I present you the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.859
 nutrition performance support job here 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.609
 we are on a product intended for health 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.710
 joints 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.060
 it's a product that contains 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.310
 mainly two ingredients the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.800
 glucosamine sulphate sulfate 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.480
 chondroitin these two ingredients they 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 are together they will act synergistically 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 to be even more effective than when 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.660
 we defend separately we will have a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
 double action here preventively 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.450
 we will see a strengthening of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.910
 articulations including cartilage 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.620
 with a prevention of destruction of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.960
 cartilage destruction that may occur 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.070
 and that may happen to most 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 of us simply what we 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.910
 plays sports and especially 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.100
 strength sports but intensive nak 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.480
 in may heavy loads on our 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.250
 joints and little by little the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.000
 cartilages from the south we also have a role 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.410
 curative 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.449
 because we're going to have an effect on the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.379
 inflammation reduction like having 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.239
 a joint level 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.180
 so it's a product that we can 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 use all year long as a preventive and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 for those who do not want to use any 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.630
 the year like me I find nobody a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.310
 little damage 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.770
 you can use when you have a 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.150
 pain to help reduce pain 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 however, we must take 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
 account that these ingredients there they 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.450
 take several weeks to act by 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.350
 against the advantage that when we stop 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.720
 the facts this product for several 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 weeks but as I already said for 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.380
 me more relevant to use this type of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.799
 products all year round in terms of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 dosage 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.750
 we will have for three capsules so this 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.320
 are normal size capsules that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.240
 should not be a problem 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.540
 especially to be swallowed we will see 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.509
 against 3 capsules 1560 mg of sulphate 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 glucosamine and 999 mg of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.320
 chondroitin so on a dosage all to 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.360
 Correct if the back is advisable 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.880
 generally one assured to say on the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.500
 dosing product is well dosed then for 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.329
 the test I did not do the tests in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.380
 live now just like 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.540
 I say it takes several weeks 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.909
 for this product to work and me 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.890
 that they already for several months a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.479
 equivalent product that will also need 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 several weeks for the effect of 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.780
 equivalent product this disciple honda tu 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.939
 it's not really relevant to doing a 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.500
 test just remember that we are 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.410
 under an association of two aggressors 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.970
 complementary and how to dose so we 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.800
 can take three juices a day 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.350
 at any time of the year and then you 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.190
 take if possible in europe 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.230
 here is now I give an appointment 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.850
 proteins no matter the tests and 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.240
 life for all the details on this 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.430
 product 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.650
 our conscientization and of course any 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.480
 our test and finally do not forget to
