00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 we change the subject one for the other boxing 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.309
 and the ideal result for the business 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.380
 but if it also closes from the point of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.179
 view of the expectation to return to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.670
 generate a new combat and this seems 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.279
 be what is going to happen in the month 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.050
 September I think it gives me the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.189
 sensation that is something that had been 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.600
 agreed if the fight came out so even 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.779
 in the possibilities of one and the other 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.550
 putting him much more sacrifice attitude 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.489
 the Argentine and his boxing voice intact that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.219
 worked for several rounds the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.200
 first were favorable to maidana the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.020
 first in particular that he went out to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.030
 star in the fight against a mayweather 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.890
 who tried to take the reins what 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 usually do to finish 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.170
 demoralize your rivals situation that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.270
 could not happen with the Maidana Chinese one 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.320
 fight that ends in the result 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 general 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.739
 with a minimum difference for 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 mayweather obviously the champion of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.520
 you have to knock it out and this is a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.910
 reality boxing specialists 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.130
 they always say to the world champion there are 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.080
 that to beat you is to say you have to throw it away 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.350
 that does not remain but it is not impossible 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.540
 to be able to take it from the point of view 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 technical difference good maidana did the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.200
 fight that was best for him I try not to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.690
 give him the ground of not letting him box 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.659
 obviously but the strategist 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.140
 floyd mayweather that has to do with 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.530
 crowns no this is not little '70s record 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.240
 of 26 is never a 45 in the with this 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.950
 fight 46 victories never lost and this 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.030
 he marked a respect from the point of view 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.740
 from maidana that I respect him from the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.929
 knowing that he was a great boxer but 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.369
 who tried to make the fight that most 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.990
 It was convenient for Mayweather not to fight and 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.819
 this speaks of the intelligence of a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.649
 strategy from the point of view of 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.890
 maidana who knows that his technical wealth 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.390
 does not reach the height of Mayweather 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.879
 we will see what happens in 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.890
 hopefully in September rematch time 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.060
 for the Argentine because if there is something that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.289
 it is clear after having finished 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 of the fight is that it deserves a 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.039
 great opportunity I think it's the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.160
 feeling that was left in the corner of 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.959
 maidana also to mayweather 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 mayweather had gestures really 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.250
 important and during the previous one goes 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.560
 achieving a lot with who fought 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.959
 this is not little does not happen in the field 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.940
 of cooking when you usually try one 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.950
 to discourage beyond the episode of 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.750
 the gloves that reflect the Saturday of 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.700
 that little stuffed 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.700
 with which those gloves arrived for 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.220
 maidana and that he had to change them 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.380
 done but prove it in the fight had 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.070
 very much regarding the statements 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.090
 in what he valued maidana by knockout 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.550
 and others and this surely happened to a 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.070
 fundamental seasoning at the height of the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.890
 prior to September if it is given 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.950
 the situation here just the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.430
 figures of 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.769
 the referees lemme points out that it was 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.950
 located the reality a climate was lived 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.989
 spectacular of the Argentines the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.629
 whistle because the husbands were the 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.150
 Argentines when it was consolidated to 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.760
 mayweather as winner 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.730
 and the situations 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:27.560
 referees has to do with 117-111 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.599
 116-112 respectively where mayweather 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.739
 important to keep in mind is the 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.120
 tie that michael pernick gave in 114 in 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.250
 which good seems to me that those 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.989
 quite positive results in many 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.890
 it has to do with a situation of 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.090
 tie 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.920
 valuing this that I said in the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.050
 I start not to face the champion of 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.230
 world a boxing strategy without 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.410
 no doubt and a strategy 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.959
 by maidana non knowing what to do 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.670
 that could was to try to leave sacrifice 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.080
 all the service of a fight seems to me 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.300
 the result for maidana was 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.660
 widely positive thank you many 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.660
 thank you, juan
