any<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:12.200> us<00:01:12.350> i<00:01:12.380> think<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:13.190> if<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.460> have<00:01:13.640> this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
any of us i think that if you have this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.969 
any of us i think that if you have this
on<00:01:13.970> external<00:01:14.299> power<00:01:14.630> actually<00:01:15.290> charges<00:01:15.860> the

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
on external power actually charges the

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.160 
on external power actually charges the
battery<00:01:16.310> doesn't<00:01:16.610> charge<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.150> got<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:18.049> then

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
battery doesn't charge it got and then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.969 
battery doesn't charge it got and then
inside<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.799> here<00:01:19.040> there's<00:01:19.700> an<00:01:19.909> SD<00:01:20.210> card<00:01:20.979> sim

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
inside of here there's an SD card sim

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.359 
inside of here there's an SD card sim

there's<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.709> connector<00:03:55.130> on<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.370> radio<00:03:55.819> look<00:03:56.810> up

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
there's a connector on the radio look up

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.070 
there's a connector on the radio look up
this<00:03:57.560> vision<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.330> radio<00:03:59.720> because

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
this vision is this is the radio because

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.900 
this vision is this is the radio because
it's<00:04:00.260> got<00:04:00.380> an<00:04:00.530> internal<00:04:01.040> pack<00:04:01.340> press<00:04:01.640> radio

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
it's got an internal pack press radio

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.590 
it's got an internal pack press radio
and<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:02.780> goes<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.549> satellite<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:05.060> gnss

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
and this goes to the satellite the gnss

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.960 
and this goes to the satellite the gnss
antenna<00:04:06.019> GSS<00:04:06.709> antenna<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.549> standard

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
antenna GSS antenna and it's a standard

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.259 
antenna GSS antenna and it's a standard
BNC<00:04:08.510> connector<00:04:08.959> but<00:04:09.709> it's<00:04:09.860> heavy<00:04:10.040> duty<00:04:10.280> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
BNC connector but it's heavy duty and

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.590 
BNC connector but it's heavy duty and
it's<00:04:11.420> got<00:04:11.540> these<00:04:11.660> nice<00:04:11.870> little<00:04:12.080> water<00:04:12.410> caps

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
it's got these nice little water caps

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.840 
it's got these nice little water caps
then<00:04:14.600> we've<00:04:14.870> got<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:15.170> canvas<00:04:16.040> connector<00:04:16.609> that's

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
then we've got a canvas connector that's

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.520 
then we've got a canvas connector that's
optically<00:04:17.419> isolated<00:04:17.540> all<00:04:18.229> of<00:04:18.410> the

the<00:04:20.540> power<00:04:20.750> are<00:04:21.709> optically<00:04:22.250> isolated<00:04:22.600> to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
the power are optically isolated to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.659 
the power are optically isolated to
explain<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.350> them<00:04:24.530> what<00:04:24.740> what<00:04:24.979> optical

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
explain to them what what optical

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.310 
explain to them what what optical
isolation<00:04:26.180> means<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.510> how<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.660> benefits<00:04:27.169> us

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
isolation means and how that benefits us

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.650 
isolation means and how that benefits us
so<00:04:27.620> if<00:04:27.740> you're<00:04:27.919> working<00:04:28.160> on<00:04:28.700> a<00:04:29.030> marine

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
so if you're working on a marine

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.840 
so if you're working on a marine
application<00:04:30.410> on<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.590> boat<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:31.160> don't<00:04:31.370> want<00:04:31.639> any

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
application on a boat you don't want any

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.180 
application on a boat you don't want any
stray<00:04:32.360> currents<00:04:32.870> going<00:04:33.169> from<00:04:33.680> different

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190

places on the boat back or on a big
piece<00:04:37.100> of<00:04:37.130> equipment<00:04:37.789> you<00:04:37.940> don't<00:04:38.330> want<00:04:38.510> any

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
piece of equipment you don't want any

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.690 
piece of equipment you don't want any
strict<00:04:39.050> with<00:04:39.289> currency<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.490> these<00:04:40.640> are

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
strict with currency so these are

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.240 
strict with currency so these are
optically<00:04:41.300> isolated<00:04:41.419> so<00:04:42.229> wherever<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.950> run

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
optically isolated so wherever you run

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.900 
optically isolated so wherever you run
the<00:04:43.370> wire

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
the wire

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.910 
the wire
is<00:04:44.090> not<00:04:44.480> electrically<00:04:45.230> connected<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.800> this

is not electrically connected to this

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.980 
is not electrically connected to this
box<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.910> is<00:04:47.150> but<00:04:47.360> it's<00:04:47.510> optically<00:04:47.930> isolated

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
box it is but it's optically isolated

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.200 
box it is but it's optically isolated
inside<00:04:48.980> so<00:04:49.160> essentially<00:04:49.730> it's<00:04:49.850> taken<00:04:50.120> 20

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
inside so essentially it's taken 20

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.210 
inside so essentially it's taken 20
meter<00:04:50.480> go<00:04:50.990> from<00:04:51.170> these<00:04:51.350> connectors<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:52.130> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
meter go from these connectors to the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.030 
meter go from these connectors to the
box<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:53.060> will<00:04:53.240> be<00:04:53.390> infamous<00:04:53.900> no<00:04:54.470> current<00:04:54.860> flows

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
box it will be infamous no current flows

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.820 
box it will be infamous no current flows
so<00:04:55.610> there's<00:04:55.790> can<00:04:56.120> bus<00:04:56.390> connector<00:04:56.900> there<00:04:57.590> sent

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
so there's can bus connector there sent

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.290 
so there's can bus connector there sent
the<00:04:58.220> can<00:04:58.460> bus<00:04:58.700> connector<00:04:59.210> is<00:04:59.620> for<00:05:00.620> use<00:05:00.920> in

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
the can bus connector is for use in

actually<00:06:02.020> put<00:06:02.199> another<00:06:02.470> gnss<00:06:03.400> porta<00:06:03.759> there

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
actually put another gnss porta there

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.999 
actually put another gnss porta there
will<00:06:04.419> be<00:06:04.539> able<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:04.810> run<00:06:04.930> two<00:06:05.199> antennas<00:06:05.740> out<00:06:05.860> of

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
will be able to run two antennas out of

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.920 
will be able to run two antennas out of
here<00:06:06.220> and<00:06:06.400> real-time<00:06:06.970> be<00:06:07.330> able<00:06:07.509> to<00:06:07.570> give<00:06:07.720> that

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
here and real-time be able to give that

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.930 
here and real-time be able to give that
so<00:06:08.560> we'll<00:06:08.680> have<00:06:08.830> a<00:06:08.860> centimeter<00:06:09.490> position

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
so we'll have a centimeter position

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.420 
so we'll have a centimeter position
closed<00:06:10.180> heading<00:06:10.449> plus<00:06:10.900> heading<00:06:11.289> and<00:06:11.500> five

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
closed heading plus heading and five

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.159 
closed heading plus heading and five
national<00:06:12.910> independent<00:06:13.600> and<00:06:13.810> then<00:06:13.990> this<00:06:14.110> one

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
national independent and then this one

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.439 
national independent and then this one
here<00:06:14.620> the<00:06:14.770> next-to-last<00:06:15.130> one<00:06:15.520> is<00:06:15.940> an<00:06:16.090> Ethernet
