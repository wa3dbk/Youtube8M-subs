what<00:00:07.500> I've<00:00:07.740> done<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.840> my<00:00:10.130> NZXT<00:00:11.130> switch<00:00:11.370> 810

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
what I've done to my NZXT switch 810

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.529 
what I've done to my NZXT switch 810
build<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:13.280> these<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.230> xigmatek<00:00:16.910> XLF<00:00:17.910> to

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
build so these are the xigmatek XLF to

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.560 
build so these are the xigmatek XLF to
five<00:00:18.840> sixes<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.970> when<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> plug<00:00:21.270> them<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
five sixes and when you plug them and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.929 
five sixes and when you plug them and
they<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.890> four<00:00:22.890> white<00:00:23.070> LEDs<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.850> an

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
they have four white LEDs just like an

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.730 
they have four white LEDs just like an
LED<00:00:24.269> fan<00:00:24.510> would<00:00:25.730> but<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.849> also<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.380> like<00:00:28.380> UV

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
LED fan would but they also have like UV

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.380 
LED fan would but they also have like UV
reactive<00:00:28.890> properties<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.670> them<00:00:29.789> as<00:00:29.910> well<00:00:29.939> as

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
reactive properties in them as well as

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.709 
reactive properties in them as well as
you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.000> led<00:00:33.329> on

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
you can see there and with that led on

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.830 
you can see there and with that led on
not<00:00:34.260> only<00:00:34.440> does<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.649> take<00:00:34.890> away<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> UV<00:00:35.840> miss

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
not only does it take away the UV miss

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.729 
not only does it take away the UV miss
of<00:00:37.170> tubing<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:39.300> does<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> fan<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.079> well<00:00:40.110> so

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
of tubing but it does the fan as well so

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.030 
of tubing but it does the fan as well so
I<00:00:40.980> thought<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.180> bugger<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.040> cut

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I thought you know what bugger it cut

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.639 
I thought you know what bugger it cut
those<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:45.120> white<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.020> kind<00:00:46.530> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
those little white on the kind like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.690 
those little white on the kind like
silvery<00:00:47.420> cables<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.629> connect<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> LEDs

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
silvery cables that connect the LEDs

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.900 
silvery cables that connect the LEDs
cuddle<00:00:50.700> four<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:52.739> create<00:00:53.070> almost<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
cuddle four of them to create almost a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.170 
cuddle four of them to create almost a
Gaillard<00:00:54.780> wing<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.000> looks

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
Gaillard wing really so that looks

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.650 
Gaillard wing really so that looks
awesome<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:58.850> thought<00:00:59.850> maybe<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.359> video<00:01:00.600> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
awesome I thought maybe in this video I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.870 
awesome I thought maybe in this video I
could<00:01:00.870> give<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.350> review<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.950 

xspc<00:01:05.880> rasa<00:01:06.270> RS<00:01:06.990> 360<00:01:07.680> kit<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
xspc rasa RS 360 kit so I have that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.770 
xspc rasa RS 360 kit so I have that
there<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.770> kit<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
there as you can see so with this kit I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
there as you can see so with this kit I
found<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.080> pretty<00:01:16.619> easy<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:18.470> I<00:01:20.240> thought

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
found it pretty easy to do I thought

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
found it pretty easy to do I thought
that<00:01:21.299> maybe<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.780> should<00:01:22.020> swap<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.759> normal

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that maybe I should swap out the normal

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.980 
that maybe I should swap out the normal
barb<00:01:23.939> fittings<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.570> wanted<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.900> with

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
barb fittings I really wanted to go with

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
barb fittings I really wanted to go with
compression<00:01:25.470> fittings<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> wasn't<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
compression fittings I wasn't really a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.810 
compression fittings I wasn't really a
hundred<00:01:27.720> percent<00:01:28.100> keen<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> whole<00:01:29.430> barb

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
hundred percent keen on the whole barb

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.840 
hundred percent keen on the whole barb
idea<00:01:30.299> especially<00:01:31.009> with<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> stock<00:01:32.430> tubing

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
idea especially with the stock tubing

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
idea especially with the stock tubing
which<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> pretty<00:01:33.390> crappy<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.380> give

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
which is pretty crappy that they give

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.450 
which is pretty crappy that they give
you<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:37.290> half<00:01:37.740> inch<00:01:38.040> compression

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you so I put half inch compression

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
you so I put half inch compression
fittings<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.439> remember

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
fittings on there and I do not remember

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
fittings on there and I do not remember
commend<00:01:41.579> doing<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.479> had<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> get

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
commend doing this because I had to get

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.740 
commend doing this because I had to get
plies<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.939> screw<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> crap<00:01:45.540> out

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
plies and really like screw the crap out

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
plies and really like screw the crap out
of<00:01:45.780> them<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:46.950> they

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
of them to get on that because they they

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.810 
of them to get on that because they they
touch<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.540> screw<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.399> untwist

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
touch so you screw one on and it untwist

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.510 
touch so you screw one on and it untwist
the<00:01:51.060> other<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.049> how<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> did<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.189> i'm<00:01:53.340> not

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the other one so how I did it i'm not

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.219 
the other one so how I did it i'm not
sure<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.000> i<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.329> prayed<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> God<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> it

sure and i just prayed to God that it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.639 
sure and i just prayed to God that it
didn't<00:01:55.439> leak<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:57.119> didn't<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.079> thought

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
didn't leak and it didn't so I thought

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
didn't leak and it didn't so I thought
okay<00:01:59.270> chuckling<00:02:00.270> my<00:02:00.450> system<00:02:01.399> leaked<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.579> I'm

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
okay chuckling my system leaked I I'm

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.780 
okay chuckling my system leaked I I'm
not<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.600> help<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:05.009> probably<00:02:05.250> me<00:02:05.430> hate<00:02:05.610> for
