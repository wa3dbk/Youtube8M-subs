the<00:00:48.899> bottom<00:00:49.879> that's<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> battery<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.660> there

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the bottom that's the battery down there

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.100 
the bottom that's the battery down there
the<00:00:52.860> lithium-ion<00:00:53.399> battery<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.870> probably

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the lithium-ion battery it's probably

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.840 
the lithium-ion battery it's probably
good<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.460> 15.6<00:00:56.460> points<00:00:56.879> 6<00:00:57.480> inch<00:00:57.780> screen<00:00:58.850> we've

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
good to 15.6 points 6 inch screen we've

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.320 
good to 15.6 points 6 inch screen we've
got<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:02.210> bedding<00:01:03.210> area<00:01:03.570> right<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:05.330> there's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
got the bedding area right there there's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.289 
got the bedding area right there there's
an<00:01:06.479> Ethernet<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:08.090> think<00:01:09.090> that's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
an Ethernet right there I think that's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.710 
an Ethernet right there I think that's
an<00:01:09.510> HD<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.229> an<00:01:10.409> HDMI<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> believe<00:01:11.570> what<00:01:12.570> some

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
an HD is an HDMI I believe what some

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
an HD is an HDMI I believe what some
