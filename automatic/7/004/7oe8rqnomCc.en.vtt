only decks that has this kind of engine

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.969 
only decks that has this kind of engine
still<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.750> guess<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.500> download<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
still in it so guess one download the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
still in it so guess one download the
stack<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.400> available<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.850> Dropbox<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
stack would be available on Dropbox I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
stack would be available on Dropbox I
probably<00:01:28.290> should<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.759> mobius

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
probably should do that so to mobius

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.130 
probably should do that so to mobius
