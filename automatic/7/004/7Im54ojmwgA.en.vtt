00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.780
 xl returns 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.150
 with my brother for sure 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.429
 smart and you're another night between 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.470
 all questions and reflections other 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.720
 early morning more with nothing more than my 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.970
 songs more ballads more puffs more 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.070
 words more tensions plus pomegranates me 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.859
 respond with more questions and more than 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.869
 nothing is that nothing else goes up today I leave 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.660
 looking for answers where I was already 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.820
 I'm never there because I walked between degrees 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.620
 uncertainty and with hunger for life the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.839
 life makes us more men 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.629
 summits more challenges more names more 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.210
 deserts more poems more calm more souls 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.489
 that wander in penalties more penalties less goals 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.260
 more money without trajectory than while 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.600
 more speak and speak more seven of 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
 stories plus its history plus jazz curtain 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.100
 less came more versions more you hate me 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.350
 more visions of this blind spot more 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.539
 obstacles in the game marked by fire and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.250
 without avenging is you get up with a couple of 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.039
 soil eggs and if the grief 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.289
 squeeze that the sky is not the first and 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.690
 more if you fight for yours with effort and 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:10.149
 compassion with the whole ashtray of 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.800
 eternal sincere verses that he toured already 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.770
 I have neither 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.550
 clung to the verse and I feel that I fly and 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.910
 It was my step by the death of the points 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.060
 7 if I say without fear are my creed friars 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.730
 so I think that I die closed the verse 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.690
 and I feel they have flight and poise fitting 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.720
 24/7 does not hurt the poison without hatred without 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.270
 fear I am the same and I think I think that 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.700
 the days and the inspiration and 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.160
 needed drinks in life and a single 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 death drink from it wanting 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.540
 I lost track and tension to each 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.970
 song punishes the soul of this artist 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.160
 and each problem is encased and we were shaped 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.890
 on paper with a present without a future and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.410
 stuck in yesterday with a sunrise or 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.840
 dark and without light on the road working 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.760
 hard stop you goal fate dies 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.770
 a scary pain vanishes that 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.440
 feeling the weather killed that population 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.750
 I had everything inside and everything sounds 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.760
 lie the most fallen wounds more 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 doors that close and that reach me 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.300
 any outlet more drinks want 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.020
 achieve a thorn 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.480
 in all the song my soul is not 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.640
 body and soul soundtrack but it 's 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.550
 with memories and experiences given that in 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.060
 this show grows and leather closed the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.300
 verse hundred has the flight and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.160
 commenting on it hurts on 24 7 like this 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.770
 summed up concrete solvents I'll have to 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.600
 see the verse and I feel that flight of 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:48.110
 luck fit for hurts less 24 7 I keep 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.940
 without fear I am happy my creed 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.940
 so I think I die 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.200
 m 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.430
 little bit 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:16.579
 this summer 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:20.829
 in driving conditions with the 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.829
