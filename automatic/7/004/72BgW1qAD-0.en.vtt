00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
a power bank as well so let's start

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.689 
a power bank as well so let's start
let's<00:00:29.380> open<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.859> box<00:00:31.739> so<00:00:32.739> this<00:00:33.039> is<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.819> unit

warranty card so let's insert the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.640 
warranty card so let's insert the
battery<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:03.750> bear<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.020> me<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> few

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
battery just bear with me for a few

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.100 
battery just bear with me for a few
seconds<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:07.970> don't<00:02:08.970> know<00:02:09.090> also<00:02:09.300> exactly<00:02:09.869> how

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
seconds as I don't know also exactly how

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:20.150 
seconds as I don't know also exactly how
this<00:02:10.380> one<00:02:11.030> works

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.060 

there<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.250> go<00:02:22.540> basically<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.440> one<00:02:23.710> also

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
there you go basically this one also

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.380 
there you go basically this one also
supports<00:02:24.520> two<00:02:24.790> regular<00:02:25.330> Sims<00:02:25.660> SIM<00:02:26.410> cards<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
supports two regular Sims SIM cards and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.080 
supports two regular Sims SIM cards and
there's<00:02:28.390> also<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.840> slot<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:30.070> micro<00:02:30.220> SD<00:02:30.850> card

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
there's also a slot for a micro SD card

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.640 
there's also a slot for a micro SD card
here<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:32.560> one<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.990> let's<00:02:35.230> insert<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
here this one so let's insert the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.810 
here this one so let's insert the
battery<00:02:40.800> as<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.580> battery

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
battery as you can see the battery

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.970 
battery as you can see the battery
already<00:02:43.390> has<00:02:43.960> its<00:02:44.470> own<00:02:46.440> standard<00:02:47.440> USB<00:02:47.800> port

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
already has its own standard USB port

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.870 
already has its own standard USB port
and<00:02:48.570> actually<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:51.420> micro<00:02:52.420> USB<00:02:52.959> port<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:54.430> think

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
and actually a micro USB port so I think

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.930 
and actually a micro USB port so I think
with<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.050> battery<00:02:56.380> itself<00:02:56.850> if<00:02:57.850> you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
with just the battery itself if you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.670 
with just the battery itself if you
don't<00:02:58.270> need<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.570> phone<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.110> use<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.470> as

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
don't need the phone you can use it as

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.490 
don't need the phone you can use it as
your<00:03:00.030> external<00:03:01.030> battery<00:03:01.690> pack<00:03:01.780> or<00:03:02.170> your<00:03:02.290> power

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
your external battery pack or your power

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:12.380 
your external battery pack or your power
back<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.980> let's<00:03:06.190> insert<00:03:06.520> this<00:03:06.730> one

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.449 

and

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:24.229 
and
let's<00:03:15.469> put<00:03:16.469> back<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.859> back<00:03:17.069> cover<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:22.670> yes<00:03:23.670> as

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
let's put back the back cover and yes as

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.500 
let's put back the back cover and yes as
you<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.480> see<00:03:24.719> the<00:03:25.549> port<00:03:26.549> for<00:03:26.819> charging<00:03:26.849> other

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
you can see the port for charging other

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.970 
you can see the port for charging other
devices<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.319> also<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.459> same<00:03:29.700> port<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.980> in

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
devices is also the same port that is in

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.830 
devices is also the same port that is in
the<00:03:32.730> battery<00:03:33.420> itself<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.549> let's<00:03:35.670> just<00:03:35.969> put

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
