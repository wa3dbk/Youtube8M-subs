the time starting from the latest close
to<00:01:35.799> Doris<00:01:36.250> colors<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.689> it's<00:01:37.810> easier<00:01:38.500> to

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
to Doris colors because it's easier to

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.380 
to Doris colors because it's easier to
paint<00:01:38.770> darker<00:01:39.399> color<00:01:39.700> overlay<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.149> colors
