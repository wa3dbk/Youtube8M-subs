00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.920
 but if you pay attention 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.199
 jojojojo could be cursors for 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.449
 same without flag 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.310
 obviously a year and a half studying their 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.470
 songs and I discovered this song that 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.470
 has the best 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.770
 like slowly but if it 's very clear says 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.350
 I have to put love 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.230
 to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.500
 Now imagine yourself as a fantasy 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:31.050
 I had nothing left to do but to do 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.220
 an exit and here if the soloist is 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.220
 song because it says why 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:50.289
 and my local passion in witnesses of 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.289
 possible way and then you look and you 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:01.070
 and why 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.110
 I intended to listen well says love 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.110
 he says nothing 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.470
 and good to cri crí not also 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.010
 if we think about those of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.010
 crisis 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.450
 there is courage to consummate 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.450
 yes he picked people to taste 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.750
 because the plover 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.989
 I'm not taking innocence away from the 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.090
 ant 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:16.090
 because the trickle splashed it and its 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.090
 habitat 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:33.530
 as Breton and admiration of truth is a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.920
 I work hard my dear Tony which was 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.920
 your first contract and just like that 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.630
 with qualities it was something very damn good 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.540
 we were in the office and suddenly 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:57.880
 I'm not going to say the brand but it's a 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:57.880
 this is a drink with lactobacilli in 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:09.440
 the convention and mark the office and 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.910
 so that we live on the internet in 2 to 1 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.530
 comedian and what we want to have and 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.180
 very nice because by the convention of 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.820
 this company 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.320
 and 78 states each with 500 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.990
 people or you can imagine yourself 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.990
 then already as tony mendoza failing 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.300
 like the student of Jorge Falcón if not already 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.030
 do not encourage comedian and I'm 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.800
 Current eternal smile I wanted me 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:40.190
 I suggested clearly that he was in the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.169
 channel 4 in 2009 there was a program 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.400
 Llama risks TV early in the 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.199
 mornings and the first image was thorium 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.199
 and actually one day he presents me 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.060
 some days that we have good taste 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.060
 days 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:11.690

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:21.050
 with the father as the father amaro who 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.200
 has seen it in programs of 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.200

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.520

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:55.100
 You said you're rough with him and I do not know 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:06:02.290
 what do you have there is hiccups or something like that 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.290
 but what a wife 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.020
 the wife tells the husband relatives 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.930

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.240
