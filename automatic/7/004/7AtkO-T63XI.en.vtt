wanted to create a nice woodland feel by

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400 
wanted to create a nice woodland feel by
planting<00:00:21.029> trees<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> hillside<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.260> we've

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
planting trees on the hillside so we've

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.630 
planting trees on the hillside so we've
done<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.890> we've<00:00:23.010> put<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> lot<00:00:23.430> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
done that and we've put in a lot of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.710 
done that and we've put in a lot of
different<00:00:23.910> trees<00:00:24.300> across<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> hillside<00:00:26.720> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
different trees across the hillside you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390 
different trees across the hillside you
know<00:00:27.840> prior<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> putting<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> plantings<00:00:29.250> in

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
know prior to putting the plantings in

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.060 
know prior to putting the plantings in
this<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.150> completely<00:00:30.720> bare<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
this was completely bare and what that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.880 
this was completely bare and what that
did<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.610> gave<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.090> feeling<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.559> cars

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
did was it gave that feeling of the cars

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.650 
did was it gave that feeling of the cars
being<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.520> top<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.030> house<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.420> cars

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
being right on top of the house the cars

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
being right on top of the house the cars
would<00:00:36.840> go<00:00:37.020> by<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.559> you'd<00:00:38.010> hear<00:00:38.309> them<00:00:38.489> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
would go by and you'd hear them and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.190 
would go by and you'd hear them and
you'd<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.300> there<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.510> no<00:00:39.660> privacy

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
you'd see them and there was no privacy

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.470 
you'd see them and there was no privacy
so<00:00:40.680> by<00:00:40.829> planting<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.430> evergreens<00:00:42.030> we've

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so by planting the evergreens we've

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.610 
so by planting the evergreens we've
allowed<00:00:42.809> some<00:00:43.110> privacy<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.190> created<00:00:45.590> now<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
allowed some privacy to be created now I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.690 
allowed some privacy to be created now I
certainly<00:00:46.920> could<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.280> put<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> row<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
certainly could have put a row of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.279 
certainly could have put a row of
arborvitae<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.050> would<00:00:49.170> have

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
arborvitae here and that would have

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.720 
arborvitae here and that would have
completely<00:00:49.739> screened<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> whole<00:00:50.340> thing<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
completely screened the whole thing and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.069 
completely screened the whole thing and
that's<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:50.969> option<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:51.629> could<00:00:51.899> put<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that's an option you also could put a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
that's an option you also could put a
fence<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.800> chose<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.760> put

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
fence but what we chose to do was put

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.610 
fence but what we chose to do was put
several<00:00:54.329> different<00:00:54.690> types<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.170> evergreens

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
several different types of evergreens

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
several different types of evergreens
giving<00:00:56.250> different<00:00:56.760> textures<00:00:57.210> different

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
giving different textures different

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
giving different textures different
heights<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.050> different<00:00:58.590> colors<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.550> at

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
heights in different colors so look at

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.060 
heights in different colors so look at
the<00:00:59.730> crypts<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.180> hear<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.629> nice<00:01:01.140> kamas<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.920> Aris

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the crypts I hear a nice kamas if Aris

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.759 
the crypts I hear a nice kamas if Aris
but<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.730> yellow<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.930> yellow<00:01:04.229> plant

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but it's yellow and this yellow plant

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.060 
but it's yellow and this yellow plant
will<00:01:05.339> continue<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:05.970> larger<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.840> width<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
will continue to get larger in width and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.980 
will continue to get larger in width and
a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.400> taller<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:09.840> nice

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
a lot taller will have this really nice

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
a lot taller will have this really nice
yellow<00:01:10.200> color<00:01:10.530> during<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> entire<00:01:11.220> year

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
yellow color during the entire year

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.469 
yellow color during the entire year
that's<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.119> add<00:01:12.330> winter<00:01:12.780> interest<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.350> well

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
that's gonna add winter interest as well

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
that's gonna add winter interest as well
so<00:01:15.479> next<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.290> put<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> concolor<00:01:17.310> fir

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so next to that I put the concolor fir

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.510 
so next to that I put the concolor fir
it<00:01:18.000> sort<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> has<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.720> bluish<00:01:19.290> hue<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it sort of has this bluish hue to it and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
it sort of has this bluish hue to it and
it's<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.299> different<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.020> needles<00:01:22.380> were<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it's very different the needles were a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
it's very different the needles were a
little<00:01:22.680> wider<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.310> has<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> softer<00:01:24.119> look<00:01:24.299> so

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
little wider and has a softer look so

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.109 
little wider and has a softer look so
further<00:01:25.439> down<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:26.009> did<00:01:26.159> an<00:01:26.250> earlier<00:01:26.610> planting

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
further down we did an earlier planting

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
further down we did an earlier planting
last<00:01:27.330> year<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> lot<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> different

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
last year with a lot of different

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
last year with a lot of different
spruces<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.700> those<00:01:30.180> spruces<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.900> much

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
spruces and those spruces are much

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.410 
spruces and those spruces are much
greener<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.369> also<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> different

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
greener and also have a different

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.210 
greener and also have a different
texture<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.110> putting<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> con<00:01:34.710> color<00:01:34.979> next

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
texture so by putting the con color next

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160 
texture so by putting the con color next
to<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> spruce<00:01:35.790> we've<00:01:36.180> created<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.630> nice<00:01:36.840> look

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to the spruce we've created a nice look

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
to the spruce we've created a nice look
now<00:01:38.130> remember<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> folks<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.090> viewing

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
now remember the folks gonna be viewing

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.760 
now remember the folks gonna be viewing
this<00:01:39.479> from<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> house<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> wanted<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> put

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this from the house so I wanted to put

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200 
this from the house so I wanted to put
something<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> flowers<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.060> well

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
something that flowers in here as well

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.999 
something that flowers in here as well
so<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.720> three<00:01:43.320> plants<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:43.890> going

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
so we have three plants that are going

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
so we have three plants that are going
to<00:01:44.070> flower<00:01:44.280> number<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> dogwood<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
to flower number one is the dogwood and
