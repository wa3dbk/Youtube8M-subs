once<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.570> started<00:01:24.930> finding<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.070> there

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
once I started finding all that there

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.380 
once I started finding all that there
was<00:01:26.250> people<00:01:26.520> duplicating<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.060> especially

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
was people duplicating them especially

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
was people duplicating them especially
like<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.259> normally<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> ones

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
like just normally like you and the ones

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.890 
like just normally like you and the ones
that<00:01:29.340> spawned<00:01:29.729> people<00:01:30.240> were<00:01:30.360> duplicating

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that spawned people were duplicating

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200 
that spawned people were duplicating
bows<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.610> obviously<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> price<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bows so obviously the price is going to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
bows so obviously the price is going to
go<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.390> especially<00:01:33.720> over<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> next<00:01:34.380> couple

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
go up especially over the next couple

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
go up especially over the next couple
days<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.880> been<00:01:36.000> holding<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> mine

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
days so I just been holding on to mine

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
days so I just been holding on to mine
and<00:01:36.840> I'm<00:01:37.110> gonna<00:01:37.229> wait<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.740> those<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.070> up

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and I'm gonna wait for those to go up

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
and I'm gonna wait for those to go up
more<00:01:38.790> money<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.720> people<00:01:40.020> were

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
more money because if people were

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.240 
more money because if people were
duplicating<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:40.650> they're<00:01:40.799> obviously<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> can
