00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
think that was good pickup I think that

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.430 
think that was good pickup I think that
they<00:02:15.130> was<00:02:15.280> one<00:02:15.460> of<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.930> buffet<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.110> Malcolm

Jenkins<00:02:17.590> kinase<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.160> same<00:02:18.370> grade<00:02:18.670> for<00:02:18.880> safety

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
Jenkins kinase the same grade for safety

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.750 
Jenkins kinase the same grade for safety
so<00:02:20.440> they<00:02:20.950> got<00:02:21.070> any<00:02:21.190> qualms<00:02:21.370> bold<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.640> there

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
so they got any qualms bold in there

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
the the draft the 49ers are almost in a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
best player available type thing so I

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.250 
best player available type thing so I
really<00:02:36.970> had<00:02:37.090> their<00:02:37.180> kind<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.510> two<00:02:37.720> major<00:02:37.990> areas

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
really had their kind of two major areas

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.220 
really had their kind of two major areas
in<00:02:38.560> need<00:02:38.680> at<00:02:38.950> wide<00:02:39.190> receiver<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.640> corner

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
in need at wide receiver in corner

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.410 
in need at wide receiver in corner
because<00:02:41.230> outside<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.190> crabtree<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:43.000> boldin

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
because outside of crabtree and boldin

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.090 
because outside of crabtree and boldin
they<00:02:43.600> could<00:02:43.810> ideally<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.380> good<00:02:44.560> slot<00:02:44.890> guy

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
they could ideally have a good slot guy

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.220 
they could ideally have a good slot guy
but<00:02:45.730> everything<00:02:46.060> there's<00:02:46.300> anyone<00:02:46.660> exactly

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
but everything there's anyone exactly

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.560 
but everything there's anyone exactly
that<00:02:47.350> fits<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.650> mold<00:02:47.740> here<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.150> think<00:02:49.480> they

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
that fits that mold here so I think they

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.990 
that fits that mold here so I think they
go<00:02:49.750> corner<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.490> for<00:02:51.490> some<00:02:51.640> reason<00:02:51.670> Jim

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
go corner and for some reason Jim

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.930 
go corner and for some reason Jim
Harbaugh<00:02:52.330> takes<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.110> kind<00:02:53.590> of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
Harbaugh takes the the kind of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.340 
Harbaugh takes the the kind of
surprising<00:02:54.940> player<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.660> not<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.990> Dudley

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
surprising player that not the Dudley

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.690 
surprising player that not the Dudley
expected<00:02:56.830> cuz<00:02:56.950> right<00:02:57.070> now<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.280> think<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
expected cuz right now you think the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.340 
expected cuz right now you think the
best<00:02:57.880> corner<00:02:58.150> available<00:02:58.570> will<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.840> Kyle
