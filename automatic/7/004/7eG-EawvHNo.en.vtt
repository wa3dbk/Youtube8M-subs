00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
my two real Crossing bells we didn't

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.510 
my two real Crossing bells we didn't
build<00:00:33.630> these<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.500> came<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> signals

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
build these these came from the signals

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.150 
build these these came from the signals
themselves<00:00:37.940> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.780> general<00:00:40.350> signal<00:00:40.860> type

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
themselves this is a general signal type

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.990 
themselves this is a general signal type
one<00:00:41.640> electronic<00:00:42.390> Bell<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> safe

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
one electronic Bell and this is a safe

one electronic Bell and this is a safe
Tran<00:00:45.809> Kanaka<00:00:46.739> Bell<00:00:48.110> I'm<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> start<00:00:49.710> with

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
Tran Kanaka Bell I'm going to start with

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.060 
Tran Kanaka Bell I'm going to start with
testing<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> safe<00:00:51.149> trend<00:00:51.660> though<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.770> first

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
testing the safe trend though the first

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.970 
testing the safe trend though the first
11<00:00:53.489> I'll<00:00:53.789> let<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.420> inside<00:01:00.980> so

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
11 I'll let you have a look inside so

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.289 
11 I'll let you have a look inside so
you<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.430> pulley<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.580> makes<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you see this is the pulley that makes it

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
you see this is the pulley that makes it
that<00:01:07.110> leads<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> hammer<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.100> strikes

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that leads to the hammer that strikes

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.320 
that leads to the hammer that strikes
the<00:01:09.000> Bell<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.680> right<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the Bell and right here this is the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.450 
the Bell and right here this is the
circuit<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> goes<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
circuit so that when it goes up and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.880 
circuit so that when it goes up and
strikes<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> Bell<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.780> dis<00:01:16.049> completes<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
strikes the Bell it dis completes and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
strikes the Bell it dis completes and
have<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.630> goes

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
have it and have it and then it goes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679 
have it and have it and then it goes
back<00:01:19.020> down<00:01:19.080> again<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.850> comes<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.030> strikes<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
back down again and comes up strikes it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.969 
back down again and comes up strikes it
again<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:22.950> makes<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> ding

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.539 

this<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:30.180> safe<00:01:30.450> Trindle<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:32.040> actually

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
this the safe Trindle it's it's actually

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.050 
this the safe Trindle it's it's actually
pretty<00:01:33.119> loud<00:01:33.390> still<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> might<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.939> to

pretty loud still so you might want to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.740 
pretty loud still so you might want to
turn<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.960> volume<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:37.799> computer

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
the this bill the general signal type

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.170 
the this bill the general signal type
Bell<00:02:37.180> was<00:02:37.480> actually<00:02:38.290> pretty<00:02:39.189> loud<00:02:39.430> too<00:02:39.879> when

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
Bell was actually pretty loud too when

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.599 
Bell was actually pretty loud too when
we<00:02:40.329> got<00:02:40.569> it

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
we got it

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.270 
we got it
except<00:02:42.609> we<00:02:43.150> taped<00:02:44.019> we<00:02:44.349> got<00:02:44.530> some<00:02:44.769> old<00:02:44.980> towels

except we taped we got some old towels

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.879 
except we taped we got some old towels
and<00:02:45.939> tape<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.629> speaker<00:02:46.989> up<00:02:47.139> good<00:02:47.379> so<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.769> was

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
and tape the speaker up good so that was

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.309 
and tape the speaker up good so that was
a<00:02:48.219> little<00:02:48.400> bit<00:02:48.639> quieter<00:02:49.090> that's<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.109> way<00:02:50.200> it

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
a little bit quieter that's the way it

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.220 
a little bit quieter that's the way it
is<00:02:50.439> right<00:02:50.620> now<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.510> blue<00:02:52.510> demonstration<00:02:52.720> of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
is right now and blue demonstration of

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:13.340 
is right now and blue demonstration of
it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:29.900 

[Music]

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.450 

all<00:03:30.910> right<00:03:31.390> that's<00:03:32.080> how<00:03:32.350> both<00:03:32.620> my<00:03:32.890> bells<00:03:33.130> work

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
all right that's how both my bells work

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.450 
all right that's how both my bells work
there's<00:03:34.390> also<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.870> way<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.110> do<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.560> without<00:03:35.740> any

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
there's also a way to do it without any

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.210 
there's also a way to do it without any
of<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.730> bells<00:03:36.880> but<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.710> think<00:03:38.710> that's<00:03:38.920> enough

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
of the bells but I think that's enough

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.810 
of the bells but I think that's enough
for<00:03:39.250> now

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
for now

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.690 
for now
thanks<00:03:40.390> for<00:03:40.570> watching
