00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.670
 When you're all 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.840
 What 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.200
 It's the first time this time in the s-Belair Olympics so Anna tonight nothing this 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:18.970
 But that's right 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:23.720
 Really the result of that one all until the last Toka Na or with physical strength myself can be good slip 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 I think that I must do my best rather than just being Rician 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 really 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.830
 When it was over , I didn't even look at that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.920
 Well good was Yanaka Gaano what to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.390
 I What is still really went three I'd have thought that one gave me a medal 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 I'd thought Na 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.650
 Positive integer is it 's such I was along or also fourth ah constant 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.070
 very well 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:56.970
 Wow it but is anything but I'd yo standing not but rain would do that so take Dakiru 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.970
 It's been fresh feeling so far 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:21.720
 I think that the final in particular was a slip of the whole body 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.910
 Hen something it was not able to until now when I can slip such as touch if in that you 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.910
 That's why I'm very happy 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.870
 I 've said many times that I want to make my own slip for the Sochi Olympics 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.100
 Could you slide like you today? 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.640
 I think I can not do it 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.990
 More 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:48.530
 Have themselves well to this after all I'd have is always also say you know yourself, et al. 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:51.530
 At that start, I would like to do my best in the course in front of me. 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.630
 Say ish maybe it's Tteyuu slip out 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:02.180
 I'd think I was in that ideal I thought Well today sister Park's because it was able to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:08.690
 viewing and a yourself really really glad value ordering 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:12.009

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.009
 Well this way 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:36.390
 I'm booboo saying error 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.319
 It really glad that this was to the point where say the best of the slip was with or take just maybe 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.560
 I think 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.560
 Yes 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.180

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:07.819
 What really what or me to say shy 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.659
 How many times even thought that really glad that the skate many times at the softening stage of the Olympic 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:16.459
 To be 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:20.209
 I think that it is the last time this time , so I wonder what is already a very porin pick for myself 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.170
 I think that the memories of will end with very good memories 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.580
 There is no medal but 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.970
 There is no choice but to say something else, but it was good to do my best 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.970
 I think
