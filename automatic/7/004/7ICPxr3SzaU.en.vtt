that this minigame right here is I like

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
that this minigame right here is I like
Scott<00:01:00.359> Scottsman<00:01:00.840> plated<00:01:01.199> ahead<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Scott Scottsman plated ahead of the

Scott Scottsman plated ahead of the
future<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> know<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
future you know I think that this

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
future you know I think that this
minigame<00:01:02.730> right<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> exactly<00:01:04.080> after<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
minigame right here is exactly after it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
minigame right here is exactly after it
so<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.549> after<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.000> ending<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.479> five

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
so it's right after the ending of five

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.149 
so it's right after the ending of five
minutes<00:01:07.290> -<00:01:07.350> Freddy<00:01:07.500> started<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> night<00:01:08.010> by

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
I don't know guys but I definitely

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.860 
I don't know guys but I definitely
believe<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.550> there<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:17.790> some<00:02:18.090> Association

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
believe that there are some Association

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.000

as<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.170> see<00:02:19.320> right<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.860> two

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
as you can see right here with the two

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
as you can see right here with the two
balloons<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.640> could<00:02:20.850> be<00:02:20.970> coincidence<00:02:21.150> guys

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
balloons it could be coincidence guys

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.600 
balloons it could be coincidence guys
but<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> think<00:02:22.740> Scott's<00:02:23.010> too<00:02:23.160> smart<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.490> that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
but I think Scott's too smart for that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.680 
but I think Scott's too smart for that
you<00:02:23.760> know<00:02:23.880> Scott<00:02:24.090> doesn't<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.540> that

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
you know Scott doesn't really do that

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.420 
you know Scott doesn't really do that
many<00:02:24.840> coincidences<00:02:25.040> almost<00:02:26.040> everything

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
many coincidences almost everything

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.250 
many coincidences almost everything
Scott<00:02:26.670> does<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.240> plan<00:02:27.720> maybe<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.020> playing<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.270 
think that the puppet actually does
