 from the moment I chose him the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.209
 game that will appear to me is the gta 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.849

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.349
 to guys 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.330
 many people say that with the advent of 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.450
 you can not get online 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.280
 So you can, but you have to take some 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.910
 care 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.150
 for example as a locked video game 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.580
 I do not exist a continent, I just go 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.110
 logo on psn 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:41.950
 after I have the game since I never 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:46.540
 I'll play the last log in 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:50.190
 psn because psn is the registration of games 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.190
 I'm just going to enter a test here. 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.340

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.160
 over there 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.160
 starts the normal session 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.010
 there is logged if I want to play online 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.180
 I can play normal I just do not recommend 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.630
 two games 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.990
 battlefield and caufield because surveillance 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.910
 of are quite rigid with violence 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.060
 block but the rest is quiet 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.810
 remembering to never enter multi-media 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.940
 logged in on psn as I am now never 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.600
