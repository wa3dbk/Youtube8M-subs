00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.620
 little margin 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.740
 peladeau additionally in France fifteen thousand public crossings are 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.190
 borrowed daily by road users 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.850
 most of them have known that no incident for ten years 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.950
 yet even if the numbers are down we continue to deplore a 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.950
 collision every three days 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.539
 it's not the level crossing that has necessarily dangerous 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.380
 is very dangerous it's people's behavior 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.480
 that's why this is a collage of awareness-raising operations 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.970
 to try two corey jane to improve the behavior of the players 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.610
 no number is still constant 90% of accidents 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.920
 level are due to non-compliance with the Highway Code a level crossing 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.400
 is not a road junction 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.050
 and the top priority and conceded have towed to the stopping distance for 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.760
 trains traveling at 50 kilometers per hour 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 more than 400 meters at 160 kilometers an hour it would take more than a kilometer 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330
 to be able to mark the party 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.489
 on the crossing 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.540
 it's not worth it 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.980
 to say more because people in prison have nothing to do as well 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.040
 found to say what about he thinks even plan that the barriers are 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.890
 closed 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.920
 accidents affect all cases of used cars motor coach trucks 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 pedestrians and cyclists 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.020
 everyone in here a few minutes that ultimately on this very expensive side 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.690
 I do not count the dead ones closed tomorrow 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.880
 because I saw so many so no neighbors 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.450
 who was going to look are growing 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 and for laughter 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170
 he passed between the gates approved in the hat is growing 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.520
 we do not have very good 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 it is not fault of signaling to warn the users of the arrival 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.470
 imminent of a tram that can not he will not stop and under a few 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 rules must be respected 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.170
 the first signed to meet before going again this time 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.000
 we 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.650
 it is placed without 150 meters before the level crossing 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.090
 it means to slow down caution the stop signal of the crossing is the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 authentic trophy and the ringtone must stop as soon as the lights 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.400
 flashed the sounding sound 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.160
 well before lowering the barriers 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.930
 somehow spending less than 30 years whose photo is still 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.250
 noted on the crossing it must be broken down the barrier it is 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.590
 intended for at least either if bp is down 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.400
 the entire vehicle all the occupants and phone with the 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.020
 phone that is located right next to the crossing but if the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.070
 level crossings without fire or barrier signaled by endogenous growth 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.950
 with or without roof not for its level crossings and once at the shootings stop 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.360
 I crossed only if the bosses on both sides if the rules of 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.189
 security to respect are the same everywhere 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.269
 some crossings require even greater vigilance in 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.189
 Ile-de-France has about 500 level crossings for 128 passengers 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.729
 Germans who are characterized as 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:34.429
 concretely it means that she did after accident on this way of 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:35.109
 see 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.629
 improve network security and daily challenges of the rail network 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.009
 of France on average it's a hundred level crossings in total been 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:43.119
 deleted each year 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.569
 by creating a page of closing deviations of minutes from 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.289
 road 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.439
 take a level crossing it's true that it's very long very very happy 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.389
 and France's rail network can never do it alone per cent 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.639
 and always working in partnership with communities with 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.449
 municipalities with department with the regional council if the passages to 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.859
 level remains obligatory passages it is by an awareness of all the 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.139
 stakeholders but also users that together we can 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.689
 improve security 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.409
 to save lives
