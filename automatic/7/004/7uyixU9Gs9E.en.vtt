mood and I realized I shouldn't have

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649 
mood and I realized I shouldn't have
said<00:01:52.500> anything<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.240> rude

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and I I mean honestly I knew my girl

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.509 
and I I mean honestly I knew my girl
might<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.780> knew<00:02:10.229> my<00:02:10.379> brother<00:02:10.439> was<00:02:11.069> gonna<00:02:11.250> try

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
might I knew my brother was gonna try

and hook me up with her within

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.290 
and hook me up with her within
girl<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.200> kind<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.740> had<00:02:15.920> ulterior<00:02:16.670> motives

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
girl so I kind of had ulterior motives

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.360 
girl so I kind of had ulterior motives
at<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.599> same<00:02:17.810> time<00:02:18.140> because<00:02:18.380> my<00:02:18.980> brother's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
at the same time because my brother's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.610 
at the same time because my brother's
pretty<00:02:19.640> good<00:02:19.849> with<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> ladies<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:21.080> think

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
pretty good with the ladies and I think

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.839

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
he would have been able to hook me up

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.790 
he would have been able to hook me up
