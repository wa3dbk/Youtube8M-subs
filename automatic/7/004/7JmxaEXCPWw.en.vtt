incorrectly<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> falls<00:01:41.009> out<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.030> just

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
incorrectly like it falls out or it just

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.249 
incorrectly like it falls out or it just
doesn't<00:01:42.270> sounds<00:01:42.810> good<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:45.079> it<00:01:46.079> sounds

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
doesn't sounds good because it sounds

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
doesn't sounds good because it sounds
better<00:01:46.439> whenever<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> nice<00:01:47.729> snug<00:01:48.360> fit

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
better whenever it's a nice snug fit

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.440 
better whenever it's a nice snug fit
inside<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.320> your<00:01:49.500> ear<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
inside of your ear so what you do is you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
inside of your ear so what you do is you
put<00:01:51.659> inside<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.170> ear<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
put inside of your ear and then you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.920 
put inside of your ear and then you
actually<00:01:53.750> twist<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:55.070> one<00:01:56.070> way<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> other

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
actually twist it one way or the other

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.800 
actually twist it one way or the other
I've<00:01:57.930> actually<00:01:58.229> twisted<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.630> had<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I've actually twisted it and had the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.059 
I've actually twisted it and had the
wire<00:02:01.549> go<00:02:02.549> upwards<00:02:03.829> when<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> ear<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
wire go upwards when it's in the ear and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.050 
wire go upwards when it's in the ear and
based<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> angle<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:11.640> actually

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
based on the angle of this it actually

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
based on the angle of this it actually
sounds<00:02:13.020> better

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
sounds better

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.530 
sounds better
much<00:02:14.310> better<00:02:14.609> it<00:02:14.849> sounds<00:02:15.469> just<00:02:16.469> as<00:02:16.620> good<00:02:16.709> as

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
much better it sounds just as good as

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.890 
much better it sounds just as good as
the<00:02:18.540> original<00:02:19.250> extreme<00:02:20.250> explosives<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.540> I

twisting<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.670> one<00:02:26.670> way<00:02:26.849> or<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.150> other<00:02:27.239> or

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
twisting it one way or the other or

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.860 
twisting it one way or the other or
maybe<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> way<00:02:29.489> around<00:02:29.609> until<00:02:29.969> it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
maybe all the way around until it's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.830 
maybe all the way around until it's
feels<00:02:31.620> right<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:34.230> music<00:02:34.590> sounds<00:02:35.099> better

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840

attendees<00:03:04.530> bass<00:03:04.889> booster<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.480> that's<00:03:07.109> just<00:03:07.200> a

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
attendees bass booster so that's just a

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.409 
attendees bass booster so that's just a
way<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.530> improve<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.730> sound<00:03:08.879> quality<00:03:09.090> of

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
way to improve the sound quality of

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.839 
way to improve the sound quality of
these<00:03:09.599> just<00:03:10.409> when<00:03:10.829> senior<00:03:11.129> year<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.579> twist

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
these just when senior year just twist

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.759 
these just when senior year just twist
it<00:03:11.969> and<00:03:13.010> that's<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.400> by<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.329> way<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.750> use<00:03:16.590> my

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
it and that's it and by the way I use my

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.399 
it and that's it and by the way I use my
own<00:03:16.919> red<00:03:17.489> rubber<00:03:17.849> caps<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.449> it<00:03:18.569> so<00:03:19.290> that

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
own red rubber caps on it so that

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.099 
own red rubber caps on it so that
explains<00:03:22.409> why<00:03:23.209> these<00:03:24.209> are<00:03:24.269> red<00:03:24.569> ants<00:03:24.720> or<00:03:24.840> black

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
explains why these are red ants or black

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.140 
explains why these are red ants or black
because<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.190> red<00:03:26.340> ones<00:03:26.549> are<00:03:26.639> actually<00:03:27.000> easier

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
because the red ones are actually easier

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.259 
because the red ones are actually easier
to<00:03:27.299> keep<00:03:27.569> clean<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.650> black<00:03:28.859> ones<00:03:29.129> get<00:03:29.760> dusty

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
to keep clean the black ones get dusty

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.949 
to keep clean the black ones get dusty
really<00:03:30.689> really<00:03:31.079> fast<00:03:31.459> anyway<00:03:32.459> um<00:03:32.729> ok<00:03:33.599> let's

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
really really fast anyway um ok let's

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
really really fast anyway um ok let's
just<00:03:34.519> unravel<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.549> little<00:03:35.790> bit<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:38.060> ok

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
just unravel a little bit of this ok

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.659 
just unravel a little bit of this ok
there's<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.720> button<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.549> there's<00:03:41.549> the

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
there's the button and there's the

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.189 
there's the button and there's the
earbud<00:03:43.519> I'd<00:03:44.519> say<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.060> about<00:03:45.659> six<00:03:46.019> inches

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
earbud I'd say that is about six inches

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.249 
earbud I'd say that is about six inches
right<00:03:46.859> there<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.599> button<00:03:48.870> should<00:03:49.139> be

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
right there so the button should be

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.210 
right there so the button should be
hanging<00:03:50.359> about<00:03:51.359> by<00:03:51.959> your<00:03:52.109> shoulders<00:03:52.349> I<00:03:52.889> guess

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
hanging about by your shoulders I guess

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.749 
hanging about by your shoulders I guess
and<00:03:56.180> that's<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.479> a<00:03:57.540> question<00:03:57.959> i<00:03:58.109> received

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
and that's just a question i received

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:04.069 
and that's just a question i received
recently<00:04:00.739> from<00:04:02.269> one<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.449> comments<00:04:03.930> on
