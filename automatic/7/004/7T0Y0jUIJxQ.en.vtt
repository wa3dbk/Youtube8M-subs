00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
evasion but there just wasn't enough

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.030

and<00:01:59.970> whatnot<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:00.930> worth

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
and whatnot but I think it's worth

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.440 
and whatnot but I think it's worth
considering<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.890> three<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:03.180> best

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
goblins are warriors in fact you could

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.740 
goblins are warriors in fact you could
actually<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:05.729> more<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.150> warrior<00:02:06.420> type

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
actually go more of a warrior type

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.869 
actually go more of a warrior type
strategy<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.860> still<00:02:08.159> think<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.459> goblin

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
strategy and I still think that goblin

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.589

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
pile driver is good enough to consider

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.780 
pile driver is good enough to consider

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
i really really like if we get some more

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.040 
i really really like if we get some more
goblins<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.860> could<00:03:59.700> see<00:04:00.030> myself<00:04:00.209> going<00:04:00.630> out<00:04:00.900> of

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
goblins I could see myself going out of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.540 
goblins I could see myself going out of
hoarding<00:04:01.380> outbursts<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.890> dragon<00:04:02.250> fathers

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
hoarding outbursts and dragon fathers

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.040 
hoarding outbursts and dragon fathers
and<00:04:02.730> they<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> lot<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> synergy<00:04:03.990> with

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
and they have a lot of synergy with

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.020 
and they have a lot of synergy with
gunpowder<00:04:04.350> effort<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.010> at<00:04:05.340> Argus<00:04:05.670> command

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
gunpowder effort and at Argus command

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.390 
gunpowder effort and at Argus command
but<00:04:06.720> if<00:04:07.050> we<00:04:07.350> get<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.650> goblin<00:04:07.890> Lord<00:04:08.280> at

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
but if we get like a goblin Lord at

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.280 
but if we get like a goblin Lord at
three<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.940> think<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.630> worth<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
three I think it is worth the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.410 
three I think it is worth the
consideration<00:04:11.250> going<00:04:11.550> into<00:04:11.730> all<00:04:11.880> creatures

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
consideration going into all creatures

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.800 
consideration going into all creatures
and<00:04:12.690> then<00:04:13.110> going<00:04:13.350> in<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.810> collected

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.080 
and then going in to the collected
company<00:04:16.290> collected<00:04:16.950> company<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.489> an<00:04:17.609> insanely

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
company collected company is an insanely

definitely do need to consider running

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.960 
definitely do need to consider running
running<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.620> strategy<00:04:38.010> over<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.580> token

running that strategy over the token

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.640 
running that strategy over the token
based<00:04:39.180> strategy<00:04:39.600> or<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.780> could<00:04:39.990> still<00:04:40.200> go<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.350> mix

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
based strategy or I could still go a mix

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.260 
based strategy or I could still go a mix
other<00:04:40.890> than<00:04:41.100> we're<00:04:41.280> sitting<00:04:41.550> at<00:04:41.610> 20<00:04:41.940> creatures

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
other than we're sitting at 20 creatures

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.590 
other than we're sitting at 20 creatures
right<00:04:42.420> now<00:04:42.570> it'd<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> bit<00:04:43.530> hard<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:44.820> get<00:04:45.570> up

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
right now it'd be a bit hard to get up

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.510 
right now it'd be a bit hard to get up
to<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.170> amount<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.440> count<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.830> need<00:04:47.070> with

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
to the amount of count you need with

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.080 
to the amount of count you need with
going<00:04:47.760> up<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.970> like<00:04:48.090> 22<00:04:48.510> 23<00:04:48.690> lands<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.730> for<00:04:50.730> to

going up to like 22 23 lands and for to

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.580 
going up to like 22 23 lands and for to
get<00:04:51.240> consistently<00:04:51.840> out<00:04:52.050> for<00:04:52.260> collective

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
get consistently out for collective

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.380 
get consistently out for collective
company<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:53.100> guess<00:04:53.490> maybe<00:04:53.730> good<00:04:53.970> just<00:04:54.090> take<00:04:54.240> out

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390

modern<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.360> think<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.690> card<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.200> just<00:05:31.590> so

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
modern I think the card is just so

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.460 
modern I think the card is just so
amazing<00:05:32.490> in<00:05:32.940> modern<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.510> don't<00:05:34.020> think<00:05:34.260> that<00:05:34.380> it

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
amazing in modern I don't think that it

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.470 
amazing in modern I don't think that it
will<00:05:34.530> get<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.680> ban<00:05:34.920> or<00:05:35.130> anything<00:05:35.520> but<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.090> mean

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
will get a ban or anything but I mean

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.990 
will get a ban or anything but I mean
it's<00:05:36.720> pretty<00:05:36.930> powerful<00:05:37.260> card<00:05:37.590> as<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:38.000> to

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
it's pretty powerful card as a to

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.640 
it's pretty powerful card as a to
dropping<00:05:39.300> it<00:05:39.510> in<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.660> right<00:05:39.870> deck<00:05:40.170> so
