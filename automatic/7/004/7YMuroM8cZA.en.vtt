00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.940
 Y 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.519
 let's continue as friends 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.299
 we are 90 minutes 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.930
 if we are here we have a great team 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.940
 wisdom to handle this game are 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.620
 90 minutes from the first minute we 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.620
 we give away absolutely nothing 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.840
 many more 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.699
 hello friends very bad solution the 'fluff' 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.020
 Perez and I want to send you a light 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.020
 special memory 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.740
 when I was inside the field that you 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.810
 you are feeding that is in several 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 occasions that the results were not given 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.360
 and having very good equipment even 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 until Carlos Valderrama of others 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.439
 moments when we were in the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 powerful with the site towards the same if 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.850
 you have not also 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.980
 and they use the rostrum and we lost we lost 20 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 against envigado and 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.780
 and we had to leave crying because 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.980
 they really are very bad and also 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.980
 I remember that with Pedro Sarmiento 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.730
 we played in Barranquilla and we lost 5 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.460
 to 15 to 0 but Eskimos and we 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.580
 We decomposed totana and with work 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.120
 he came back reiterated with the support of the body 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.310
 technician we join and see that we came out 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.000
 final champions for subject to have always 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.710
 its reward then for that in that 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.500
 time to keep calm boys 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.110
 it is no longer waiting for you have to always 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.110
 we want to win we always want to be in 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.720
 the first positions and that the best thing 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.230
 because an institution like this one 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.810
 deser 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.629
 because the fans that have it 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.580
 it deserves but then in the moments 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.610
 difficult is where you know the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.910
 true fan of the gift of my heart 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.070
 he said that all this happened still happens 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.440
 with the bad moments in life 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.590
 always other ways I want 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.500
 wish the fans the best 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.720
 team to the boys who are part of 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.670
 of this great team 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.880
 I was in all this to match 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.630
 that is that everything has changed they change are 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.459
 good talented players and if we do not 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.780
 they want in Medellin if they were not 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.660
 talent without stars in conditions 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.420
 and I remember that last year also 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.290
 with 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.310
 with professor hernán darío convention 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 they had this kind of circumstance 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.780
 from this bad time however 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.930
 they reached a final then we did not 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.110
 let's hope we continue supporting this 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.110
 institution
