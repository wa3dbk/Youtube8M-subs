chance they could get upgraded and of

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.710 
chance they could get upgraded and of
course<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.850> going<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> little<00:02:36.270> windy

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720

that<00:02:43.890> low<00:02:44.250> starting<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.120> break<00:02:45.330> down<00:02:45.390> that's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
that low starting to break down that's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.900 
that low starting to break down that's
what<00:02:46.350> was<00:02:46.470> responsible<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.580> cool

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910

weather and the clouds that we saw
earlier<00:02:50.160> today<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:50.730> again<00:02:51.090> that's<00:02:51.450> really

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
earlier today but again that's really

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.810 
earlier today but again that's really
going<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> distant<00:02:52.770> memory<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.520> we<00:02:53.670> head

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
going to be a distant memory as we head

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.520 
going to be a distant memory as we head
to<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.000> next<00:02:54.240> few<00:02:54.390> days<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.959> all<00:02:55.350> we're
