goal was a kindly exciting for me we

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.090 
goal was a kindly exciting for me we
played<00:00:40.089> well<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.420> first<00:00:40.629> period<00:00:40.929> and<00:00:41.199> to<00:00:41.949> get

up<00:00:42.249> that<00:00:42.280> many<00:00:42.640> goals<00:00:42.879> I<00:00:43.089> think<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.420> was<00:00:43.510> just

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
up that many goals I think it was just

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.899 
up that many goals I think it was just
the<00:00:44.230> rest<00:00:44.409> of<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.589> game<00:00:44.769> is<00:00:44.980> not<00:00:45.579> getting<00:00:45.789> any

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
the rest of the game is not getting any

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.139 
the rest of the game is not getting any
bad<00:00:46.120> habits<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:47.320> our<00:00:47.589> game<00:00:47.949> plan<00:00:48.249> I<00:00:48.879> mean

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
bad habits into our game plan I mean

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.239 
bad habits into our game plan I mean
audience<00:00:49.659> difficult<00:00:50.350> playing<00:00:50.559> against<00:00:50.920> when

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
audience difficult playing against when

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:52.770 
audience difficult playing against when
you're<00:00:51.370> playing<00:00:51.640> five<00:00:52.089> enough<00:00:52.359> and<00:00:52.569> you<00:00:52.629> don't

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
you're playing five enough and you don't

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.840 
you're playing five enough and you don't
want<00:00:52.899> any<00:00:53.019> bad<00:00:53.230> habits<00:00:53.289> creep<00:00:53.859> into<00:00:54.039> any

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
want any bad habits creep into any

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.540 
want any bad habits creep into any
players<00:00:55.149> game<00:00:55.539> so<00:00:55.870> but<00:00:56.800> I<00:00:56.829> think<00:00:57.100> we<00:00:57.159> did<00:00:57.460> a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
players game so but I think we did a

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.309 
players game so but I think we did a
real<00:00:57.699> good<00:00:57.729> job<00:00:57.850> just<00:00:58.329> keeping<00:00:58.629> our<00:00:58.780> keeping

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
real good job just keeping our keeping

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.889 
real good job just keeping our keeping
our<00:00:59.409> game<00:00:59.559> I<00:00:59.710> knew<00:00:59.979> I<00:01:00.010> can<00:01:00.659> playing<00:01:01.659> the<00:01:01.780> right

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
our game I knew I can playing the right

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.180 
our game I knew I can playing the right
way<00:01:02.079> that<00:01:02.409> maybe<00:01:02.559> some<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.829> those<00:01:02.979> lucky

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
way that maybe some of those lucky

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.219 
way that maybe some of those lucky
bounces<00:01:03.670> specifically<00:01:04.300> with<00:01:04.479> i<00:01:04.870> think<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.170> was

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
bounces specifically with i think it was

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.560 
bounces specifically with i think it was
Riley's<00:01:05.680> gold<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.700> just<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:07.120> whack<00:01:07.300> at<00:01:07.540> it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
Riley's gold it it just you whack at it

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.149 
Riley's gold it it just you whack at it
and<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.840> ends<00:01:08.049> up<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.380> net<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.860> maybe

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
and it ends up in the net is that maybe

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.410 
and it ends up in the net is that maybe
a<00:01:09.250> sense<00:01:09.490> that<00:01:09.549> maybe<00:01:09.759> some<00:01:09.969> of<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.149> lucky

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
a sense that maybe some of the lucky

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.209 
a sense that maybe some of the lucky
bounces<00:01:10.780> are<00:01:11.020> going<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.380> come<00:01:11.560> start<00:01:12.009> coming

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
bounces are going to come start coming

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.920 
bounces are going to come start coming
your<00:01:12.340> way<00:01:12.369> yeah<00:01:13.119> I<00:01:13.149> mean<00:01:13.240> we<00:01:13.450> didn't<00:01:13.659> have<00:01:13.750> too

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
your way yeah I mean we didn't have too

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.190 
your way yeah I mean we didn't have too
many<00:01:14.049> at<00:01:14.259> all<00:01:14.350> in<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> money<00:01:15.579> night<00:01:16.200> excluding

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
many at all in the money night excluding

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.959 
many at all in the money night excluding
germany's<00:01:17.649> game<00:01:17.799> against<00:01:18.340> russia<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.790> canada

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
germany's game against russia and canada

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.999 
germany's game against russia and canada
so<00:01:19.390> i<00:01:19.689> think<00:01:20.020> it's<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.320> good<00:01:20.439> sign<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.680> those

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
so i think it's a good sign that those

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.039 
so i think it's a good sign that those
those<00:01:21.399> are<00:01:21.430> going<00:01:21.729> in<00:01:21.850> today<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.149> hopefully

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
those are going in today and hopefully

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.450 
those are going in today and hopefully
it<00:01:23.289> will<00:01:23.380> keep<00:01:23.530> going<00:01:23.799> in<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.979> matter<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.310> a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
it will keep going in the matter on a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.279 
it will keep going in the matter on a
lot<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:25.000> guys<00:01:25.149> that<00:01:25.180> hadn't<00:01:25.689> been<00:01:25.780> scoring

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
lot of guys that hadn't been scoring

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.800 
lot of guys that hadn't been scoring
scored<00:01:26.680> so<00:01:26.920> that's<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.219> good<00:01:27.399> thing<00:01:27.969> for<00:01:28.329> our

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
scored so that's a good thing for our

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.819 
scored so that's a good thing for our
team<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:30.719> we<00:01:31.719> look<00:01:31.899> forward<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.289> getting<00:01:32.770> to

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
team and we look forward to getting to

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.499 
team and we look forward to getting to
the<00:01:32.920> quarters<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.490> think<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.759> fire<00:01:34.149> penalty

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
the quarters I think I fire penalty

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.170 
the quarters I think I fire penalty
killing<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.990> was<00:01:35.460> extremely<00:01:36.460> good<00:01:36.820> at<00:01:36.850> hint

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
killing it was extremely good at hint

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.740 
killing it was extremely good at hint
tonight<00:01:37.329> and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
tonight and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.720 
tonight and
you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.870> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.380> discipline<00:01:41.280> again<00:01:41.580> is

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
you know I think discipline again is

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.420 
you know I think discipline again is
going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.450> area<00:01:42.980> you<00:01:43.980> know<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.160> try<00:01:44.370> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
going to be one area you know we try to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.820 
going to be one area you know we try to
keep<00:01:44.790> our<00:01:44.940> sticks<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.510> and<00:01:45.930> sometimes<00:01:46.650> the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
keep our sticks down and sometimes the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.700 
keep our sticks down and sometimes the
calls<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.370> not<00:01:47.400> going<00:01:47.760> our<00:01:48.030> way<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.170> don't

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
calls are not going our way and I don't

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.780 
calls are not going our way and I don't
think<00:01:49.830> we've<00:01:50.040> had<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> five-on-three
