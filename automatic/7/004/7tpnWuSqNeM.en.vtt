quarterbacks it's completely different

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
quarterbacks it's completely different
than<00:00:13.559> last<00:00:13.710> year<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.099> lot<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.519> talent<00:00:15.210> first

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480

thing<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.750> want<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.929> ask<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> why<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.800> that

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
thing I want to ask you is why is that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.060 
thing I want to ask you is why is that
well<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.060> think<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.330> past<00:00:18.359> couple<00:00:18.810> years

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
well I think the past couple years

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.560 
well I think the past couple years
people<00:00:20.070> talk<00:00:20.250> about<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.270> spread

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
people talk about the the spread

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
people talk about the the spread
offenses<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> adverse<00:00:22.920> effects<00:00:23.250> has<00:00:23.369> had<00:00:23.519> on

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
offenses and adverse effects has had on

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.130 
offenses and adverse effects has had on
the<00:00:23.760> throwing<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> athletic

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the throwing not the athletic

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.570 
the throwing not the athletic
quarterback<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> passing<00:00:25.920> quarterbacks

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
quarterback but the passing quarterbacks

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
quarterback but the passing quarterbacks
that's<00:00:27.240> part<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> another<00:00:28.170> part<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that's part of it another part of it is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
that's part of it another part of it is
talent<00:00:29.369> cyclical<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:30.269> some<00:00:30.539> years

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
talent cyclical it some years

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.420 
talent cyclical it some years
linebackers<00:00:31.560> might<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.859> better<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.219> years

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
linebackers might be better some years

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
linebackers might be better some years
quarterbacks<00:00:32.820> might<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.120> better<00:00:33.300> past<00:00:33.960> couple

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
quarterbacks might be better past couple

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.360 
quarterbacks might be better past couple
years<00:00:34.290> we've<00:00:34.530> been<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.890> quarterbacks

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
years we've been down on quarterbacks

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.220 
years we've been down on quarterbacks
but<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:35.730> maybe<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.390> major<00:00:36.660> reason

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
but I think maybe that the major reason

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500 
but I think maybe that the major reason
is<00:00:37.410> Major<00:00:38.010> League<00:00:38.250> Baseball<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.940> was<00:00:39.149> watching

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
how many big arms are we're coming on

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
how many big arms are we're coming on
the<00:00:45.510> high<00:00:45.600> school<00:00:45.840> ranks<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.980> look<00:00:47.129> at

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the high school ranks so if you look at

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
the high school ranks so if you look at
the<00:00:47.219> class<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.579> 10<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> class<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.390> 11<00:00:48.510> there

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the class of 10 in the class of 11 there

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.750 
the class of 10 in the class of 11 there
are<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> lot<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> quarterbacks<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
are a lot of the quarterbacks if you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.920 
are a lot of the quarterbacks if you
take<00:00:50.940> ten<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> those<00:00:51.329> high<00:00:51.539> school<00:00:51.750> pitchers

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
take ten of those high school pitchers

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
take ten of those high school pitchers
and<00:00:52.260> make<00:00:52.350> half<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.800> quarterbacks<00:00:53.370> all

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and make half of them quarterbacks all

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.130 
and make half of them quarterbacks all
of<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> sudden<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> quarterback<00:00:54.719> class<00:00:54.930> looks

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
of a sudden the quarterback class looks

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
of a sudden the quarterback class looks
a<00:00:55.199> lot<00:00:55.320> better<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.770> we've<00:00:56.280> had<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> lack<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
a lot better but we've had a lack of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
a lot better but we've had a lack of
true<00:00:57.449> passers<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> past<00:00:58.260> few<00:00:58.410> years<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:58.859> i

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
true passers the past few years but i

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
true passers the past few years but i
think<00:00:59.039> its<00:00:59.160> class<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.520> 13<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.090> gonna<00:01:00.180> make<00:01:00.449> up

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
think its class of 13 it's gonna make up

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.990 
think its class of 13 it's gonna make up
for<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.989> okay<00:01:01.829> well<00:01:02.039> let's<00:01:02.250> let's<00:01:02.609> talk<00:01:02.850> about

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
for it okay well let's let's talk about

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
for it okay well let's let's talk about
that<00:01:03.239> class<00:01:03.510> specifically<00:01:04.260> who<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:04.979> some<00:01:05.189> of

so<00:02:07.020> already<00:02:07.680> i've<00:02:07.920> named<00:02:08.160> more<00:02:08.369> guys<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.670> i

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so already i've named more guys that i

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.029 
so already i've named more guys that i
think<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> high<00:02:10.259> level<00:02:10.289> quarterback

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
think can be at a high level quarterback

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.890 
think can be at a high level quarterback
then<00:02:11.340> i<00:02:11.400> probably<00:02:11.700> could<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> last<00:02:12.720> two

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
then i probably could in the last two

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.820 
then i probably could in the last two

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
classes combined

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920

and<00:02:13.950> we're<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.120> even<00:02:15.390> getting

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and we're not really even getting

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.240 
and we're not really even getting
halfway<00:02:16.080> through<00:02:16.470> them<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.770> think<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.160> go

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
halfway through them I think we can go

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.310 
halfway through them I think we can go
25<00:02:17.460> 30<00:02:18.030> deep<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.540> high-level<00:02:18.660> quarterbacks
