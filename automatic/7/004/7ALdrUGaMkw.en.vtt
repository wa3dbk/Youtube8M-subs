00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.480
 and I to all and welcome one you saw in 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.760
 my channel I am a mecca cloister and as 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.379
 always 30 is a new video and good 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.029
 people in this case I bring you a 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.550
 background gameplay gameplay 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.830
 infected and let's talk a little bit about 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.940
 This game mode is very similar to 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:30.260
 model of infection that comes out in halo 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.810
 this mode already existed but I liked it 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.240
 enough to put the beautiful and 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.310
 they know it's not like what 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.470
 of what happened to me when everyone 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.680
 the carlos toti so I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.510
 more or less of me 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.520
 so my experience on this mode see 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.770
 there no do not know what happened but what it 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.200
 I killed but I'm going to kill something like that 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.660
 this year happened basically there are going 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.400
 surviving and during those 15 seconds 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.850
 everyone has to separate because a 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.649
 Guy will go back as what 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 a zombie or be an infected with his 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.210
 knife to each type prototype because 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.890
 well it makes me more of the types 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 many say the naughty ones of nai me 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.899
 they killed and now I am an infected not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.729
 is very similar very choteado the model of 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.280
 what they want but the truth is that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.080
 it's kind of entertaining I did not like it very much 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.520
 that the games are pretty fast 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.120
 you will be able to see in the duration 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.730
 of video 4 - how long is the game 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.530
 they are giving you points and they are killing 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.270
 others while you are surviving 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.760
 they are giving points and you kill they were 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.740
 giving points whether you are a matte 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.380
 infected or is it a human fucking 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.580
 you basically get points like 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.780
 you want in experience do not give much 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.240
 apparently they do not give many according to what 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.950
 I what I could see what I went through 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 time I was playing the water not 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.990
 it is always in addition to mention it always 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.570
 it is there 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.009
 so it's a game mode over 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.939
 carlos of the truth I believe that it is one 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.880
 of the little ones are so now that 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.369
 The call of duty cost is not bad but 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.640
 I really do not know, I think it would be 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.280
 what to try with a private or something 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.450
 a little different because fast games 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.069
 it works equal matches you win and like 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.569
 that you write down kiwi can not 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.310
 kill I made balls with my bat 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.739
 team but if you can kill it 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.959
 I killed and I killed another wey then it was like that 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.239
 like I kill you kill you all kill 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.700
 we kill all then pretty much something 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.209
 That's how I told them that if you want 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.860
 put to play online games or something 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.600
 well it's not a very game mode 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.640
 recommend you see there I missed it then 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.680
 due to the paste and all can not 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.030
 killing nobody is not a very game mode 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.280
 recommended because it really 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.930
 losses are super fast is not a 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.010
 very funny model in fact it's not going to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.440
 be a game mode that happens to play 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.019
 at least it was with subscribers or something 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.660
 so in some private items or not 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.050
 what do i know 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.790
 but as competitive competitive 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.250
 I still prefer what is being the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.800
 hobby list team deathmatch mode will 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.630
 confirm domain and all the others 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.050
 real game modes there are ones that are very 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.140
 good ones 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.570
 that are house amoros where they are pulling 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.580
 weapons type home type games of hunger 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.080
 then that is very good in some 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.180
 when we bring the channel to the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.480
 arrive so they are more or less watching 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.190
 What is the game mode of the game? 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.820
 infected I is not minimal is not 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.950
 infection just like the leave it is to have 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.990
 infected so good people 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.070
 basically is this I would rate this 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.570
 Game mode with a 7 click if at all 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.520
 it's mostly besides the maps are 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.720
 great that that affects all of 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.070
 game modes especially in this to 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.830
 Although you run in chinga 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.330
 ana gabriela guevara characters that you 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.520
 You can take Corri Corri Corri Corri 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.320
 I ran I ran and you will not find 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.030
 nobody there are some maps where everyone is 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.920
 they can summon to hit in a cabin 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.780
 or something like that they were all windows and 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.270
 It's also like a little impossible 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.340
 suddenly you are touched as first to be 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.370
 the the hunter in fact see the latter 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.709
 Weiser has done with a 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.209
 in a van and it was costing us 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.950
 everyone kill them how cool you are 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.780

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.549
