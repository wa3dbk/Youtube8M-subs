controller<00:00:23.460> tomorrow<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.060> has<00:00:24.300> helped<00:00:24.630> my

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
controller tomorrow but it has helped my

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.900 
controller tomorrow but it has helped my
aim<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.289> my<00:00:25.439> transition<00:00:26.099> back<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> xbox

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
aim and my transition back to xbox

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.779 
aim and my transition back to xbox
actually<00:00:27.750> quite<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> lot<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:29.130> first

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
actually quite a lot because I first

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.519 
actually quite a lot because I first
when<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> started<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> default

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
when I started with the default

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
when I started with the default
controller<00:00:31.859> Miami<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.489> bad<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
controller Miami is really bad but the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.580 
controller Miami is really bad but the
scuff<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.570> feels<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.930> much<00:00:34.050> better<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
scuff it just feels so much better and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.400 
scuff it just feels so much better and
it's<00:00:35.399> more<00:00:35.820> similar<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> PC<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it's more similar to PC because you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.810 
it's more similar to PC because you
don't<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> move<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.100> hands<00:00:38.460> away<00:00:38.640> from

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
don't have to move your hands away from

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.209 
don't have to move your hands away from
well<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> pc<00:00:40.260> situation<00:00:40.800> when<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
well on the pc situation when I have to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.010 
well on the pc situation when I have to
move<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.460> away<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.879> keyboard<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.450> on

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
move them away from the keyboard and on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.150 
move them away from the keyboard and on
the<00:00:43.140> controller<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.680> don't<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.040> move

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the controller you don't have to move

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.770 
the controller you don't have to move
them<00:00:44.280> away<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.730> thumb<00:00:45.000> stick<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
them away from your thumb stick so I

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
them away from your thumb stick so I
just<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> made<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> transition

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
just think that it made the transition

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
just think that it made the transition
really<00:00:47.730> nicely<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.809> accuracy

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
really nicely and I got my accuracy

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
really nicely and I got my accuracy
pretty<00:00:49.620> much<00:00:49.770> back<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> normal<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:51.000> I'm

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
pretty much back to normal so I'm

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.189 
pretty much back to normal so I'm
probably<00:00:51.270> gonna<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.570> posting<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> lot<00:00:52.050> more

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
probably gonna be posting a lot more

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.869 
probably gonna be posting a lot more
xbox<00:00:52.620> game<00:00:52.860> plays<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> was

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
xbox game plays one thing that I was

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.459 
xbox game plays one thing that I was
thinking<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.239> doing<00:00:54.390> though<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.350> get

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
thinking about doing though you can get

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
thinking about doing though you can get
these<00:00:55.620> converters<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.340> mouse<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> keyboard

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
these converters for mouse and keyboard

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
these converters for mouse and keyboard
to<00:00:57.539> xbox<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.710> about<00:00:59.039> doing<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.370> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
to xbox so I think about doing that I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
to xbox so I think about doing that I
definitely<00:00:59.730> do<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.270> Xbox<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.840> lot<00:01:00.989> more

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
hearing on Twitter that nobody would get

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
hearing on Twitter that nobody would get
a<00:01:32.159> video<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.150> their<00:01:33.270> sub<00:01:33.479> box<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> past

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
a video on their sub box for the past

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
a video on their sub box for the past
like<00:01:34.290> 14<00:01:34.799> hours<00:01:34.920> which<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.430> kind<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
like 14 hours which is kind of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
like 14 hours which is kind of
ridiculous<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.810> mean<00:01:37.259> YouTube's<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
ridiculous I mean YouTube's one of the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
ridiculous I mean YouTube's one of the
biggest<00:01:38.130> websites<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.780> whole<00:01:40.049> entire

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
biggest websites in the whole entire

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.140 
biggest websites in the whole entire
internet<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.829> guess<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> could<00:01:41.250> say<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
internet I guess you could say and you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
internet I guess you could say and you
would<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.899> shit

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
would think they would have it shit

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
would think they would have it shit
together<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.920> working<00:01:44.180> ninety-nine

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
together on would be working ninety-nine

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
together on would be working ninety-nine
percent<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> time<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.140> obviously<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
percent of the time and obviously it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.410 
percent of the time and obviously it
isn't<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.189> hopefully<00:01:47.850> they<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.090> their<00:01:48.270> shit

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
isn't so hopefully they get their shit

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
isn't so hopefully they get their shit
