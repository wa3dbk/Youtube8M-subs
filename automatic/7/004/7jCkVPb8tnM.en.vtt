00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.699
 hello everyone I bring the myth number 5 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.189
 in call of duty ghost we are on the map 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.349
 of without I do not know if he pronounced it well and 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.300
 well they told me that if I print I saw some 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.029
 things below the map a satellite and not 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.619
 I know what good stories now you're going to see 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.359
 here as you can see we are in the area of cee 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.400
 in case we were in the mode 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.590
 domain worth this would be pretty much the 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.230
 cee area as you can see here there is a group 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.580
 of normal trees and current do not 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.890
 absolutely nothing happens there is nothing 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.050
 strange but what happens if we go down 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.400
 just below the good map for the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.780
 you do not know I'm using a hack 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.760
 a ps3 in dex vale 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.860
 I'm using the use mode as you see 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.440
 if we go down just cross the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.910
 soil is worth we are below the map as 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.890
 you see here it appears 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.770
 a satellite destroyed not 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.340
 more or less what are you going to see this would be the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.230
 say that satellite and then 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.070
 you see the 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.990
 for rays this is not what you call it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.000
 these antennas that has what it would be 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.160
 a satellite, and as you can see, there are 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.340
 some of the trunks already destroyed 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.290
 some of the trees already broken do not and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.570
 good and I was with pocho and pocho and I 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.150
 He said it was good that this had enough 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.370
 meaning not since there is a streak in the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.080
 that has to do something from a satellite is 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.760
 something has to do with a satellite I do not 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.910
 I knew this streak the truth because something 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.210
 the truth is played quite little and 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.430
 good 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.450
 and it turns out that we have to get a 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.340
 streak to get our streaks 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.560
 We need you already know the briefcase that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.479
 there's out there when we kill an enemy 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.040
 sometimes get a briefcase and we have to 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.590
 do one of the small missions that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.710
 they ask us for a low body-to-body thing 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.880
 Well, not when we have a few 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.220
 It does not always come out at the first voucher 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.050
 We were testing is not in the package 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.759
 and one of those packages does not come out you're 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.190
 streak vouchers that would be the satellite's not 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.259
 I know what it's called good, well, I caught 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.700
 this streak we're going to the area again of 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.190
 those trees and good and we saw that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.750
 was there down the satellite that with 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.209
 the trees that makes a lot of sense 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.950
 for what you're going to see now it's worth but the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.900
 truth that is a fuller of care or 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.730
 they sold us the game that I was going to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 be butterfield style like the one from which 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.480
 like the phil 4 toilet voucher 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.070
 that buildings and things are going to be destroyed 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.100
 of those who are going to see the fuller 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.390
 have gotten here or have they done in 10 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.190
 minutes like the one that says it's worth 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.440
 say something here as you see stretched the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.209
 streak is worth and it is a streak of these that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.010
 good a satellite appears and bursts 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.440
 the satellite there is worth and there is a flash 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.420
 it's true that happens while that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.150
 flash that what happens is that you 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.670
 letters 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.319
 what is below the map on top of the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.299
 map and what is on the map is 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.189
 it goes down again down it's worth here as 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.010
 you are seeing we are on the map worth 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.659
 normal and suddenly the satellite is 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.480
 we had seen below the map here 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.890
 destroyed with fire you are going to see by the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.540
 parabolic that I said before 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.310
 the antennae of the satellite is also 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.409
 out there and the trunks destroyed by 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.180
 here it is worth but now you are going to see that 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.390
 when he puts me back under the map 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.739
 are totally normal trees do not 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.329
 which are the ones that were in the beginning 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.040
 I think that's a trick of 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.109
 careful what they have put not be 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.170
 teleport an object to take out 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.690
 some gusts that we go directly do not 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.299
 I see it very seedy but not good and every 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.760
 one that thinks what you want not everyone 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.049
 we have an opinion so good this 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.030
 it would be the myth if they say something about a 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.739
 satellite is totally true especially 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.359
 on this map so nothing is simply 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.980
 I hope you liked it if it has 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.870
 liked to vote i like favorites and we 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.870
 we see the next video greetings to all
