00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
believe is a rep here for me because

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.839 
believe is a rep here for me because
obviously<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.859> rep<00:00:26.070> max<00:00:26.099> calculator

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
obviously the one rep max calculator

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.939 
obviously the one rep max calculator
went<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.599> once<00:00:28.050> again<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.529> getting<00:00:28.710> very

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
went up once again it's getting very

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.659 
went up once again it's getting very
close<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.519> 180<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:31.349> decided<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.579> going

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
close to that 180 I decided I was going

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.479 
close to that 180 I decided I was going
to<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.469> doing<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:34.860> single<00:00:35.219> sided

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to have a go at doing some single sided

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.220 
to have a go at doing some single sided
155<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.410> felt<00:00:37.860> pretty<00:00:38.040> easy<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.690> then<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
155 for one felt pretty easy and then I

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.979 
155 for one felt pretty easy and then I
a<00:00:40.640> loaded<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.940> hundreds<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.239> kilos<00:00:42.809> which

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
a loaded up to hundreds of kilos which

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
a loaded up to hundreds of kilos which
would<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.320> been<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> PR<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.070> me<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.899> bill<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
would have been a PR for me and bill I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.959 
would have been a PR for me and bill I
got<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> hole<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.550> don't

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
got out of the hole but I just don't

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.590 
got out of the hole but I just don't
seem<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> ability<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.260> grind<00:00:50.600> soon

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
seem to have the ability to grind soon

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
seem to have the ability to grind soon
as<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> becomes<00:00:52.110> tough<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.620> give<00:00:53.280> up

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
as it becomes tough I just give up

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000 
as it becomes tough I just give up
simple<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.829> my<00:00:55.829> back's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
simple because I just think my back's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.849 
simple because I just think my back's
gonna<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.340> hair<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.969> stop<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.620> need<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.710> get

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
gonna get hair so stop I need to get

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
gonna get hair so stop I need to get
over<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.640> start<00:01:00.359> pushing<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
over this and just start pushing but I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.399 
over this and just start pushing but I
think<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.129> could<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.370> had<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.030> fresh

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
think I could have had it if I was fresh

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.719 
think I could have had it if I was fresh
so<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.100> trying<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.519> any
