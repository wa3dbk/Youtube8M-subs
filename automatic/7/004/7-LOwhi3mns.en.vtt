thought that it would be cool to share
with<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.399> maybe<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.850> could<00:01:03.030> use<00:01:03.180> it

slow with each arm
once<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.090> get<00:03:35.240> 25<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:36.380> switch<00:03:37.960> now<00:03:38.960> you've

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
once you get 25 you switch now you've

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.410 
once you get 25 you switch now you've
done<00:03:39.410> half<00:03:39.740> of<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.040> routine<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.880> rest<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.300> it

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
done half of the routine the rest of it

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.630 
done half of the routine the rest of it
so<00:03:42.170> simple<00:03:42.500> you're<00:03:42.830> just<00:03:43.040> going<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.250> reverse

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
so simple you're just going to reverse

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.400 
so simple you're just going to reverse
what<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:44.120> did<00:03:44.300> but<00:03:44.690> instead<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:45.050> starting<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
what you did but instead of starting the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.530 
what you did but instead of starting the
routine<00:03:45.710> over<00:03:46.130> you're<00:03:46.610> going<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.790> do<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.060> back

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
routine over you're going to do it back

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.120 
routine over you're going to do it back
to<00:03:47.750> front<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.350> now<00:03:48.500> you're<00:03:48.680> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.890> start

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
to front so now you're going to start

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.540 
to front so now you're going to start
with<00:03:49.280> 5<00:03:50.030> negative<00:03:50.780> hammer<00:03:51.170> curls<00:03:51.590> each<00:03:52.160> arm

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
with 5 negative hammer curls each arm

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.110 
with 5 negative hammer curls each arm
switch<00:03:53.510> your<00:03:53.900> hammers<00:03:54.770> over<00:03:54.980> here<00:03:55.190> switch

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
switch your hammers over here switch

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.390 
switch your hammers over here switch
back<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:56.720> you're<00:03:57.380> going<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.560> go<00:03:57.680> back<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.160> your
