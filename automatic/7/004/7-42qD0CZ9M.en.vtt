00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
have like a chunk of hair missing so you

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.670 
have like a chunk of hair missing so you
just<00:05:30.460> get<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:30.850> to<00:05:31.030> where<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.510> want<00:05:31.540> it<00:05:32.140> to<00:05:32.380> be
