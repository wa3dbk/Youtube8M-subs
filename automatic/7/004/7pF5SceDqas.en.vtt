00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.909
 It could probably have been a 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.650
 career incident like any 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.750
 but knowing that in the mercedes team 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.120
 there is a small battle between your two 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.550
 pilots and the team some fans of the 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.440
 formula one among them I have made 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.810
 doubt those nico track exits 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.610
 rosberg last Sunday taking out 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.130
 us our fourth quarter side 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.380
 obviously I can not say that it is 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.910
 that I am going to say only I am going to say 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.359
 what I think and when looking for the words 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.550
 rosberg and sanction or rosberg and bet by 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.920
 twitter I realized that I am not the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.410
 only so we get to the point 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.570
 we place great prize of italy 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.430
 rosberg comes out first and hamilton second 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.890
 we come from a race in which rosberg 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.260
 done to put it like that to hamilton the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.690
 track that week the tension in team 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.610
 mercedes energy at the same time as the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.590
 excitement in the fans in the gp 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.660
 from italy who were very encouraged to 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.489
 see what happened in the first curve until 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.289
 right there but now we go back to the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.329
 turn 29 a few turns before 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.430
 rosberg went braking or at least 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.739
 that seemed and lost a few seconds 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.900
 Regarding Hamilton, the two stayed 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.700
 a distance of about 12 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.610
 a 2 each round to hamilton scratched him 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 one tenth until in 28 it went down from 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.510
 second and it came pretty close was to 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.890
 half a second of rosberg when they entered 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.320
 to the main straight 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.570
 Rosberg again stopped braking but 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.300
 this time in a weirder way I think 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.550
 Hamilton advanced and won the race but 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.650
 remember this week had been spoken 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.290
 a lot of sanctions internal to rosberg 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.360
 I do not know what and seeing the weird past of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.400
 Rosberg braking started to jump 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.160
 the bombs at least mine first that 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.770
 we all review normally at the end of 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.010
 the curve is slowed down to the signal of 150 or 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.810
 between 150 and 100 and Rosberg holding back that 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.720
 signal should have made the curve 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.880
 no problems with his wheel came out a little 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.190
 of smoke from the braking that hit something that did not 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.950
 I understand why at the 150 signal already 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.500
 had slowed down but the strangest thing is that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.000
 rosberg never made the curve yet 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.820
 your line is compared to hamilton 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.770
 for example let's do an average if 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.869
 We match the rear wheels of the car 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.000
 with the principle of advertising 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.920
 hamilton starts to turn to take the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 curve at that time if we compare it 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.880
 with nico rosberg 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.100
 completely straight does not intend 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.540
 to take the curve and probably say 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.360
 that he did not have time to give the curve 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.670
 but we're going in that same career I remember 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.950
 have seen an impressive braking of 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.780
 Kiriaat and still managed to do the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.819
 chicana destroyed the tires but 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.550
 did not arrive rosberg or try to turn 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.069
 it does not happen of braking because to the signal 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.230
 of 150 I had braked and then brake 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.970
 dry before entering the loophole thing 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.030
 I do not understand, that's what I 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.610
 I think now if the weird thing is to see the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.680
 toto wolff face with a smile 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.600
 I know I became the director of a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.640
 team and I see one of my pilots who 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.920
 is leading the race that comes out of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.590
 track and we get a smile just what 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.900
 otherwise it would be serious and good until 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.260
 here the 'fourth millennium' I say the video 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.610
 from today 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.830
 leave in the comments our opinion 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.500
 on the subject the runway exits of 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.390
 rosberg were provoked and I tell you that 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.790
 I'm not saying nothing only 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.530
 I am saying what I think if 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.360
 you liked to like and subscribe 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.360
