all you really need to do is go to your

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.169 
all you really need to do is go to your
ballistic<00:01:01.019> turret<00:01:01.199> scope<00:01:01.589> and<00:01:02.179> disassemble

ballistic turret scope and disassemble
it<00:01:03.269> like<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.600> normally<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.440> were

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it like you normally would if you were

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.930 
it like you normally would if you were
going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> cite<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> bt<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
will pop off and at this point you're

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
will pop off and at this point you're
ready<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.440> mount<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> scope<00:01:14.160> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> rifle

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
ready to mount the scope on the rifle

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.480 
ready to mount the scope on the rifle
and<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.570> cite<00:01:15.870> it<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.680> particular<00:01:17.040> rifle

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and go cite it in this particular rifle

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.650 
and go cite it in this particular rifle
that<00:01:17.550> we're<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:17.940> using<00:01:18.150> today<00:01:18.480> is<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
that we're going to be using today is a

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.870 
that we're going to be using today is a
300<00:01:19.230> Winchester<00:01:19.770> Magnum<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.460> we're<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
300 Winchester Magnum and we're going to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:49.300 
300 Winchester Magnum and we're going to
use<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> 200-yard<00:01:21.990> zero

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.620 

so<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.520> we're<00:01:50.730> sliding<00:01:50.910> at<00:01:51.150> 200<00:01:51.600> yards

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
so now that we're sliding at 200 yards

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.380 
so now that we're sliding at 200 yards
the<00:01:52.200> next<00:01:52.470> step<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.920> process<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.910> lock

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the next step in the process is to lock

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.390 
the next step in the process is to lock
that<00:01:54.810> ballistic<00:01:55.350> turret<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.800> place<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> what

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
that ballistic turret in place and what

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.040 
that ballistic turret in place and what
you<00:01:56.490> want<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.760> do<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.240> take<00:01:57.480> this<00:01:57.600> locking

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
you want to do is just take this locking

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.260 
you want to do is just take this locking
mechanism<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:58.710> set<00:01:59.370> it<00:01:59.490> back<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.760> where<00:02:00.120> your

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
mechanism and set it back to where your

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.360 
mechanism and set it back to where your
zero<00:02:00.540> setting<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.230> and<00:02:01.470> then<00:02:01.950> take<00:02:02.190> your

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
zero setting is and then take your

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.730 
zero setting is and then take your
ballistic<00:02:02.880> coupling<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.510> drop<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.260> back<00:02:04.470> on

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
ballistic coupling and drop it back on

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.130 
ballistic coupling and drop it back on
the<00:02:04.890> bt<00:02:05.280> scope<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.970> will<00:02:06.180> set<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.690> zero

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the bt scope and this will set your zero

everything<00:02:38.010> assembled<00:02:38.670> back<00:02:38.850> together<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
everything assembled back together the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.790 
everything assembled back together the
way<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.690> should<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.170> what<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
way that it should be but what I like to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.250 
way that it should be but what I like to
do<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.220> take<00:02:41.430> one<00:02:41.850> more<00:02:42.090> shot<00:02:42.390> at<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.750> 200

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
do is take one more shot at that 200

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.990 
do is take one more shot at that 200
yards<00:02:43.500> ile<00:02:43.620> just<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.220> make<00:02:44.370> sure<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.790> gun<00:02:44.970> is

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
yards ile just to make sure the gun is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.330 
yards ile just to make sure the gun is
shooting<00:02:45.120> where<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.600> supposed<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:50.190> now

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
shooting where it's supposed to so now

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
shooting where it's supposed to so now
that<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.610> know<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.209> turret<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.660> fully

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that we know the turret is fully

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050 
that we know the turret is fully
assembled<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.650> shooting<00:02:53.100> dead-on<00:02:53.430> at<00:02:53.610> 200

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
assembled and shooting dead-on at 200

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.470 
assembled and shooting dead-on at 200
yards

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
yards

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.000 
yards
the<00:02:54.630> first<00:02:54.900> downrange<00:02:55.470> distance<00:02:55.530> we're<00:02:55.890> going

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the first downrange distance we're going

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.770 
the first downrange distance we're going
to<00:02:56.070> try<00:02:56.220> today<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.549> 300<00:02:57.000> yot<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.269> all<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.540> really

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
to try today is 300 yot so all we really

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.380 
to try today is 300 yot so all we really
need<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.019> do<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.890> our<00:02:59.040> turret<00:02:59.370> adjust<00:03:00.209> it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
need to do is take our turret adjust it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.380 
need to do is take our turret adjust it
to<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.660> 300<00:03:01.230> yards<00:03:01.470> setting<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:03.120> should

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
to that 300 yards setting and it should

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:24.259 
to that 300 yards setting and it should
be<00:03:03.540> right<00:03:03.750> on

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.210 

so<00:03:25.269> now<00:03:25.420> we<00:03:25.480> know<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.870> guns<00:03:26.050> on<00:03:26.260> at<00:03:26.410> 300<00:03:26.890> yards

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
so now we know the guns on at 300 yards

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.830 
so now we know the guns on at 300 yards
the<00:03:27.310> next<00:03:27.670> downrange<00:03:28.150> distance<00:03:28.239> we're<00:03:28.720> going

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
the next downrange distance we're going

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.449 
the next downrange distance we're going
to<00:03:28.900> move<00:03:29.080> we're<00:03:29.230> going<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.410> move<00:03:29.530> right<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.950> 600

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
to move we're going to move right to 600

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.770 
to move we're going to move right to 600
yards<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:30.849> all<00:03:30.970> we<00:03:31.150> need<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.330> do<00:03:31.510> with<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
yards and all we need to do with the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.449 
yards and all we need to do with the
ballistic<00:03:32.170> turret<00:03:32.349> is<00:03:32.560> crank<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.010> up<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.310> that

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
ballistic turret is crank it up to that

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.300 
ballistic turret is crank it up to that
600<00:03:34.300> yards<00:03:34.569> setting<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:35.950> should<00:03:36.160> be

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
600 yards setting and we should be

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:51.399 
600 yards setting and we should be
dead-on<00:03:36.580> at<00:03:36.910> 600<00:03:37.360> yards

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.899 

so<00:03:52.409> in<00:03:52.560> less<00:03:52.799> than<00:03:52.980> an<00:03:53.129> hour<00:03:53.219> we've<00:03:53.549> got<00:03:53.760> this

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
so in less than an hour we've got this

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.089 
so in less than an hour we've got this
gun<00:03:54.150> shooting<00:03:54.569> consistently<00:03:55.290> out<00:03:55.439> to<00:03:55.620> 600

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
gun shooting consistently out to 600

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.709 
gun shooting consistently out to 600
yards<00:03:56.400> we're<00:03:56.549> able<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.909> come<00:03:57.120> set<00:03:57.480> up<00:03:57.599> the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
yards we're able to come set up the

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.110 
yards we're able to come set up the
whole<00:03:57.900> system<00:03:58.200> cite<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.219> in<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.549> zero<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.999> at

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
whole system cite it in and zero it at

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.539 
whole system cite it in and zero it at
200<00:04:00.569> yards<00:04:00.599> shoot<00:04:01.049> consistently<00:04:01.769> at<00:04:01.920> 300<00:04:02.459> and

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
200 yards shoot consistently at 300 and

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.069 
200 yards shoot consistently at 300 and
weigh<00:04:02.760> out<00:04:02.909> to<00:04:03.090> six<00:04:03.329> on<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:03.689> that's<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
weigh out to six on it and that's the

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.750 
weigh out to six on it and that's the
beauty<00:04:04.409> of<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.650> system<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:05.159> put<00:04:05.340> all<00:04:05.519> this

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
beauty of the system to put all this

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.819 
beauty of the system to put all this
equipment<00:04:06.030> together<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:07.079> mesh<00:04:07.349> it<00:04:07.500> into<00:04:07.650> one

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
equipment together and mesh it into one

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.190 
equipment together and mesh it into one
and<00:04:07.950> make<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.340> much<00:04:08.609> simpler<00:04:09.569> way<00:04:09.719> to<00:04:09.780> make

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
and make it a much simpler way to make

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.229 
and make it a much simpler way to make
long<00:04:10.500> distance<00:04:10.950> shots<00:04:11.129> and<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.909> know<00:04:12.030> that's

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
long distance shots and you know that's

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.429 
long distance shots and you know that's
the<00:04:12.359> nice<00:04:12.510> thing<00:04:12.659> for<00:04:12.689> me<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.959> get<00:04:13.169> to<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
the nice thing for me you get to the

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.500 
the nice thing for me you get to the
range<00:04:13.680> you're<00:04:14.099> able<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.370> do<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.120> just

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
range you're able to do this and it just

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.449 
range you're able to do this and it just
it<00:04:15.689> makes<00:04:15.959> your<00:04:16.169> time<00:04:16.440> at<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.919> range<00:04:17.160> much

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
it makes your time at the range much

it makes your time at the range much
more<00:04:17.729> productive<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.359> it's<00:04:18.479> going<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.840> make
