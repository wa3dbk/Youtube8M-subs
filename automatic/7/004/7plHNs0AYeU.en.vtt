00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.750
 in this tutorial I will explain how 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.769
 record single files like those 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.860
 we see here in the video 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.180
 on a dvd disc and that is compatible with 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.490
 the xbox 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.560
 Well the first thing we need is 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.600
 have the game application emulator 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.210
 etcetera in a folder in our 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.660
 computer as you see here we have to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.450
 identify that the default point file 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.420
 xb s must always exist for 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.080
 when we create we will create a dvd disc 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.070
 for xbox good what we have to do 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.070
 is to open the money 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.820
 it has no applications we go to the nero 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.820
 burning rom 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.630
 let's talk 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.760
 here 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.430
 in the left part we're going 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.910
 down 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.910
 and we chose the cd-rom option of f 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.799
 all right 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.710
 in multi session we choose the option without 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.950
 multi session 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.530
 and then we go to the efe tab 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.119
 and activate the box that says activate 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.420
 a compatibility mode with the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.420
 expopular 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.690
 we give new 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 well in the part of the right we enter 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.049
 to the folder where I have we have the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.720
 application game files that 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.350
 we want to record if we select everything 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.950
 and we drag it to the left 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.320
 and ready 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.909
 we are almost done finished what 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.530
 The only thing we have to do is make 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.530
 click on record on the top 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.990
 here the same activate the box 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.740
 finalize disc and we choose the version 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.020
 lower than black allows us 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.690
 this is not completely necessary but 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.080
 if it is more highly recommended so that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.500
 there are problems when it comes to the xbox 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.330
 create the disc and well this is all you 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.330
 we record and we have finished
