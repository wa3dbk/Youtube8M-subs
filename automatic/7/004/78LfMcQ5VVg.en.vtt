00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.980
 U 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.980
 At first I see you outside 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.260
 Give me your clothes and shake it. 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.980
 I promised if I did. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.199
 Oh, I've been helping you innocently. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.890
 It looks a lot nervous. 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.890
 That's the evidence that Woo-suk covered his face with. 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.470
 So finally, let's go to Macau. 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.600
 222 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:46.050
 Oh Well wash fire four he was sitting 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 Hi 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:59.339
 We were facing each other with a separation door but we could not 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.339
 In the meantime , I've exchanged notes over 202 8 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.399
 Now a little way to create not limited to the following steps Let ' 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.830
 Well sit inside two minutes flat even when the inside of the opposite 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.980
 Time of last greetings with Woo Suk Lee 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.980
 I can sleep. Yes. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.150
 U 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.150
 I do not have a bit of Java down 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:38.660
 U 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:42.190
 Still not long laugh instead of saying've never ever gave unprecedented open 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.190
 I'm opening the door. 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.760
 Kid's got even you 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:58.180
 Love letter in the number of weeks that I exchanged for a week 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.180
 Was it our mind that was in it? 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.480
 Product hand shake 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.860
 Oh undertake this rumor Beats rockfall 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.050
 AX 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.160
 I can not get my hands. 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.810
 Yeah . Just hold on a little longer . 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.819
 Never forget this feeling in the future . 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.819
 Gotta it should continue acting so little in society 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.269
 What 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:42.940
 Thank you once more for a handshake than for a white horse. 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:50.160
 People are scared of this and people usually encounter some Woosuk the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.160
 But it is also people who are treating and raising a child . 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.680
 tae woo 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.680
 U 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.069
 won 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.069
 Yes 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.110
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.490
 There 's a terrifying road that just looks at it 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:40.120
 I can not believe it. 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:47.270
 In an accident. 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:51.020
 When you look out the window with a thump, it means that there is a traffic accident. 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.370
 When talking about a fortnight during the holidays while I John 3 gs is the wood box fight 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.130
 I've been. 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.470
 8 am 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.030
 The road in question, which is two days long and has an accident , passes through Pyeongtaek city 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.140
 Route 1 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.140
 A three -way street 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:15.430
 By the way , there is a formula for Hyunsei traffic accident. 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.820
 I mean, it only happens in that place . 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:24.370
 It's a strange thing that keeps me in the same spot. 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.340
 Trucks are now new to the center guard rail, and they continue to hit the vans . 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:33.310
 The car dragons become a yogi wave . 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:38.800
 But there is more mystery than a series of accidents in one place. 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.350
 Maybe cheaper then your total drivers who have so little because of the speed 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.169
 I think it's third game. 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:50.050
 I have a breathing pattern. 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:56.229
 There is a little easier to understand when you say something is red, I is not 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:58.190
 It's not a long way to go about a three-way accident, 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.340
 It is. 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.800
 But the scene is second attachments 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.800
 The grape block is broken and the streetlight
