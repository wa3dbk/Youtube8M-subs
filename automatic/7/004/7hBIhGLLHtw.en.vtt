remote box is to give you a camera a
little<00:00:43.390> more<00:00:43.690> protection<00:00:44.019> when<00:00:44.589> it's<00:00:44.710> outside

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
little more protection when it's outside

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.340 
little more protection when it's outside
in<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.519> field<00:00:45.760> they<00:00:46.479> this<00:00:46.900> one<00:00:47.140> here

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
in the field they this one here

in the field they this one here
constructed<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.070> pelican<00:00:48.460> case<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.879> a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
constructed of a pelican case is a

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.180 
constructed of a pelican case is a
little<00:00:49.210> more<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.449> an<00:00:49.540> expensive<00:00:50.110> version<00:00:50.530> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
little more of an expensive version the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.100 
little more of an expensive version the
reason<00:00:51.489> behind<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.879> is<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.299> leave<00:00:52.659> it<00:00:52.780> out<00:00:52.900> for

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
reason behind that is I leave it out for

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.840 
reason behind that is I leave it out for
quite<00:00:53.199> a<00:00:53.290> long<00:00:53.500> time<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:54.100> that<00:00:54.400> means<00:00:54.519> I<00:00:54.670> want

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
quite a long time and that means I want

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.000 
quite a long time and that means I want
it<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.030> be<00:00:55.119> as<00:00:55.210> waterproof<00:00:55.600> as<00:00:55.900> possible<00:00:56.350> but

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
it to be as waterproof as possible but

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.740 
it to be as waterproof as possible but
before<00:00:57.369> I<00:00:57.400> kind<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.850> had<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.059> funds<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:58.510> build

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
before I kind of had the funds to build

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.240 
before I kind of had the funds to build
one<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.049> these<00:00:59.199> even<00:00:59.680> though<00:00:59.769> it<00:00:59.890> still<00:01:00.040> looks

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
one of these even though it still looks

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.520 
one of these even though it still looks
a<00:01:00.309> little<00:01:00.400> bit<00:01:00.670> rough<00:01:00.909> I<00:01:01.180> made<00:01:01.689> a<00:01:01.930> very<00:01:02.199> similar

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
a little bit rough I made a very similar

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.969 
a little bit rough I made a very similar
thing<00:01:02.830> out<00:01:03.220> of<00:01:03.610> quite<00:01:04.449> simply<00:01:04.869> something<00:01:05.770> like

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
thing out of quite simply something like

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.640 
thing out of quite simply something like
this<00:01:06.189> a<00:01:06.430> Tupperware<00:01:07.180> box<00:01:07.330> now<00:01:08.229> all<00:01:08.470> you<00:01:08.619> have

earlier<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:22.120> all<00:01:22.240> we're<00:01:22.390> gonna<00:01:22.480> do<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.900> take

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
earlier and all we're gonna do is take

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.050 
earlier and all we're gonna do is take
that<00:01:23.290> off<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:24.040> want<00:01:24.220> one<00:01:24.370> with<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.580> removable

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.090 
that off you want one with a removable
lid<00:01:25.510> because<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.800> form<00:01:27.010> the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
lid because this is going to form the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.160 
lid because this is going to form the
base<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.760> where<00:01:28.480> you're<00:01:28.600> going<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.810> push<00:01:28.960> your

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
base of where you're going to push your

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.170 
base of where you're going to push your
camera<00:01:29.500> on<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:30.100> what<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:30.490> do<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:30.760> take<00:01:31.000> that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
camera on and what you do is take that

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.060 
camera on and what you do is take that
top<00:01:31.420> off<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:32.170> we're<00:01:32.290> going<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.440> need<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.710> cut<00:01:32.890> a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
top off and we're going to need to cut a

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.280 
top off and we're going to need to cut a
flap<00:01:33.490> on<00:01:33.730> the<00:01:33.820> front<00:01:34.210> like<00:01:34.750> here<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.110> can<00:01:35.140> see

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
flap on the front like here you can see

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.410 
flap on the front like here you can see
we've<00:01:35.530> already<00:01:35.710> pre<00:01:36.130> soared<00:01:36.460> down<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.120> sides

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
we've already pre soared down the sides

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.760 
we've already pre soared down the sides
with<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.050> hacksaw

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
with a hacksaw

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.750 
with a hacksaw
and<00:01:38.860> then<00:01:39.130> what<00:01:39.250> we're<00:01:39.370> going<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.520> do<00:01:39.640> is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
and then what we're going to do is

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.730 
and then what we're going to do is
merely<00:01:39.970> cut<00:01:40.210> off<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.450> top<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:40.960> use<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.440> as<00:01:41.710> a

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
merely cut off the top and use that as a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.040 
merely cut off the top and use that as a
hood<00:01:42.040> now<00:01:42.880> before<00:01:43.210> we<00:01:43.360> get<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.600> doing<00:01:43.900> that

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
place and settle on there to hold it in

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.660 
place and settle on there to hold it in
position<00:01:57.900> when<00:01:58.900> you<00:01:59.020> clip<00:01:59.620> on<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.890> top<00:02:00.070> now

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
position when you clip on the top now

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.640 
position when you clip on the top now
I've<00:02:00.790> got<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.150> also<00:02:01.330> cut<00:02:01.900> away<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.110> section<00:02:02.560> of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
I've got to also cut away a section of

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.260 
I've got to also cut away a section of
this<00:02:02.740> side<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.370> make<00:02:03.490> sure<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.729> my<00:02:03.850> camera

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
this side to make sure that my camera

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.100 
this side to make sure that my camera
holds<00:02:04.570> flat

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
holds flat

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.590 
holds flat
the<00:02:05.920> reason<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.460> want<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.790> tripod<00:02:07.150> brush<00:02:07.420> is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
the reason you want the tripod brush is

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.300 
the reason you want the tripod brush is
simply<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.289> allows<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.799> position<00:02:09.220> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
simply it allows you to position the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.009 
simply it allows you to position the
camera<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.610> lot<00:02:09.729> easier<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.509> can<00:02:10.629> use<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.869> on<00:02:10.959> a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
camera a lot easier you can use it on a

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.259 
camera a lot easier you can use it on a
tripod<00:02:11.530> or<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.769> tree<00:02:12.040> mail<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.909> this<00:02:13.090> means

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
tripod or a tree mail and this means

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.330 
tripod or a tree mail and this means
that<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.569> makes<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.989> much<00:02:14.110> more<00:02:14.349> versatile<00:02:14.920> so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
that it makes it much more versatile so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.039 
that it makes it much more versatile so
we're<00:02:15.459> going<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> go<00:02:15.790> ahead<00:02:15.909> and<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.659> this<00:02:16.840> for

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
we're going to go ahead and do this for

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.490 
we're going to go ahead and do this for
you<00:02:17.499> and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:17.769> show<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.040> when<00:02:18.219> we're<00:02:18.400> done

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.230 

so<00:02:21.500> as<00:02:21.860> we<00:02:22.040> talked<00:02:22.250> about<00:02:22.400> we've<00:02:22.730> cut<00:02:22.970> out<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
so as we talked about we've cut out the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.970 
so as we talked about we've cut out the
front<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.230> we've<00:02:24.470> used<00:02:24.740> that

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
front like this and we've used that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.400 
front like this and we've used that
section<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.520> make<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.790> makeshift<00:02:26.420> hood<00:02:26.810> on<00:02:27.110> top

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
section to make a makeshift hood on top

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.680 
section to make a makeshift hood on top
just<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.130> protect<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> camera<00:02:28.850> from<00:02:29.030> any<00:02:29.270> kind

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
just to protect the camera from any kind

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.260 
just to protect the camera from any kind
of<00:02:29.810> water<00:02:30.410> falling<00:02:30.800> directly<00:02:31.070> down<00:02:31.790> onto<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
of water falling directly down onto the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.910 
of water falling directly down onto the
lens<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:33.020> make<00:02:33.170> sure<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.620> don't<00:02:33.830> get

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
lens just to make sure that we don't get

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.860 
lens just to make sure that we don't get
any<00:02:33.980> splatters<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.730> could<00:02:34.880> mist<00:02:35.150> up<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:35.510> ruin
