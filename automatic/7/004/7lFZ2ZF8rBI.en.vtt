00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.040
 and now we are going to follow the together 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.940
 formal couple and caterina muscas 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.940
 day 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.950
 they represent russia though 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.060
 jonathan was born in sydney in australia e 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.430
 they come from precedents 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.570
 we certainly remember collaborations 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.960
 day that renault with ekaterina 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.349
 we had already seen riazanova 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.660
 compete while their real gene 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 only since May 2009 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.080
 behind them 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.080
 nikolai morozov following them 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.640
 62 salemi 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.960
 no come on 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.960
 6 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.210
 Hello 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.430
 and the test a little particular considering that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.720
 is trying some solutions a little 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.940
 funny details for his 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.129
 skaters this couple that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.769
 we remember competing together since 2009 and 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.650
 then he had marked a mood because of it 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.349
 beard two games in the united states must 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.799
 train and founded by limit and now if 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.810
 not then with the maharaja profession 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.510
 definitely a very nice couple 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.209
 because I have to remember that unfortunately for 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.400
 luck also the aesthetic part of a 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.810
 couple does a lot especially for 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.579
 what concerns the loop are beautiful 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.889
 to see on the track they fill a lot 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.290
 their movements are therefore very long 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.500
 they are very high, these are factors 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.160
 that you must necessarily keep in 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.520
 consideration is certain music music 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.780
 it precedes me as much as you think it is 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.940
 who sits in the dance that is the 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.260
 for men and women, however, seen 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.600
 which is a musical choice that is a bit 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.550
 undermining all the various categories e 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.260
 on a technical level I had some 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.120
 suspect here is constituted 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.289
 regards telecom and continues to 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.729
 unbalancing expect I did not think in the 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.830
 home of to his concern here when 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.210
 you see that going unbalanced you see that 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.250
 lose your balance 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.690
 then especially in the last tweezer that 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.880
 is one of the musicals from level a 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.039
 just stopped the rotation so 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.560
 theoretically from the technical panel not 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.090
 should be taken into consideration 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.039
 I say theoretically why rightly 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.020
 live the impression completely 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.360
 different is lifting 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.610
 look at how she holds the position and 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.479
 ring latelli we should be the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.910
 as close as possible to me 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.030
 personally it's not enough because the 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.740
 accepted distance should be the 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.180
 half of a blade in this case second 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.450
 it could have been a little too wide 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.370
 always here is at discretion 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.960
 of all this we will now see for summer 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.449
 minutes saw that 70 percent 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.039
 they are an important test for them 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.110
 also to see if the choice of exchange 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.060
 coach made right at the beginning 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.120
 summer is passing by natalia 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.160
 linichuk in pensilvania to nicolai mordor 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.740
 which in any case is also based in the 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:07.190
 united states ad hiv is surely served 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.169
 have the only room as companions of 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.300
 workout and then big stimulus 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.770
 have already met for crystal purposes 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.030
 that I had to Rome they did a second one 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.910
 position 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.170
 then 24 and 28 the worst technician 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:25.030
 so far her clients 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:27.340
 60 and wine deduction 49 28 because you do 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.160
 so why then what I saw e 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.140
 it is represented that it is always right 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.780
 difficult even from home try to give 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.280
 a judgment however believe that the score 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.660
 especially the technical one gives me reason 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.320
 so I expect that we have seen 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.060
 together the least one can be for the 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.860
 lifting that lasted a little too long 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.970
 let us remember that the uprisings in this 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.250
 question and above all for 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.680
 represent in short programs not 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.680
 may exceed 6 seconds
