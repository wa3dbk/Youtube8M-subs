00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.950
 hello I bring you today a video for 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.590
 show you the cap 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.269
 I've used it two or three times and already more or 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.070
 minus the trasteado and I'm going to those who 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.000
 you just received there are doubts that I 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.029
 I've also asked you bring this hoop 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.279
 and bring the lid because you see this ring is 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.279
 as a UFO this edge of here 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.780
 so this edge is going down 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.400
 and then we will put the lid to the oven 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:43.300
 here the doubt that there is that it dances 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.790
 I hear in many groups that 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.540
 they ask is that I do not fit is normal 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.420
 Well yes it is normal but that edge does not come out 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.430
 do not let it come out okay so let's go 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.670
 I'm doing something with the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.670
 mobile 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.990
 above all, plug what happens to us as 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.880
 to me that the first day I got scared and I thought 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.640
 that did not work and of course it is not 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.790
 I had done 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.940
 - another when I bring you a recipe in 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.650
 the times that will expose put today to 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.460
 oven in an oven for example and 20 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.970
 minutes 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 and it's for oven 25 because you have to 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.740
 do at once in this case I'm going to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.270
 make shorter because for you to see it 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.090
 well for example we will put oven 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.079
 and the recipe 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.810
 For example recipe says 15 minutes 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:47.780
 15 minutes is already underway and the cap 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.670
 it indicates 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.670
 to see if it looks good I will give the light 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.650
 the lid or is indicated 10 15 minutes then 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.550
 you put 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.550
 15 minutes 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.430
 and the degrees this I already have it so good 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:13.090
 well for example the degrees at 200 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.090
 it's worth 15 minutes to 200 and then you go down 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 and then it is when it gets going 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.610
 It's worth when they finish these fifteen minutes 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.250
 well here I've also seen it 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.980
 if I have put it 15 minutes then 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.820
 suppose here they go 20 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.140
 well here they finish at 15 then nothing 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.300
 for that and let the lid finish the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.570
 5 that you have left is exposed in those 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.600
 times is like that then the good thing that has 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:47.300
 is that as you can see 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.569
 you can control the food 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.329
 when you want, you will 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.530
 you can open it back to take a 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:00.400
 look and as for low is the stage 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.400
 is already underway 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.210
 Nothing, I just wanted to show you those 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.610
 for which you have the first doubts 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.890
 which are like the ones I've had because 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.620
 I have not given much use alone either 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.810
 he has used three times 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 but that is great 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.959
 and it was to clarify that about everything 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.380
 of the ring that does not have to be fixed 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.030
 but it does not come out you do not know with the weight 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.550
 from the top 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.550
 and that's scary 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:45.440
 direct also goes but I'm more than 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.630
 I have more confidence to talk to her 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.600
 down 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.600
 put here do not be afraid do not fall 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.810
 it's down it starts up it 's 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.290
 up for and especially when the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.090
 let it stop being such a place not the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.500
 you will put on top of the rag because that 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.230
 right now it 's burning it would stay 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.990
 stuck and on a marble and nothing in one place 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.970
 so in metallic trivet and it's already 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.970
 Well, I do not expect anything that I have 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.270
 liked this video and until next time 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.270
 friends
