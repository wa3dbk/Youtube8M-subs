00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
smells fantastic so we want to go ahead

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
smells fantastic so we want to go ahead

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and get this mixed up at in a little bit

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
and get this mixed up at in a little bit
more<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.500> everything<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.040> covered<00:01:38.310> really

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729

well<00:01:38.909> no<00:01:39.600> sense<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.960> somebody<00:01:40.320> getting<00:01:40.560> all

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
well no sense in somebody getting all

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.170 
well no sense in somebody getting all
the<00:01:40.829> flavor<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> raw

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the flavor and then you just got a raw

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.760 
the flavor and then you just got a raw
chicken<00:01:42.689> piece<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.049> nothing<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.590> there

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
chicken piece with nothing up in there

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
chicken piece with nothing up in there

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so that's not going to work out good now

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510
