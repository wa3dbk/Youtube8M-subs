 Here's one thing that every young like 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.810
 huh 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:18.599
 most at least demoted cars 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:21.820
 this is a threaded telescope and I 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.519
 I do not even want to talk so much about what's 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.699
 Good to ride in a lowered car is cool if 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:32.320
 put in the wheel there is in the big garden 15 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:35.680
 16 17 nowadays much ball 18 19 20 and 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.380
 30 and 22 and 24 in six trucks made 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.090
 with 24 and 26 have enough wheel today to 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.920
 majority of staff places big wheel 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.140
 have to give that download to stay 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.300
 with that sporting spirit and such I 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.950
 I wanted you to pay attention to a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.730
 You drive there in the workshop there the guy. 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.100
 specializes in lowered suspension 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.250
 brass beauty 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.679
 I change this here already in the range of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:09.189
 about 18 years old there more 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:11.560
 or less trash that I have already moved with much 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:16.390
 Suspension suspension does not require 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.850
 prepared and I'm here today. 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.439
 in the region that I have until service there 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.060
 I 'm looking to get it - that's a 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.020
 thing that sometimes takes time beyond 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.119
 And, and you have to have lots of hands. 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.840
 of specialized work would be to click here 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.389
 who came in several years to itown tinker 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.090
 in silver with the effect of noisy 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:38.770
 integrate for student takes linen a wheel 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.719
 very large and rebounded into the mud 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.240
 tried to avoid this kind of service until 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.090
 for my time without understanding I did 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.340
 for many years without paying 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.639
 Note that all these all 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.539
 Adaptations get out of the car 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.109
 there are some dangers also 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.119
 Danger 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.170
 here you can see that there is a 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.920
 weld 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.399
 we were cut off from the low tower she takes off and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.220
 approximately six centimeters there seven 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.870
 centimeters puts the line back and does 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.319
 I soldered and I've always soldered them. 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.250
 big tig even by finishing such for 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.909
 ford 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.790
 I already got a lot of fucking finding tower. 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.209
 that staff welds and leaves faults in the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.730
 weak soldering welding that happens 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.099
 depending on where the probe is made 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.269
 It's not that much trouble just done here. 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.780
 There are cracks on the terminal but here 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.060
 can extract salt car can still 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.810
 to suffer damage but can still do 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.090
 do the selma jumps to where the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.970
 Most of the people nowadays 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.209
 probe that happens to the wheel is silly 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.640
 serve here the terminal but here in the wheel 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.250
 on the shaft sleeve on the hub here it goes 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.829
 rotate in false 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.950
 so whenever you are going to do this type 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:08.730
 and adaptation in your car that in the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.989
 truth is an adaptation in your car and 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.290
 do the relegation 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.269
 both for rice prepared caar lend 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.720
 attention to the professional who 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.819
 raises and extended to the workshop and I 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.579
 I always say that not in the workshop. 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.760
 pro first employee 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.379
 We're going to work hard every time. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.129
 pay attention to what you are doing 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.590
 because office just like hospital only office 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.099
 and race will need a hospital would be 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.750
 I 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.810
 the mechanic the doctor is over or 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.569
 less heat if we blow l is here 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.730
 use the doctor there so I always pt 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.349
 spoke to pay attention of always torque 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.069
 Screw tightening for a wine

 piquet braz screwing year is that when 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.599
 It was only made to make it 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.940
 Solder is a guy with a 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.310
 Over 40 years I am a very 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.980
 specialized in welding 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.329
 I never had a problem, it was always low 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.879
 pay attention to who is taking 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.840
