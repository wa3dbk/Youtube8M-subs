00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.960
 and 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.300
 very good friends of paul musician and c's 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.100
 Here we are again in our store 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.840
 de san sebastiÃ¡n de los reyes this time 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.630
 let's talk about one of the last 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.660
 guitars that has come to our 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.940
 exhibition and who is looking for owner to 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.750
 People love telecaster custom efe 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.410
 mt 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.480
 hh it's a guitar of the saga 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.030
 fender japan but with some qualities 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.830
 impressive performance for not 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.650
 be American as they are not usually the 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.720
 famous people to start talking about 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.460
 this guitar tells us that we have 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.559
 two pills without duncan in the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.420
 mast we carry a symbolic extend 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.940
 black cannon and here we take a fender 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.320
 atomic ready to give a lot of cane 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.720
 a lot of definition and a lot of wax 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.870
 it's a guitar that despite being 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.840
 telecaster is mahogany all 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.340
 mahogany guitars the mast also yes 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.540
 you notice it is not screwed with the plate 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.400
 of four screws that usually carry 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.610
 but it is attached to the greater mast 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.190
 comfort in the hand 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.170
 and the flamed maple stage what does 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.420
 is this method so unique and so 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.159
 beautiful 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.990
 the ropes as there are care before 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.580
 all go through the body what we 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.350
 will ensure greater strength more 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600
 definition and that all the vibration is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 deal for the guitar 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.619
 providing us with a great sound 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.619
 the story is a fixed bridge without mushrooms 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.650
 with a metallic silver finish 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.300
 dark equally very clear 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 that has difference with other 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.770
 telecaster no longer just the two pills 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.870
 about the hamburger to the elector as 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.900
 they carry all the telecasters where 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.400
 volume but the tone button is a 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.870
 pulse in pure we can also 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.260
 transform our double entry into 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.960
 simple and we take it out and double it when 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.880
 we press inwards he will give us the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.120
 have the sound of the classic telecaster 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.770
 if we have the simple pills and if 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.430
 we press and turn them into doubles 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 we are going to have a bit more claw and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.340
 reed our sound is worth a guitar 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.930
 super comfortable with the cut and totally 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.450
 perfect for us to finish the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.520
 body we are comfortable touching the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.740
 fingerboard is of rosewood vale is a 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.200
 little darker than the pink stick 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.390
 super comfortable to play super fast and 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.520
 all inlays are made of 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.110
 mother but leaves bigger for 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.840
 greater view of where 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.000
 we position our 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.670
 and in the finish, as you see it very 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 brilliant super polished and the truth that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.550
 how a guitar is beautiful in 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.950
 how much sound is the same 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.600
 the clean one that it has is the traditional 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.740
 the telecaster as I said before when 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.740
 we are in simple games 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.660
 clean with much shine much body 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.310
 ah 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.620
 the mastery of the bridge if we go to the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.100
 neck pickup will only be a 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.100
 little more serious 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.720
 in which the note stays a long time 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.760
 now what happens when we press the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.760
 blue course here we have a normal sun 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.800
 in clean happened to have more body more 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.970
 forcefulness and we will pass it with the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.770
 distortion here we would have a 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.480
 distortion with a tad less volume 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.140
 and less body 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.140
 how would it be 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.959
 Y 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.930
 of this little guitar more than saying yes 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.599
 you are looking for a versatile guitar with a 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.880
 good sound that has a lot of cane but 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.880
 that conserves is the classic to defend with 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.370
 a tad of modernity is undoubtedly 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.760
 your guitar if you want to come to 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.760
 try it
