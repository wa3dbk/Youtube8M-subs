00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
have a bunch of different ones of these

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.020 
have a bunch of different ones of these
coffee<00:02:20.850> stir<00:02:21.239> sticks<00:02:21.570> okay<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:23.549> other<00:02:23.670> ones<00:02:23.880> i

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030

have out in the shed are actually longer

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.000 
have out in the shed are actually longer
than<00:02:25.980> these<00:02:26.370> okay<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:28.230> they're<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> little<00:02:28.590> bit

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
than these okay but they're a little bit

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.289 
than these okay but they're a little bit
fatter<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.739> thought<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.799> could<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.400> know<00:02:32.430> use

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
fatter so I thought I could you know use

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.880 
fatter so I thought I could you know use
those<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.019> have<00:02:34.290> some<00:02:34.410> other<00:02:34.620> ones

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
those and then I have some other ones

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.349 
those and then I have some other ones
that<00:02:35.130> came<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.549> yellow<00:02:35.850> box<00:02:36.350> me<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.560> those

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
that came in a yellow box me see those

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.849 
that came in a yellow box me see those
they're<00:02:39.359> a<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.690> bit<00:02:39.959> smaller<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.650> little

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
they're a little bit smaller a little

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.150 
they're a little bit smaller a little
bit<00:02:41.280> narrower<00:02:41.760> yet<00:02:42.540> okay<00:02:43.079> so<00:02:43.170> there's<00:02:43.500> various

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
bit narrower yet okay so there's various

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.830 
bit narrower yet okay so there's various
different<00:02:44.459> sizes<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:44.880> those<00:02:45.090> things<00:02:45.269> okay<00:02:45.660> so

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
different sizes of those things okay so

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.620 
different sizes of those things okay so
whichever<00:02:46.500> ones<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.859> find<00:02:47.209> make<00:02:48.209> sure<00:02:48.239> you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
whichever ones you find make sure you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.170 
whichever ones you find make sure you
kind<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> rough<00:02:49.980> calculation<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.970> that

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
kind of do a rough calculation so that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.690 
kind of do a rough calculation so that
you<00:02:51.930> know<00:02:51.989> because<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.230> want<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.579> know

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
you know because you want the you know

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
you know because you want the you know
to<00:02:53.760> look<00:02:54.030> right<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.019> join<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
to look right a you know you join on the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.680 
to look right a you know you join on the
beams<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:56.130> not<00:02:56.340> half<00:02:56.579> way<00:02:56.790> through<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.420> think

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
beams a not half way through to think

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.770 
beams a not half way through to think
also<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.769> join<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.430> beams<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.420> this

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
also you join on the beams and in this

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.289 
also you join on the beams and in this
case<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.350> couldn't<00:03:01.470> find<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.130> board<00:03:02.459> long<00:03:02.970> enough

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
case I couldn't find a board long enough

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.289 
case I couldn't find a board long enough
ok<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.010> I'm<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.609> to<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.819> modify<00:03:06.150> this

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
ok so I'm going to have to modify this

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.970 
ok so I'm going to have to modify this
all<00:03:06.660> cut<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:07.019> these<00:03:07.140> other<00:03:07.319> ones<00:03:07.530> back<00:03:07.769> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
all cut all these other ones back to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.880 
all cut all these other ones back to
match<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.459> one<00:03:08.910> guy<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.750> then<00:03:10.680> I'll

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
match this one guy here and then I'll

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.270 
match this one guy here and then I'll
just<00:03:10.920> put<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.400> sort<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.590> final<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.709> sill<00:03:14.070> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
just put in sort of a final a sill a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.250 
just put in sort of a final a sill a
door<00:03:14.549> jamb<00:03:14.579> in<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.359> sense

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
door jamb in a sense
