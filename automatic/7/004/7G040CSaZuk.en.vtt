target this peaks at 55 pounds and we're

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.169 
target this peaks at 55 pounds and we're
going<00:01:38.069> to<00:01:38.100> see<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.399> one's<00:01:38.549> easiest<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.030> draw

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
going to see which one's easiest to draw

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.859 
going to see which one's easiest to draw
out<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.080> this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.100> how<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.280> apply<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:41.720> it's<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
out so this is how you apply it it's a

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.630 
out so this is how you apply it it's a
similar<00:01:43.560> construction<00:01:43.950> I've<00:01:44.369> heard<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
similar construction I've heard it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480 
similar construction I've heard it
enlightening<00:01:45.209> to<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.810> bingo<00:01:46.409> pen<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.250> yeah<00:01:47.429> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
enlightening to a bingo pen so yeah you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910 
enlightening to a bingo pen so yeah you
just<00:01:47.719> push<00:01:48.719> it<00:01:48.750> down<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.350> started<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
just push it down get it started and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.840 
just push it down get it started and
then<00:01:50.490> rub<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.729> over<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.350> end<00:01:52.549> portion<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.759> your

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
then rub it over the end portion of your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
then rub it over the end portion of your
arrow<00:01:54.210> chef's<00:01:54.539> they're<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> first<00:01:55.890> 5

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
arrow chef's they're not the first 5

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.709 
arrow chef's they're not the first 5
cent<00:01:56.399> 5<00:01:56.579> 10<00:01:56.789> centimetres<00:01:57.329> something<00:01:57.600> like

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
cent 5 10 centimetres something like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.359 
cent 5 10 centimetres something like
that<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.140> need<00:01:58.259> too<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.280> yeah

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that you don't need too much but yeah

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.709 
that you don't need too much but yeah
once<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.759> coated<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.270> find<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
once that's coated you'll find that that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.359 
once that's coated you'll find that that
comes<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.109> the<00:02:01.229> target<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.770> easier<00:02:02.100> than

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
comes out the target a lot easier than

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.240 
comes out the target a lot easier than
an<00:02:02.520> arrow<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.909> isn't<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.899> yeah<00:02:04.799> let's<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
an arrow that isn't so yeah let's go and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
an arrow that isn't so yeah let's go and
have<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> little<00:02:05.490> shoot<00:02:05.789> with<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.799> yeah

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
have a little shoot with that and yeah

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.039 
have a little shoot with that and yeah
see<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.340> one's<00:02:08.519> easiest<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.880> pull<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.149> mm

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
see which one's easiest to pull out mm

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:16.740 
see which one's easiest to pull out mm
so<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.829> is<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.130> lubricated<00:02:11.850> shaft

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.040 

and<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.250> unlubricated<00:02:19.760> chat

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.360 

okay<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.110> here<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:27.440> have<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.740> two<00:02:27.890> arrows<00:02:28.190> that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
okay so here we have the two arrows that

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.000 
okay so here we have the two arrows that
we<00:02:28.460> shot<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.180> has<00:02:29.420> been<00:02:29.630> lubricated

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
we shot this one has been lubricated

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.320 
we shot this one has been lubricated
this<00:02:31.010> one<00:02:31.190> hasn't<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.820> let's<00:02:31.970> pull<00:02:32.150> them<00:02:32.210> out

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
this one hasn't so let's pull them out

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.260 
this one hasn't so let's pull them out
and<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:32.630> which<00:02:32.750> one's<00:02:32.930> easiest<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.350> retrieve

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
and see which one's easiest to retrieve

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.300 
and see which one's easiest to retrieve
okay<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.870> one<00:02:36.020> came<00:02:36.230> out<00:02:36.380> relatively<00:02:37.040> easily

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.940 

it's<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.900> there's<00:02:41.900> not<00:02:41.990> any<00:02:42.140> residue<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.860> or

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
it's a there's not any residue on it or

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.160 
it's a there's not any residue on it or
anything<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.250> came<00:02:44.030> out<00:02:44.150> quite<00:02:44.360> nice<00:02:44.570> these

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
anything that came out quite nice these

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.080 
anything that came out quite nice these
are<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.350> nightmare<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:46.340> pull<00:02:46.610> arrows<00:02:46.880> out<00:02:47.060> of

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
are a nightmare to pull arrows out of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.820 
are a nightmare to pull arrows out of
but<00:02:47.450> let's<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.990> give<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.290> one<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.500> go<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
but let's just give this one I go the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.310 
but let's just give this one I go the
unlubricated<00:02:49.690> all<00:02:50.690> right<00:02:51.070> gosh<00:02:52.960> it's<00:02:53.960> comment

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320

oh yeah so that is the difference

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.660 
oh yeah so that is the difference
between<00:03:00.100> lubricated<00:03:01.100> arrows<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
between lubricated arrows and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.080 
between lubricated arrows and
unlubricated<00:03:02.330> arrows<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.820> hope<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:04.940> found
