you just step is here ok the important
thing<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.310> realize<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:18.300> is<00:01:18.510> counting

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
thing to realize is this is counting

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.399 
thing to realize is this is counting
however<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.680> sucked<00:01:20.010> back<00:01:20.280> help<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
however much I sucked back help it is

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.940 
however much I sucked back help it is
here<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> doesn't<00:01:26.450> disaster<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:28.290> hardly<00:01:28.800> helps

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
here it doesn't disaster it hardly helps

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
here it doesn't disaster it hardly helps
the<00:01:29.220> point<00:01:29.520> where<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.060> richmond<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the point where you in richmond and so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.340 
the point where you in richmond and so
is<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.760> 20<00:01:33.300> something<00:01:33.630> back<00:01:34.050> something

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
is it just a 20 something back something

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.430 
is it just a 20 something back something
back<00:01:35.130> an<00:01:35.310> important<00:01:35.940> but<00:01:36.210> when<00:01:36.360> camping<00:01:36.870> down

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
back an important but when camping down

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.430 
back an important but when camping down
here<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.070> i<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.370> to<00:01:38.490> try<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> add<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.350> do

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
here so i want to try to add it to do

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.300 
here so i want to try to add it to do
that<00:01:41.060> from<00:01:42.060> doing<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> instead<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that from doing that instead of that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.880 
that from doing that instead of that
that<00:01:45.210> people<00:01:45.930> name<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.260> not<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:46.680> he

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that people name is not so he

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
that people name is not so he
but<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.490> won't<00:01:47.790> leave<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
but I won't leave they are now the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.060 
but I won't leave they are now the
second<00:01:49.650> you<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.100> no<00:01:50.250> answer<00:01:50.790> step<00:01:51.360> by

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
second you so you get no answer step by

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.480 
second you so you get no answer step by
step<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.440> be<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.740> space<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
step so this can be more space for the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.700 
step so this can be more space for the
if<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.360> too<00:01:57.570> much<00:01:57.750> space<00:01:58.020> tracking<00:01:58.380> as

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
if you get too much space tracking as

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
if you get too much space tracking as
much<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.190> as<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.940> write<00:02:00.210> these

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
much time as you are to write these

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
much time as you are to write these
right<00:02:00.690> here<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.140> coming<00:02:04.440> in<00:02:04.560> first<00:02:05.100> step

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
right here so it's coming in first step

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.070 
right here so it's coming in first step
I<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.759> did<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:07.009> first<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.490> did<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
I just did this first up I just did this

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.370 
I just did this first up I just did this
second<00:02:10.080> step<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:10.590> side<00:02:11.070> into<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:12.170> third<00:02:13.170> i

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
second step on my side into this third i

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.920 
second step on my side into this third i
give<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.709> event<00:02:14.130> aside<00:02:15.410> okay<00:02:16.410> what<00:02:17.100> happened

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
give this event aside okay what happened

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.449 
give this event aside okay what happened
this<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.760> had<00:02:20.760> set<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.420> here<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:23.250> show

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
this one here had set up here to show

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.070 
this one here had set up here to show

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
one just go back segment that mankind or

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.880 
one just go back segment that mankind or
tomorrow<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:33.120> what<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.630> back<00:02:33.890> some

tomorrow that's what is your back some
in<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.130> bit<00:02:35.310> well<00:02:35.720> that's<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:36.989> going<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.470> side

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
in a bit well that's one going to side

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.440 
in a bit well that's one going to side
back<00:02:38.570> that's<00:02:39.570> why<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:39.930> back<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.470> insight

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
back that's why go back on that insight
