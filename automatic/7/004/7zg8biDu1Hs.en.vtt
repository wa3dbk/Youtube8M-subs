00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
have all of it he was clearly very

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.220 
have all of it he was clearly very
intelligent<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.120> he<00:03:22.180> recognized<00:03:22.840> very

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
intelligent and he recognized very

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.860 
intelligent and he recognized very
quickly<00:03:23.379> that<00:03:23.920> his<00:03:24.160> life<00:03:24.849> could<00:03:25.450> be<00:03:25.599> snatched

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
quickly that his life could be snatched

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.250 
quickly that his life could be snatched
away<00:03:26.049> from<00:03:26.140> him<00:03:26.379> on<00:03:26.590> any<00:03:27.280> given<00:03:27.579> day<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:28.989> I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
away from him on any given day and so I

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.259 
away from him on any given day and so I
think<00:03:29.950> he<00:03:30.129> felt<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.730> strongest<00:03:30.970> thing

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
think he felt like the strongest thing

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.390 
think he felt like the strongest thing
he<00:03:31.390> could<00:03:31.540> do<00:03:31.659> was<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.959> stay<00:03:32.170> alive<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.799> that

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
he could do was to stay alive and that

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.309 
he could do was to stay alive and that
if<00:03:33.489> he<00:03:33.579> stayed<00:03:33.790> alive<00:03:33.909> long<00:03:34.299> enough<00:03:34.329> perhaps

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
if he stayed alive long enough perhaps

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.750 
if he stayed alive long enough perhaps
he<00:03:35.859> would<00:03:36.129> find<00:03:36.700> his<00:03:36.909> way<00:03:37.090> out<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:39.129> I<00:03:39.220> realized

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
he would find his way out so I realized

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.280 
he would find his way out so I realized
that<00:03:39.909> you<00:03:40.180> know<00:03:40.299> there's<00:03:40.599> a<00:03:40.659> possibility<00:03:40.870> of
