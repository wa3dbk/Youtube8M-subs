 love of life but the passing of time 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.310
 beautiful was irritating me in a way 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.210
 a way people are impossible I do not know 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.790

 nostalgic book let's talk about you from the self 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.420
 I will not tell the story but I think 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.360
 that is out of focus but do not go by 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.759
 moment I read this book I read in 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.700

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.739
 2011 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.110
 This book then looks very sweetheart. 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.410
 has even dedication 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.720
 let's see why I have two and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.030
 did not have one will understand 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.330
 Five books that scared me. 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.209
 talk about the beloved beloved tava not know not 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.799
 I can not pronounce people nor try to 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.599
 freedom to teach and within the 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.030
 book how it is pronounced until today 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.349
 I did not learn but the following book 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.260
 to fit in almost every 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.930
 if you know why this book 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.120
 also irritated me because it scared me and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.049
 I get tense 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.010
 this book he is very dark extreme 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.560
 insists one thousand he talks about death 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.440
 personified and it is a very 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.959
 very exotic exotic just reading to have 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.090
 A notion of them people wrote a 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.220
 strange but I'm already wanting two 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.829
 because it has continuation 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.040
 and there is the first chapter here and there 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.470
 stay in that will I want to see if 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.620
 I buy but this is the book that moves 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.709
 well scared by history and by 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.319
 context it has very strong scenes 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.290
 anyway and finally this book 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.880
 I remember you left me surprised when he 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.680
 surprised me was the guide of the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.709
 backpacker of galaxies and that volume 1 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.780
 that surprised me I did not expect everything 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.480
 that the book is at least what 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.880
 meant to me is what we people 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.530
 I called the devil I thought I was going to stay 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.709
 in the meantime I thought I was not going 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.400
 I really like this book, it does not end like this. 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.239
 is not particularly inviting, it is not 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 but, I liked 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.790
 I loved it so it was a surprise yes me 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.980
 surprised the book that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.829
 disappointed I'm going to talk about romeu and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.169

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.099
 really like julieta 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.810
 I did not even expect much more than just 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:23.490
 try had seen the film knows 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.340
 story but tour is something else ne 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.229

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.970
 is not shakespeare original said 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.849
