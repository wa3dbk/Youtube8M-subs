00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.980
 here it has not happened to you that you are running 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.980
 in your track and you break things 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.630
 see if what you see is that the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.630
 crown 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.170
 if indeed the program has been broken 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.590
 we will need a screwdriver to 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 remove the screws from the body 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.440
 allen keys for crown and guillÃ©n 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.110
 these 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.180
 oil to oil the crown of the pinion 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.770
 an insertion stator of pinions for 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.040
 remove the old pinion and put it one 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.040
 new 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.470
 a pinion of nine a crown of 26 or 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.000
 we have decided for this one 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.090
 the first step is to dismantle the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.310
 body with the screwdriver the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.050
 Second step is to disassemble a tire from 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.850
 right to the left is indifferent and 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.090
 extract the shaft from that loose cndh or the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 crown 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.350
 in the third step here we have the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.620
 fastening the motor with the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.620
 screwdriver 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.640
 in the fourth step we will remove the engine from 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.620
 the engine mounts and we extract the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.620
 pinion gears extractor 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.549
 once put the pinion inside the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.830
 motor and motor suction we're going to 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.290
 introduce the axle and the tires and the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.660
 pinion 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.900
 well we will place the crown inside the 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.910
 position that touches and we will place the axis 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.980
 inside this by screwing the the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.810
 choke on the pinion and 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.330
 we put the other tire what we have 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.130
 What to do is put the two tires and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.530
 the the crown then dance then we can 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.560
 adjust the tires to the point 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.420
 wider center more narrow and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.610
 when we are satisfied we press the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.740
 pinion and we already have the transmission made 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.800
 Once done we can place the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.800
 body with screws and running 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 good people on my part nothing else I hope 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.760
