Beethoven's<00:00:18.119> Pastoral<00:00:18.330> Symphony<00:00:19.699> followed<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony followed a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.769 
Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony followed a
period<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.390> Europe<00:00:21.840> where<00:00:22.170> there<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
period in Europe where there was the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.720 
period in Europe where there was the
thought<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:25.199> might<00:00:25.230> actually<00:00:25.619> return<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
thought that we might actually return to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.570 
thought that we might actually return to
the<00:00:27.240> sources<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.289> could<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:28.830> back<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the sources that we could go back to the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.900 
the sources that we could go back to the
rural<00:00:30.449> cultures<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:31.769> many<00:00:32.489> cities

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
rural cultures from which many cities

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.010 
rural cultures from which many cities
had<00:00:33.120> grown<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.840> find<00:00:35.780> find<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> ultimate

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
had grown up and find find the ultimate

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.850 
had grown up and find find the ultimate
truths<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.010> Beethoven<00:00:39.020> goes<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.440> sense

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
truths and Beethoven goes to this sense

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.280 
truths and Beethoven goes to this sense
of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.730> pastoral<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.450> how<00:00:42.570> wonderful<00:00:42.899> this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of the pastoral and how wonderful this

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.369 
of the pastoral and how wonderful this
is<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.430> vocation<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
is in a vocation which was one of the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.819 
is in a vocation which was one of the
first<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.239> symphonic<00:00:48.239> music<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
first in symphonic music that that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
first in symphonic music that that
really<00:00:50.070> paints<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.449> kind<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.809> picture<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
really paints the kind of picture of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.979 
really paints the kind of picture of
where<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.360> hear<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:57.570> moment
