right to bring back the big old boy what

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.610 
right to bring back the big old boy what
do<00:03:24.909> you<00:03:24.939> think<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.329> what's<00:03:26.079> good<00:03:26.260> yeah

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
do you think of that what's good yeah

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.949 
do you think of that what's good yeah
prices<00:03:27.579> they'll<00:03:28.090> probably<00:03:28.120> hang<00:03:28.599> out<00:03:28.750> with

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
prices they'll probably hang out with

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.500 
prices they'll probably hang out with
the<00:03:29.049> audi<00:03:29.169> a8<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.950> 70<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.489> 80<00:03:30.609> grand<00:03:31.030> range

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the audi a8 in the 70 to 80 grand range

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.420 
the audi a8 in the 70 to 80 grand range
so<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.260> could<00:03:32.379> assume<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:33.010> will<00:03:33.069> probably

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
so you could assume it will probably

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.000 
so you could assume it will probably
come<00:03:33.639> with<00:03:33.819> some<00:03:34.049> special<00:03:35.049> features<00:03:35.169> I<00:03:35.560> don't

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
come with some special features I don't

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.349 
come with some special features I don't
know<00:03:36.099> though<00:03:36.280> if<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.519> ask<00:03:36.549> me<00:03:36.849> judging<00:03:37.180> by

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
know though if you ask me judging by

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.030 
know though if you ask me judging by
this<00:03:37.419> rendering<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.260> just<00:03:38.680> looks<00:03:38.859> like<00:03:38.950> a
