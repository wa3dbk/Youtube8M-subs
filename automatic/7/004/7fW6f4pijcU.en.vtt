I<00:01:53.110> think<00:01:54.110> it's<00:01:54.350> more<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.820> little

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
I think it's more that it's a little

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.820 
I think it's more that it's a little
confusion<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.900> we're<00:01:57.020> saying<00:01:57.200> oh<00:01:57.410> you<00:01:57.470> know

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
confusion and we're saying oh you know

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.190 
confusion and we're saying oh you know
if<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.850> know<00:01:58.970> okay<00:01:59.390> if<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.720> get<00:01:59.900> caught

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
if it's you know okay if I get caught

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.310 
if it's you know okay if I get caught
probably<00:02:01.160> they're<00:02:01.310> thinking<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.970> know<00:02:02.320> I'll

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
probably they're thinking you know I'll

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.680 
probably they're thinking you know I'll
tell<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.680> cop<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.070> didn't<00:02:04.310> know<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:05.270> something

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
tell the cop I didn't know or something

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.150 
tell the cop I didn't know or something
that's<00:02:05.870> what<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.050> think<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.590> most<00:02:06.770> people

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
that's what I think that most people

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.889 
that's what I think that most people
feel<00:02:07.400> about<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:08.000> there<00:02:08.240> were<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> rough<00:02:08.630> New

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.750 

some<00:02:36.500> drives<00:02:36.740> off<00:02:36.920> sometimes<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.610> don't
