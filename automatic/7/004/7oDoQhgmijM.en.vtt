here and then we've got two white board
sets<00:01:45.470> down<00:01:45.650> here<00:01:45.920> now<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.220> doesn't<00:01:46.400> mean

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
sets down here now that doesn't mean

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.270 
sets down here now that doesn't mean
that<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:46.850> can't<00:01:46.880> edit<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.720> other<00:01:48.380> slides<00:01:48.980> to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
that we can't edit the other slides to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.740 
that we can't edit the other slides to
be<00:01:49.430> able<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.700> get<00:01:49.850> them<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.120> look<00:01:50.330> white<00:01:50.510> board

be able to get them to look white board

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.240 
be able to get them to look white board
which<00:01:50.870> we<00:01:51.020> can<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.560> we<00:01:51.620> can<00:01:51.650> just<00:01:51.890> change<00:01:52.040> the

which we can and we can just change the
background<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:53.150> white<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.540> utilize<00:01:54.410> the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
background of white and utilize the

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.650 
background of white and utilize the
features<00:01:54.980> in<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:55.670> that's<00:01:56.390> one<00:01:56.570> of

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660

white so I can have a whiteboard effect

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.170 
white so I can have a whiteboard effect
going<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.050> here<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:12.680> does<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.970> really

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
going on here and so does this really

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.390 
going on here and so does this really
expands<00:03:14.750> your<00:03:14.810> ability<00:03:15.170> very<00:03:15.470> simple<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.130> can

expands your ability very simple you can

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.920 
expands your ability very simple you can
utilize<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:17.030> effects<00:03:17.360> or<00:03:17.510> if<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.690> don't<00:03:17.810> want

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
utilize the effects or if you don't want

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.509 
utilize the effects or if you don't want
to<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> fade<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:18.830> out<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.340> look

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
to have a fade in and out you just look

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.699 
to have a fade in and out you just look
for<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> slide<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:19.940> doesn't<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.870> now

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
for a slide that doesn't have that now

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.470 
for a slide that doesn't have that now
you'll<00:03:21.860> find<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.250> sometimes<00:03:22.730> some<00:03:23.209> slides

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
you'll find that sometimes some slides

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.500 
you'll find that sometimes some slides
you<00:03:24.140> might<00:03:24.350> not<00:03:24.890> have<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.340> resize<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.390> fit

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
you might not have to resize it to fit

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.410 
you might not have to resize it to fit
that<00:03:26.870> sometimes<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.470> have<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> box<00:03:27.920> in<00:03:28.580> area<00:03:29.180> and

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
that sometimes I have a box in area and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.199 
that sometimes I have a box in area and
so<00:03:30.290> forth<00:03:30.590> now<00:03:30.739> in<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.280> particular<00:03:31.519> slide

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
so forth now in this particular slide

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.930 
so forth now in this particular slide
what<00:03:32.780> i<00:03:32.810> could<00:03:32.930> do<00:03:33.380> also<00:03:33.680> i'm<00:03:34.489> actually<00:03:34.760> i'm

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
what i could do also i'm actually i'm

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.250 
what i could do also i'm actually i'm
going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.120> let<00:03:35.390> me<00:03:35.600> get<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> different<00:03:35.930> slide

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
going to let me get a different slide

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.310 
going to let me get a different slide
because<00:03:37.060> let's<00:03:38.060> find<00:03:38.360> one<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.810> doesn't<00:03:39.080> have

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
because let's find one that doesn't have

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.680 
because let's find one that doesn't have
the<00:03:40.070> ability<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.730> have<00:03:40.760> an<00:03:41.000> image<00:03:41.269> that's<00:03:41.299> got

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
the ability to have an image that's got

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.920 
the ability to have an image that's got
one<00:03:41.739> let's<00:03:42.739> come<00:03:42.980> down<00:03:43.010> here<00:03:43.580> this<00:03:44.209> is<00:03:44.420> like<00:03:44.840> we

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
one let's come down here this is like we

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.400 
one let's come down here this is like we
just<00:03:45.080> did<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.410> one<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:47.540> has<00:03:47.750> an<00:03:47.900> image<00:03:48.049> area

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
just did that one it has an image area

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.990 
just did that one it has an image area
so<00:03:48.709> what<00:03:48.860> we're<00:03:49.010> not<00:03:49.160> its<00:03:49.489> kind<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.820> sometimes

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
so what we're not its kind of sometimes

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.360 
so what we're not its kind of sometimes
it's<00:03:50.450> very<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:51.140> lot<00:03:51.709> of<00:03:51.830> them<00:03:52.150> have<00:03:54.040> no<00:03:55.040> image

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
it's very a lot of them have no image

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.910 
it's very a lot of them have no image
and<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.510> sometimes<00:03:57.110> it's<00:03:57.380> hard<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.560> find<00:03:57.799> it

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
and so sometimes it's hard to find it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.259 
and so sometimes it's hard to find it
looks<00:03:58.160> like<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:58.400> one<00:03:58.580> does<00:03:58.790> have<00:03:58.820> an<00:03:59.120> image

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
looks like this one does have an image

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.900 
looks like this one does have an image
area<00:03:59.570> but<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.590> know<00:04:00.739> what<00:04:00.890> let's<00:04:01.040> just<00:04:01.100> leave

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
area but you know what let's just leave

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.310 
area but you know what let's just leave
it<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.120> way<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.269> is<00:04:02.420> what<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.870> wanted<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.230> show

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
it the way it is what I wanted to show

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.340 
it the way it is what I wanted to show
you<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.860> is<00:04:04.100> that<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.880> also<00:04:05.090> drop<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:06.140> a

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
you is is that I can also drop in a

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.979 
you is is that I can also drop in a
static<00:04:07.130> image<00:04:07.220> for<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.730> background<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.269> so<00:04:08.959> I

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
static image for the background and so I

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.080 
static image for the background and so I
want<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.230> take<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.830> st.<00:04:10.130> same<00:04:10.430> image<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.970> I'm

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
want to take the st. same image and I'm

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.240 
want to take the st. same image and I'm
going<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.269> pop<00:04:11.480> it<00:04:11.660> in<00:04:11.750> as<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.959> background<00:04:12.250> you

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
going to pop it in as a background you

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.890 
going to pop it in as a background you
can<00:04:13.340> see<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.519> it<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.180> know<00:04:14.209> it<00:04:14.329> kind<00:04:14.840> of

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
can see that it and you know it kind of

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.479 
can see that it and you know it kind of
is<00:04:15.110> too<00:04:15.350> big<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.799> everything<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.160> might<00:04:16.340> have

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
is too big and everything I might have

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.520 
is too big and everything I might have
to<00:04:16.609> adjust<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:17.030> size<00:04:17.329> it's<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.260> think<00:04:18.320> it's

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
to adjust the size it's I think it's

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.789 
to adjust the size it's I think it's
expanding<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.310> fill<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:20.000> whole<00:04:20.180> area<00:04:20.799> and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
expanding it to fill the whole area and

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.400 
expanding it to fill the whole area and
so<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.250> would<00:04:22.789> want<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.570> know<00:04:23.690> add<00:04:23.930> some

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
so I would want to you know add some

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.510 
so I would want to you know add some
space<00:04:25.250> around<00:04:25.610> it

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
space around it

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520 
space around it
and<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:27.960> wouldn't<00:04:28.110> crop

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and so that it so that it wouldn't crop

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.110 
and so that it so that it wouldn't crop
off<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.919> edges<00:04:29.099> and<00:04:29.400> stuff<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.729> that<00:04:29.789> but

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
off the edges and stuff like that but

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.379 
off the edges and stuff like that but
you<00:04:30.690> can<00:04:30.960> add<00:04:31.259> a<00:04:31.560> static<00:04:31.830> image<00:04:32.129> in<00:04:32.520> as<00:04:33.150> the

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
you can add a static image in as the

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.640 
you can add a static image in as the
background<00:04:33.569> and<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.080> course<00:04:34.319> you<00:04:34.410> don't<00:04:34.500> have

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
background and of course you don't have

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.950 
background and of course you don't have
to<00:04:34.770> use<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.889> PNG<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.520> can<00:04:35.669> use<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:35.879> JPEG<00:04:36.360> it

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
to use a PNG you can use a JPEG it

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.029 
to use a PNG you can use a JPEG it
doesn't<00:04:37.289> have<00:04:37.379> to<00:04:37.440> have<00:04:37.680> transparency

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
doesn't have to have transparency

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.279 
doesn't have to have transparency
showing<00:04:38.729> through<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:39.000> background<00:04:39.419> you<00:04:39.629> can

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
showing through the background you can

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.619 
showing through the background you can
certainly<00:04:40.789> change<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:42.030> as<00:04:42.150> well<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.569> can

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
certainly change that as well you can

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.300 
certainly change that as well you can
see<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.169> once<00:04:43.409> again<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.740> can<00:04:43.919> come<00:04:44.069> in<00:04:44.099> here

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
see that once again I can come in here

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.409 
see that once again I can come in here
and<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.520> can<00:04:44.639> change<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.970> background<00:04:45.120> color

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
and that can change the background color

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.779 
and that can change the background color
to<00:04:45.629> whatever<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.020> want<00:04:46.349> and<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.639> is<00:04:47.759> a

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
to whatever I want and so that is a

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.779 
to whatever I want and so that is a
super<00:04:48.000> easy<00:04:48.150> way<00:04:48.539> to<00:04:49.319> use<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.650> art<00:04:49.830> from

just just a quick look ahead we're going

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.760 
just just a quick look ahead we're going
to<00:05:03.060> take<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.240> look<00:05:03.479> at<00:05:03.690> using<00:05:03.960> for<00:05:04.319> instance<00:05:04.680> the

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
to take a look at using for instance the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.010 
to take a look at using for instance the
video<00:05:05.340> slides<00:05:05.880> I'm<00:05:06.509> not<00:05:06.659> sure<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.810> lot<00:05:06.960> of

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
video slides I'm not sure a lot of

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.839 
video slides I'm not sure a lot of
people<00:05:07.110> have<00:05:07.380> shown<00:05:08.190> this<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.400> people<00:05:08.759> they

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
people have shown this to people they

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.700 
people have shown this to people they
didn't<00:05:09.030> even<00:05:09.120> know<00:05:09.300> they<00:05:09.419> were<00:05:09.449> there<00:05:09.620> let<00:05:10.620> me

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
didn't even know they were there let me

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.200 
didn't even know they were there let me
go<00:05:10.860> ahead<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.039> add<00:05:11.250> that<00:05:11.520> slide<00:05:11.819> and<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.060> can

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
go ahead and add that slide and you can

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.700 
go ahead and add that slide and you can
see<00:05:12.389> that<00:05:12.419> it<00:05:12.960> does<00:05:13.169> give<00:05:13.440> us<00:05:13.560> some

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
see that it does give us some

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.890 
see that it does give us some
specifications<00:05:14.490> we<00:05:14.669> need<00:05:14.819> to<00:05:14.909> have<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:15.720> at

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
specifications we need to have it at

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.700 
specifications we need to have it at
1280<00:05:16.349> by<00:05:16.620> 720<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.610> at<00:05:18.599> that<00:05:18.659> resolution<00:05:19.289> and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
1280 by 720 and at that resolution and

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.370 
1280 by 720 and at that resolution and
so<00:05:19.860> forth<00:05:20.130> and<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:20.370> we'll<00:05:20.669> take<00:05:20.789> a<00:05:20.849> look<00:05:21.090> at

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
so forth and so we'll take a look at

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.550 
so forth and so we'll take a look at
using<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:23.060> like<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.180> MOV<00:05:24.900> files<00:05:25.139> for<00:05:25.469> the

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
using the like the MOV files for the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.249 
using the like the MOV files for the
sick<00:05:25.740> man<00:05:25.770> or<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:27.060> other<00:05:27.360> stuff<00:05:27.659> you're<00:05:28.080> using

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
sick man or and other stuff you're using

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.399 
sick man or and other stuff you're using
this<00:05:28.500> feature<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.099> and<00:05:29.639> also<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.900> can<00:05:31.169> this

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
this feature and and also you can this

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.890 
this feature and and also you can this
this<00:05:31.650> is<00:05:31.860> almost<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.639> same<00:05:32.669> as<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.479> technique

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
this is almost the same as the technique

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.159 
this is almost the same as the technique
that<00:05:34.110> we<00:05:34.319> cover<00:05:35.190> that<00:05:36.060> we've<00:05:36.599> already<00:05:36.780> got<00:05:37.050> on

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
that we cover that we've already got on

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.050 
that we cover that we've already got on
the<00:05:37.289> site<00:05:37.500> on<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.800> in<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.310> level<00:05:38.610> one<00:05:38.759> area

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
the site on the in the level one area

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.570 
the site on the in the level one area
about<00:05:39.360> using<00:05:39.780> flash<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.770> use<00:05:40.889> the<00:05:41.009> backgrounds

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
about using flash to use the backgrounds

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.249 
about using flash to use the backgrounds
because<00:05:41.789> basically<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.719> turn<00:05:42.930> off<00:05:43.050> all<00:05:43.229> the

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
because basically you turn off all the

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.050 
because basically you turn off all the
stuff<00:05:43.529> and<00:05:43.740> you<00:05:43.800> have<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.370> background<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.969> it

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
stuff and you have a background and it

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.939 
stuff and you have a background and it
can<00:05:45.150> have<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.330> video<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:46.349> advantage<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.800> using

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
can have a video the advantage of using

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.070 
can have a video the advantage of using
flashes<00:05:47.580> its<00:05:47.729> vector<00:05:48.210> its<00:05:48.719> resolution

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
flashes its vector its resolution

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.100 
flashes its vector its resolution
independent<00:05:49.469> and<00:05:49.979> so<00:05:50.639> it's<00:05:51.180> it's<00:05:51.779> a<00:05:51.900> little

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
independent and so it's it's a little

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.450 
independent and so it's it's a little
bit<00:05:52.229> easier<00:05:52.380> a<00:05:52.590> little<00:05:52.770> bit<00:05:52.979> you<00:05:53.159> may<00:05:53.250> have<00:05:53.279> to

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
bit easier a little bit you may have to

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.059 
bit easier a little bit you may have to
worry<00:05:53.789> quite<00:05:54.090> as<00:05:54.210> much<00:05:54.389> about<00:05:54.919> resolution<00:05:55.919> and

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
worry quite as much about resolution and

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.040 
worry quite as much about resolution and
sizing<00:05:56.490> that<00:05:56.699> kind<00:05:56.909> of<00:05:56.940> stuff<00:05:57.210> but<00:05:57.870> if<00:05:57.990> you

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
sizing that kind of stuff but if you

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.499 
sizing that kind of stuff but if you
don't<00:05:58.229> have<00:05:58.349> flash<00:05:58.500> then<00:05:59.069> you<00:05:59.699> know<00:05:59.819> the<00:06:00.240> video

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
don't have flash then you know the video

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.209 
don't have flash then you know the video
programs<00:06:01.110> that<00:06:01.469> are<00:06:01.590> out<00:06:01.620> there<00:06:01.740> you<00:06:01.919> brought

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
programs that are out there you brought

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.529 
programs that are out there you brought
you<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.400> lot<00:06:02.520> of<00:06:02.550> people<00:06:02.699> have<00:06:02.849> camped<00:06:03.150> Asian

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
you a lot of people have camped Asian

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.300 
you a lot of people have camped Asian
ScreenFlow<00:06:04.409> and<00:06:04.830> all<00:06:04.889> that<00:06:05.039> kind<00:06:05.219> of<00:06:05.250> stuff

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
ScreenFlow and all that kind of stuff

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.219 
ScreenFlow and all that kind of stuff
and<00:06:05.669> so<00:06:06.090> we'll<00:06:06.389> be<00:06:06.479> looking<00:06:06.599> at<00:06:06.840> how<00:06:06.960> to<00:06:07.020> use

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
and so we'll be looking at how to use

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.769 
and so we'll be looking at how to use
this<00:06:07.469> but<00:06:07.800> just<00:06:07.979> kind<00:06:08.250> of<00:06:08.279> look<00:06:08.520> ahead<00:06:08.789> and<00:06:09.000> you

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
this but just kind of look ahead and you

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.390 
this but just kind of look ahead and you
can<00:06:09.810> start<00:06:10.080> playing<00:06:10.349> with<00:06:10.469> it<00:06:10.529> and<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:11.279> we're

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
can start playing with it and but we're

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.589 
can start playing with it and but we're
going<00:06:11.550> to<00:06:11.639> show<00:06:11.819> you<00:06:11.880> some<00:06:12.090> techniques<00:06:12.240> on

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
going to show you some techniques on

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.629 
going to show you some techniques on
using<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:12.960> stuff<00:06:13.169> that<00:06:13.770> is<00:06:14.009> inside<00:06:14.400> of

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
using the stuff that is inside of

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.219 
using the stuff that is inside of
hand-drawn<00:06:15.210> whiteboard<00:06:15.900> mega<00:06:16.110> bundle<00:06:16.259> thanks
