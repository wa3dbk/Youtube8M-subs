so<00:00:01.050> something<00:00:02.010> different<00:00:02.460> again<00:00:02.850> from<00:00:02.909> what<00:00:03.330> I

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so something different again from what I

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.220 
so something different again from what I
normally<00:00:03.449> do

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
normally do

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.419 
normally do
um<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.580> my<00:00:05.609> Kenan<00:00:06.330> 450d<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.379> at<00:00:07.980> first<00:00:08.189> I

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
um this is my Kenan 450d and at first I

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.280 
um this is my Kenan 450d and at first I
was<00:00:08.460> actually<00:00:08.970> gonna<00:00:09.120> talk<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:10.019> actual

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
was actually gonna talk about the actual

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.280 
was actually gonna talk about the actual
camera<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:11.460> then<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.639> realized<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.110> my

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
camera but then I realized this is my

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.740 
camera but then I realized this is my
first<00:00:13.559> SLR<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.820> nothing<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.420> compare

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
first SLR and I have nothing to compare

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.650 
first SLR and I have nothing to compare
it<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.830> really<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.400> review<00:00:17.850> would<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.029> kind

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it to so really the review would be kind

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
bucks to get yeah I should probably say

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.400 
bucks to get yeah I should probably say
mmm<00:00:37.290> everything<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.980> say<00:00:38.190> about<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.579> lens<00:00:39.410> if

mmm everything I say about this lens if

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.160 
mmm everything I say about this lens if
you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.950> anything<00:00:41.370> about<00:00:41.790> SLR<00:00:42.570> photography

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
you know anything about SLR photography

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.590 
you know anything about SLR photography
or<00:00:43.770> lenses<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.180> gonna<00:00:45.390> be

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
or lenses a lot of what I'm gonna be

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.440 
or lenses a lot of what I'm gonna be
saying<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.200> gonna<00:00:46.440> sound<00:00:46.739> pretty<00:00:47.180> low<00:00:48.180> brow

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
saying it's gonna sound pretty low brow

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.139 
saying it's gonna sound pretty low brow
and<00:00:48.840> non-technical<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.850> probably

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and non-technical so you can probably

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.569 
and non-technical so you can probably
save<00:00:51.480> yourself<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> energy<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.649> maybe<00:00:53.160> not

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
save yourself the energy and maybe not

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.500 
save yourself the energy and maybe not
watch<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.500> um<00:00:55.610> having<00:00:56.610> said<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
watch this um having said that this is a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
watch this um having said that this is a
really<00:00:57.930> good<00:00:58.079> learning<00:00:58.350> lens<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.010> mean<00:00:59.579> because

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
really good learning lens I mean because

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
really good learning lens I mean because
once<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.359> said<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> parameters<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
once you said all the parameters that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.000 
once you said all the parameters that
you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.910> ISO<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.860> shutter<00:01:04.860> speed

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you can like the ISO the shutter speed

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.520 
you can like the ISO the shutter speed
and<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> aperture<00:01:06.270> size<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.229> need<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and the aperture size all you need to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
and the aperture size all you need to
worry<00:01:07.560> about<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.310> focus<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.659> lens<00:01:09.840> will

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
worry about is focus and this lens will

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.370 
worry about is focus and this lens will
give<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.650> good<00:01:11.479> control<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> depth

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
give you a really good control of depth

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.219 
give you a really good control of depth
of<00:01:13.530> field<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.670> mean<00:01:14.880> I've<00:01:15.270> been<00:01:15.330> mucking

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
of field so I mean I've been mucking

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.710 
of field so I mean I've been mucking
around<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.740> lens<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.220> I'm<00:01:17.369> actually

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
around with this lens and I'm actually

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
around with this lens and I'm actually
pretty<00:01:18.720> sure<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.950> could<00:01:20.130> probably<00:01:20.280> make

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
pretty sure that you could probably make

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.679 
pretty sure that you could probably make
it<00:01:20.700> turn<00:01:21.060> look<00:01:21.689> artistic<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.650> lens

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
it turn look artistic with this lens

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.240 
it turn look artistic with this lens
yeah<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> reason<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.830> bought<00:01:26.009> these

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
yeah but the reason I bought these

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
yeah but the reason I bought these
things<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.509> lot<00:01:27.720> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
things is because I do a lot of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.230 
things is because I do a lot of
photography<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.829> low<00:01:29.070> light

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
photography in really low light

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
photography in really low light
conditions<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.600> all<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
conditions and all of that is that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
conditions and all of that is that
concerts<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.420> mean<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
concerts so I mean if with this if you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.310 
concerts so I mean if with this if you
open<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> aperture<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:36.000> wide<00:01:36.600> open<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> F

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
open the aperture like wide open to F

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.789 
open the aperture like wide open to F
1.8<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.659> get<00:01:39.810> away<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.259> shutter<00:01:40.470> speeds

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
1.8 I can get away with shutter speeds

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
1.8 I can get away with shutter speeds
of<00:01:40.979> 1/100<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.030> second<00:01:42.450> which<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> basically

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
of 1/100 of a second which is basically

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
of 1/100 of a second which is basically
unheard<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.579> used<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> shoot<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
unheard of when I used to shoot with the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
unheard of when I used to shoot with the
point-and-shoot<00:01:46.409> that's<00:01:46.680> actually<00:01:47.040> filming

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
point-and-shoot that's actually filming

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.719 
point-and-shoot that's actually filming
this<00:01:47.549> um<00:01:48.320> with<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.890> you'd<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.220> lucky<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
this um with that one you'd be lucky to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.390 
this um with that one you'd be lucky to
get<00:01:50.880> away

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
get away

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.940 
get away
shutter<00:01:51.790> speeds<00:01:52.120> of<00:01:52.300> one<00:01:52.720> one<00:01:53.230> twentieth<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.830> a

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
shutter speeds of one one twentieth of a

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.490 
shutter speeds of one one twentieth of a
second<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:54.700> like<00:01:55.540> even<00:01:55.900> then<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.200> image

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
second and like even then the image

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.920 
second and like even then the image
might<00:01:56.710> not<00:01:56.890> be<00:01:57.040> properly<00:01:57.370> exposed<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:58.690> this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
might not be properly exposed so this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.380 
might not be properly exposed so this
one<00:01:59.110> with<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.800> aperture<00:02:00.220> wide<00:02:00.490> open<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.210> can

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
one with the aperture wide open you can

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.200 
one with the aperture wide open you can
still<00:02:01.900> get<00:02:02.170> used<00:02:02.500> really<00:02:02.680> sharp<00:02:03.100> fast<00:02:03.850> shutter

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
still get used really sharp fast shutter

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.460 
still get used really sharp fast shutter
speeds<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:04.780> still<00:02:05.050> get<00:02:05.260> really<00:02:05.530> clear<00:02:05.890> images

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
speeds and still get really clear images

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.160 
speeds and still get really clear images
the<00:02:08.470> autofocus<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.460> dim<00:02:09.820> conditions<00:02:10.300> like<00:02:11.050> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the autofocus in dim conditions like I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.480 
the autofocus in dim conditions like I
said<00:02:11.350> before<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.620> have<00:02:11.770> nothing<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.130> compare

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
said before I have nothing to compare

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.380 
said before I have nothing to compare
this<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.830> feels<00:02:15.040> really<00:02:15.250> fast<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:16.270> me

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
this to but it feels really fast to me

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.270 
this to but it feels really fast to me
and<00:02:17.380> for<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> most<00:02:17.800> part<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.220> pretty

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
and for the most part it's pretty

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.840 
and for the most part it's pretty
accurate<00:02:18.670> as<00:02:19.120> well<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:21.100> if<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.280> want<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.520> hear

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
accurate as well so if you want to hear

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.820 
accurate as well so if you want to hear
how<00:02:22.570> fast<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:24.340> does<00:02:24.520> its<00:02:24.730> thing<00:02:28.800> yep

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
how fast it is and it does its thing yep

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.630 
how fast it is and it does its thing yep
so<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.190> pretty<00:02:30.340> fast<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.770> do<00:02:33.040> Oh<00:02:33.100> another

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
so it's pretty fast to do Oh another

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.270 
so it's pretty fast to do Oh another
thing<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.570> lens<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.930> specified<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.830> 50

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
thing the lens is specified as a 50

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.100 
thing the lens is specified as a 50
millimeter<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:36.970> when<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.240> put<00:02:37.420> out<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> 450

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
millimeter but when you put out on a 450

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.590 
millimeter but when you put out on a 450
day<00:02:38.440> body<00:02:38.709> it's<00:02:39.580> equivalent<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.240> actually

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
day body it's equivalent it's actually

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.720 
day body it's equivalent it's actually
80<00:02:40.840> millimetres<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:42.190> need<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.490> stand

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
80 millimetres so you need to stand

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.390 
80 millimetres so you need to stand
about<00:02:43.110> two<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.410> two<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.709> half<00:02:44.830> meters<00:02:45.220> away

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
about two to two and a half meters away

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.760 
about two to two and a half meters away
from<00:02:45.550> someone<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.360> get<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.780> full<00:02:47.080> body<00:02:47.260> shot<00:02:47.350> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
from someone to get a full body shot and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.310 
from someone to get a full body shot and
about<00:02:48.550> half<00:02:48.820> meter<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.300> meet<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.900> do<00:02:50.050> like<00:02:50.290> a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
about half meter to meet it to do like a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.580 
about half meter to meet it to do like a
portrait<00:02:50.800> shot<00:02:51.270> um<00:02:52.270> as<00:02:52.720> far<00:02:52.930> as<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.320> see<00:02:53.470> if

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
portrait shot um as far as I can see if

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.979 
portrait shot um as far as I can see if
this<00:02:53.709> lens<00:02:54.280> has<00:02:54.550> like<00:02:54.790> two<00:02:55.150> downsides<00:02:55.720> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
this lens has like two downsides and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.350 
this lens has like two downsides and
then<00:02:56.110> not<00:02:56.440> even<00:02:56.950> really<00:02:57.459> downsides<00:02:57.940> anyway

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
then not even really downsides anyway

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.320 
then not even really downsides anyway
the<00:02:59.110> first<00:02:59.380> one<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.830> them<00:03:00.190> when<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.880> aperture

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the first one is them when the aperture

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.410 
the first one is them when the aperture
is<00:03:01.390> opened<00:03:01.840> all<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:01.989> way<00:03:02.170> up<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.790> focus<00:03:04.209> is

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
is opened all the way up the focus is

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.600 
is opened all the way up the focus is
really<00:03:04.450> sincere<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.830> difference<00:03:06.280> between

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
really sincere so the difference between

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.400 
really sincere so the difference between
something<00:03:06.880> that's<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.420> focus<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:08.050> something

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
something that's in focus and something

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.460 
something that's in focus and something
that's<00:03:08.590> not<00:03:08.800> in<00:03:09.190> focus<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.730> really<00:03:10.030> small<00:03:10.470> what

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
that's not in focus is really small what

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.050 
that's not in focus is really small what
I<00:03:11.500> mean<00:03:11.739> by<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.220> sometimes<00:03:12.670> when<00:03:12.940> I'm

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
I mean by that is sometimes when I'm

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.540 
I mean by that is sometimes when I'm
trying<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.390> take<00:03:13.540> photos<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.230> someone<00:03:15.190> singing

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
trying to take photos of someone singing

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.300 
trying to take photos of someone singing
like<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.239> am<00:03:16.630> intending<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.440> focus<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.130> their

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
like I am intending to focus on their

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.750 
like I am intending to focus on their
eye<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:18.820> then<00:03:19.540> maybe<00:03:20.170> when<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.830> hope<00:03:21.489> have<00:03:21.730> a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
eye but then maybe when I hope have a

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.949 
eye but then maybe when I hope have a
look<00:03:21.970> at<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.150> photo<00:03:22.360> later<00:03:22.600> I<00:03:22.750> actually

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
look at the photo later I actually

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.530 
look at the photo later I actually
focused<00:03:23.500> on<00:03:23.590> their<00:03:23.769> nose<00:03:23.950> or<00:03:24.130> something<00:03:24.540> with

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
focused on their nose or something with

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.350 
focused on their nose or something with
practice<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.290> public<00:03:26.620> area<00:03:26.800> of<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
practice in a public area of that the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.690 
practice in a public area of that the
second<00:03:28.750> thing<00:03:28.959> like<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:30.400> know<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.610> probably

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
second thing like you know it probably

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.270 
second thing like you know it probably
isn't<00:03:31.060> even<00:03:31.510> an<00:03:31.930> issue<00:03:32.080> if<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.650> can<00:03:32.830> afford<00:03:33.130> to

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
isn't even an issue if you can afford to

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.170 
isn't even an issue if you can afford to
be<00:03:33.430> flexible<00:03:33.910> between<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.420> distance

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
be flexible between the distance

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.780 
be flexible between the distance
you<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.629> your<00:03:35.750> subject<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.920> time<00:03:37.250> I've<00:03:37.609> been

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
you and your subject but time I've been

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.509 
you and your subject but time I've been
to<00:03:37.969> concerts<00:03:38.209> but<00:03:38.689> basically<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
to concerts but basically like the

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.270 
to concerts but basically like the
crowds<00:03:40.790> really<00:03:41.299> dense<00:03:41.689> and<00:03:42.159> basically<00:03:43.159> they

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
crowds really dense and basically they

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.759 
crowds really dense and basically they
will<00:03:43.430> get<00:03:43.579> shitty<00:03:43.969> with<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.390> if<00:03:44.629> you<00:03:44.780> try<00:03:44.989> keep

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
will get shitty with you if you try keep

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.050 
will get shitty with you if you try keep
on<00:03:45.950> shifting<00:03:46.159> in<00:03:46.430> front<00:03:46.609> of<00:03:46.670> them<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.879> take

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
on shifting in front of them to take

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.569 
on shifting in front of them to take
photos<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:48.260> as<00:03:48.469> a<00:03:48.500> result<00:03:48.709> without<00:03:49.099> zoom

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
photos so as a result without zoom

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.490 
photos so as a result without zoom
control<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:50.480> end<00:03:50.659> up<00:03:50.780> with<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.989> whole<00:03:51.109> bunch<00:03:51.349> of

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
control you end up with a whole bunch of

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.410 
control you end up with a whole bunch of
protists<00:03:51.859> that<00:03:51.889> look<00:03:52.280> composed<00:03:52.849> exactly<00:03:53.269> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
protists that look composed exactly the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.500 
protists that look composed exactly the
same<00:03:53.629> um<00:03:54.700> what<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.730> mean<00:03:55.909> I<00:03:55.939> guess<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.269> can<00:03:56.389> get

to<00:04:13.879> 55<00:04:14.510> millimeter<00:04:15.200> kit<00:04:15.470> lens<00:04:15.709> that<00:04:15.919> comes

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
to 55 millimeter kit lens that comes

to 55 millimeter kit lens that comes
with<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.519> because<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.419> pretty<00:04:17.810> rarely<00:04:18.500> will

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
with it because I pretty rarely will

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.990 
with it because I pretty rarely will
actually<00:04:19.039> I've<00:04:19.160> never<00:04:19.190> taken<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.849> to<00:04:19.970> a

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
concert with me but I guess it depends

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.600 
concert with me but I guess it depends
on<00:04:23.060> what<00:04:23.210> you're<00:04:23.360> gonna<00:04:23.509> be<00:04:23.720> shooting<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.370> I'm

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
on what you're gonna be shooting so I'm

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.010 
on what you're gonna be shooting so I'm
obviously<00:04:25.820> that's<00:04:26.300> not<00:04:26.389> gonna<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.990> same

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
obviously that's not gonna be the same

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.680 
obviously that's not gonna be the same
for<00:04:27.440> everyone
