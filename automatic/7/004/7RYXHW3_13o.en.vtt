 constantly in the water 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.829

 catch turtle found depth that it has better 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.700
 The fact that we learn is impressive in terms of the best

 meters but to ensure the new 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.010

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.230
 because the water conditions are active 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.620
 the visibility is great did not have 20 surplus water temperature
