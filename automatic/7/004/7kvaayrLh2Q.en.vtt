00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.250
 i 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.100
 and here you have to tell us what is your 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.500
 hobby because you always have to do 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.959
 to pray to me I really like the bike 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.180
 mountain and I like to climb and look today 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.340
 let's see use tires we're going to 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 make a bucket to make an organizer 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 and so we take care of the planet and take care of the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.609
 we can use it for 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.079
 put magazines also I can think 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.880
 which can be used for the fourth of 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.460
 the teenagers where we can put 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.079
 maybe the shirts are not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.760
 t-shirts that they use for also for 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.680
 hobbies of skateboarding are also 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.570
 you can use and it's very simple to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.160
 do not even nobel rims of their 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.199
 cars are still today I behaved very 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.539
 well and I will use a tire to the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.250
 which already has the strings coming out or 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.500
 that the tire is not always used 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 that no longer has a drawing and how good it is 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 risk that we use a damaged tire 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.649
 and instead of throwing it you probably 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.629
 can make you have a waste 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.519
 inappropriate because many people burn them 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.190
 and of course we are going to contaminate the 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.929
 atmosphere I decided to do this pop and what 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.480
 what we are going to do nothing else is to use 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.550
 a little aerosol spray for 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.160
 paint it give it several layers and good 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.900
 give the tones that are left to use and 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.590
 since we do not have painted we are going to 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.380
 use a little wood 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.170
 to make a base and also to make 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.479
 The stage of our push can use 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.939
 5 mm wood precisely for 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.799
 that endurance is a good wood that the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.509
 will use well basic we will be able to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.549
 move our public to be able to change it 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.310
 of the place and we will also be able to have 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.990
 a good support above the wood has 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.359
 to be a little larger in diameter 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.420
 of our tire to hold and what 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.640
 what I did was paint two parts 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.149
 bright red good I painted a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.970
 part black and a red part already what 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.489
 is going to be the base I did some 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.860
 perforations because the base is going to 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.719
 hold though the wood will be 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.280
 inside the tire and it's not going to come out 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.750
 we will also hold it so that it does not 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.509
 there is no problem of running 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.979
 because that if the base is not totally 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.929
 of the diameter of the rim because if not 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.269
 we could not fit it and what there is 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.060
 do here is press and put the 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.950
 club tire that's here to help me 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.750
 that we work as a team because here you 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.750
 I need complicated price 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:36.319
 and with great pleasure 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.269
 nothing else is needed here to place this I go 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.250
 to use wooden chilillos to 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.959
 able to hold the base of the rim 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.209
 because the chilillo has a point 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.730
 then it's going to be very easy 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.540
 to cross the rubber and to be able to fix the table 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.250
 of wood in the following way we 're going 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.410
 to put in our drilling there is 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.540
 placed the chili and what we're going to 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.110
 to do nothing else is to hold it 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.110
 and ready 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.810
 here we press a little bit hard and the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.390
 we are placing then we place the 4 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.060
 chilillos in each of the part 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.160
 of the base and the only thing for our cover 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.560
 what I did was to use here a 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.600
 little bit of fake fur to make a 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.430
 tongue that will serve us to be able 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.400
 lift the lid and we do not have to be 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.230
 pulling to lift it and good the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.810
 fasten also with wood staples 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.130
 but if we do not have a stapler to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.840
 wood we can also use 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.690
 screws of the little ones of the most 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.480
 shorts are fastened put 4 so that 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.770
 hold well and ready we can use 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.489
 our organizer to save 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.489
 anything
